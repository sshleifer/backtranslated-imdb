A very good drama, although there seemed to be several empty areas leaving viewers to complete the action for themselves. I can imagine such a life for a person who can neither read nor write. This film smacks of the real world: a wife who suddenly becomes the only supporter, living relatives and their quarrels, a worried child who is confused, and then, as a rule, leaves school, an ass husband who takes a nest egg and buys beer by him. 2 thumbs up.
