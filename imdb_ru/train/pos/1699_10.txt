This is the jewel of the film, not only for people who like funny and unusual rooms, but also for those who love the history and traditions of science fiction and classic Hollywood films. Every alien from the Martian team is the epitome of a classic fantastic character or a member of the Hollywood royal family, and it is very pleasant to watch them bounce off each other and from the inhabitants of Big Bean.
