Whenever I see most reviews, this is called Eddie Murphy's "flash in the pan." These critics want to take a look at some of the things he does these days, and maybe look at their position in retrospect ... “Golden Child” is not very exciting entertainment, but thanks to some actors it breathes new life into the old cliche and gives Murphy one of their best roles. I do not understand the general lack of "love" for her efforts. Perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment was tired of crazy adventures? Steven Spielberg began this with Indiana Jones; it is not fair to make this a scapegoat, when that which is perhaps his greatest sin is also completely harmless. There is nothing wrong with trying to capitalize on trends. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is stupid, but even a casual observer must understand that “funny” is where the Hollywood idea of ​​mysticism begins and ends. What is more important than the credibility of such a story is that the audience has interesting guides to show them the mysterious sights. Michael Richie and Eddie Murphy do an excellent job with this task. My advice to you is to buy a ticket and ride.
