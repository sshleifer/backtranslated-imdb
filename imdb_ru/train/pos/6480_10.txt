It was the best military documentary ever made. From the very beginning of the first episode, when Sir Lawrence Olivier described the terrible events in Oradour-sur-Glane “The Day When Soldiers Came”. Until the last days of the war, when mushroom clouds appeared over Japan, I never missed a single second of this classic series, and I remember it well, although it was shown back in 1974. Every aspect of this tragedy has been covered in detail. This whole series should be mandatory for watching as many children as possible in the world so that the tragedy of the Second World War is not repeated and that fanaticism, hatred, greed and intolerance do not mix with patriotism or religious zeal.
