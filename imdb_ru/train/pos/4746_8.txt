This film seems to draw a line - on the one hand, those who love it, on the other hand, those who consider it intolerable. <br /> <br /> For starters, there are a lot of comedies in this film that many viewers don’t “get”. Of course, the mask of Jet Li looks like Kato Bruce Lee - he should have, this is a joke. The guy who has a time bomb in his heart is outrageous? of course it's a joke! Some readers will probably ask if this film should be so funny, why all this excessive and bloody violence? Well, first of all, tolerance for this level of violence actually differs from culture to culture; and although Hong Kong viewers admit that this violence is extreme, it is certainly only slightly more than the average for the HK action movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, Black Mask is indeed a film that uses genre conventions and pushes. to the extreme, simply because the conventions themselves are completely unreal. After decades of observing how people were shot without any visible open wounds, many people were horrified that Bonnie and Clyde and the Wild Bunch criminals shed blood everywhere. But the fact is that when you are shot with a fast metal projectile, almost certainly the blood will splash, especially from the artery. <br /> <br /> This film is a film of Chinese comics. It’s true that Spider-Man movies would never get this bloody - but if they were true to reality, they would! Well, despite its origin from the comics, this film is true to reality. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have is flashy, overly stylized shooting and editing. If the creators of this film shot it with an eye to the nostalgia in the Hollywood style (such as “The Rocket Man” or the recent film “Captain Sky”), I doubt that it would seem offensive to someone. <br /> <br /> But be that as it may, I still had a lot of fun watching this movie.
