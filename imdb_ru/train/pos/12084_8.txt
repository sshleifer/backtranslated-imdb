The toothed little bowler, whose 65-minute length does not seem too short, "My name is Julia Ross" returns to the English tradition of things that are not what they seem to be - Hitchcock's "Lady disappears" is one example. Without a job, Julia Ross (Nina Foch) finds a dream job at a new employment agency in London, whose sinister representative seems to want to find out if she has living relatives or a boyfriend. After reporting to the service, she wakes up (being drunk) in a huge pile, similar to Manderley on the coast of Cornwall, allegedly as George Makredy’s crazy wife, who shows anxious interest in knives and pickaxes, His loving, enabling mother is the irresistible Lady Ma Witty (this time the model of fussy efficiency on the other side of good-against-evil than in “Lady disappears”). The nightmarish vision of this story unfolds claustrophobically; we know what is happening, but are powerless to tell poor Julia. This film, oddly enough, is regularly honored with a place of honor as one of the earliest (and very few British) noir films. I think this is closer to the gothic tradition of the old dark house than the American tradition of wet cobbles and urban corruption; nonetheless, it demonstrates a more modern, psychoanalytic mindset. Anyway, it remains a witty thriller.
