Stephen King films are a fun thing for me. I either love them or hate them. I didnâ€™t like some of the more fantastic productions (such as Despair and Storm of the Century). I really liked some of the smaller ones. Lunatics are what I really like, and I watch them regularly. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are lunatics, shape-changing creatures who, although similar to humans, are transformed into feline creatures. They are immune to scratching cats, and whenever they move to a new city, they set traps to catch and kill animals. When they move to their last city, they need to look for a virgin, and when Charles finds her, he actually falls in love with her, but his mother needs to feed her to maintain her strength. The story revolves around what will happen to the girl. Can Charles spare her or use her to save his mother? <br /> <br /> Although there are incest wrappers in this story that some may find unattractive, it does play a role in this story, and therefore not only in the film. for the sake of scandal. Like most of the stories of Stephen King, it is based in a small town with many interesting characters. Acting is not the best, and while it is not special effects, however, somehow it all tends to become a "gel" and is a very watchable and enjoyable adaptation. <br /> <br /> For British readers: this production has most recently been shown on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller / Horror channels.
