This is probably Karisma at its best, except Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar also laid out, not even trying. At times the story is very good, but by the end it seems to be dragging on, especially when Shah Rukh appears in the picture. What really made me love it was leadership actions, the delivery of dialogue, as well as history, for what it was. It could be directed better, and edited. The case of support was even great, including that of Karim's mother-in-law, although she had only one bright moment, it was great to watch her. <br /> <br /> The sets were also pretty good. I didnâ€™t like their image of a Canadian family, but as soon as they enter India, it will be as real as possible. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would love to raise it!
