I read so many comments that I shared too, remembering this film and so much wanting to see it again, but I did not know the name of the movie. Fortunately, thanks to the search and finding the title on this site, I read the comments left here and realized that this is a movie that I remember. Then I searched and found the film, and was so glad to have the opportunity to watch the film 40 years later. Thanks to this site and your comments you helped me, and therefore I want to thank you all. I want to share how I managed to find this film for all of you, who were also looking for a copy. It was on the VHS-version of Wonderful World of Disney "Call it Courage", which contained 2 films, the second of which was "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". It touched me now as much as 40 years ago, and now I have my own copy. I think it is available only on VHS. I found it on ebay, and I saw several copies of it there. Enjoy it, I know what I did! <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful story about the love of a boy and an eagle that he cared about. When it came time to sacrifice an eagle, the boy freed the eagle because he could not allow his killing. After the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after the eagle's release, the eagle also saved the boyâ€™s life and, moreover, taught him to survive. The proximity that the boy and the eagle shared in the wilderness was so touching, and the shots were really wonderful. What a wonderful era it was. I have never seen anything like this movie!
