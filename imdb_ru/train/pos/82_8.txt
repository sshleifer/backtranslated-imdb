Fortunately for us, fans of Real McCoy (most likely all the baby boomers who grew up in the late 50s and 60s), three adult actor / actresses appeared when they performed at the reunion in 2000. Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna both died shortly thereafter. No matter how pleasant it was to see Luke, Sugar Babe and Pepino together again, it was equally mysterious that they did not mention Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman at all? As I understand it, Little Luke passed away in 1999, but I'm not sure how. On the Internet there is no information about Hussey, which I can find. Very curious why they were not even mentioned? Their absence on the Reunion show was so noticeable that I suspect that the family of Michael and Lydia herself (if they are still alive) either 1) asked not to participate in the discussion, and therefore their desire was satisfied, or 2) TNN could not find no trace of either Michael or Lydia (like all of us), they seem to have disappeared. Thus, it would be the safest way to exclude them from the conversation. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, Walter Brennenâ€™s retrospective was wonderfully done. They didn't hide it ... it was the grandfather who made the show so successful. I remember how in childhood I imitated my grandfather's walk and my parents laughed (as I am sure, a million other children then). One annoyance that bothered me a little was Richard Krenna's desire to dominate the discussion ... sometimes interrupting Tony and Kathleen to make a point. In fact, although Tony Martinez seemed quite capable of contributing to the conversation, he was not allowed to speak or speak too much during the Reunion show. Unfortunately, since I wanted to hear from all three, equally. In general, the Reunion Show was a real treat for me. I watched it on DVD several times and enjoyed it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
