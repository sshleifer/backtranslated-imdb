HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of the classic Shemp Shepherd Dog. New culinary scene of the film at the beginning of the film is gorgeous. The puppets are always funny when they cook. However, after the first few minutes of cooking, we moved on to the original frames of “UNLIMITED CARGO”. One thing that I noticed in these remakes from 1953 to 1956 is that they are in line with the new story. They insert if the old storyline does not match. <br /> <br /> Husbands have a new end, but I will not give it to those who want to be surprised. > <br /> **** of 4 stars.
