Or at least one of the best. I think this is a very fun and very cool game for the N64. Bowser responds to his usual machinations (yes, this is a stupid word, but I can think of only one), and Mario must stop him again. This game is very fun to play, and there is a lot of nostalgia for me. The only bad thing about this is the graphics, which are terrible by today's standards, but everything else is pretty good (especially small mini-games that you can unlock). This is the second best N64 game (the first best one is Conker's Bad Fur Day) that I recommend to any Mario fan or platform game lover. It surpasses the mediocre Super Mario Sunshine on any given day. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A
