"Lion King 1 1/2" is the funniest Disney non-theatrical release. I recently saw this film again after not seeing it for many years. I remember seeing him for the first time, I had no expectations and I was pleasantly surprised by this watchable and very fascinating film. <br /> <br /> Is it better than Simba's Pride? In many ways, yes. Although the Simba's Pride was not entirely bad, she suffered from some problems: the lack of a good script and bad characteristics that affected otherwise it would be nice. <br /> <br /> In any case: it is nice to see the Persons of Timon and Pumba again flourish as we (or, of course, I) loved them in this film; in Simba's Pride, they were very annoying, and I didn’t like the series “Timon and Pumba”. <br /> <br /> This film could easily have been stupid, but, fortunately, the filmmakers did not take the wrong turn and instead focused on making this film sometimes extremely funny. There are several jokes that adults can enjoy on their own. The score is pretty good. There are two new songs that are striking and two new characters, Timon's mom, (voiced by recognizable Julie Kavner from Marge Simpsons) and Uncle Max, which are pleasant. The friendship between Timon and Pumba is portrayed touchingly. Emotional scenes are well integrated into a comic story and do not feel out of place, which would be easy to do (especially in comedies). <br /> <br /> But is there anything that distracts this picture from getting 10? votes from me? Yes there is. Although, fortunately, they are not very influential, but I will mention them: 1. Many scenes from the first film are used in this. Personally, it was strange to see old scenes integrated with new ones. <br /> <br /> 2. During a climax, some jokes become lame. <br /> <br /> 3. In the story, this is the story of Timon, and although the filmmakers are trying to integrate his story with the Simba film, at times the script seems a bit hasty. <br /> <br /> But these details do not affect this funny movie, This is the only really acceptable continuation of Disney, which should be in every collection of films.
