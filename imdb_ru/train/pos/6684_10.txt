This is a great movie. I love it more every time I look. Most comedies can be rather inconclusive because you know all the jokes, but mysterious people are so complete in their writing and characterization that they look again - as Ben Stiller tears on the bonnet a limousine decoration, or Hank Azaria says goodbye to Louise Lasser, or Jeffrey Rush shows his the Fuhrer's choreography, or Tom Waits mumbles while he watches a news report, or Jane Garofalo refuses a kiss from Paul Rubens - this is a pleasure. This is the perfect ensemble. The story develops directly and consistently, the sequences of actions are creative and not too dominant, all results pay off towards the end. Seriously, if you saw it, and it was for a while, look at it again, and if you have not done it, then start. You cannot watch it again until you see it for the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, trial scene. Too much good!)
