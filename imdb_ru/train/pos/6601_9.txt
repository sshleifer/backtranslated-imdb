This movie is absolutely awesome. The new Blade Runner is the future noir in its very rigidity. The vision of Paris is magnificent, recognizable and farsighted, with broad perspectives, ugly decorations and futuristic virtual reality. <br /> <br /> The storyline is pretty simple, with a few surprises, but this is not what I like most about the movie. This is a visual pleasure. <br /> <br /> Made in 3D and made in black and white (no gray!) with only one short color spot, it is less dangerous for the eyes than it seems. There are a lot of "skillful" camera shots - close-ups and weird points of view - but this only adds to the temperament of the film. In general, you get the impression of a graphic novel in the form of a video series. <br /> <br /> Initially, I got the impression that the film was rotoscoped, such is the level of animation and high detail of the character's facial expressions. But unlike “A Scanner Darkly” - which suffers (or even increases) from inconsistent determination of character (just see how some hairs change shape!) - the Renaissance is consistent and accurate in everything. When the character is in close-up, you can see additional details and texture, but when they are in the middle of the frame or farther, the details are omitted, but not to the detriment of the character's definition. <br /> <br /> For me, the only drawback of the film is that in one comment we are told that this is a one-time project. Such a shame, as I would like to see more of this futuristic plot line of the film noir, and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style. <br /> <br /> Yes, and English dub is also great. <br /> <br /> Overall a great movie and highly recommended.
