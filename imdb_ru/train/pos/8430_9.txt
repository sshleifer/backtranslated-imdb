It's always nice to see Angela Bassett playing a role in which she can really dive. At times, she is tense, funny, and even sexy in her role as Lena, a “colorful” woman who is forced to build a house on a deserted muddy beach near Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also good at not quite sympathetic as her partner, Boesman. Willy John as a stranger demonstrates subtle nuances, discovering a new place of residence for Besman and Lena. Infrequently, you can see a smart film on mature topics. Although it is based on a play, the late director John Berry (who also shot Claudine) opens the material by shooting the film in a widescreen Cinemascope format. He also keeps things visually interesting through creative blocking of actors and showing us things just mentioned in the play. Like Diann Carroll at Claudine, John Berry could have sent Angela Bassett to an Academy Award nomination. This is definitely a movie to look for.
