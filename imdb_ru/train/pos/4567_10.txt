My left leg is an outstanding epic film telling about the life and times of Christie Brown, who had cerebral palsy, a severe disability and he had only his left leg, but he was disobedient, he managed to become an artist and a writer against all the odds > <br /> I have seen this movie many times, and every time I see it, I find it equally brilliant every time. I wonder how this amazing movie didn't get an Oscar for the best picture? These are the ruins of the Academy Awards. Jim Shirdan for me is one of the greatest directors in the world. The script, the music and everything else in this movie are excellent. In the course of the film, you almost feel like in a brown house when everything happens. Ray McAnally and Brenda Fricker are great as Christie's parents, and Fiona Shaw is as brilliant as Dr. Eileen Cole, who helps Christie in his battle of defiance. br /> <br /> The Irish film industry had a lot in common with her name before my left leg. My left foot was the beginning of a wonderful period in Irish cinema. such powerful and brilliant films as “The Field”, “The Weeping Game”, on behalf of the father, and Michael Collins followed my left foot. These Irish films were highly acclaimed throughout the world and were nominated for several Oscars and won. Period for the Irish film. My left leg is a powerful, outstanding film. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis plays the crippled Christie Brown so well and brilliantly, and the same goes for Hugh, Conner, who plays young Christy. for me, these two performances are two of the best films ever produced, especially the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, which I would rate as highly as Anthony Hopkins in the silence of the lambs. Daniel Day-Lewis in his career proved that he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> This is a great masterpiece in the cinema, look!
