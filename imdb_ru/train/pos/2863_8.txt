Although this show has not been broadcast since 1973, after watching the DVD set, which I borrowed from our library, I had to tell a little about it. <br /> <br /> I remember when it was the only color show on television in the 1960s, and sometimes there was a small "Sunday Night Party" with friends to watch it on NBC on one of the few color TVs. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy the story not so much for names and dates, but how it affects us today and how much can be so deep, based on the most insignificant actions of that time. Case in point: the city of Virginia, Nevada, which became one of the richest cities in the world because of silver, got its name from a character called “Old Virgin” who got out of the sedan during the first days of the city, fell and smashed his bottle of whiskey. <br /> <br /> Old Virginia did not want to miss this incident, as the precious liquid seeped into the mud, and he decided to christen the city "Virginia Town". This area became known as Comstock Lode because another character, Henry Comstock, had a reputation as a person who tried to provoke universal attraction, and this area became known as Comstock Lode. <br /> <br /> I just watched an early episode that I had with these 2 items. Other episodes related to Mark Twain's literary upsurge when he was a reporter for the Territorial Enterprise ... <br /> <br /> This was useful (and often educational) family entertainment. As someone else noted, each episode will truly be considered a film with its own rights — rich in scripts and characters. <br /> <br /> One thing that distorted the truth was proximity to Virginia and Ponderos. To tell the truth, to drive from Ponderosa (all northern Lake Tahoe), you had to drive your horse about 3000 feet (1000 meters) down the top of Spooner to a high desert (3000-4000 feet) in the Carson Valley, and then another. 30-40 miles to the city of Virginia. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the Cartwright will have some sick buttocks doing this on a regular basis. But every writer must have some kind of freedom in truth. <br /> <br /> How I miss this show, even today.
