An excellent film telling about counter-currents in the life of a multinational group of not-so-ordinary people in rural areas of the Pacific Northwest. Solid leadership and writing along with a great game, especially the performances of Quami Taha and Dan Stowe. Interestingly, this film was shot in the same year as the very successful Crash, written and directed by Paul Haggis. The pace of action may not be as rabid as in urban Los Angeles, and the characters may seem better acquainted with each other in the movie “Beyond It,” but the personal relationships of the characters are just as imperfect and concerned, and their stories are as resonant and any of those in "Collapse." For those viewers who rated "Crash", this film is a must see. Also fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will love this movie.
