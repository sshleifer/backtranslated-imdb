There are four prisoners in the same cell: Markus, a powerful transvestite (Clovis Kornilyak); Marcus's idiot friend, Puckett (Dmitry Rato), who will eat anything, including a pocket watch, cockroaches, and his younger sister; Lassalle (Philippe Loudenbach), a clever librarian who killed his wife; and Carrère (Gérale Laroche), a new guy who was involved in corporate fraud and is now focused on escape. After the brick falls off the wall of the camera, the men discover a hidden diary written by the serial killer, possessed by the Fountain of Youth, who occupied the camera in the 1920s. Is this magazine the secret of their escape? Or is there something much more sinister behind it? <br /> <br /> I’m a bit tired of participating in this film because the only other experience I’ve had with Eric Valet was the terrible One Missed Call (2008), which I’m considered the worst theatrical movie I’ve made ever seen. However, much of what was wrong with One Missed Call could probably be explained by Klavan’s horrible script, because (as I recall) Valetta’s direction was not the worst part of the film (unless he decided to include the child) . In any case, Maléfique was a good way to regain my respect. This is a French film (obviously something I like), and it happens in prison (this is my second favorite horror movie after the asylum). So these are two points for him even before the movie starts. Fortunately, Valletta got me as soon as the film ended. Maléfique is a rather deep, rather complex, rather convincing story of obsession and despair. The desire and the need to translate fantasy into reality. Although it is not a terrible film in the traditional sense, the strangeness of its power makes it damn scary. The period between the climax and the end was one of the best films I have seen in a long time, and I sincerely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with a rather steep bleeding. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8.5 / 10. Valette regained some respect. <br /> <br /> Note: Paramount has acquired the rights to an American remake (unexpected surprise). This should happen in 2009. I’m not sure why, honestly, because it doesn’t look like it could be a great source of income here in the states. But I was surprised before. <br /> <br /> Vive La France! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
