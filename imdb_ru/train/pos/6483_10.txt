It should be noted that in this excellent series, brilliantly narrated by Lawrence Olivier, the beginning of the Second World War is scheduled. The origin has not been fully explored as a result of the fall of Germany as a result of the Treaty of Versailles, which helped advance Hitlerâ€™s demonic rise, but, as one reviewer says, it must be difficult to do in a series of 26 pieces into which so much has to be squeezed. <br /> <br /> In addition to the expected combat photography / action movie, there are many personal, emotional and human tragedies that tell give the viewer an amazing insight, especially if you are not necessarily a Second World War lover / fan. The episodes showing "evidence" and what life was like in the rear of the main allies / adversary, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States, were quite open to the eye. Showing the extreme cruelty of the war on the front line and, of course, the suffering of the civilian population, death camps, etc., They were very well handled and exposed. I would fully recommend it in any history lesson for the younger generation (about which it can be said that I am alone in 47 years!). <br /> <br /> Some things are strangely omitted, such as the emergence of the beginning of a new era of jet aircraft with Frank Whittle, an experimental jet aircraft, Gloster, and the combat debut of Gloster Meteor, as well as the German Messerschmitt Me 262 - especially since 1 was seen in the opening, and the mention of V2 was surprisingly less. This is probably a small mistake, not related to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons that WW2 has put forward from the more barren old science. But a great series, which made a great impression and has done so since when, fortunately, it was repeated. <br /> <br /> The DVD series, intended to be used as a historical film, for those who, in particular, are a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be proud.
