If, in 1968, two more charming performers appeared in a more charming film with Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, I do not know who they were. I first saw this adorable little satirical gem 25 years ago at the age of 16, and I believe that any year in which I could not sit down to watch it again is lost. It is intelligent, quirky, tidy, thoughtful, sweet, mildly subversive and utterly charming. The romance of these two social losers is both richly comical and terribly touching - never more than Maggie Smith’s desperate attempt to pick up the right card in the deck, a scene that is both sadly funny, and a perfect miniature portrait of heartbreaking loneliness. And this last freeze-frame on Ustinov’s agitated, worried, loving face when he asks: “Are you all right?” - Has anyone ever done so that the loyalty and sound of devotion were so perfect and frankly honest? I would never want to know someone well who didn’t like this movie.
