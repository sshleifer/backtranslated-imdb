I donâ€™t know why people always want to get a deeper meaning in films or find them useless. <br /> <br /> How about just having fun? Something in which Morgan Freeman stands out. He has a chance to brag a little. Paz Vega, his colleague, gets a promotion in his career, and Brad Silberling gets a name to attract people to watch his film. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie. A bit of humor, a little pathos, a little bitter sweetness, but nothing more than that. I got a special joy from Jim Parsons as a registrar at a construction company. When he looks at Freeman with adoration and says: "You make me want to be a woman." He's just fun. The scene of the fight between Ms. Vega, her ex-husband and her friend is also wonderful. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a cute, charming film that will make you smile. You could do much, much worse.
