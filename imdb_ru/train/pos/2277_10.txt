Although the film sometimes seems a bit long, it's worth it. Gordon leads in a style that reminds you of the writing styles of Vonneguts. Ruthless, thoughtful, ironic, bizarre and dark, this film will stay with you for a while, asking answers to impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman and Arkin are incredible. Cheryl Lee is also great in a role that reminds us of Lynchâ€™s fans about her days Laura / Maddy. Do not miss it!
