I loved this movie from start to finish. I find the style of the director / actor of direct appeal to me / the audience very attractive. <br /> <br /> What impresses and refreshes me most in this film is its ignoring - and, therefore, the challenge - of gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths, and the lack of judgment — and the characters’s acceptance of themselves and each other — allowed me to accept them and allow them to be drawn into their world. Without a sermon, with a mind, tender and loving humor, this film is able to open up new possibilities and gives hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and valuable people. I look forward to new proposals from this creative and talented director.
