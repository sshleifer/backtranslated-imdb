It takes patience to get through the eccentric David Lynch, but - for a change - the life-affirming chronicle of Alvin Straight's journey, but stick to it. Although he moves as slowly as John Deere Straight, when he meets good strangers during his pilgrimage, we learn a lot about the isolation of aging, painful regrets and secrets and, ultimately, about family strength and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth ends his career with the most sincere performance of the year, sad and poetic, frivolous and caring. And Sissy Spacek compares him to his “slow” daughter Rose, who is worrying about her personal loss while caring for her dad. Rarely is a modern film so positively preaching about the family.
