If you want your vision of Chaplin to be limited to an attractive vagabond, and your belly laughing from the pathos, look something else. However, if you like one of the best comedic films, watch this one. <br /> <br /> The picture shows a tramp who really cannot get a girl. He notices another couple kissing on a park bench, and he has an explosion destroying their fun. <br /> <br /> This is one of Chaplin’s “park comedies”, shot in Mac Sennett Park, with pickpockets, policemen and couples. These shorts work as the format allows Chaplin to shine when he overcomes difficulties. <br /> <br /> I checked the box, as it can be considered a spoiler, although it is not so if you have seen these films. All fall into the pond, except for Chaplin. He gets the girl that Minta Durfi played in this case, she is Mrs. Roscoe "Fat Man" Arbuckle.
