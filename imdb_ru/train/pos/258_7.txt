Between San Francisco and the Captains the Bold, two of the greatest roles of Spencer Tracy, there is this very curious film about the war and its influence on some people. They gave him the title of "Pistol" Spencer Tracy and Franchot Ton in the only movie they ever made together, and Gladys George as a woman who loves them both. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Ton are a pair of World War I draftees, Ton is a weak character who almost runs across a hill in a training camp, but Tracy stops him. Tracy is still playing an attractive, younger version of the Wallace Beery, which MGM provided for him when they signed him away from Fox. <br /> <br /> At the front, Thon gets an opportunity and uses it when he manages to get to the church tower, which looks at the German machine-gun nest, during the battle. He has already learned to shoot, and he is Sergeant York. But Alvin S. York never changed war, as Ton did. <br /> <br /> Wounded in battle, Thon escapes to the hospital, and Gladys George looks after him. Tracy voluntarily visits her friend, and she and George do something. Later, when Tracey is reported missing, Ton and George are getting married. Tracy is heartbroken when he comes back and finds out about the marriage, but sits down in stride. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is about how Tone applies the wartime skills he learned to gangster trading. Now he is a hired killer, and George doesn't really know what he does for a living. I think you can understand everything else. <br /> <br /> The part of the film that gave me some trouble was that I could not believe that Gladys George could not understand it. She is a smart street girl, her role is very similar to the one she played in Roaring Twenties with James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Roaring Twenties, the character development of Humphrey Bogart there is similar to the development of Ton, although he was not the central character of the film. In fact, there are elements of “They gave him a weapon”, which can be found in “The Taxi Driver” and in Clint Eastwood’s classic “The Unforgiven.” <br /> <br /> Director Woody Van Dyke very successfully put the fighting episodes of the First World War. For some reason, Leonard Maltin panned this film, I think it is much better than he thought.
