I have to admit that Holly was not on my viewing list at the Edinburgh Film Festival. However, after the artistic director of the festival specifically recommended this film to viewers of more than 200 people before showing another film, I decided to go see it. Blimey! <br /> <br /> This film deals with the very difficult problem of child prostitution and does so without any compromise. I found myself crying several times during the film and laughing at others. Speaking of an emotional rollercoaster. <br /> <br /> The lead actor (Tui Nguyen) is a Vietnamese newcomer (he was only 14 at the time of filming), and he had to cope with this incredibly difficult and difficult role. She reminded me of Keishu Castle-Hughes from The Whale Rider, but the role is much more difficult here, since she has to play a child prostitute. Most likely, she will receive many awards. <br /> <br /> The main story of a girl who was sold by her family to prostitution and was kept as a sex slave in a brothel in Cambodia. She meets an American (played by Ron Livingston in a dramatic role that we are not used to seeing from him), who, after spending some time with her, decides to help her. However, by that time, it is being sold again, and he sets off to find her in Cambodia. The plot unfolds and unfolds, and the audience can never predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The acting was very strong, with a very interesting international composition. Udo Kier (very persuasive as a sex tourist), Virgin Ledoyen (touching as a social worker) and Chris Penn (one of his latest films). The Asian cast was also excellent. <br /> <br /> Although the film is about this complex subject, it successfully tells a convincing, powerful story. It was filmed in Cambodia (some scenes in real brothels), which creates the feeling that you are almost watching a documentary. It seems that the DP used a lot of hand-held cameras and close-ups, and in general it made you feel that you are part of the story. <br /> <br /> After the show, I listened to other members of the audience as they left, and it seemed that they were all stunned. Watching this film is not easy, and I applaud the filmmakers for not shooting the Hollywood film. <br /> <br /> This is by far the best film I've ever seen at the Edinburgh Film Festival. My husband and a couple of other friends share this opinion.
