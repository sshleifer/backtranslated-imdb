I really enjoyed the reunion! I would rate it 10 if they had "Hassie" and "Little Luke". There was not even a mention of where they are today or why they did not participate in reunification. They were very popular characters, and I think it was a mistake not to explain their lack of appearance. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was glad that TNN launched the series again! I've been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to tape the entire series (maybe I missed a few episodes). Jenny hanahan
