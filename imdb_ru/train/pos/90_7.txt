Yes, the poster is a terrible job. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was fine ... nothing special ... I just hoped that he would become a hardcore addict and completely ruin his life. <br /> <br /> Oh, and with rich children this can not be, right? Not for the son of a rich businessman who organizes big ball parties and has a beautiful well-kept lawn in front of a mini-mansion. <br /> <br /> No ... the child is too good to completely ruin his life. After all, who will drive the new SUV and who will go to law school? <br /> <br /> Ah, poor little rich children ... in their quaint pretty house, with their ivy league schools, ultra-clean houses and social parties ... what will the world do without them? <br /> <br /> I hope that all of them are addicted to drugs, passed away in their lives and ended up in prison ... so maybe we will see films that not all revolve around poor little rich boys and girls surrealistic world.
