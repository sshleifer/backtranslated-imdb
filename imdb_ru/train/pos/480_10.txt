The main aspect of this film, which most people miss, is that Luhzin lives his own game of chess. So many people saw this film and simply did not understand it, and I do not understand why. When I watched this movie, I was sent on a private journey that stopped me. I will try to explain it without any spoilers, but be warned, I'm really talking about what happens in the film. <br /> <br /> **** Possible spoilers **** Be warned! **** <br /> <br /> This is the life of the "big moves" against the "small moves". He chooses Natalia as his queen, and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a child. Listen carefully to this description. <br /> <br /> When someone asks a question, he remembers the past, as if reviewing past steps. (By the way, flashbacks are beautifully lit.) Flashbacks are also quite interesting, since they reflect not only his point of view in childhood, but also the point of view of another character. This is amazing. <br /> <br /> Different characters become either his assistants or his enemies, pawns, bishops and knights, their actions enlighten you as to which side they are on. Even placing them in a scene is crucial for understanding what is happening. Well done. <br /> <br /> I will not comment more on what happens to Luzhinâ€™s character, but I hope that this will illuminate what actually happens at the end. <br /> <br /> This film is constantly running on many levels, so I approve of it. It was a pleasure and look fun. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, I would recommend a movie called Fresh. The only way these films resemble is the use of chess and characters, which are considered as figures. <br /> <br />
