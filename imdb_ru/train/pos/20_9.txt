Stanley and Iris show the triumph of the human spirit. For Stanley, this is a struggle to become literate and realize their potential. For Iris to find the courage to love again, becoming a widow. The beauty of the film is that the dance performed by Robert De Niro and Jane Fonda begins and stops before each of them acquires the skills and courage to trust each other fully and move on. In this sense, it very well gives us a good idea of ​​how often life happens, and, therefore, is trustworthy. Unlike some other reviewers, I found that each of the characters corresponds to the whole picture. The supporting cast is also carefully chosen, and they add character depth, which the main characters get added value from the supporting acts. Overall a great movie. The best thing I get from this is Hope.
