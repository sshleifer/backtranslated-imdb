one of the funniest marios I've ever played. The levels are creative, there are smooth controls and good graphics for their time. There are also a lot of crazy bosses and enemies to fight. Sometimes the levels become frustrating, and if you miss some of the difficult levels and yet you need to do more to fight the boss, it can be annoying. another complaint is the angle of the camera; although in most cases it works quite well, in certain situations it can be painful. if you are a big fan of Mario; this is for you. even if you are not a big fan of it, I still recommend this one. This is a great game, and getting what you need may take some time, but it's very nice. Good for playing at short notice. it will almost certainly attract your interest; it definitely holds me!
