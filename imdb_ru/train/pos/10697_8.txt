Modern, original, romantic story. <br /> <br /> Very good game by Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Ms. Kidman perfectly imitates the Russian accent. Ben Chaplin is also good as a shy, boring clerk. For men (and some women): Miss Kidman looks fantastic and very responsive. I forgot what a gorgeous woman she is. It is not difficult to imagine that John falls in love with her. Some unexpected twists in the story are good for waiting. Although I was hoping for a happy ending, the last part of the film came as a surprise to me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a good movie. <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: Destinations.
