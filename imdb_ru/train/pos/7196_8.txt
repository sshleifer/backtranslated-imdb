In the course of the TV series "Battle Legion Zorro" - one of the best fighters of the 1930s. Made in a period when the studios could still exhibit a large cast, this film has all 12 episodes. <br /> <br /> In 1824, the president of the newly formed Republic of Mexico, Benito Juárez (Carlton Young), tried to put his new country on a solid financial foundation. To this end, he organized the shipment of rich lots of gold to the capital from the local mine of San Mendolit. <br /> <br /> Members of the local council are planning to steal goods on behalf of Don del Oro. a god of golden armor who, with the help of a local yaki tribe, hopes to become the ruler of Mexico. Against him is Don Francisco (Guy D'Annery), who forms a legion of locals to help Juárez. When Don Franciso is killed by Don Del Oro's people, a stranger, a silly Don Diego (Reed Hadley) arrives in the city. Diego aka Zorro captures the legion with the help of his friends Ramon (William Corson) and Juan (Budd Buster). The main heroine of the play is Sister Ramona Volita (Sheila D'Arcy). <br /> <br /> Diego and Ramon take seats at the local governing council. It soon becomes apparent that some of the other members of the Council are in alliance with Don del Oro. First come the chairman of the Council (Leander de Cordova), the head of the militia Manuel (John Merton), the main judge Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and Gonsols (Edmund Cobb). Zorro suspects that Don Del Oro is one of these people, but which one? <br /> <br /> What follows a few hair-raising shoots of Zorro and his like-minded people from followers of Don del Oro. We have an ever-existing collapsing rope bridge, a deep gulf between two rocks, through which only Zorro can jump to a safe place, and the usual assortment of explosions, fires and buses and wagons crashing or crossing a rock. I take off my hat to a wonderful team of stuntmen of the Republic under the leadership of the legendary Yakima Kanutt and the Irigoyans, Bill and Joe. Kanutt performs his trademark trick by jumping on a team of escaped horses, and then falls under the coach, which he repeated in other films, including John Ford's "Stagecoach" in the same year. <br /> <br /> In any case, Zorro finally exposes the false god Don del Oro and restores peace to the valley before going into sunset in chapter 12. <br /> <br /> Other actors include Jim Pierce, Curley Dresden, and Charlie King as Don Del Oro’s men, hence the men, and if you look closely, you can find bits from the future serial star and Lone Ranger Clayton Moore and Canutt stuntman in bits. By the way, the “Big” Jim Pierce is best remembered for playing Tarzan in Tarzana and Zolotom Liom (1927) in 1927 and for his marriage to Joan Burrows, the daughter of Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burrows. <br /> <br /> Thoroughly enjoyable.
