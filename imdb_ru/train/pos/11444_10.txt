Watch this movie to see the gorgeous images of Andy Goldsworthy sculptures, and treat yourself to a fully revealing and relaxing experience. Music perfectly complements the footage, but never attracts attention. Some commentators have called fragments of interviews with the artist a weak point, but think about it: why would you dwell on this in the film if you can read Andyâ€™s thoughts in detail in his books or attend one of his excellent lectures? This environment is much more suitable for demonstrating the ephemerality of the artist's works and is used skillfully in this regard.
