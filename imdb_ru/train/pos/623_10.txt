There are not so many films around me that would give me the feeling that “Stardust” has been doing all this time throughout the film. The fairy tale, similar to the Princess Bride, Star Dust, is by far the most wonderful fantasy performance of the 2000s and 1990s. Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro, especially exciting, funny, with beautiful images and unforgettable characters, urge anyone to watch this movie without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end, but it is the journey, and not the destination, that fascinates the viewer from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Ten stars, not decimals Less.
