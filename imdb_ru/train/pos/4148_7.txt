Let's make one thing clear: this film does not seek to redefine the genre, this is not Dr. Strangelove about Young Frankenstein. This is a stupid film with three gorgeous women (I don’t remember any other comedies with similar characteristics), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehr from SNL and indie queen Parker Posey, charming as ever. The story is simple: three students were “losers” in college and they are still being pursued. Poeler is a dog trainer (who can't even meet with a blind guy), Posey is an assistant senator (who "hasn't been touched by a man since Clinton was in the office" ... I realized that after a few minutes ... I was slow, okay!), and Dracht has a happy bride (Seth Meyers from SNL, funny). They should prevent the senator’s “not cool” daughter (always sweet Amber Tamblyn from the TV series “Jeanne Arkady”) from embarrassing her during the spring break. Therefore, of course, they have to go to look after her, and some merriment arises. All in all, a light, simple comedy, rather short and rather pleasant.
