Cliffhanger - this is what seems to be the last fighter of Sliweder Stallone, before he became such an underrated actor. This is a climber who should help his friend after he was taken hostage by mercenaries who want them to find three suitcases with money in excess of $ 100 million. It has a great sequence of activities, the edge of your fun place and a great time in the movies.
