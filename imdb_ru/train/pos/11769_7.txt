I bought this movie a few days ago and thought it would be a pretty crappy movie. But when I inserted it into a DVD player, it surprised me a lot. James Belushi plays very well, like Bill "The Mouth" of Manucci. But especially Timothy Dalton plays a very good cast as Sheriff. The “final” scene in Bill’s house is very good, good camera work, pleasant dialogues and a very good game. Bill “Mouth” Manucci stole $ 12 million from the mafia. He lives with his wife in South Carolina as part of a witness protection program. But the mafia is tracking him down and wants to get 12 million dollars. Bill can trust only one person he knows inside out to himself.
