This ensemble play about adults who return to the formal Summer Camp of their youth is a very quiet participant and spectator in cinemas in the fall of 1993. I would say that it is a shame, but again, some of the best films are silent releases, which do not receive much hype or praise. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin are good here â€” a group of actors who embody these roles as people who have grown old with good, bad and funny memories of last summer. This film is about emotions, mostly pleasant, and the film never makes the viewer feel what the characters feel, preferring to allow the viewer to enter the memories on their own. Since I am a film viewer who manipulates films brutally and boldly, this is what I appreciate from writer / director Mike Binder. <br /> <br /> This film is a great cheap rent, a good basic rent, and even a good sit in the cinema. You may encounter this on TV, and I would definitely suggest watching.
