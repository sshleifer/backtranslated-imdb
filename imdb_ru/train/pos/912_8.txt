This film brings back a lot of memories of the classic old-fashioned movie, where the actors did not need to take off their clothes for the audience to watch their film. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I think that the main advantage of this film - Amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita - is, of course, the creation of the film. <br /> <br /> I have seen a lot of comments that the film is too painful and too slushy. In response to this, I think that to some extent this is the correct analysis, however, given that this is the film “Baryatya”, I think that in comparison with MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH, it has decreased significantly. HSSH was almost unbearable to watch in some places. <br /> <br /> However, in this film, when sentimental moments come, you smile, wishing the young couples all the best and hoping that nothing bad will happen to them. <br /> <br /> Another important plus is the performances of Shahid and Amrita. Both played very well, especially Shahid, who looks great in the film. Amrita looks amazing and should be taken seriously as a future main star. <br /> <br /> In spite of the fact that I generally liked the film, I feel that it is too long. Part of the middle could be cut, and this could have an even greater impact. I also think that music, although it fits into the film, when you see that the situations are a bit old-fashioned, and the film could win if a more modern soundtrack was available. Although the pictoriality of the songs Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein is wonderful. <br /> <br /> In general, I definitely recommend this film, it’s romantic, it’s amazing and it has a dramatic climax (I’m not going to go into details if you haven’t seen it. <br /> <br / > PS. If you tend to cry - take a napkin! (I needed a few)
