Also known as "Stairway to Heaven" in the United States. During the Second World War, the British aircraft of Peter Carter (David Niven) shot down in battle, but he survives. He meets and falls in love with beautiful June (Kim Hunter). But it seems that a mistake was made in heaven - he had to die! The French spirit comes for him, but he refuses. Soon he will appear before his court before the heavenly tribunal that he should be allowed to live. <br /> <br /> Sounds ridiculous, but in reality itâ€™s an incredible movie. The script is good because the actors play the roles completely straight and it is beautifully directed - scenes on Earth in breathtaking Technicolor (I have never seen such beautiful blue skies) and scenes in Heaven in black and white! Niven is sometimes a bit tense, but Hunter is just great (and very handsome), and Roger Livesey is great as a doctor trying to help Niven. The images everywhere are amazing (especially the ladder and during the final test sequence), and the special effects are really great (considering the age of the film). There is also a very strange sequence when Niven encounters a completely naked boy herding sheep! This is an absolutely beautiful, thought-provoking film - highly recommended. This remains unknown in the US, which is a shame.
