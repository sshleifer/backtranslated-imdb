“Hot Millions” is a delightful comedy that gets even better thanks to the presence of a wonderful cast that was put together for her. The film is a tribute to the genius of Peter Ustinov, who wrote the script and acts as the key figure of an enterprising predator. In the film, filmed by Eric Till, there is no indication that he has met such horrible people as some others from that period. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the action is a friendly man, Marcus Pendleton, who, before he leaves prison, sets the income tax forms for the warden, who is surprised by the refund he owes the government. Marcus, a genius in numbers, sees opportunities where others will not. He starts working at a company that uses the latest computers for its accounting, but Pendleton is a resourceful person who finds a way to take advantage of the system and creates different fake accounts in different parts of the continent. <br /> <br /> A secretary has been appointed to Marcus, who also has an apartment in his house. Incompetent Patty is considered to be a worker who manages to spoil everything. The way she gets a job as a secretary is not clear, but in the office everything is different when the eerie Willard Gnatpol decides to follow her, but is not afraid, Patty's heart belongs to Marcus, who is an experienced pianist, and she is a Flute player, and together create beautiful music. <br /> <br /> The best thing in the film is Peter Ustinov. He clearly understood how to play Marcus, and runs away with the film. Mr. Ustinov gives a guaranteed report of embezzlement. Superb Maggie Smith is also at her best with her role as Patty, a kind woman who loves Marcus and who herself turns out to be a genius when it comes to investing money that she finds in Marcus’s pockets. <br /> <br /> Carl Malden is perfect as an American in charge of the corporation. Bob Newhart also appears in the role of Gnatpol, a man who wants Patty but cannot make her reciprocate. The marvelous Robert Morley is Caesar Smith, whose personality Marcus accepted. Cesar Romero also acts as a cameo in the role of an airport customs inspector. <br /> <br /> “Hot Millions” will delight anyone who is looking for a fun time spent in the company of this dubious but charming character, Marcus Pendleton.
