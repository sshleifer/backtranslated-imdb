these are films like these that make you want you to never get carried away by a nerd at school. If you liked this movie, then I would advise you to watch Valentine. I just found out today that the guy who played Marty (Simon) committed suicide a little after the release of the movie, and that's a shame, because he did a good job. Interestingly, this is because of the role that he played in the film? It starts when Carol makes him go to the girls' toilet so that they act as if they were going to do it. When he changed clothes in the shower, Carol's popular friends made their way into the bathroom and prepared everything: the camera, the electric shock, the pole. When Marty opened the curtain naked, he realized that he had been deceived. He tries to cover the shower, but the children open him, grab Marty and begin to shower him when the camera rolls. They lifted him up, plunged his head into tolith while it was reddened, and they electrically disconnected it (slightly). When the children are in custody provided by the coach, the two boys give Marty a joint that will force him to pull out. Skip smashes one of the windows in the gym, using a brick to force the teacher to excuse him. While Marty is vomiting in the bathroom, Skip sneaks into the Science Lab and mixes some things that look like cocaine, but are not sure what it was. The lab explodes, disfiguring him badly. After 5 years, the children who tormented him that day received invitations to reunite in high school for 5 years, which was burned the day it exploded. One by one people are killed. I do not understand how the girl sank. she could be back after Marty left. She almost went out the first time.
