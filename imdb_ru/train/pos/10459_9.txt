I didnâ€™t expect that this film, depicting a family, would affect me so much, just like you would expect to live next door. They are ordinary people of flesh and blood, not like typical Hollywood dishes. They are faced with too common a problem - a debilitating disease. But the storyline captures the heart with a powerful lesson. The cast, script, direction and acting are combined with a wave that deeply immerses the viewer in the story. Give this film full attention, and its message will really inspire.
