Simply put, Oliver! This is one of the greatest musicals of all time. It is filled with memorable songs - “Food Glorious Food”, “Oliver!”, “Think for yourself” and “Oom-Pah-Pah” to name just a few - and equally memorable characters. <br /> <br /> The film is a musical adaptation of the classic novel by Charles Dickens and is very similar to the story of Oliver Twist himself. This is the perfect family movie. There are some frightening moments - the villain Bill Sykes, played by Oliver Reed, is scary enough in itself, but in general the film will appeal to children of all ages, as well as adults. <br /> <br /> The story - which almost everyone knows by now - revolves around a little orphan boy named Oliver and his life grew in London. At first he lives in the workplace with the rest of his orphans, but after he dares to interrogate Mr. Bumble, the warden, he is sold to the family as a servant. <br /> <br /> After a series of failures and shaving, he meets the Clever Dodger - superbly played by young Jack Wilde, who gives all his strength to the role - and through him, greedy Fagin (Ron Moody), who trains young boys to collect pocket treasures that he keeps for himself. <br /> <br /> The film was shot exclusively in studios and on the sound stages of the Shepperton film studio, but this is not translated at all to a film. The sets perfectly repeat Victorian London, as well as the costumes of the characters. Multiple Oscar winner and huge success on his release, Oliver! is a worthy contender for the best musical all the time and will delight anyone who loves the movie.
