In 1991, the two best sequels of all time were released: TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY and BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY. Of these two, I always liked BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY more. TERMINATOR 2: JUDICIAL DAY is made better, but there is nothing better than Bill and Ted. Besides Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY, it’s hard to come up with a greater comedy duo than Bill and Ted. They are one of a kind. <br /> <br /> It seems influenced by OS National Lamphun Stiggs, Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Mathison, two incredibly talented writers who invented the duet, performing in a local theater in Los Angeles back in the 1980s. Two quickly began to write the script for about two, and soon BILL AND TEDA EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was born. The film, shot in 1987 and released in 1989, was a great box office success and instant cult classics. Soon work began on the sequel. Stephen Herek, the director of “EXCELLENT ADVENTURE”, was not interested in working on the sequel, as he considered it too vile and, unlike the first, Peter Hewitt, who debuted in his full-length film, brought a continuation for the production. There could be no better director for the job. BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is amazingly directed. It is filled with its own unique style and energy that can not be compared. <br /> <br /> What makes BOGUS JOURNEY one of the best sequels is that it is darker than the original, it’s just as fun. It doesn’t change characters like most sequels. Bill and Ted are the same cute characters they were in the first movie. This is because it was written by the authors of the original. Most of the sequels were not written by the same authors as the first one, but since BOGUS JOURNEY had the same scriptwriters, the result was as good as EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, if not better. Like the first one, “BOGUS JOURNEY” is absolutely cheerful, well written, funny and, above all, original. It is filled with spectacular special effects and fantastic comedy performances by Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves and William Sadler. This is an unforgettable "journey." 10/10
