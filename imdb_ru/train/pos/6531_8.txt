I really liked this movie ... it was nice. I liked it, but if you didn't, it's your fault. Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew, although she does not quite look like books. Old fashion clothes are weird when you see them in our time, but she looks good on them. For me, rich girls did not have clothes that made them look rich. I mean, it looks like they got all the clothes - blindfolded - at a garage sale and just decided to put it together. All outfits were sticky, especially when they wore loafers with regular outfits. I don't want the film to look bad, because it was definitely not! Just go to the theater and see !!! You'll like it!
