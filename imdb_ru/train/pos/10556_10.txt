I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm glad I went to see it. A clever, slightly perverted comedy that makes you think. I'm not quite sure how a director can create “nothing,” but left it to Mr. Natalie and brilliant personalities in C.O.R.E. create another low-budget set that looks real (as real as it’s possible). It is worth spending time and money, if you have the opportunity to see this, please go. You will be glad you did.
