I would not have learned about this film if it were not for his “unexpected” Oscar nomination for best animated film. Fortunately, it so happened that I was able to see this revived little treasure. <br /> <br /> The story of the child Brendan, who was the nephew of the impressive and overly protective abbot of Kells. The abbot’s main occupation is building a wall to protect Kells from attacking Vikings. One day, Aiden, a famous illustrator from Jonah, took refuge with them. Aiden opens Brendan’s eyes to the art of illustration and the temptation of the outside world. Along the way, Brendan became friends with the white forest sprite Aisling, trying to find an ancient crystal, invaluable to the painstaking art of book illustration. <br /> <br /> Kells' Secret is not like most of the released animations. Those days. This is a kind of return, as the illustrations are made in strict geometric lines and design without much concern for realism, as well as symbolism. The movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplified, but at the same time smooth animation style that was used at the beginning of the Kung Fu Panda sequence. However, it is the great use of color that is the main source of surprise for viewers. The red colors used in the Viking invasion episode are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try to catch this silent gem of the film. This is a long-awaited respite from all the senseless bombardment of modern animated films, such as Monsters vs. Aliens, and the like. The sparse Celtic musical score is effective in evoking a sense of fantasy that fills the film. Well, the story may be a bit superficial, and the ending is a bit desirable. I would like to know more about the Book that Brendan and Aiden have been working on. But the clear star of this film is his amazing stylized artwork, which is said to be based on the artwork in this Book of Kells.
