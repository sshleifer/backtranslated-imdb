Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman together with Jennifer Aniston together make one of the funniest films in the 2003 season (end of May) and improve the past crazy and personally forgotten roles of Kerry in past comedies. With a little relaxed Kerry antics, but with the shock of his old self, Kerry powerfully brings this film to the heights of laughter, as well as dramatic, tearful and gloomy moments. Elements of Jim's real acting ability continue to appear in this film. This amazing summer fun amazes most of the buttons, including dramatic elements and dull moments that blend perfectly with this scenario. Bruce still lacks a magnificently honored comedy / drama ensemble, but still deserves praise for the fact that he has a great date film, as well as a solid message, soft spiritual cynicism and a parody that support his good-natured taste. Eight out of ten stars.
