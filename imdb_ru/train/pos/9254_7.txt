No film with Dennis Hopper, Gary Buzie, Erica Eleniak, Tom Berenger, Dean Stockwell, Marilu Henner deserves a rating below 5 here. This is a bad male version of films, such as 16 blocks or the endless run of Midnight, except that the prisoner transported here is very easy to see, Ms. Eleniak. Tom Berenguer plays well another coarse, individual military type, and William McNamara plays his new recruit, who will soon be thrown out of foil. The plot at first glance is absurd, because I lost count of the time that Eleniak should and could have escaped, but this is an interesting film with good health, and there are good cameos from all the above actors who support this film. In fact, this is not a family film, as there is a curse in it and a rare nude scene with Eleniak, but it is much better than the other chatter that appeared at this time.
