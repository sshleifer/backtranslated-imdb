This film is a classic story. Music, camera shots, and acting skills are superb. Showing the film in black and white gave it a much better look and perfectly complemented the music, like Psycho. It's amazing how few people have commented on this film. I think this is a difficult film to find. I gave the film 9. Watch the movie and you will understand what I am talking about.
