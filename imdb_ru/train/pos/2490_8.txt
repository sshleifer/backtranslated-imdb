Those from the era of "instant reward" horror films will undoubtedly complain about the speed of this film and the lack of free effects and the number of bodies. The fact is that “Empty Acre” is a good example of how independent horror films should be created. <br /> <br /> If you avoid independent stanchions because you are tired of annoying teenagers or twenty people who are killed. you. <br /> <br /> Being in the rotting remnants of the American dream of the countryside, “The“ Empty Acre ”is a story about a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six-month-old baby. When a weak relationship breaks up, a big story unfolds in the background. At night, a shapeless dark mass boils on a sunless barren acre on their farm and seems to be devouring everything in its path, leaving no sign that it ever was. <br /> <br /> The film has many mysterious characters and visual clues about what is going on and ends with a well-executed ending that resonates with enough questions left to confirm the author’s / director’s belief in an intellectual audience. <br /> <br /> It seems that the text is about the death of the American dream, but I would hardly call the film an allegory. “Empty Acre” is a fantastic little indie that horror-thinking fans should love.
