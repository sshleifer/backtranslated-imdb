it's all very simple Jake goes to prison and spends five years with a crook and chess master. they feel compassion for his story of losses and setbacks and the terrible sufferings he lives for, because of his faith in his skill in little tricks and control over the rules of little crooks. they decide to give Jake complete freedom: from his inner fears, from what he considers himself. for this they take him on a trip where he must release all fear, all pride, all hope â€” to be reborn as the true master of his will. <br /> <br /> This is a clever film about the journey of enlightenment about endless gambling and games that we make with and within ourselves. 10/10, without a doubt.
