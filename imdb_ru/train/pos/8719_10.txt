I was amazed at the improvements made in the animated film. If you sit close to the screen, you will see details in the grass and surface structures. Details, colors and shadows are at least an order of magnitude better than toy history. How they were able to remove the shading, I will never know. I very much hope that PIXAR will provide a documentary on how the film was shot, so that I can learn how it all was achieved. Based on this film, I think the animation films of the future will be judged based on this film.
