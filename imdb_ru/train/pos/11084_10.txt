<br /> <br /> I saw the Ice Fox in the theater when I was nine years old - I persuaded my parents to take me back three times. I started searching for it on video about five years ago, finally finding a copy on the online auction site, but I would really like it to be picked up by a new distributor and re-released (as I understand it, the original video was small) rights acquired by The Family Channel, Disney, etc., and regularly shown. This is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of the Fox family in northern Japan, told by a wise old tree. Great soundtrack complements the film well. Today it would be a good seller, better than many of the weak sentences of children's films today.
