I think this movie was good. It is strange that now the twins Olsen is 13 years old, they have guys and all that. I enjoyed them a lot when they were small children at Full House. In any case, the casting was good, and the film was somewhat funny. I kind of confused all the places of switching and their names. This is just an old version of It Takes Two.
