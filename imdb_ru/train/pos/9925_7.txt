When I rented a Domino, I expected it to be very stupid. I hate films with really bright editing and cinematography, and Domino also received very bad reviews. The only reason I watched it was because I liked Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott on other occasions. I also just enjoy adventure stories. Yes, the editing and cinematography were insane, the story was weak, and the acting was mediocre, but I still loved this film for some strange reason. Domino was very, very interesting and often very funny. I think it was terribly undervalued, because everyone wanted a more emotional journey, like Scottâ€™s last man, The Fire, and just got some great fun instead. I really understand why everyone hated Domino so much, although I liked it and recommend it.
