CONTAINS SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I saw an ad on this video. Then my sister discovered that we have a book, and I read it. I shot the video the same day I finished the book. I thought it was very memorable, like a book. The cast was great. Tara Fitzgerald was great because Helen and Rupert Graves hated Arthur. The costumes, music and decor are amazingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION! SEE THIS <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are several sex scenes that have been added, and some violence. That is why the video has a rating of 15. There are some other things that have been added. After the first part, I felt that the accuracy went down. Although the book is better than this one, I am glad that I have seen it and recommend it to people who read the book, are Bronte fans or love costume dramas (I'm 3!), If you are moving quickly through the sex scene. The book is rather undervalued. It seems that the books of Ann Brontes are not as widely read or well known as Jane Erie or Wuttering Heights, who have been on television and movies several times. One more thing. When I read the book, I was surprised at how much religion there was in it, but here they excluded all of this! <br /> <br /> 7 \ 10
