I turned it on to see the incredible Ethel Waters, whose autobiography I am currently reading. I admit that my jaw dropped when pork chops and watermelons began to appear, but people cannot look at this film as stereotypical or racist. This is largely a short film shot by blacks, for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was fairly divided, and stereotypes for the people involved were jokes of their time, old trends were exaggerated for humor. We see that modern black films are doing the same thing, but with new trends (stereotypes), “ho”, “hood” and the like. I think that if you look back eighty years ago, you will see that today's films will look just like racist ones. What viewers should appreciate in this film is the talent the size of a pint of Waters and Sammy Davis Jr., who taps his contemporary Shirley Temple and looks surprisingly the same as an adult. Everyone who participated in this film, it was clearly fun to do it. Why not enjoy what it is, instead of what you think it should be?
