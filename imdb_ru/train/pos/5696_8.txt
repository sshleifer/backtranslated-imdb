What are you doing with a 14-inch cocked porn star who was involved in drugs and murders and then died of AIDS? You are making a movie, of course. A likely reason why this was not done earlier is the fact that Eddie Nash would be in the way of its production. So it was not by chance that the film was shot some time after Nash was sent to prison. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is its fast pace. Time is not wasted on unnecessary crap. And why would it? There is too much good stuff to claim boring filler scenes. The cast is good. Kilmer was mediocre in a series of films, so here, finally, was the role, quite suitable for him. Bosworth is cute, so it doesn't matter how she behaves (she is solid), and McDermott, who is quite annoying for the rest, is quite good, largely because he has so much facial hair that I did not recognize him at first. (I would like them to do this with Cruise in every movie so I don’t have to look at his dull face.) I didn’t recognize Christina Applegate at all and don’t know that she was there if I hadn’t seen her name in the final credits . Kudrow is charming as always, a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (By the way, “Friends” is the worst TV comedy series of all time.) The only questionable casting options were Carrie Fisher's early almost cameo and the absolutely absurd inclusion of the morons of the 90s Jeanine Garofalo. Did you think that I would turn on Paris Hilton too? No, I think Hilton is the perfect choice in her 10-second appearance as a dumb whore. Because the film is about decadence, by the way ?? and about porn actor ?? she fits perfectly
