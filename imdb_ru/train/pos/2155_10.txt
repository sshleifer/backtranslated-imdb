What a wonderful and delightful movie! The story is amazingly good: drama, comedy and romance. The cast is excellent, and I was particularly struck by the cold beauty and mercy of the wife of director Masayuki Suo and professional ballet dancer Tamiyo Kusakari. On September 6, last year, I saw an American remake of "Should We Dance?" for the first time, and I found this amazing entertainment. But now I can say that this is another unnecessary remake, and I recommend this original film. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Dan√ßa Comigo?" ("Dance with Me?")
