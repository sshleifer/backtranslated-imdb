The Ship Ahoy was probably created to showcase MGM's talent. The film is a fascinating journey on an ocean liner en route to San Juan, Puerto Rico, at a time when the country participated in World War II. It was a typical fare in movie studios, due to which the film became a popular entertainment for entertainment in those difficult times when the country lived. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Eleanor Powell is visible in her best musical ranks where she clearly shows us that she was a dancer to be reckoned with. Red Skelton is also visible in the straight part with a small number of clowns, as he pursues the beautiful Miss Powell on the ship that delivers them to Puerto Rico. The irresistible Bert Lahr has a good opportunity in the film to show that he was a funny person. Virginia Gray is also considered an amusing girl that no one is deceiving. <br /> <br /> There are good musical numbers with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, in which, among other things, you can see the amazing Buddy Rich, who has several solos with Mr. Dorsey and Miss Powell. The young Frank Sinatra also acts as vocalist for the band with the support of Pied Pipers. <br /> <br /> This is a nostalgic journey worth loving the fans of this genre, which MGM fully controls.
