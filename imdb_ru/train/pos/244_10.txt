I did not know what to expect from Ned Kelly, but I really liked it. It was dark, dramatic and exciting. It also seemed very authentic, I felt transported in the 1800s. I have never been a big fan of Heath Ledger, seeing him only in teen-type films, but he is quite convincing in this role. Ledger plays Ned Kelly with dignity and energy, showing us how an energetic boy became the most notorious killer in Australia. Naomi Watts superbly plays a supporting role as a lover of Kelly society. Highly recommended - and this is from the Australian!
