I am definitely not in the target audience for this film. I am about 50 years old, who just recently stumbled upon the world of independent cinema. This happened quite by accident, when the film “Clerks” was opened on television late in the evening. The first two things I noticed in this film were: 1) technically amateur and 2) brilliantly written. When I read an interview with a director in a local newspaper, and he said that one of his influences was a clerk, I was curious. When he said that his main influence was “The Station Agent,” the film I saw on DVD the week before, I decided that I should go and check it out. The result can be described in the same way as Clerks, although the two films have nothing to do with the content. Both films suffer from technical mistakes that are overcome by amazing writing. While clerks are a day in the life of a person who has nothing at all in his life and is afraid to ask difficult questions about himself and his situation, “Less Like Me” is about a person who apparently forces himself to be constantly busy He always runs one way or another, filling his life with trifles so that he never has to deal with big ones. The themes and ideas of this film are strong and insightful. Watching this, I can say that little has changed since I grew up, young people still have the same problems that they always have. The writer puts these problems and themes in modern folk, gives surprisingly honest images and makes them do absolutely believable things. As for the indie cinema, then perhaps it is not perfect from a technical point of view, but from an artistic point of view it is very close.
