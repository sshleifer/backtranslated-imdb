It’s just a classic film where human voices from animals are what they think they are. I don’t know if a copy of the scene disappeared in my video, but it never shows how the dogs came out of the pit. It also shows the instinct of animal survival and tracing ability. Put people in the same position, and the helicopters will be absent. This time, the original film has been improved with a remake, since the offscreen text for the first one has been removed. Only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind, because the use of people should have made the story sharp, turning it into murder, proving that, after all, animals are more interesting than people
