This is one of the movies that gets better every time you see them. There are so many original and non-standard ideas in it that you will always find a new part. As in the next Sabu films (I haven’t seen The Unlucky Monkey yet, but others are just as wonderful), failure, chance and humanism play a big role. Directorial work and editing are inventive and artistic, without a film, which is an “artistic” picture, but very interesting. When comparing it with “Run, Lola, Run,” you should keep in mind that “Dangan Ranna” was created several years ago and was shown on German television in 1997 ... so it’s more likely that it served as an inspiration Tom Pumper film, and not vice versa. In addition to other reviews, I have to add that I really like acting and finals. This film is very interesting in many ways, and it manages to deliver the message without being annoying or pretentious.
