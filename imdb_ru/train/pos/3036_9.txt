The name just says everything. I watched this film with my father when he came out, and while serving in Korea, he admired this man. The disappointing thing about this film is that it concentrates only on a short period of a person’s life — interestingly enough, that a person’s whole life would make such an epic biography that it is stunning to imagine the cost of production. <br /> <br /> Some posters are not amenable to erroneous characteristics of a person, which are cheap pictures. The theme of the film “Debt, Honor, Country” is not just words ripped off from the lips of a high-ranking officer — it is a profound declaration of one man’s total devotion to his country. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Peck, being a liberal, gained a better understanding of man. He does an excellent job showing the fearless general, hardened by the human side of a man.
