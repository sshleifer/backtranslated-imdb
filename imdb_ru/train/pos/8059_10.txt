I just watched this movie in the film "Turner Classic Movies" last night and was amazed at the play of Victor McLaglen: in every sense of the word "tour de force". The atmosphere of Dublin in 1922, created through cinematic and production design, anticipated the methods used in the best films of the noir of the 40s and early 50s. It is very pleasant to pay attention to details: during the track of Frankie MacFillip (Wallace Ford), the mourners all pray in Gaelic. Max Steiner's rating is unforgettable. As in later films such as the 1939 GWTW, he appropriated folk ballads to impart a local flavor and a sense of time and place. John Ford: already a giant movie in 1935!
