Easy 9 out of 10 for the film director we will continue to grow to admire. But do not watch this film, expecting to be "entertained." Ang Lee objectively looks at the relatively unexplored aspect of civil war. What is beautiful in the film, as in all Lee films, is that he does not "support" his characters. He creates characters, brings them to life, problems and ambiguity ... and gives them a reality that often gets much closer to home than many people feel comfortable. This film has an action, but it is not for the lover of action, because violence is deeply disturbing and far from gratuitous ... that is, as characters, it is real. And, as one would expect from one of the most terrible wars of mankind, violence is terrifying. <br /> <br /> But as a study of greater human ambiguity, which undoubtedly dwelt in civil war, it is a masterpiece. Was there a war of slavery and abolitionism? It seems that Lee really wants to erase this line, which has become so popular in such images as Blue and Gray. However, this does not apply to idealism, as seen in Gone with the Wind. It is about freedom, the desire to have something of their own and fight for it. Watching the characters, you ask yourself: “How can they fight to save slavery?” The fact is that I don’t think this is true, and this film shows the problem of why so many people fell into the maelstrom of the Civil War . <br /> <br /> It’s a fact that many of the characters we’re learning about are fighting out of a sense of dedication to “home,” although they may never have investigated what a house is, or whether they really support it. values. Written scenes are very touching and yet subtle. Jake and Daniel are other examples of devotion stretched to the limit. And when the tension finally subsides, and these characters are suddenly “free” ... we see the birth of new people. <br /> <br /> It all mixed up with Lee’s beautiful inclusion in the environment of mankind with breathtaking views and shots. Lee has a style that is his, somehow European in his “art” (slow camera, indifferent), Asian in his epic and plot development, and yet somehow familiar and easily accessible to many in North America. /> <br /> Relax, let go of your preconceptions about what a Civil War is, what a “western” is like a genre, what a war movie should be ... and let Ang Lee take you into a world so fragile is so difficult so real that few of us can comfortably see it. <br /> <br /> In this, Lee continues what he did in Icestorm. Again, the film is going slowly and without visible "direction" ... a sure sign of Lee's ability to direct, without "imposing" himself in history or on the screen. His direction is enhanced by the fact that he extracts from Jewel (yes, the singer), the still untested actress, who puts on amazing performances. <br /> <br /> The film is for those who love movies and do not like the standard Hollywood epic.
