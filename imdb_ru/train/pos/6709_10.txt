What I like about this series is that it follows the lives of modern witches, and it is a pleasure to experience their daily love, humor and adventures. The literature of magic is so diverse, depicting ideas of classical, medieval and modern magic, such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina, a teenage witch, this show is so exciting and unique, because it allows us to experience a lot of modern magic, worthy of seven seasons! This show has so many great qualities, and itâ€™s very nice to see Sabrina live her daily life in a mortal and "friend" world. I would recommend this to any family, because the television series is clean, funny and adventurous. Classical!
