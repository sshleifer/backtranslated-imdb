When a small town is threatened by a child killer, a policewoman stalks him, pretending to be his friend. As she becomes more and more emotionally involved with the killer, her mind begins to beat, causing her to lose focus on the job of catching the criminal. Not a film about high-voltage excitement, but a solid work of the police and a good depiction of the erroneous mind of a psychotic loser.
