Now it's one of the best in Big, the only role of Jack Hulbert in 1931, divided into two parts for the band Band Waggon radio Askey & Murdoch. He boasts an excellent cast of actors who win all they are worth, especially Asuka, of course. Histrionics was provided by Linden Travers, the melodramatic of Herbert Lomas and the pragmatist Richard Murdoch. <br /> <br /> A group of railway passengers stuck in a lonely country station during the night finds more than expected, ghost trains, Ghost porters, hairy sausages and Arthur try to entertain them all. His repartee with all falls between the split and scary bored. When the formula works, it is very good, but sometimes it becomes very far-fetched and makes the film seem more outdated than it is. But these damned treacherous fifth observers - thank God, Britain has not one now! <br /> <br /> Ultimately, a good inoffensive film that can be seen on the TV screen again, like an old friend, but if you were expecting to burst from your logs, you will probably be very disappointed!
