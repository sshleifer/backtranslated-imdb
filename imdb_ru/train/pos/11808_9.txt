In the late eighties, Warren Beatty created and starred in the literate epic film "The Reds" about the founding of the Soviet Union in the eyes of the radical radical figure John Reed. It was a deep and fascinating film, which sounded a message from the star cast. At the end of the decade, Warren Beatty created another epic in the movie “Dick Tracy”, which does not claim to be anything other than entertainment, with a whole bunch of best actors around, just having a great time, dragging it under tons of makeup. br /> <br /> The fact that both red and Dick Tracy can be from the same person means that this person has a player. In this film, Beatty managed to collect all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and combine them into one original script. <br /> <br /> The main gangster of the city - Big Boy Caprice - takes a step to truly eliminate competition. The film begins with the fact that he washes the henchmen of Lips Manlis in shooting in the style of the Valentine Massacre, and then Lips himself is fitted to the cement coat. But Caprice’s actions make him a target for Tracy. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the third mysterious and faceless person hopes to overthrow Caprice himself. Can our hero understand this underworld of crime? <br /> <br /> The spirit of fun in this movie is truly infectious. When people like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, William Forsyth, RG Armstrong will take himself to a disgrace to look like the cartoon creations of the stripper Chester Gould, and then immerse yourself in the exercise of cutting the largest slice of ham, you will surely enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but any of these guys could have, only Pacino, like the Big Boy Caprice, gets more time on the screen. Only Beatty plays it right, the rest seems to play on it. Dick Tracy received an Oscar for Best Art and Set Design, Best Song written by Stephen Sondheim and presented by Madonna's “Early or Late.” The fact that he even managed to get someone like Sondheim to write the score for this film only shows that Sondheim wanted to have fun. As for Madonna, Material Girl does more than alone with all these acting heavyweights, like the singer with the Breathless Mahoney club torch. <br /> <br /> In front of this film, Dick Tracy's films were sent to Photo B and, even worse, on Saturday, the daily series. The only thing that competes with this stellar extravaganza is a radio program made for the radio of the Armed Forces during World War II, which fell on vinyl. Can you believe actors like Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durant, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan and Andrews sisters? Try to find a record of this gem. <br /> <br /> Until then, the classic Warren Beatty comic strip for the big screen will work well.
