Although the "special effects" and technical attributes of this film may in fact seem ridiculous for some, I have never managed to erase the images that this film captured in my young and impressionable mind when I first saw it at the age of about 8 years. The story of the survival of this girl and the trials she went through has stayed with me all these years, and I remembered more than once how the girl went out of situations that went far beyond what I had seen. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a true story, and the fact that I was just a kid when I first saw it, could be the reason for my appreciation of this film. Every time this film was broadcast on television in the 70s and 80s, I was riveted to television, drinking an interest in every scene that I cannot explain. I believe that itâ€™s the first time to watch it as an adult (and with a weary look at the world), maybe some are not so pleased. In fact, I tried my best to get a copy to show this film to my son. <br /> <br /> This, like many other films, is not for everyone. If you are impressed with the wonderful stories about human survival, are not indifferent to Peru / McCiu Picchu and / or Amazon, then I think you might like this movie just as I have enjoyed it for the past 30 years.
