Pinjar is a really good movie, with great acting, good narration, good presentation, touching emotions, etc. and this film is one of the proofs. <br /> <br /> No Bollywood film that I can remember had such an impact on me - I literally spent hours thinking about the film - marveling at the various emotional situations that a person experiences in Man. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the great game of Urmila Matondkar, as well as Manoj Bajpai. Urmilla plays a girl in North India in the background of the section, and all the problems seem pleasant when compared to the problems she faces. <br /> <br /> Be sure to watch the movie. Technically excellent Bollywood product, which, in my opinion, is comparable with the best films from other countries of the world.
