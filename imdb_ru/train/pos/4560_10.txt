I have just returned from the show “My left foot” in our public library. What an emotional experience - I feel exhausted and invigorated. <br /> <br /> This is a story about Christie Brown, an Irish writer and artist, based on the author’s autobiographical article, My Left Foot. Christie was born with a form of cerebral palsy, that the only limb that he had under control was his left leg. Doctors advised his parents that he was hopelessly mentally retarded, but his mother was not disappointed in him and, to some extent, as Annie Sullivan did away with Helen Keller, helped him achieve a breakthrough in which he learned the alphabet, and then began to read, write and paint. <br /> <br /> This film won the Academy Award for Daniel Day-Lewis (Best Actor), as well as Best Supporting Actress for the actress playing his mother; He also received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Scenario. <br /> <br /> As a former clinical psychologist and family therapist, although many films can entertain me, many also often leave me without attention to fiction or improbability in realistic psychological reactions. <br /> <br /> Not this film - it was absolutely “accurate” in depicting typical Irish parental roles and behaviors (see, for example, see typical Irish families in “Ethnos and McGoldrick”). "Family therapy"), as well as the uneven emotional maturation of Kristi Brown - some immature reactions of the individual, which were further intensified when he perceived the features of his father. <br /> <br /> The film presents a great truth when changing certain sequences in its development (drawing and writing) and uniting several important people into one person for the sake of telling a coherent, believable story, not burdened with small distracting, less important facts . (See Christie Brown on Wikipedia for more accuracy.) On the DVD version, which was shown to us, there were some English subtitles that were very helpful in understanding Christie's speech (and some Irish speeches); The initial release of the film may not have been enough. (If you see this on a DVD, turn on this option.) <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is one of the greatest, most realistic actor's work I've ever seen. Really magnificent, outstanding, excellent. <br /> <br /> “My left foot” has more similarities with the more recent film “Diving bell and butterfly”, in which each depicts the life of a real person. successfully overcomes imprisonment and isolation of extremely severe physical disability. <br /> <br /> And at the same time, it echoes William Ernest Henley’s Invictus, which begins: “Outside the night that covers me, // Black as Pit from pole to pole, // I thank all the gods, which can be // For my invincible soul. "
