Although the main story was to take place in Morocco, this film was shot in foggy Romania in 18 days with a very limited budget. No matter how broken their cards are, the actors and the team play them with remarkable skill and devotion, so in the end I found the result touching and elegant. Nicholas Coaster-Waldau provides a formidable game like a bad guy. The script and direction provide some gems. However, whether you like the movie or not will depend on how you play the main role with Alexandra Staden. Other reviewers pointed to the flaws of the Staden as Blaise's Modesty. They may make sense, but I found her interpretation delightful and very appropriate. Modesty manages to overcome terrible differences through discipline, innate talent and courage. Stad seems to be doing the same here.
