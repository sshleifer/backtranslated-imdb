10/10 for this movie. <br /> <br /> I am a British doctor in India, now in India. the word Beckham pushed me away because I am a hardheaded fan of Liverpool and personally believe that Owen is really cool. Since Liverpool and Manchester United are rivals, I was DEAD that I won’t watch the movie. <br /> <br /> But then I was in Delhi to meet with friends, and I had an early morning flight, so I thought: “What the hell, let's wait by watching this movie,” because it was late at night. <br /> <br /> What an idiot I am. I had to see this movie on the day it was released. I think that using Beckham’s name should have attracted the attention of the audience (which in my case was counterproductive !!!), but then I really can’t think of a better title for the film. <br /> <br /> Both Nahgra, Knightley (amazingly amazing) and Rhys Meyers did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> If you hate football, don't like Manchester United (or England for that matter), then this is the DEFINED movie for you. In fact, I am only 29 years old, by profession a psychiatrist, but in my heart is a child. This movie knocked out Star Wars from my first position. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there are not so many British Indians like me. I wonder why? <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this movie.
