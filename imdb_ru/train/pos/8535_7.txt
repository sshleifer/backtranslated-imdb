This work is a bold look at the thinking of men who are in wheelchairs. This film never tries to soften it, cotton candy or mild soap - the fear, confusion and pain of what these guys live with. This is his strength, I think. <br /> <br /> But more than that, the performances are fantastic, with a well thought out and delivered dialogue that attracts you and makes you feel part of the experience. Characters never try to prevent viewers from knowing what's on their mind â€” what's on their mind. <br /> <br /> I found it tedious but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Rated 6.6 / 10 out of ... <br /> <br /> Fiend:
