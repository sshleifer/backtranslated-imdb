Frailty - 8/10 - This is a meaningless headline and the headline "Bill Paxton Directs", it's a pretty good old-fashioned rip sniffing the biblical horror thriller. In the end, he may only be the inbred Kubrick's "Shining" South Gothic cousin - but, hey, this is a damn interesting idea. It also has a wacky plot twist ... and a very ambiguous moral message. This is the film that in a few years people will catch late at night using a regular cable and frighten those who are watching it themselves. It is a pity that director Bill Paxton had to hire himself to be shot ... but oh well ... still a devil with a good rent.
