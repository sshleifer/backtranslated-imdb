I would almost give 10 out of 10. However, there are some intricate parts as well as sections that lead to errors that damage the flow / continuity of the film. The storyline is gorgeous and well composed; You definitely want to look at it calmly to fully understand it. Characters are complex, like the storyline, expect that you will be given enough information to stop scratching your head, this is a movie that explains everything at the end. The animation is gorgeous, and the combination of the femme fatale and the film noir leads to a great movie that is not like any of what I saw in the animation. This is a black and white film and its quiet darkness in several scenes, so it is worth watching it on a good TV or plasma. The voices of the characters really save this film in its English version, but it would be more convincing if there were some French accents to emphasize that this is happening in Paris, I liked more in French with English subtitles. In general, itâ€™s worth buying on DVD or BlueRay, if they exist! And personally, if you liked this movie, you might also like it; Awakening of Life and the Ghost in Shell 2 Innocence, this is just a personal sentence.
