For those who may not know what a movie with one actor, this is the best example. This plot is ridiculous, and really makes no sense. He is full of stamped situations, hackneyed lines, melodramas, comedies ... you name it! <br /> <br /> But Amitabh Bachchan can do something convincing, and this film is by no means an exception. Everyone performs well - Shashi Kapoor, Vahida Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smith Patil ... But it is Megastar that overshadows everyone with its sublime presence. Without it, this film would have been difficult ... The story of separation / misguided personalities / misunderstandings / love / hate / loyalty / good against evil - everything is in fact! Amitabh is a brilliant performance in all respects, otherwise a silly movie! And did I mention that this is ridiculous?
