This is a “tongue in cheek” film from the very beginning with a voice-over, which makes fun of everything French and then creates a rather naive, but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. Depicted by the magnificent Gerard Philippe, a dashing young man fully believes in the fate of the sinuous Lollobrigida - especially that he will marry the daughter of King Louis XV! The problem is that La Lollo will soon find out that she, too, is in love with Fanfan ... <br /> <br /> The driving force is good sword fighting, cavalcade and other lively action films, the film moves at a cheerful pace and with many comics. moments. The direction is perhaps the weakest aspect, but the film is so light and perceives itself so frivolously that I could not think about these shortcomings again. Pay attention to Noel Rokevert, the traditional heavyweight in French films, trying to steal La Lollo, causing trouble and passing the script to a fortune teller who reads La Lollo's hand! And what a pearl Marcel Herrand, the same passionate and passionate king Louis XV! That's not all: so many beautiful women in one film makes me want me to be in France and on the set in 1952! The film may have come out this year, but its inspiration, cheek, excellent narration, impeccable photography and unforgettable Gerard Philippe guarantee that it remains modern and pleasant to watch. I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren, not to mention the one who loves movies in general and scammers in particular! I see it!
