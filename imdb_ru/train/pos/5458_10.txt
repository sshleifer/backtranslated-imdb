I really liked this movie. I thought that the plot of the film is realistic and relevant for any period of American history. There is always that woman who does what she needs to climb the class system. I feel that the character Lilly was portrayed correctly and could not be better. Most of all I liked it when she realized what love really is. Throughout the film, all the men who fell in love with her, loved her, gave her everything, even lost their careers for her. Until she met Cortland, she did not understand why these people abandoned everything for the sake of happiness. The way her life ended was far from what she expected. I would recommend this film to all mature viewers so that you can understand the content and meaning of the film and the plot.
