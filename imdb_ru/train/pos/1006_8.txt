Robert A. Heinlein’s classic star-trooper in recent years has been messed up in everything: from the 1997 Paul Verhoeven film to the series, from a number of games. But none of them, so to speak, really captured the spirit of his novel. The games are usually unrelated, the series was more attractive, and the less Verhoeven’s film speaks about, the better. However, few people know that in Japan, an animation adaptation has already been made, released in the year of Heinlein's death. And believe it or not, despite the differences, this 6-episode animated series, according to the plot, is the most faithful adaptation of the Heinlein classics. <br /> <br /> The most obvious advantage of this series is the presence of exoskeletons with powerful armor, which we were deprived of in the Verhoeven film. As in the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on actions and space travel, although we see a fair amount of each of them. Although events do not happen as in the book, the feeling of the plot of the book is present. Rico and Carmen are romantically entangled, but this is touched on a little more than in the book. Although some may believe that the dialogue and interaction of the characters is a little inferior to the book (there is a little anime in it, but what did you expect?), But it is far superior to the film. Heinlein’s political views are simply excised, in contrast to the film where they are reversed. However, a big return to this series is the climate battle on Klendath between soldiers and beetles / aliens, which includes action in costumes with heavy armor, which we would like to see in the film version. > <br /> Overall, I liked this show because I wanted to see a vision closer to what Heinlein had. And I think they handled it very well. If you can find this series, take a look at it.
