In this horror film, the paranoia of the 50s, Reagan's America and high school films, Adam Arkin plays Tony, the starry full-moon protector in the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) are going to Communist Romania, and although one night he was lost in the streets, he was bitten by a werewolf. When he returns to the state, he cannot control his animalistic motivations and continues to kill. Disappointed, he flees the city. Decades later, the immortal Tony returns to the city and enters high school again. He still cannot control his transformations, and the townspeople and his friends understand that he is not quite human. Everything ends during a big football game in schools. <br /> <br /> I expected it to be one of those “so bad it is good” films of the early 80s. But I was surprised that the film was really, really funny. The cast, including Kenneth Mars as the first trainer, Rose Kelly as the lustful former Flame Tony, Demond Wilson as the bus driver and Alan Arkin as the marvelous doctor, do their best with fun results. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I was amazed at how similar the script and humor are to the “Family Guy”. “Full Moon High” has the same attitude and never takes itself seriously.
