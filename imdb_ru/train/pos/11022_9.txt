FORGET RELIABILITY <br /> <br /> You canâ€™t expect confidence in the militants, where the superhero has to perform an endless series of incredible feats that the process takes, but it recovers at lightning speed and turns harmless gadgets into a deadly weapon ... especially when directed by Rennie Harlin. <br /> <br /> "CLIFFHANGER" is no exception. But the film has numerous advantages: breathtaking landscapes, beautifully photographed, stunning special effects and visual effects (the first five minutes capture and set the film's tone), great music, long-awaited attempts at frivolity to remove some tension and solid cast: two heroes (Stallone, star and the corridor, have the lion's share of the footage, but the excellent Michael Rucker is more than firmly on his own), the charming heroin (Janine Turner) and one of the most disgusting The villains in history (invaluable John Lithgow and deceptively feminine Caroline Goodall, but also Rex Lynn - in longer than usual parts that do most of this, Leon, Craig Fairbrass) Good, solid entertainment then, if not credible. As Roger Ebert wrote (about another film) "This is such a film that you can relax and enjoy, if you are not mistaken, thinking too much." <br /> <br />
