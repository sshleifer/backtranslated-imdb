The successful self-made married businessman Harry Mitchell (Roy Shader's brilliantly hooligan performance) forces the adulteress to rush to the young stripper Sweet'n'sexy Cini (the gorgeous Kelly Preston). Harry blackmailed a trio of frothy low life hoods - sloppy porn theater manager Raimy (brilliantly slimy John Glover), restless strip Co-owner Leo (well played by Robert Treboru) and insane pimp Bobby Shy (and terrified intense Clarence Williams III) - who filmed his novel on video with cini. When Harry refuses to pay, the hoods kill Cheney and make it look like Harry did. This, in turn, ignites a dangerous battle of mind and will between Harry and the hoods. Directed by John Frankenheimer, adopting a tough screenplay based on Elmore Leonard's tough novel about the crime thriller, masterfully maintains a stable fast pace, provides a sufficient amount of exciting tension and effectively creates a defiantly unpleasant atmosphere. The presenters are all equally excellent, with outstanding supporting turns by Ann-Margret as the bitter abandoned wife of Harry Barbara, Vanity as the cheeky exhausted prostitute Doreen, and Lonny Chapman as the faithful business partner of Harry Jim O'Boyle. The tight and winding plot keeps the viewers on their toes. The viciously profane dialogue, Joss Wakano’s glossy cinematography, Gary Chang’s exhilarating score, sharply immoral tone and inspiring conclusion - all this is also for money. As an added bonus, Vanity and Preston take off their clothes. Very strong and nice little room worth checking out.
