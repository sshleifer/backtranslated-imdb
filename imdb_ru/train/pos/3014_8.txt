This fantastic detective story is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular movie genre. I was happy to see William Powell, who leads a detective story with charisma and charm and without the stupid attitude of his character Nick Charles (from the series "Thin Man"). Although the story itself is good, I think itâ€™s really interesting to watch this film - this is fantastic fantasy guide by Michael Curtis. From a visual point of view, this is a richly textured film in which Curtis demonstrates an incredible command of a medium; Curtis demonstrates that he was one of the best Hollywood directors, from split-screen images to weird camera angles and creative memories. Highly recommended if you are a fan of this type of movie.
