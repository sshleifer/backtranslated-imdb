I really don't like both Shrek films. (Since they are both "PG" and have words in them, I would never say it myself, so I did not like them.) <br /> <br /> But when it comes to "Spirit: Simarron stallion", which just barely watched for the first time last month, I became a fan of animated films other than Pixar. *** Spoilers ahead. *** In "Spirit: Stallion of Cimarron" a foal is born, which eventually becomes the leader of what he heard. One night, he sees a strange light in the distance and heads towards him. This action ultimately leads to his capture and a few more things. Throughout the film, we hear the story. It is through the thoughts of the Spirit, although horses never speak. This is what makes the film so sticky. They (the filmmakers) recorded real horses to make sounds made by horses; none of these sounds was made by humans. <br /> <br /> Spirit meets Rain, a beautiful mare, and Little Creek, the native American who owns Rain. Little Creek later frees Spirit and Rain, they run home. <br /> <br /> I’ve never been a big fan of Brian Adams, but I’m going to buy a soundtrack for this film in the near future. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you will not regret it. My account: 10/10
