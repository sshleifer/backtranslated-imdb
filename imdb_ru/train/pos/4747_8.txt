Anyone who has never seen anything like the battle scenes in The Matrix has never seen this movie. The fighting scenes were staged by the psychopath of the battle scene, Yuen Woo Ping, who also participated in the fights in The Matrix. And the fight scenes are few. <br /> <br /> Lee plays a super-soldier who does not feel pain, who now lives the life of a pacifist librarian (you understood me). When other evil super-soldiers start killing local drug lords to take over the drug trade, Lee teams up with his police buddy to help stop them. <br /> <br /> Absolutely insane things happen in this film (one badguy cuts off the hand with glass and hardly notices it). Battle scenes are filled with flying punches and blows; the number of bodies there is far. Lee rarely felt better, and he surrounded himself with many beautiful female costumes (Yip kicks some serious ass as his super soldier). Anthony Wong even starred as a drug lord (there are no surprises; he stars in every HK movie). Unfortunately, they do not do action films in the United States; I would not have to sit through all these terrible duplicate works in order to see the action that I thirst for. Featured.
