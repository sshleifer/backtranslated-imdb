I had never heard of this movie a couple of weeks ago, but his concept interested me when I heard it: an American man meets a European woman with his last night in Europe, and they spend the night together talking. It aroused my interest, but I never expected it to be so great. “Before Sunrise” is a masterpiece, as well as one of the most romantic films ever. To my surprise, the cynicism of the 1990s was completely absent. It is impossible to talk too much about this, because, so to speak, there is no real story (although there are a lot of absolutely interesting things that you could talk about; it looks like My Dinner with Andrey, where the conversation is going on, but this is not just a conversation which does matter), but let me just say, look. SEE THIS!
