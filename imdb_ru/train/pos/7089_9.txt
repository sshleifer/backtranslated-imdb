No doubt, 12 MONKEYS is one of the best science fiction films of the genre, and director Terry Gilliam is no stranger to making such cinematic originality. An apocalyptic film that keeps you completely enchanted, 12 MONKEYS never gives up and makes you wonder all the way. The excellent use of Philadelphia locales and sets of hell creates a gothic sense of tragedy, and two people get to the wrong place in time. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis avoids his macho image and depicts a real psycho who is right all this will happen. He’s actually sane, but the people of the future (or the present, if you will) distort this guy’s head so badly during time travel that it’s not surprising that he is unraveling. He was sent to World War I right after Beng was sent the wrong year to find out how the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is coping with the destruction of civilization as we know it. They finally understood everything correctly, and in a truly wonderful script corresponding to the performance, we will see Willis, Madeleine Stowe and the sinister Brad Pitt, who are cross-referenced for 6 years. <br /> <br /> Stowe is sensual and hard as a risky psychotherapist, who gradually begins to realize that Willis may not be as upset as it seems. The exciting element of the relationship between her and Willis is their feeling of “seeing” each other earlier, in another place or time. 12 Monkeys are, in essence, time and madness, in which futuristic people and present times are plunged, when murderers and a psychotic genius can change the world. <br /> <br /> The pensive city of Philadelphia is a dark and gothic backdrop for the disaster of Willis to complete his mission, which, despite all the usual Hollywood stereotypes, does NOT save the world. He collects information. The film also makes fun of the viewer, putting Willis in a new setting by a pin drop. It must have been an extremely complex picture, but Gilliam seems to be a master of making films hard-boiled. He even falls into humor, reminiscent of other great works, such as TIME BANDITS and BRAZIL. The screen is the canvas of this man, and he knows how to draw a sometimes horrifying picture of the world and its possible future in the mainstream atmosphere of high-budget films. If you want sincere madness and ironic tragedy, see 12 MARKIROV. <br /> <br /> RATING: 9 out of 10
