The long-standing prison, which has been closed for more than 20 years, is reopened, and Ethan Sharp (the late, great character actor Lane Smith), once a guard, was appointed as a warder. When prisoners are sent to work to put this place in order, they are ordered to enter the old execution room. This releases a violent spirit that mercilessly damages both the guards and the prisoners; Steep as can be restrained prisoner Burke (Viggo Mortensen, demonstrating the real balance in the early role) is in the role of a hero. <br /> <br /> I know I praise the film for its atmosphere (it was filmed in an actual abandoned prison near Rawlins, Wyoming), but it raises this horror film to a higher level. He has a wonderful hunch, created from the very beginning. Director Renny Harlin did his fourth directorial work here; He received him as a director of Nightmare on Elm Street 4 and actually began an impressive career in mainstream action films, thrillers and horror films. <br /> <br /> He may have standard characters, but he has an apt composition to bring them to life: Chelsea Field - a young woman fighting for prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick - a tired veteran convict Creuse, Tom Everett - restless the crook Rabbit, Ivan Kane - the outgoing lasagna, Tommy "Little" Lister - the quiet giant Tini, and Arlen Dean Snyder in the role of captain Horton. It is also worth noting the early role of Kane Hodder (as a vengeful spirit), who helped him play Jason Voorhe in the Friday 13th series. <br /> <br /> Worthy special effects Capricious lighting thanks to the prolific genre of cinematographer Mac Alberg, the terrible music of Richard Band and Christopher Stone, great visual effects, an incredibly gloomy location and a generally flashy and rich presentation help make it quite interesting. It's terrible, disgusting and fun for a horror fan. <br /> <br /> 8/10
