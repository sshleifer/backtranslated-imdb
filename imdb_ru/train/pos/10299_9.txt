I'm a very big fan of Jim Carrey. I laughed at my ass during a liar, a liar and Ace Ventura. I also love him in his serious films, especially the Truman Show. It's a cross between his VERY funny side and his serious side. He is, of course, VERY funny in this film, but there are parts that are very serious and he copes with it with great ease. he is truly a multifunctional actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, I was pleased with the play of Jennifer Aniston. I think she is more than just a pair of beautiful boobs and a great ass. Morgan Freeman makes a VERY cool God. As for Stephen Carell, his limited scenes are VERY fun, especially in the anchor scene. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would rate it 9. A good game, a funny script and some very serious situations make this a very good movie.
