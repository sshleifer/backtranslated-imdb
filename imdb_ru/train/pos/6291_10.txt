Well, now it was definitely an unexpected episode. In this anthological sci-fi series with all these "Alien creatures", "Unusual Incidents" and a lot of "Brushes with a Future Life" this episode will certainly be assessed as unusual. His seemingly insignificant adjustments, apparently, do not introduce any morale at the end of the story. Or that? It starts with the Silent Movie form, without a recorded dialogue, but with musical accompaniment. In this case, we are talking about the sound track, without the use of an organ or piano playing by a local musician. In this part of the episode, along with the final section, the title cards were also widely used, as in the “Old Time Films”. While these Titles are a bit exaggerated and exaggerated, they are made so intentionally and with love, and not with contempt for the Silent Film. <br /> <br /> A veteran comedy director, Norman Z. Mcleod, was the man in the chair for this half-hour installment plan. He directed many of the greatest comedies of all time, in which people such as the Marx brothers, V.S. Fields, Harold Lloyd and Danny Kay. He was not a stranger to television, since he did a great job on the television series. <br /> <br /> It seems that he and Mr. Keaton have never worked together before (since I cannot find any evidence of this), “but judging by the outcome of the film, they succeeded in this with the help of flying colors! Anyone who led Keaton knew that Buster was also a good comedy director and comedy player. Behind the camera, he was as comfortable as in front of her. Their short partnership had to be harmonious with the principle of “come on and take” on how to do something. Obviously, many of the gags were Keaton, resurrected from his days of Silent Picture. For example, the gag was put on a pair of pants with the help of Rollo (Stanley Adams' help was made by Keaton and Roscoe Fat Man by Arbuckle in one of Arbuckle-2 Reelers, THE GARAGE (1919). It was a vivid example of his mastery in two words. /> <br /> Buster knew that we were shooting our world with a camera, giving him a two-dimensional image. This fact underlies many intruders. This is the cardinal's rule for his filming. <br /> <br /> The cast was small, and once again just jam-packed with veteran talent. Stanley Adams was Rollo and served as a direct Mr. Keaton's man. Jessie White, an old Maytag Repairman, ran a Repair It store that corrected Time HJelmet. Gil Lamb, the serene veteran of the short RKO series, was a policeman from the 1890s. James Flavin, George E. Stone , Harry Fleur, Warren Parker and Milton Parsons rounded this mostly silent cast. <br /> <br /> Without spilling the beans, let's just say yes, maybe there is a lesson here. If it were not for the one that had already been mentioned: “The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence!” And then like: “Be careful what you ask for, because you can just get it!”
