I had the honor of watching Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a powerful and touching story! Holly is a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl who was sold by her family to prostitution and lives in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (American) comes into the life of Holly and decides that he wants to help her. When Holly is on sale again, Patrick is desperately looking for her. We follow their difficult journey through Cambodia and look forward to their reunion. <br /> <br /> Holly is one of the millions of children who are sold and sold every day. The film depicts this complex problem, without crossing the line. I left, wanting to learn more about the problem of trafficking in children, and asked, how can I help? This film should be watched by everyone, because this is a beautiful story, and there is a problem in it that we should no longer ignore.
