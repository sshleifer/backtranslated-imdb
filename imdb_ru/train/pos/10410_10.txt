The thief of Baghdad is one of the ten my favorite movies in history. It is exciting without blood, it is beautifully filmed, and the artistic direction is impeccable. Casting could not be better. Rex Ingram made me believe in jinn. And the embodiment of evil is certainly captured by Conrad Weit as Jafar. He set the bar very high. <br /> <br /> .. I watch this film at least twice a year ... and never get tired of it. This film is an adventure for all ages .. no one is too old to enjoy it. The thief of Baghdad pushes my memories to a more innocent time ... I was ten years old when I first saw this, and the United States was just about to enter World War II. Konrad Fiet was such a great actor that he was able to continue this fundamental "anger" a few years later in "Casablanca." And Korda teamed up, I believe, with Justin and Dupree again in “Four Feathers” ... great filmmaking!
