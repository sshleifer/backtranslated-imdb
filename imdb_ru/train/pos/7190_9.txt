The best of the Zorro series and one of my favorite TV shows, period. This is the period established immediately after the birth of Mexico. The new nation is counting on gold produced by this one city in order to preserve the solvency of the republic. However, the golden god, Don del Oro, excites the Indians and steals the gold for himself. His Zorro and his group of people to the rescue. Reed Hadley is the victorious Zorro, and he cuts a bright figure when he gets a good selection of notes (most of which were reused in later Zorro TV shows, as well as in other TV shows). The story is moving, and it is pleasantly not clear who the real bad guy is. There is a reason why I saw this most of all the TV shows I've seen, it's just a great action adventure. The only thing with which I can compare it is the Sign of Zorro with Tyrone Power or one of the other scammers of that period. It is super and highly recommended.
