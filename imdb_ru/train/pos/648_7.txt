I decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site. I would say it was worth the effort. However, you must take into account that this film will last 210 minutes. If you don't have a holding power, tape it down and look for a couple of nights. <br /> <br /> Now about the film, what I’ll say, will contain “spoilers”, and if there is no mind, like this: <br /> <br /> Alexander is an indiscriminate bum, womanizer and gigolo. He lives with an elderly woman named Marie. Marie owns a retail store, and she provides Alex. Alex spends his days in cafes and restaurants. History shows that Alex had previously infused Gilbert, with whom he lived. Gilberta left him for a less attractive man she didn’t like because Alex insulted her. At this point, Alex was ready to get a job and help raise his child before he learned that Gilberte interrupted him and planned to marry someone else. <br /> <br /> Alexander accidentally met a nymph named Veronica, and they struck up a relationship. Veronica fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the dirty sex she had with men in the past. Marie and Veronica are fighting for Alex's affection, and they had a supply of money. Finally, in the end, it turns out that Veronica is pregnant with Alex's child, and Alex asked her to marry him. We assume (as already mentioned in the situation with Gilbert), Alexander will even get a job and become a supplier of his new love and family. There is hope! <br /> <br /> With the title “La Maman et la putain” I understand that Jean Eustace was related to the character of Veronica Francoise Lebrun. She was a whore, and then she became a mother. So mother and whore is the same person? Anyway, what I know! French films are mostly (not all) very talkative, aimlessly politicized, preaching, theatrical, tasteless, mourning and full of quotes. Lebrun and Leod played their stubborn characters well and kept the film together, as some of the script became a bit lost and disconnected. <br /> <br /> Not a bad effort. 7/10.
