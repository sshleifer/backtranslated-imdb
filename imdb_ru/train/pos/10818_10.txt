Why does it have such a low rating? I really do not understand ... Is it because of a bad game? Bad dialogue? Well, who cares about these things in low-cost cheese horror films? Seriously, the game and the dialogue are not important in those films. People who hate movies just because of bad games and bad communication should not be allowed to rate stupid low-budget films. These films should not be taken seriously. Period. <br /> <br /> Anyway, time to talk about the film, right? Well, I loved it! I bought it because I was expecting Gorefest, but this is not GoreFest, and the blood is rather bad (in most cases it’s just animal guts on the body of actors, and it is lame), but I didn’t care because the movie was funny The characters are funny, the actors are funny (bad acting is a GOOD thing in low-budget cheese horror films), the dialogue is cheerful (bad dialogue is a good thing in low-cost cheese horror films) would go on and on, but I don’t want to talk too much ... BUT I have to mention that there is a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll as if lol are alive! Yes, and the zombie rapist falls in love with a sex doll. Lol! <br /> <br /> The best lines in the film: <br /> <br /> Detective style: * sniffing Coke * Detective Sloan: What is the horn? * are you doing, manners? What the hell are you snorting? What the heck is that? Detective Manners: Nothing, man, this is ... Ehh ... cold medicine ... <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * injects heroin into hand * Detective Sloan: What do you write? Behavior? Are you * beep * crazy? Detective Manners: This is cold medicine. <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * constantly kicks a random guy in the face * Detective Sloan: What the hell is going on, Manners? What are you doing? Detective Manners: This maniac roamed demons, and then began to smash his head on a stone! He just started smashing his head against a stone! I think he is on the PCP or something else! <br /> <br /> lol!
