*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** After two such walks (“Magnum Force” and “Enforcer”), Dirty Harry seems to have regained his step in “Sudden Impact”, an exciting thriller that wisely uses his strengths: to the charisma of Clint Eastwood, who also directed, and the story, which spends enough time on exposure and reserves its energy for large scenes. <br /> <br /> This time it comes to Harry outside of his native San Francisco (where he again has problems with his superiors because of his “shoot first, then ask questions” tactics) in the village of São Paulo. There (WARNING: a potential spoiler) a group of scum are killed, one at a time, by one woman whom they raped years before, and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia since the attack. /> <br /> Sondra Locke is a murderer, and she makes the character Jennifer Spencer an interesting mixture of compassion and composure. Locke's cold eyes and cold voice, when they try to console their hospitalized sister or take revenge on the rapists, very effectively draw a portrait of an unjust woman whose years of suffering and anger are now beginning to bear deadly rewards. <Br /> <br /> The rapists are a disgusting party, especially a leader who has a “psycho-nutty” almost trampled on his forehead, and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys, despite her anatomical inability to participate. The footage from the memories, although not graphically explicit, is nightmarish enough and clearly designed to get viewers to support Jennifer when she kills her attackers. <br /> <br /> Some people believe that “Sudden Impact” is rubbish: a thoughtless manipulative story of revenge. At a certain level, this is true, but it is well-made trash. What works to the benefit of the film is the power of Sondra Locke’s performance, giving us a complex character whose wounds are more noticeable in her paintings than in her gestures or speech. Here we have an action movie from the point of view. <br /> <br /> You can accept or abandon the idea that some misdemeanors deserve punishment by any means necessary, but since the mystery behind the murders becomes clear to Harry (the realization that, wisely, is not spelled out in dialogue) , he is given the choice of what to do with the murderer, whose motives he can sympathize with, but with the behavior of which he should not be tolerated by law. This makes the story more interesting than the usual “Dirty Harry”. <br /> <br /> Another atoning film quality is Eastwood's direction. After all, this is the movie “Dirty Harry,” and Eastwood knows him better than anyone else. The film is directed with style and wit, and edited to give the action scenes a big return. Here are some of the best "Harry moments" in the entire series, including Harry's most famous line "Come on, make my day." <br /> <br /> “Sudden Impact” is a film that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a story about a heinous crime and subsequent violent consequences. It is also an exciting detective story, well done and well told. And this, of course, is never boring. By these criteria it is very successful.
