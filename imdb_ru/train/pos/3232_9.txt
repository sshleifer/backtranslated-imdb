I went to see this Finnish film, and I must say that this is one of the best films I have seen this year. The intrigue consists of 5-6 different stories taking place on the same day in a small Finnish town. In the end, the stories add up very well, recalling perhaps a little about how Tarantino films are made. Most of the actors played very well, which is probably necessary in realistic dramas of this type. I especially liked the game of Sanna Hietala, the leading actress and Juha Kukkonen. By the way, I noticed that IMDB received incorrect information about Sanna. Her name, as you can see in my review;), this is not Heikkil√§, but Hietala.
