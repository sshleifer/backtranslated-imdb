A young woman who is a successful model and also engaged and who twice tried to commit suicide in the past was chosen by a secretive and distant association of Catholic priests to become the next “guardian” for the gate to hell, which apparently through the creepy old but well-kept apartment building of Brooklyn. Its tenants climb the stairs and can reincarnate, but apparently can not run away while the guard is there to block the way. The previous one (John Carradine) is about death, so she, fate or something else, will be next, and the doomed should make her kill themselves so that they are free. Lots of interesting details lie beneath the surface, her relationship with her father, stories about the doomed, her fiancé, so you can give it a cheap horror of exploitation, but considering the sets, the great cast and the overall level of quirkiness, it is definitely worth seeing.
