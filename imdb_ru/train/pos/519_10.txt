I first saw this film about 20 years ago and never forgot it. It is beautifully filmed, and the story keeps one riveted for all the time. It is hard to believe that this was done in 1946, since today the story is still fresh and really makes you think. I am not very well versed in the technique of the film, but the special effects in this film are amazing, considering when it was done. In addition, the acting is great, and the use of English and American actors is quite amazing. I recently bought a DVD, so now I can watch it whenever I want. I highly recommend anyone interested in post-war British films to watch this.
