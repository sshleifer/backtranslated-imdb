I just watched it recently on the Sundance channel. The idea of ​​the film was to attract many filmmakers, prominent figures of their country, to create short films, eleven of them, in one film, concentrating on only one plot: September 11. <br /> <br /> Of the game In this film I could tell why these directors were great in their own country, because it contained all the elements of a great movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a film from Iran, in which the teacher tries to teach students what happened on September 11, which they will not learn about later. <br /> <br /> The second film from France tells about a deaf woman who angrily writes a letter to her lover, not knowing what is happening with the TV. is playing. <br /> <br /> In the next film from Egypt, the director himself speaks with the dead soldier about the latest events not only about the terrorists of September 11, but also about explosions in other places. <br /> <br /> Then she comes from Bolivia, where she learns about the events of September 11 and believes that they should follow them. <br /> <br /> The next one is from the country of Africa, in which a group of boys follows a man whom they consider to be Bin Laden. <br /> <br /> The next one is from Mexico, which shows nothing but the sounds of that day. <br /> <br /> The next one is from Israel, when a reporter tried to get to the site of the bomb blast, but he was often told about the attacks. <br /> <br /> There are other films that I can not remember at the moment, but they are all strong. It will bring back your emotions from that day. <br /> <br /> 10/10
