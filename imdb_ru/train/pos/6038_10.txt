But on the contrary, I'm sorry, mate, I fully understand how you can be drawn into the film, because you have a relation to the topic (and you have one). This film is terrible, the main character would make any Charlie Brown Subtitler run for his money, he just constantly mutters that he is always laughing, most of the scenes just feel uncomfortable with the characters more often than not look at each other with a look .. Now, then I will respond. Best British comedy? Please, buddy, say your strong bad self ... at the end of the day ... the sun sets ... and this film is terrible. I mean well done for the people involved ... they made a film ... and maybe motorcycle enthusiasts might be in it, but people who still live here on earth with a real sense of humor will fight it more, how to smile the Christmas present they hired, bought them ... was it too harsh? I'm sorry...
