I first watched this film several years ago and continued to watch it several times a year when I have this opportunity. It's on my list of favorite movies along with some of the classics. If someone tells you it's stupid or outdated, ignore them ... this film is for those who love to laugh and listen to music. Dancing is not as important in this film as in other Aster films, so comedy and acting skills shine through. Watch this movie, if you can, it can be easy, but it is still completely funny. So I know that many people hate black and white films, they think that old films cannot be funny, this film should make them change their mind. No one I know can watch this movie without being slightly surprised. The only problem with the film: Fred Aster sings without dancing. He can be a great performer and capable singer, but it’s just not fun and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. The comedy from time to time becomes a bit of a cliche, but the serene performances of G burns and G Allen are just perfect for the play and can satisfy anyone looking for an easy laugh. Give this movie a chance, even if you don’t like old movies, this movie may like the ridiculous in any.
