This is one of the movies that doesnâ€™t require any thoughts or thoughts, this is a very fun time that you forgot for the next hour or so. I was very surprised at how John Abraham played, he usually played a gangster-like character with an impassive face, so he plays the exact opposite and does it successfully, managing to shine among comic geniuses such as Paresh Raval and Akshay Kumar. I was also quite surprised by the three Akshay girls, because the roles do not require a lot of talent, but mostly moaning about the disappearance of Akshay (in front of other girls), I was surprised when they managed to establish an identity, and you could tell them apart, Also, most of the songs are good, they are colorful and fun, so on a boring Sunday evening it will surely cheer you up.
