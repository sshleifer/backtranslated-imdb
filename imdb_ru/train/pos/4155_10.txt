What a terrific episode for this beautiful show. This is television perfection at its best. The story takes place in 1968, and it is beautifully filmed in black and white, almost noir-style with deep shadows and vivid images. This is a story about two men in love, but I do not want to spoil it. This is a rare account of what homosexuals encountered in America in the 1960s. The author of the magnificent Tom Pettit and the director of the great Jeannot Schwartz, we move through their lives, their love for each other and their tragedy. The adoption of such a delicate issue makes this episode even more stunning. Our emotions are as torn and tense as the characters. A chill ran through my spine at the end when they played the gorgeous Bob Dylan: “Ah, but then I was much older, I'm younger now,” Byrds sang. This one goes far beyond 10 and all the way to the stars. Beautiful.
