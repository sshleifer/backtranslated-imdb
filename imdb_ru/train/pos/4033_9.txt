Many of the reviewers noted that Pinjar does not look like a TV series filmed in Bollywood. While this is true, Bollywood films are generally targeted at a specific audience, and should be appreciated for achieving their goals in this regard. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Pinjar is a great movie for those who are looking for differences from the ordinary. Bollywood film based on the equation. Established during the Separation between India and Pakistan, Pinjar focuses on the Punjabi girl, who becomes a victim of social and cultural attitudes towards the treatment of women in her time. Paro, the protagonist, is forced to choose between living with the man who kidnapped her and his fleeting hope of living with her family in the Indian Punjab. More than the problem of Hindus and Muslims, Pinjar views and defines the role of a woman as a daughter, as a wife, and as a mother in India and Pakistan in 1947. Unlike typical Bollywood films, which are by nature escapist, Pinjar is a film that forces its audience to think about these issues during and after the film.
