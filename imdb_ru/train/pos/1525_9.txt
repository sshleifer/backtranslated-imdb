Having recently seen Peter O'Toole’s version, I was ready to be surprised at the clever letter in this version. Little time is spent on the fighting that I prefer. Instead, we are shown all the numerous motives underlying both French and English (who held Normandy) politicians and priests who kill her. Even the worst hypocrite of all, the archbishop, leaves us with the thought that “Of course she was innocent. The innocents must always suffer for the mighty ambitions. She had no idea what she was talking about, she had no idea about the consequences of blasphemy or hooliganism against the church. Without education, she had no idea about the position of the church in such matters. <br /> <br /> Preminger was true to the myths associated with her death, and I appreciated her preview on the tape, which showed how the flame rises and burns it. What for? They used gas jets in the film, and 2 of them were stopped. Suddenly, the air pressure blew a halt, and the flames jumped straight at her. Luckily for her, they should not have repeated the shot, as it was SO realistic: she was burned !! Quite a traumatic acquaintance of an Iowa girl with her new acting career. <br /> <br /> John Gilgud was great. He is an English politician who organizes the show. He also stresses that as soon as you condemn someone to death, you do not want to be there and watch them die. Next time you can evade your “duty” ... not that such delicacies bother the soul of our future president. We Christians, even the most anti-Semitic, have no problem retreating from the Old Testament when it comes to the death penalty, although it was rejected by the words of Jesus. Bring public executions like this little girl. The sense of smell of burned flesh can bring us around to our respectable people. <br /> <br /> The only small “choice” I have regarding this film is that we are not shown why the priest who so adamantly urged her to burn becomes so sudden, so crushed, even to madness . There should have been more expansion of his character, more dialogue - since a sudden “coming to life” does not make sense. <br /> <br /> And whether Graham Green consciously or not makes it so, Saint Joan is such a self-confident little upstart, you are almost, but not quite happy that she meets her rebirth. And when she gave up life in prison, I somehow thought about Anna Sexton, the poet who accused Sylvia Plath of “stealing her death” when she committed suicide ... knowing that such an action guarantees immortality. You must be surprised !! <br /> <br /> If ever there was a good example of intrusive thoughts and logic-tight compartments, this is one of them. St. Joan was to become a Buddhist and calm "voices in her mind."
