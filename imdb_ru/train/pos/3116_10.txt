The last part of the action movie franchise is perhaps the hardest hit of the three films. This goes on to play the anti-Bond theme. Born doesn't like what he does, and he wants to know about his blurry past. Everything connected with this film hits the target, from cinematography to choreography / stunts, from script to acting. <br /> <br /> The film begins in noise when Born flees the Moscow police. The story seems to start where the first film ended. Or that? Time is a bit confusing here, but we understand that Born remembers things. A sudden memory, when he tries to wash himself, almost took him by surprise, but he does it and does not kill anyone. They are not his goal. From there we get more intrigue of his past with the new player Noah Vossen, who seems to know everything about Borne and will defend him at any cost. Pamela Landy returned the same way as Nicky Parsons, who also seems to have had past experiences with Born. <br /> <br /> Cinematography in your face follows almost everything. The pursuit of a car is even more intense, if it seems possible, than from the first two. And the veteran cast pursuing Born is great with Albert Finney playing well. It also has little political wrappers in regard to execution and other government policies, but it is marginal and very well integrated into the plot. Overall, this is the best of the findings of the trilogy this year, if not the best action trilogy in history.
