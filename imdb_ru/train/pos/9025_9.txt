The film belongs to the genre Inventor - Underdog. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a little acting joy to the story with a few standard elements. Well shot, well edited, with a lot of well-played background roles. <br /> <br /> Some consider this film to be classic American hockey. This is both. I agree with those who say: "The film celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration." <br /> <br /> The film is a pleasant reminder that achievement can be born from simple roots. <br /> <br />
