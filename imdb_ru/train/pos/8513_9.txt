I always had a philosophy that each person has different tastes, I found this film amazing, and I think that every college student can agree with me. Despite this, this is not a “movie with a plot,” but about real guys and some of the “problems” they face. I found the movie funny (especially the parts in which they played practical jokes with each other). Simply put, if you are in the same “wavelength” as these people, you will find this film amazing. I do not think that this will bring victory to the Golden Globes or the Oscars, or that the people in this film will become future Hollywood stars, but this is a kind of “cult classic” among young people who may be related to their experience. For me, the guy who stands out most is Hans: a Scandinavian guy who, he says, is “not a caretaker,” but gets all (or some) chicks. "Little People" also play a big role in the film, especially when they are drunk. If I continue, I could provide a spoiler, and I do not want to do this, just go and get a movie, and you will not regret it. I give it 8/10
