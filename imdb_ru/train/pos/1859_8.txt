In his directorial debut, Denzel Washington takes a true story, which also turns out to be very complex, and displays it with the honesty that we used to expect from the actions of Washington, but now we see this touch as a director. <br /> <br /> Recently we saw some disastrous results of children who broke through the cracks of public protection. This story tells of a nightmarish existence that leaves terrible scars, but ultimately testifies to the victory of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> We can solve some problems with the first efforts due to too many close-ups, and not from the best editing of these scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes that project such a force cannot be understated. <br /> <br /> If the academy misses this film, it will be a parody. This film does not give any blows and goes to the cold harsh facts of the story with purity, which usually does not go beyond the scope of the novel on the screen. This, of course, a tribute to the director. <br /> <br /> This is a dandy, so go and tell your friends too!
