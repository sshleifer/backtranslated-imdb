I think that this film will only work for people who have all been turned off by the giant deceit of the Lord of the Rings. Well, that was it. And so I really love this movie. I especially like all these flawless LotR superheroes who parody so beautifully and disrespectfully. The most brilliant is the analogue of Gandalf (a brave, wise and completely unhappy all-knowing wizard): Almandi, cowardice and dead transvestite. Sauron's colleague (of course, “Sauraus” from East Germany) in the helmet is just a bucket with eye holes. Aragorn's alter ego is another idiot prone to accidents who is trying to fix his broken sword (Ulrike's legend) with scotch tape. And “Strunzdumm” (analogue of Wormtong) is really very much like Brad Dourif! And don't forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... yeah
