This film was shown in a very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I watch this film, I donâ€™t think about this wonderful series. I think it was a surprisingly good horror movie from the early 40s, with a very surprisingly good sound and picture for a 67-year-old public horror movie. I really liked to watch White Lugoshi and his strange staff, including his wife, who needs liquid from the glands of young potential brides, the old witch and her two strange sons, one is a giant idiot, the other is a comedic dwarf (Angelo Rossitto). from the 1932s freaks). I also liked the brave young female reporter, which is a kind of stereotype, but still interesting to watch. My only problem with this otherwise decent movie is its plot, even funny and unbelievable for a movie. I do not want to spoil this film, so go out and rent it, or, even better, buy it for a couple of bucks.
