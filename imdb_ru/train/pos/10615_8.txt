The invisible is done in a style more like old Hollywood puzzles than horror shows. The film is somewhat slow, but the set of bizarre images makes the film alive and watchable. The main idea of ​​young girls pursued by something in the basement, an old but good acting and production make the film worth seeing. The film is known for its emotional impact and, of course, not obvious actions or special effects. I rated it as 8 out of 10.
