I, of course, am glad that the film was made about the amazing life story of Karl Brashir. Being the way it was in the era of civil rights, Brashear became a source of inspiration for people of all minority groups who did not want to accept the expected status. <br /> <br /> Brashear performed by Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an example in the behavior of life he chose. Very similar to Jackie Robinson, who integrated baseball and made him stick to his character and behavior. Like Brashear, Gooding knows that he does not want the life that his father Karl Lumbly shares, and Lumbly makes it clear what can be learned from life more than he has received. <br /> <br /> But while Harry Truman integrated the Armed Services after World War II, the navy still has its limitations. A black can only be a cook or an officer-officer, in real combat units he is denied. This is not enough for Gooding, who claims to become a deep-sea diver of the navy. <br /> <br /> Once in a scuba diving school in Bayonne, New Jersey, Gooding throws everything at him, mainly by a senior senior officer. responsible, Robert De Niro. DeNiro may have some prejudice, but he is nonetheless a hero and one who can inspire, if he succeeds in overcoming racial differences. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. Of course, they come from different places, but, having recognized each other, both are “Honest people.” <br /> <br /> Other good performances are worth noting: Charlize Theron as the wife of De Niro and Hal Holbrook as the leader of the diving school, a guy whom the Navy would simply like to retire for reasons you see. <br /> <br /> Men Of Honor is an inspiring story about people who have the courage and the ability to change.
