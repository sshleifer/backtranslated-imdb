A typical clausen film, but again not typical. Clausen writes, directs and plays a leading role. This is really a great movie about normal people leading a normal life and trying to make the most of it. The 4 main actors were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Fritz Helmut was convincing. You believe that he is really sick. <br /> <br /> Sonya Richter plays the nurse, who is really an actor, but it turns out she is the best nurse who cares for the old man. <br /> <Everyone has problems, and those in whom no one believes, eventually become happy. But nothing good comes easy; they have to fight to win their life and love.
