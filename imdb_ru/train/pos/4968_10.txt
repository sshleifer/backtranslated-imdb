The game of Diego Armando Maradona was and remains the best player. Not just an athlete, but an artist. This documentary film that the 1986 World Cup will forever remain in the memory of every football fan around the world. Because of his huge and incredible goal, which he scored against my own country (England). There is absolutely no point in reducing this star. Although I do not understand and do not speak Spanish, I can appreciate the Argentine narrator. He is actually crying from happiness and can barely express his emotions ... Everything I wrote may be meaningless and difficult to understand, but readers ... You have to look at it to understand what I mean.
