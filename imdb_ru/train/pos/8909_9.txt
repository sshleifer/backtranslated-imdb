This is quite famous, so I will not go into details. The main story is about two teenagers who learn about the mucous lump of an alien that arrives on Earth through a meteorite. Human contact with this ball of mucus burns through the flesh like acid. It also absorbs human bodies, increasing it. No one believes teenagers (Steve McQueen and his girlfriend), and when they finally do it, it seems that the drop can not be stopped. It's really well done for its age, and unlike many other films from the 50s, the pace is pretty fast. This story is very unique, and it must be seen by any fan of old science fiction and monster films. If you can dig up the sticky blood of the horrors of the 80s, be sure to check out the 88th remake.
