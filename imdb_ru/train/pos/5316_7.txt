This is the second film that I saw about Ida Lupino as a director after the 53rd hitchhiker. I think this film was better than that. This one has a girlfriend who is going to get married, and then she is sexually abused, and she doesn’t like it when everyone is watching and talking about her, so she runs away and is taken away by her family. I think that Leonard Maltin’s review is right, only to give him 2 and 1/2 stars.
