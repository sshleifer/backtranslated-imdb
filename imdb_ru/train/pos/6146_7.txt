Disney might have hoped for another Mary Poppins, but that’s another story, and while Angela is amazing, she was a completely different singer, the great Julie Andrews. Having said that Lansbury is perfectly thrown and gives a magical performance. There is something amazing about her character, and David Tomlinson gives her wonderful support. Tomilinson can carry a melody, but he is certainly not as good as a singer. It doesn't matter that he was such a talented actor that you barely noticed. There are some wonderful cameos from very beloved stars of another time, such as Roddy McDowell, who gives a winning performance, and very beloved Tessie Osh, who does very little, but it's nice to see the old maid again. It's also nice to see Sam Jaffe and Bruce Forsyth's King of English Television in small roles. There are a couple of beautiful songs in the score, especially “The Salty Sea” and “The Epoch of Mistrust.” A large number of Portabello Road stretched to the limit, but it has a lot of theatricality. The effects today look a little cliche, but the scene with the German invaders attacked by the wildest army in the film is quite impressive. Children are not as annoying as other films, but it’s hard to understand what the younger boy says. I loved the home army march song. Home security was very important for Britain, and it is a hot homage. The animation is amazing, much better than Pixar, which I find grotesque. Warm happy film, and this is a miracle, it was not made on stage.
