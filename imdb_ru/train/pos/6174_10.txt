Unfortunately, most people outside Canada believe that the only thing Canada produces is snow, mountains and hockey players. This film is the second excellent Canadian film that I have seen over the past few weeks (the first one was “The Red Violin”) is much better than all but the best Hollywood works. <br /> <br /> Gustad Noble is not at all; In the 1970s, he was an older employee of Parsi Bank in Bombay. This film delicately examines the various things that happen to him concerning his family, his friends and his work, and their influence on him. At the same time, it is a fascinating and, I would say, accurate picture of the urban life of the middle class in India at that time. <br /> <br /> However, I was somewhat ready for this, having read the book of Rohinton Mistry several years ago. The film, as one would expect, cannot cover all the difficulties of the book, but if you want to read a really good book, to see a really good film, read and watch “Such a Long Journey.”
