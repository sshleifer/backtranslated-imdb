I think this film is very funny and terrible. I love Elvira and I love this movie. It is a pity that the second part of this wonderful film was not successful, because it is very funny, as the first part. I also regret that, apart from this film, I have not seen Cassandra Peterson in other films. I think she is an amazing actress with a lot of ... potential. I hope that I will see her in the future in the third part of the adventures of Elvira. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedians. Cassandra, if you read this, know that you are the best, and my heart will be with you. You can rely on me. What else can I add? This is a cool and cool movie!
