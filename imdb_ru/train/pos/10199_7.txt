As a child I loved this game. In the spring of 1993, I played it a million times with my friend Andrew. I used to play Axel or Blaise, and he was Adam, and no matter how often we played, we were never bored. Then the Streets of Fury 2 came out. And we quickly forgot that this one existed at all. <br /> <br /> You play as ex-cops of Axel Stone, Adam or Blaise Fielding, who left the army to defeat the bad guys in their own way. In a ruined and ruined city, led by the evil Mr. X, there are 8 levels. Beating all the bad guys and the boss at the end of the level is a lot of fun. Level 4 (Bridge) was my favorite, because you could hide the villains in the pits in the river. You even have a chance to become Mr. X’s right hand at the end of the game (for a price). This leads to a “bad end” in which you become the head of the syndicate. Exactly how it is possible is a mystery, since you are destroying the syndicate on the way to Mr. X, but never mind. <br /> <br /> Fury Streets also have really fantastic music. The composer Yuzo Koshiro performed absolute miracles with limited technology Sega Genesis. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are outstanding melodies. <br /> <br /> As the owner of the Wii, I am proud that it is forever on my console. But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it makes the first look somewhat obsolete. <br /> <br /> Pros: <br /> <br /> Average graphics, but good backgrounds are presented in the form of comics, such as a progression panel that matches the tone of the game. <br /> <br /> Great melodies. <br /> <br /> Easy to enter and hard to put down. <br /> <br /> Cons: <br /> Significantly inferior to infinitely more complex streets of Fury 2. <br /> <br /> Poor enemy AI. Villains often leave you instead of engaging in battle. This is especially infuriating boss level 5. <br /> <br /> Lack of combo moves. <br /> <br /> Lack of decent weapons. <br /> <br /> Models of bad guys are repeated far too often. <br /> <br /> Graphics B- Sound A- Gameplay B- Continuous Attraction B-
