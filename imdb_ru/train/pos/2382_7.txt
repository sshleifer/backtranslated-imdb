For a long time, the Menagerie was my favorite episode of Star Trek, although in recent years it was eclipsed by The City on the Edge of Eternity. What I used to prefer in the Menagerie is that it is a more ill-fated Star Trek with this fascinating background to the current storyline. I still think it's pretty brilliant how Gene Roddenberry included the original pilot in a two-part episode. While the “new” part of the story is pretty much an excuse for Kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea that Spock will be a military court is smart. You can punch holes in the plot if you want. For example, given the Talosian mind control skills and the state of Captain Pike, why is it even necessary to physically return Pike to your planet? There are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez. It is better not to think too much about the details and just enjoy only two ST participants.
