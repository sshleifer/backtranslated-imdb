Time was not kind to this film. Once a controversial adaptation of bestseller Jeffrey Convitz, now this film looks just like a regular version of your typical ghost. Terrible touches aside (especially crazy, over the final final), this is essentially a glossy horror film for those people who are not indifferent to the genre. He has an unusual cast in small roles (Jos√© Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others), but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive cast to convince the audience that this is not your usual low-cine film (the producers of films about the disasters of the 70s had a similar idea). I liked to see familiar faces, but the story is very stupid, and no matter how high-class the film claims to be the title, it works on the level of your regular 70s movie (though not quite bad). Nevertheless, this is a pleasant film, especially for those viewers who like to watch the stars. As usual, Albert Whitlock's matte work is outstanding. Overall, quite interesting.
