Wooden Horse was one of the first "great" escape stories from World War II, telling the true story of Eric Williams and others when they fled from Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943. I really like this film, but I had it on VHS from Amazon in England and transfer it from PAL format to USA. I read a book when I was in high school after watching a part of the movie in the early 60s on television. A mocking drama about how Peter and John tried to escape from Germany during the war more realistically than the escape route depicted in the Great Escape. This film is a lost treasure that should become more accessible to the American audience.
