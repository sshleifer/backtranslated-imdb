A trio of buddies, sergeants, all in the British army, run and quarrel in Imperial India. Extremely loyal to each other, they face their biggest and most deadly problem when they face the rebirth of a disgusting cult and its insane, uncompromising guru. Now they have to rely on the youngest servant of the regiment, the water carrier Gunga Din, to save many of the Queen’s soldiers from a certain slaughterhouse. <br /> <br /> Based more on The Three Musketeers than on Kipling’s classic poem, this remarkable adventure epic is a worthy entry in the Hollywood golden year of 1939. Filled with tension and humor, keeping romantic breaks to a minimum, it captures the interest of the viewer and holds him down to (sentimental) conclusion. <br /> <br /> Discussing the nuances of performing the three stars, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., is almost useless, because they really represent all thirds of a single organism - inseparable . However, this does not detract from the great pleasure of simply observing their magnificent time. <br /> <br /> (It is interesting to note in brackets that McLaglen boasted an outstanding military career in the First World War; a record in the Second World War is mainly in secret affairs and earning at least 4 honorary knights after the conflict, While Grant was reportedly working undercover in British intelligence, watching Hollywood Nazi supporters.) <br /> <br /> The real cast of the actors should be Sam Jaffe, heartbreaking. He inspires a humble person with radiant dignity and tremendous courage, causing the last line of Kipling's poem to ring true. He is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Montague Love is considered to be a strong colonel, while Eduardo Channelneli is the embodiment of evil, as the guru of the Bandits. The rest of the actors, Joan Fontaine, Robert Kut, Lumsden Hare, are effective, but they can do little. Movie lovers will recognize Cecil Kellawei in the tiny role of Miss Fontaine’s father. <br /> <br /> The villains are clearly visible in the film. The demonic cult of the Bandits, who worship the abominable, soaked in the blood of Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction, was the curse of Indian life for 6 centuries, ritualistically stifling up to 30,000 victims a year. In 1840, the British military, in cooperation with a number of princely states, eventually managed to suppress religion. From now on it will remain the material of novels and nightmares.
