Apart from some dubious actions (there are musicians at the end of the day), this, according to Quentin Tarrinno, sounds like: “The best rock film ever made ... period”. without rap - a young musician trying to prove himself in front of the local community, while struggling to cope with a broken home and a rival group. Add a sexual interest and truly exceptional performances, this is a real 8-mile. <br /> <br /> Prince provides solid work, as does Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Decent script, good leadership, excellent plot and spectacular performances. Not forgetting some of the best rock / pop / funk music you've ever heard.
