EA showed us that they can make the classic 007 agent and make you feel in the world of the 60s. The graphics of the game are outstanding, and the voice recording is very professional. I received this game in April 2007 (two years after the release), and I am still impressed with the gameplay. It is a pity that EA will no longer make 007 games. <br /> <br /> I give this game a 10/10 for the levels it contains, especially for the “consulate” level. I would recommend this game to anyone over the age of 13. The only thing I did not like about the game was the level of the Russian boat, it was too much pressure. In general, I like the game a lot!
