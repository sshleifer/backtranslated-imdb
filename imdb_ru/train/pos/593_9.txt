This game show lasted only one season, but it was intriguing for the audience, because it required visual abilities and a solid hand. One wrong move disqualifies a participant from receiving a prize, although it was clear that the participant knew the correct answer. It was always exciting when the participant began to draw, wondering if they would complete the drawing or be suspended; allowing another participant to easily win the competition. It was a carefree sight, but it was clear that participants were often embarrassed because of a stupid mistake made unintentionally. Rarely seen, the game show did not survive after one single season. Only an experienced game show lover will remember this show, as it turned out to be very unpopular, although game shows were returning to the TV screen after game show scandals of the 1950s. But it was a unique concept for a game show that had never been seen before.
