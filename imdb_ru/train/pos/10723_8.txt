I reread some other user comments and decided to add them too. Some of the users are stuck in the realist mentality. This film was supposed to be a “fantasy” ... funny what-if movie. He should never have been "real" or serious. It was very pleasant for everyone I knew when it came out - although it hid the tragedy of the Challenger explosion ... I was then 30 years old, and I completely enjoyed it - my young son also liked it! Later I shared it with my daughter, and she liked it too. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that needs to be enjoyed just for the sake of it. All the “realists” in the world should light or stick to watching documentaries or documentaries and avoid any other type of film. Sorry for the young people who first watched this movie and then were able to go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one at Vandenberg AFB in California) - they must have expected to find the same medium that was shown in the movie, then I felt "disappointed" ... I think their parents did not explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Well. If you like fantasy-funny movies and have not seen this, I highly recommend it! Enjoy!
