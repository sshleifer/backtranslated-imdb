The movie "Fragility" is actually more a psychological thriller than a horror movie. It has all the attributes of a horror movie, but it is not. “Weakness” is a film about the perception of religion and the understanding of the differences between good and evil. <br /> <br /> In “Weakness,” a middle-aged father (Bill Paxton) and his two sons claim that they do the work of God. It turns out that this trio of notorious serial killers called “Hands of God”. We observe how a father kills “demons” in rather cruel ways, convincing him and his sons that they are doing the work of God and that what they are doing is right. He claims to have received a message from an angel, who gave him specific instructions on how to destroy the demons living here on earth. God gave him a list of names and in exchange for his "services"; he and his sons will be given protection, which means that the police will never be able to catch them. We see how all this unfolds before us in a very disturbing way. But what really worries about all this is how it affects two sons, especially the eldest son, Adam. Adam himself seriously doubts the existence of a higher being, until his father and the week in the basement change all that. He knows that his father has clearly gone mad and is confident that the same thing is happening with his younger brother, Fenton. Fenton, the other half of this riddle, perceives everything as if it were his own religion. It seems he is trapped in the world of the father and the demons. I suppose it is because he is so young and easily impressionable. But everything that happens with these three is pretty convincing, in fact, WAY too convincing. <br /> <br /> The events taking place in the film can be viewed as a bright hallucination experienced by three main characters. I say this because each of them responds to the situation differently, and at some point in the film they claim to have seen God. Dad first sees his mission in the killings. His “mission” ultimately absorbs him and quickly turns into an obsession with destroying demons. In fact, his hallucination is basic. His "orders" and the list of names he receives are part of this hallucination. Look at the scene where dad finds an ax in the barn to find out where I'm from. Fenton, the youngest son, is easily impressed by all this talk of demons and destruction. Because he is so young, it is easy for him to fall into his father’s trap. Adam, on the other hand, is very skeptical of his father’s actions. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> In a sense, the hallucination ends when dad gets killed near the end of the movie. (I will not say how or under what circumstances). But I will say that it is not pleasant. After his death, it is fast forward to our days. (The story is told through memories, as seen from the eyes of Adam's eldest son.) In fact, Fenton tells the story, not Adam, as originally believed. The story is told the way he perceived it, by his actions and the actions of his brother. Fenton is crazy and continues what his father started by luring the FBI agent into his trap. <br /> <br /> Since this film is the main theme of religion, the film also tells how easy it is for religion to be misinterpreted by those who do not have a full understanding of it. Before the Pope discovered his new mission, he himself did not have a clear understanding of religion and did not believe in a higher being. His sons, Fenton and Adam, often sang the hymns of innocent young children, but, nevertheless, did not have a clear understanding of what the texts mean. After the discovery of the newfound mission of the Pope, both flew up in different directions - Adam still doubted the existence of the supreme being, while Fenton was gradually drawn into the madness of his father. <br /> <br /> A very good thriller that creeps the hell out of you, don't watch it alone.
