* !! - SPOILERS - !! * <br /> <br /> Before I begin this, let me say that I had both the advantages of watching this movie on the big screen and viewing the “Authorized Version” this movie, remade by Stephen King himself in 1997. <br /> <br /> Thanks to both benefits, I really liked this version of Shining. <br /> <br /> Let me say that I have read Mr. King’s book The Shining in many cases over the years, and although I love this book and am a big fan of his work, Stanley Kubrick’s retelling of this story is much more convincing ... and scary. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to convey the horror of the psyche right in the movies. In the direction of the film and writing the script, he himself acquired the name "Magus" without any doubt. Genius Kubrick is like magic. The world of cinema lost a great director when he died in 1999. Among his other distinguished merits are: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A Clockwork Orange, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many others. <br /> <br /> Torrens (Jack, his wife Wendy and their son Danny) live in the Overlook Hotel for the winter; Jack was hired as a caretaker. His responsibilities include overseeing the maintenance of the hotel for several months of heavy snowfall, until the spring, when Overlook reopens its doors. It seems that there are many wealthy and exhausted tourists who go to the mountains of Colorado for a snowy summer holiday. <br /> <br /> The hotel was an impressive example of architecture and staging. He gave the atmosphere the atmosphere of the darkest, but at the same time "hospitable" atmosphere. Furniture and furniture were all the time (late 70s - early 80s), and the film about the landscape approaching the hotel on the opening scene is brilliant. It not only allows you to enjoy the approach to Overlock, but also records how abandoned and isolated the hotel is from the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> The performance of the characters Wendy and Danny was unexpected. genius You get the whole story of their past, Danny Tony's “imaginary friend,” and the story of Jack's alcoholism — all of this is written into this beautiful, neat opening scene. There was no need to stretch the story of the past throughout the two hours of the film; Obviously, Kubrick saw it from the start. <br /> <br /> Last day. Again, a scenic trip to the mountains to the hotel (this time with the family in tow), the interaction between Jack and Danny was fun, while at the same time portraying a very disturbing exchange. <br /> <br /> The initial tour of the City View is breathtaking, even when the “staff” promotes things, you have the opportunity to see the majestic fireplaces, high cathedral ceilings and expensive furniture, dremantics and stucco decorations in architecture. “They did a good job! Pink and gold are my favorite colors. ” (Wendy Torrens) Even the “staff wing” is well designed and beautifully built. <br /> <br /> The Labyrinth was a magnificent touch, resembling the Labyrinth, in which the Minotaur in Crete was the Keeper. When Jack Nicholson stands at the scale maze model and looks to the center, seeing Wendy and Danny enter, this is a magical moment; the one that tells you right away, there are heavy energies in this house; something seriously wrong already begins. "I would not want to go there if I did not have at least an hour to find a way out." (Hotel manager) <br /> <br /> Skatman Kruters, like Dick Halloran, was sincere and open in his performance. His smiles were natural, and his performance was wonderful. You might believe that you were there at the hotel, traveling around the kitchen with Wendy and the Doc. His explanation for the "shine" of Danny was very well stated, as was his conversation with the child about Tony and about the hotel. It was believable and sincere. <br /> <br /> The clipping and panning of the hotel itself, with the mountains behind, the swirling cold air, the fog rising from the warm roof of the snow-covered hotel, adds so much to the atmosphere of the film. It also marks, so to speak, "halfway to hell"; turning point in the film. <br /> <br /> Shelley Duval as Wendy Torrens was a workshop. (So ​​WHAT, if she also played Olive Oil? It just shows her amazing variety!) Honestly, before I saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, I said, “What? Olive Oil? * Lol * (Popeye was also released in 1980.) But I took it as soon as the film began. She is gorgeous. In the opinion of this Find, this is her best performance to date! (Although I loved her in Steve Martin's Roxane, 1987.) / Once Kubrick has established the pearls of information that you, the viewer, should possess: Torrens past; Danny's broken arm; Tony; the history of the hotel itself; the fact that Danny is not "mental", but rather clairvoyant, and not the general plan of the hotel, all of which you see in the first three episodes; the movie will never stop scaring you. <br /> <br /> The two killed daughters of the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady (the girls who appeared in front of Danny several times, first with Tony in the apartment, before the family ever left the otel) were badges with which Danny could identify, and whom he feared at the same time. They pursued (and pursued) themselves and showed Danny how and where they were killed, quite visually and materially. <br /> <br /> Tony Kubrick was written as an accompanying spirit, as a spiritual guide, whom he acquired as a result of his hand, almost cut off from his body by his own father. He was ... "the little boy who lives in my mouth." He showed up at the end of Danny's finger and physically spoke through him to speak with Danny. I don’t understand how in the book where Stephen King intended to present Tony as a projection of Danny as the older boy trying to save his father. Kubrick missed this little turn, and for some reason it made him even more frightening when Tony "took ... Danny ... over". The idea that Danny is projecting himself back into his youth is not ... scary. <br /> <br /> Scene "Woman in the soul", filmed by Leah Beldan (about which I can not find other titles). for doing something before or after the younger woman and Billy Gibson (who also seem to suffer from a lack of credit for work before or after) were seductively nasty and utterly disgusting. It was dramatic and frightening. Disgusting and scary. When Nicholson looks in the mirror and sees her decaying flesh under his hands; the expression of horror on his face was so complete and REAL. <br /> <br /> Jack quickly sets off from an “alcoholic” to a verifiable madman. The deterioration of his character’s mental state has been carefully and thoroughly documented by Kubrick. Jack's instant friendship with Lloyd Bartender (as only alcoholics, potential mentally ill and drug addicts do) depicts his immediate NEED for the atmosphere in which Lloyd helps him; namely, alcohol ... "the hair of the dog that bit me." (Jack Torrens) In the case of Jack, this is bourbon on the rocks, free of charge for Jack. "Orders from home." (Lloyd Bartender) Good play on words. <br /> <br /> When Wendy's “script” finds Jack, it’s nothing but page after page of the same line, typed over and over again, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles. ... when he asks from the shadows: "How do you like that?" and Wendy whirls and screams with a baseball bat in her hand ... so sharp. This is the point where she understands how confused the whole situation is ... how confused Jack is. It is very scary, dramatic and provides a strong presence. This, combined with Danny's visions of the hotel’s blood-filled lobby, superimposed on the scene between Jack and Wendy, and the confrontational ending of this scene, make this possibly the strongest movie scene. <br /> <br /> The "REDRUM" scene. Wow. What can I say? What mother would not be frightened to wake up to find her young, troubled son, standing over them with a huge knife, talking in that bizarre voice, exclaiming “REDRUM” again and again? Even if it didn’t make any sense, it would still be as scary as level 7 BP. It was something that everyone could (and has) remember (ed.). Speaking of memorable scenes ... <br /> <br /> Nicholson’s last assault on his family with an ax was perhaps one of the worst scenes in cinema history. His advertising line: "Johnny!" was a blow of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in horror history. This is also included in the horror film history. <br /> <br /> End ..? Kubrick’s end was perfect. I felt that everything ended up fine. No smarts, no loud whining, no tearful idiotic finale for this movie. Just the embodiment of perfection. That's all I say about the final. <br /> <br /> Who cares what they pulled out ?! Look what Kubrick put in. Rent, look, BUY. This is a classic horror genre, and for good reason. IT RAWKS !! <br /> <br /> * I am me * ... Take this film, put it in your collection of Stephen King and take King’s "Authorized" version of 1997 and put it in the Children's section. That's where it belongs. .: This film estimates 9.98 from Fiend :.
