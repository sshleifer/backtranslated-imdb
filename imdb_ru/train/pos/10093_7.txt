An excellent saleswoman in London is wiped out by the owner of a millionaire tea plantation and soon turns out to be married and lives with him in his villa in British Ceylon. Although based on Robert Standish’s book, this initial setup is very similar to Hitschok’s “Rebecca” when lead lady Elizabeth Taylor came into conflict with the imposing chief of staff in the mansion and (almost immediately) with her own husband, who is still under the thumb of her deceased but dominant father. Taylor, replacing the sick last-minute Vivien Leigh, looks creamy-smooth in her fashionable wardrobe, and her performance is quite strong; however, as soon as her husband Peter Finch begins to drink heavily and bark at her, you might think that her devotion to him is rather masochistic (this feeling also impedes the ending). Nevertheless, the film offers a rash choice for soap lovers: a romantic drama, a bit of travel, an interpretive dance, a stampede of elephants and a blink of cholera just in time! *** from ****
