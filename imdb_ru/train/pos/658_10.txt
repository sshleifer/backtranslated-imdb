Watching a movie is not so simple - it lasts more than three and a half hours and consists solely of talk. And yet it’s so incredibly irresistible and merciless to watch the human character that, in my humble opinion, is one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br /> The film is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want something inspiring, see the fantastic Celine Jacques Rivette and Julie Guo Boiting, which were made at about the same time). This shows that the idealism of the late 1960s is no different from the society he was trying to change. <br /> <br /> The allegedly liberated metropolis between Alexander (played by Jean-Pierre Leo) Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronica (Francoise Lebrun) are involved in it. Nevertheless, Alexander, as shown, is as chauvinistic and jealous as any other person. Women are exposed as volunteers and defining their femininity through a masculine look. <br /> <br /> The film is the extremely icy end of the very revolutionary French New Wave. This movement was one of the most significant movements in the history of cinema and had a deep impact on cinema, as we know it. Jean-Pierre Le was one of the key actors of New Wave, having played a major role (among other films) in influential Les Quatres Cent Coups (1959) Francois Truffaut as a rebellious teenager. Director Jean Yustache is not as well known as other New Wave directors, but he should be. <br /> <br /> There is no improvisation (unlike the similar films by John Cassavetes in the USA), and the dialogue comes from talking in real life. The film resonates with the personal experience of Eustachius. For example, Francoise Lebrun was Eustache's former mistress. Yustash himself committed suicide in 1981, and the real person on whom Marie’s character was based, too. Anger and bitterness end with Veronica’s tormenting monologue, right in front of the audience, destroying the cold objective character of the rest of the film. This fascinating, personal and honest cinematic statement remains one of the most revealing films about human nature.
