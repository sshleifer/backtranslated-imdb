This is the story of Siberian villagers from the beginning of the 20th century to the 60s. It is about passion and feelings, about the Russian soul and very romantic. This movie is NOT an action, it flows slowly. In the second part you can find great songs - Russian romances. This is much better than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this film moved to America and made, for example, “Quick Train”.
