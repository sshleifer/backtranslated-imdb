If John Tau had never played Morse, Kavana or starred in Sweeney and other productions, he would have been remembered for this surprisingly unforgettable performance in Good Night, Mr. Tom. <br /> <br /> This adaptation of the fascinating novel by Michelle Magorian, superbly supported by the equally stunning performance of his film colleague (young Nick Robinson in his first role) and the unobtrusive cast, is a fitting monument to his art. <br /> <br /> When I read this story that the old widowed Norfolk resident was forced to take a young boy from London before and during the blitz show, I discovered a rather obvious temporary error, and I must pay tribute to the creators of this film for correcting this problem. mistake. They should also be commended for not being overly sentimental in the story and unable to turn something that could easily be turned into a messy mess. <br /> <br /> If you have a library of CDs or videos, then this pleasant feeling made for television is a must-have film.
