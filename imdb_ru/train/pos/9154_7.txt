Very good, except for the ending, which was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> The script was very good, as was the acting. The visual effects were often very grainy, but this was somehow added to the film, since the snow objects were in good places that helped create the mood for the film. This influence was destroyed by an incredible ending. <br /> <br /> I was going to give this film 8 out of 10, but the final knocked him down to 7, because he seemed to have radically moved away from the first 75 minutes of the film and seemed pretty forced end to make the film look smart . <br /> <br /> This film was much better than films with a much larger budget, and seemed to be shot as a home movie with some extra equipment. Not so many special effects as they go, but for the wait it was very good.
