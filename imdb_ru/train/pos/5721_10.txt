I'm not sure I understand where all these enthusiastic anti-anger people say here, maybe some people just like to rant about things. <br /> <br /> The film was certainly imperfect (uneven play, some maybe they had difficulty changing the time, the actors were too eager to go to places that I really would prefer not to attend, etc.) but IMHO there were some things that more than made up for the shortcomings. <br /> <br /> First of all, I really liked the “breaking the rules” bit. Normally, when you leave a haunted house, the villains leave you alone, giving you time to regroup, find friends and find the sign of the mysterious paranormal type. NORMAL (warning of a semi-spoiler), when you hide under a blanket, they can only go through that small hole through which you look. OK, at the end, the ghosts somehow became less scary because you found out that they were just misunderstood, or they were released, or something else. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the production was exceptional. While the film was hardly filled with the special effects of supernatural beats, while the brief was extremely well done. <br /> <br /> Perhaps not the best film for those who think that Freddie and Jason are absolute horror (nothing against them, they have their own place), but great for those who began to accept agreements like due and who has no problems with temporary distortions.
