I waited a long time to watch this movie. These commercials gave a fair idea of ​​the content, and when I finally saw it, I actually found that it was done quite well. Most ordinary romantic films end up with lovers finally marrying or starting to live a happy life after the wedding, but for this transition from the old life to a new relationship and life a really big adaptation is required. This is what this film is about about the period when the newlyweds of Fardeen and Ash marry in agreement and begin their lives from the honeymoon. The game is really obligatory, although I think that Ash remained a bit calm and she could use some lines for herself. The story was well woven, and the dialogues were more or less relevant. Editing and directing were good too, Meghna Gulzar did a really good job. To summarize, I would say that this is a good dramatic novel, a true combination of what Bollywood can offer a pure artist.
