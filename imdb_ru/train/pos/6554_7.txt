Well, that's what I say: <br /> <br /> The film was excellent. I'm a big fan of Nancy, and I read all the 1-56 original books, and I started reading on. I am now 96. Beware of the villains who give this film a lower rating than it should. All clues point to a great movie! I loved it all. So what is Nancy now. She is still old-fashioned, like in books! People who have not read more than 5 books complain about Nancy's opinion. I read all of them, and I think that Emma is beautiful, and that Nancy was beautiful. I found the parts of the movie creepy. I loved the exciting car chases and drove away. I loved the tips. I solved the mystery myself! It was really wonderful. I suggest you watch it, because people who complain don't know anything about A, what a good movie is, and B about Nancy Drew Go look. He may not be worthy of an Oscar, but this is a really good movie.
