Karloff and Lugosi - together again! This is one of those films that occasional fans skip and don't really appreciate it. This is not a total horror film like the previous two hits of the duet, The Black Cat and The Raven. But he is very worthy of both talents and is a funny movie when you re-visit. <br /> <br /> “Invisible Ray” was directed by Lambert Hiller, a director who mostly starred in westerns, but with curiosity in these last days, Lamml’s reign at Universal, he found himself running this and the last horror film Lemmla , Daughter of Dracula. Both that, and another - the accurate, accurate imaginations, very easy on the contents of horrors, despite fantastic elements. <br /> <br /> Just as Lugosi was madly fond of "The Crow", a lot needs to be said about Karloff's humming in The Invisible Ray. One aspect of this story, which is particularly unsatisfying, is that Karloff's character, Ruh, acts so insanely before it is poisoned by Radium X that after it starts to glow, there will be no change. This is very similar to the complaint of people about Jack Nicholson in "Shine" - he's crazy from the beginning. There are no real conversions. Same. Halfway through Karloff just added the goal of revenge. I still liked his performance, just as I did Lugosi’s excessive antics in Crow. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Lugosi completely surprises you and gives you a discreet and thoughtful turn as a rival to Rukh in science. Dr. Benet. Lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film, including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch Ruh, which I agree with the horror film author John Sayster - “And if he (Ruch) touches anyone?” The inspector asks. Lugoshi hesitantly responds in such a way that only Lugosi could say: “They are dying.” Just as Lugosi could be so detached, he could also be more perfect than any actor. This is one of those moments. <br /> <br /> Therefore, all the interactions of Karloff and Lugosi are very good, since we get Karloff's insane pranks against Lugosi's cool logic. Karloff would play similar crazy scientists many times, but I would like Lugosi to play more direct roles like this one. He had only one more chance (Ninochka). <br /> <br /> “Invisible Ray” is a funny movie that delivers true pleasure to the true fans of Karloff and Lugosi. This is one of those films that improves with every viewing, not because it is a masterpiece, but because of the charisma and talent of its stars and how this story complements the darker and more terrible combinations that they had. The special effects of the always innovative John Fulton are awesome, and the supporting actors are all adequate. Francis Drake looks as beautiful as in Mad Love, and plays a strong woman, which is rare in classic horror films. The scene at the end, when Karloff pursues her, and she does not scream, is one of the most haunting moments of the film. Awesome, funny movie!
