Absolutely beautiful drama and Ros at the highest level ... I highly recommend this film. Her performance, in my opinion, was the Oscar award material! The only truly sad fact is that Universal did not make sure that this film was available in any video format, whether it be a tape or a DVD. They ignore a VERY good movie. But Universal does not pay much attention to its library on DVD, which is sad. If you have the opportunity to see it somewhere (not sure why it rarely even works by cable), take a look! I will not go into the story because I think that most people prefer to have an opinion about the film, and too many “reviewers” ​​write for hours about the story that is available everywhere. <br /> <br /> a 10!
