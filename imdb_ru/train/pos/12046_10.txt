In modern "horror" there is nothing frightening, which is an insult to the word "horror".

Snatcher), Jacques Tou Renier (another student Val Lewton, who made a really terrifying film about zombies, and not the coarse garbage that Raymi did (coarse, not terrible guys, it's just rude), and Lewis Allen (“The Uninvited”), and of course Jack Clayton turned to Henry James the Innocent, and the way that the master of suspense, Hitchcock, can still lead you to the edge of your place, even with a slow and glowing period, like Under Capricorn. <br /> <br /> TEN STARS ..,
