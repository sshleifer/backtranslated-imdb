I have seen this film many times, and every time I watch it, I can't help but have fun with it. “Gunga Dean” is one of those classic films made during the Hollywood golden years, when the actors themselves had to engage viewers in the film without relying on fantastic special effects and artificial “monsters” to create the scene. The charisma and companionship on screen, shown by Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., are very curious and interesting to watch. The tongue and cheeks, in which the three actors play their roles, work beautifully and flawlessly. Some may consider it “banal”, but I consider it to be “classic” filmmaking and acting at their best. Watching this film, one should remember that Europe was involved in the war with Germany, and the audience went to the cinema to escape from the horrors of war, have fun and take them to a place where people were bigger than life and committed heroic acts and good always triumphs over evil. Gunga Dean perfectly copes with this task, allowing the audience to laugh at the actors during their painful tricks. In short, this is a classic film that does not take itself too seriously and does not want the viewers to do either.
