The new short film by David Lynch is a very “Lynchev” play, full of darkness, tension, silence, restrained, but very textured background music, in which again there are two beautiful actresses, a blonde and a brunette, is a constant theme of his work. > <br /> Both characters create a very intriguing relationship of slave mistresses, which can be viewed as a direct continuation of the same kind of relationship as the Mulhollandic doctor <br /> <br /> Beautiful. For fans of Lynch. <br /> <br />
