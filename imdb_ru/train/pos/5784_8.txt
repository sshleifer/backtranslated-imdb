I noticed that many people who publish on "Kerching!" the board seems to hate this show, which I actually find very awesome. I think this is one of the best British children's shows. It's a shame that it ends, because it is very funny (although sometimes a bit silly) and has great characters. The main character is a bit like Del Boya, although much smarter. With his two best friends, he tried to earn a million pounds for his mom by opening an online business and adopting the pseudonym "Rudeba". His friends are Seymour (who loves to cook) and Danny (who is simple-minded and has a comic relief character). Throughout the show, some characters went away and new ones appeared, but it was always interesting and improved.
