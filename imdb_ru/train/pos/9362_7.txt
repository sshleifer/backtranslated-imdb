Hello from the dark again. How rarely can a film explore people's lost soul from pain. Adam Sandler acts in the role of Charlie, a man who lost his family in the tragedy of September 11, and since then has lost his career, his reason for living and, perhaps, sanity. Don Cheadle is acting in the role of Sandler's former roommate in the dental school, who seems to have an ideal life (which Sandler obviously had before 9/11). <br /> <br /> Of course, the parallels in the lives of these people are obvious, but in fact it’s nice to see the male feelings in the film ... feelings that are different from lust and revenge, that is. Watch how they actually help each other, just being there, painfully and sincerely. Writer / director Mike Binder (“Upward Wrath” and the bookkeeper Sandler in this film) really brings a different look and feel to the film. Some scenes do not work as well as others, but in general they are well written and well directed. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent. Sandler’s character is a bit like his great performance in “Punch Drunk Love,” but here he brings a lot more depth. Cheadle is always fine and does his job well in expressing the burden that he carries ... just by watching how he creates the puzzle. <br /> <br /> Jada Pinkett Smith (as Chadla’s wife), Liv, works great in support. Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burroughs (in a strangely attractive role), Donald Sutherland as an irritated judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandler's relatives. <br /> <br /> The film does affect how the tragic events of that day affected one person so deeply that he mostly died. In addition to the interesting story and some great shots from New York, you will enjoy any film with vocals from Chrissie Hind, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltri ... as well as Eddie Wedder, imitating Daltree. Not quite an optimistic film, but it is a quality film with an unusual story.
