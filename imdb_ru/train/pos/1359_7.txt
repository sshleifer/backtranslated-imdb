I work in a library and expected this movie to be enjoyed when it came out 5 years ago. Well, I really liked Parker Posey (she's a great actress), and Omar Townsend was very cute, like her boyfriend (he couldn't play, but when you look like him, who cares?) But the film was bad. It was not funny, not cute and not so much. Posey kept the film afloat with her energy. But she learned Dewey's decimal system "At Night," and then put off tons of books to the music? !!!! ??? Come on! In addition, I had a problem with how she looked when she became a full-time librarian at the end — hair in a bun, glasses, lack of a sense of humor — can we let this stereotype go away, please? Worth a look at Posey and Townsend, but that's all. The series was much better.
