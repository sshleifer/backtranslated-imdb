The first time I watched Buster Keaton's first full-length film, I must admit that I really liked it, and I would like me to stumble upon it many years ago. Rohauer Blur from the outset warns that the single nitrate imprint of the Three Centuries was rediscovered and rescued in 1954 just before burning, and many shots that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated. So in some places rocky sight, but I saw and survived much worse. <br /> <br /> All 3 short films would be normal, but from the point of view of intolerance, they are creative and funny from start to finish: in the Stone Age with the villain Wallace Bury riding an elephant and booster Buster on a home brontosaurus; During the Roman era, Baster rode a chariot with wheel locks and was adapted for sledding, “No parking” signs in Latin; In this technological age of speed, Need and Greed, his car falls apart beautifully on the first hump. Both he and Bury have followed the girl over the centuries, an endless struggle. Favorite episode: being a caveman, he is knocked over the edge of a cliff, but he still blows a kiss into the camera - an amazing second or two! <br /> <br /> Excellent material confirming my love for a silent film comedy.
