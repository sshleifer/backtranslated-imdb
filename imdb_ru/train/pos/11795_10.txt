I will never forget this film or the events that led to Johnstown in Guyana. It just seems tragic, but you have to say. The powers of Booth give a team performance as the leader of Rev. Jim Jones from obscurity to complete insanity. He would easily have won the Academy Award if it were released in theaters. This is a mini-series that you will not forget. You will not forget the images of cruelty, control and obsession of the cult of its leader. His rise and fall and the threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered to be paradise. Mass suicide is terrifying, almost unrealistic for any imagination about why so many people (more than 900) voluntarily went or resisted the orders of John. They no longer make such mini-series when we are left open-mouthed, and we long to find out what happened to others.
