I first saw Martin Day, when I was only 10 years old, at home, on the Kino channel, and I still remember how it affected my life. It touched me like no other film touched me, and I remember rolling my eyes. <br /> <br /> After the first time I saw him, I could not find him anywhere. I asked around and no one ever heard of a movie! I think it was one of those rarer films that few people knew because no one, and I mean anyone, knew what I was talking about. I searched and searched for years, checking the shelves of video stores and looking through cable TV listings, but I always failed. Finally, in 1996, I found out that I could do it by special order, and I’ve probably watched it at least 50 times since then - and it still makes me cry every time. <br /> <br /> Martin’s Day is close to Martin Stechert, a man who is in prison (but a really good guy), who is eager to return to the special lake where he grew up as a child. It was a special place where he lived in nature, spent time with his dog and was left alone to enjoy life. Soon in the film, he runs away and begins to return to the lake. <br /> <br /> Soon the police found him, and Shtekert took the child hostage to convince the police to return off. Soon, Shtekert and his hostage (2nd Martin) become best friends, and together they make many fun adventures - from robbing a toy truck to a high-track train, all on the way to this particular lake. <br /> <br /> During the entire movie, Sheckert has great memories of him on the lake when he was a boy. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the final for you, but I will tell you that this film is a must-see. This is the BEST film I've ever seen in my life! I am without a doubt the biggest fan of this film ever! I managed to find a song that the two Martins sing throughout the entire film (“I go back to where I come from ...”). I am even planning a trip to Canada to see the lake and cottage where Martina Day was filmed. Crazy, I know - but this film means so much to me.
