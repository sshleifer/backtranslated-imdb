This is one of my all time favorite films, PERIOD. I can't think of another movie that combines so many good movie qualities like this one. In this film, there is everything: action, adventure, science fiction, good versus bad, and even a little romance (even without an innocent peck on the cheek between Paz and Shita). Perhaps best of all, you don't need to be in Mensa to “get it” and enjoy the movie, as you do with some other Miyazaki films (I don't know about you, but I watch movies to take a break from thinking). It's just an exciting movie that everyone will like, so do yourself a favor and buy it. The only sour note is American dubbing. I found that Vander-Geek is just annoying. But still not lost, the original Japanese version is on a set with two discs, and it rocks! Who cares if you don't understand spoken Japanese? If you can read at the second level, look at the original Japanese recording with English subtitles. You will not regret it.
