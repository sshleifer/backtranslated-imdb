A masterful reference to the James Kane film “The Postman Always Rings Twice” as the first Lucino Visconti film, made mostly around Ferrara in heartless Italy torn by war. The original negative was considered destroyed, but Visconti retained an imprint, and, fortunately, today we can see this early neo-realistic work. Vigorously beautiful Massimo Girotti and Clara Kalamai (who recently opened their breasts in La Cena delle beffe "(1941) play the role of sensually charged and ill-fated lovers who plan to kill her husband. Does not pay, pay in a manner not directly connected with the crime. leadership, screenplay, acting and cinematography.It is reportedly not as good as the French Tournament Le Dernier (1939), but probably better than the American version (1946) starring Lana Turner and John Garfield. Highly recommended.
