A great movie, more difficult than really interesting. Unfortunately, there are no memorable quotes here, but this is my favorite: Alexander: If you leave the one you love, you have to say what I am saying to you now: “Farewell, I leave.” But to disappear, to hide, as a criminal, is ignoble. (I did not watch it with English subtitles) <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it expresses all this. There is so much tactics in the relationship between Alexander and the rest, and yet everyone craves for a little more truth. However, knowing the truth can hurt even more, as Alexander is going through. The general interpretation is that the film criticizes the simple possibility of “liberated love”, portraying undesirable consequences for the people involved. It does show it in a convincing way, but I would appreciate it if the reasons were considered in more detail: it’s not that liberated love is doomed to failure, but people (especially men, I think) have to work on themselves and try to overcome ruling morality earlier, rather than using the practice of liberated love. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film is realistic, albeit noteworthy.
