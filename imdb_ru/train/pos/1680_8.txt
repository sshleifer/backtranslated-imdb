Well-made and stylish, but at the same time still meaningful, this thriller is suitable for non-fiction fans to get interested in the genre than the later Argento recordings that go overboard in all directions. <br /> <br /> For fans of this crazy Italian thriller, they will appreciate George Hilton and the turns his character takes and what he went through. Camera work is fresh in terms of graphic violence and a strange, but suitable choice and a good, but not bloated score. The less you know about the plot, the better it is to make it work. <br /> <br /> The only thing missing for not being a great director Sergio Martino is that there is no such sexual or psychological character in the plot. or both elements to put it on top. This is rather a common mystery, the characters are clearly defined, but they live or die in accordance with the plot, and not in accordance with their own strengths and weaknesses. <br /> <br /> The recent DVD release (2005) looks beautiful and definitely to watch a movie, unless they get shows of art houses, which seems unlikely.
