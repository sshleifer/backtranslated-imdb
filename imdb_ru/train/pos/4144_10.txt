For a while I fell into the trap, where I found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that I like them. Fatty Drives the Bus is an exception. It's true. This is the best "bad" film ever. <br /> <br /> The “badness” of this film seems to be natural. In the middle of Satan’s first monologue, the word “Hell” appears at the bottom of the screen. Glamor Bridget - an unshaven man in a wig and a charity dress. An eccentric pair is required, which continues to try to kill each other forever in order to descend the stairs. Jesus goes to the funk soundtrack. <br /> <br /> In any case, Fat Man has the impression that someone has lost his post for advising the film for the older one. But the sincerity of how bad it makes him so wonderful. It seems that the creators knew that it would be bad, but never forced it. <br /> <br /> Never repeat in amazement, delivers Fatty. Highly recommended.
