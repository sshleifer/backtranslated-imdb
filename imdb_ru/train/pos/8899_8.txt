What the film of the 60s actually represents (for those of us who at that time roared in America) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite the exaggerated, stereotypical images, the authenticity of the questions remains clear. <br /> <br /> These were not only radical times of change, but also very troubled times. Then two main things changed our world: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the enormous influence of the media. These two new freedoms became social changes that soon became institutionalized. <br /> <br /> Sensitivity came out of chaos, values ​​out of confusion. Keep in mind, however, that most Americans were not involved in this ... they worked, they played, they watched the news ... and gradually they became the result of the efforts and struggles of minorities ... Civil rights workers, political activists, anti-war efforts , the war against poverty .... <br /> <br /> The representation of the power of the press and television, in particular, was well reflected, although the conflict between the attitude of the general public and those who are trying to change something was ignored at best. .. and at worst - distorted. Middle-class Americans did not stand around, angrily holding baseball bats or denying their wayward daughters. They, too, were confused. Let us not forget how folk singers suddenly became protest singers and how the Beatles launched an onslaught that killed the popular protest movement. There are no Beatles songs in the film, and there are even no references to them. <br /> <br /> I think that if you hadn’t lived for a decade, you might not have an idea of ​​what this is about, the whole picture is a bit dim. At some point I stayed on a permanent job, while my sister lived in the commune of Hog Farm and left for Woodstock. At another time, I was in Haight-Asbury and in the Detroit riots when she worked and played housewives in Maine and Connecticut. Roles are constantly changing. <br /> <br /> The film features three middle-class brothers and sisters. They represent a hippie child, a political activist and active military personnel. Dad represents typical relationships, and Mom represents the voice of reason, tolerance, and sometimes compromise ... in the name of peace. <br /> <br /> Black family consists of a minister and his son ... disproportionately, I think. I assume that the producers knew all the variables and should have limited themselves to restrictions, otherwise the film would have become a long, boring documentary. Dad said that anger begets bitterness, and bitterness begets chaos. It is clear that this was a message addressed to modern youth. <br /> <br /> We are looking at a unique solution to social problems, as well as how we are separated by problems ... The 60s were unusual in this sense, and only Roar of the 20s compares. In other words, this film has a moral in the end. In the end, it is our collective individualism that survives. Put it on your list of oxymorons. <br /> <br /> In the 1960s, everyone was a God, a Guru, or a freedom-loving genius. It was a time of magic and madness. No one would ever nail the 60s straight ... it was too diverse (this film is close). At least, we can say that we are not ashamed of this, that we learned and grew out of it, and that this time the generation formed and changed America ... for the better.
