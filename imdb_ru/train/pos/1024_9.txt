I have not always been a fan, but the show has grown on me. Only after the fifth season did I begin to see the richness of the show. Finally, they completed the search for Daniel Jackson regarding his wife, and finally most of Guo, perhaps the System Lords, were killed by rival Lords, SG-1 or others. <br /> <br /> By season 5, Stargate SG-1 began to get stale. With new authors and close attention from producer Peter Deleuze, the show became more and more solid. <br /> <br /> Characters are also outdated. Colonel Jack O'Neill was a stereotypical hero with emotional baggage. After his son Charlie was killed as a result of shooting O'Neill’s weapon, he decided to commit suicide by going to Abydos to meet with Go'ould RA. The character offers little growth for any actor, and actor Richard Dean Anderson decided to play him straight, raising emotional barriers to protect himself. only lets in his close friends. <br /> <br /> Amanda Tapping joined the cast as Captain Samantha Carter. She was on the verge of a feminist, ready to fight with any man who doubted her ability to do her job. Although this character had little room to grow, Tapping did a lot of work, concentrating on Carter's strengths. She took the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things Carter is talking about so that she can present the character intelligently. <br /> <br /> Christopher Judge joined the cast, playing alien Til'k. Tilk was a stranger named Jaffa. The baby Go'uld (snake-like creatures) will be embedded in Jaffa until it reaches such an extent that it will be inserted into another form of life. Jaffa will die. Tilk was Apophis First Prime Army. Knowing that Apophis was not a god like Guo pretended, he realized the genocide committed by their armies in the galaxy. Finally, having had enough, he and Jack O'Neill liberated their team along with quite a few innocent people. Arriving on Earth, he realized that the Earth is the planet he was looking for that would help him fight Go'old. Christopher Judge did quite a bit with limited temperament. Til'k is a wise warrior, many of whom he learned from his master Master Bra'taka. The show would not have been complete without Master Bratak by Tony Amandola. He is also a rock. In the end, he became an adviser to most of the SG-1, especially Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Don S. Daville was there from the start, playing Major-General George Hammand. Davis did an incredible job with Hammond, making him responsive and normal. He does his job, has a wife, sons and daughters and grandchildren. You can really say that he is an anchor base. I would just die for this person. If not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams outside the world. He will go by himself. He leaves no one behind. <br /> <br /> I saved the last of Daniel Daniel Jackson, because, I think, this character grew the most in the ten or eleven years he was in. Choosing Shanks, I do not think that the producer realized how strong Shanks will be, and now, when people talk about Jackson, they don’t talk about Spader, they talk about Shanks. In the early years, Jackson's character acted as a whiner. That's why I probably wasn't a fan. As the seasons passed, the character grew stronger. This gave him confidence. At the end, by season 10, Jackson's character matured to such an extent that he became a selfless hero. He still keeps track of group ethics. He is still the leader in providing information that can move any mission forward. Acheology, history, culture and research are part of his very being. He is determined. Although he is a man of the world, he is so mature that the use of his weapon may be the only way to resolve differences. <br /> <br /> Other characters recently include Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black) and Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder), the new leader of SG-1. Both actors come from a TV show called Farscape, and you can guess why they were put together. I see a slight difference between Mitchell and Krayton (Farscape character). The character of black is just behind the wall. Definitely different from her soldier, like the character of Arin Sun.
