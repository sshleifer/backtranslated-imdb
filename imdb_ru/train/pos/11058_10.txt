I would say that this is the first quality romantic comedy I have ever seen. he had depth, and although you knew from the very beginning who was going to finish together, there was still desire and expectation. the idea that maybe they would not come together ... this indie film was eventually well-written, directed and acted upon. the dances on the side of the road were great.
