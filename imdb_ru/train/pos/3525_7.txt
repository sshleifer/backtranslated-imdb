Dude, this is a hard DVD. I could only find it in Region 2, a Spanish import, and that was expensive. <br /> <br /> Was it worth it? Well yes. Not so much, because it is a masterpiece of film production, although directed by Kurt Siodmak (in the credits on IMDb.com it says "Robert", but the list of titles on the DVD is "Kurt"), or because there are a couple of familiar figures from it the mysteries of the killings — Elisha Cook Jr. and Thomas Gomez — but because my ten-year curiosity about the film has finally been satisfied. <br /> <br /> In essence, a respected but independent engineer (Alan Curtis) was left his ex-wife finds himself in a New York bar with two tickets to the show in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat is standing on a chair next to him, and he politely invites her to join him in a musical review. She takes, a little grimly. The joker bartender gives them both a look when they leave. <br /> <br /> At the show, a stormy star notices that this lady in the audience wears the same hat and breaks backstage with anger. The drummer in the group Cook looks at the silent lady, but does not get an answer. Curtis takes the woman to her home and asks her name, but she will not give it, and she does not want to know him. If she were a longfellow devotee, she would say something about ships that sail at night. Well, Curtis goes home and discovers that his wife was killed in his absence. Chief Police Officer Gomez hands it to the district attorney. His only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady who no one seems to remember - neither the bartender, the Latin star, nor the taxi driver (Al-Alp), nor the drummer - and since the lady herself disappeared, her impossible to dig out. <br /> <br /> Curtis convicted and sentenced to death. But Inspector Gomez thought it over and decided that she was probably innocent, because no one would have thought up such a stupid story wisely. He joins Curtis' loving secretary, Ella Raines, in an informal case investigation. <br /> <br /> They again visit the alleged witnesses. The sinister bartender was hit by a car, perhaps by accident, so he is out of sight. Latina is hot-tempered gone, because the show is closed, and in any case she refuses to cooperate and does not know about the source of the hat. Elisha Cook Jr. is strangled by a real killer, but not before he figures in the scene in which he knocks on the drums in an improvised jazz band. His sweaty face takes on an expression that does not involve intense concentration, but rather a monstrous, orgasmic insanity. His eyeballs roll to the ceiling, his mouth opens, his blows become frantic. I laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> Nobody acted differently, but everyone is quite professional. Thomas Gomez is always reliable. The best performance, however, is probably Franchot Tone. He's a real killer, and he fakes his alibi. He is discreet and artistic. Even when he loses consciousness, he is decent. I don’t know how to express it, but Ton seems to think in the same way that he simply performs his role. Alan Curtis as an innocent engineer is close to zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs to image B. <br /> <br /> I don’t know why this is considered classic. This is really your basic murder mystery by Cornell Woolrich, not as good as some of his others. But the direction of Siodmak is sensitive. The man runs off, and his hat is in the gutter, around which water flows. Its use of shadows is quietly effective. <br /> <br /> Glad I understood.
