I thoroughly enjoyed this faithful to form a take on Dick Tracy's face. This is a well-made product that uses modern technology to create a comic story filled with images. If you are a fan or have recently watched some of the old B / W films about Dick Tracy, then you will surely enjoy this version. Pastel colors and larger characters than in life, presented in a painstakingly authentic look at the past era, are entertainment, as it should be. Personally, I think that the musical component of the Madonna is the main part of this film - the disc with her music from this film is one that I often listened to over the years, it’s just very well made, performed musically and tuned in to that era. In my opinion, the best moment of the Madonna is like on the screen, but especially musically. This will surely cause a “child” in you.
