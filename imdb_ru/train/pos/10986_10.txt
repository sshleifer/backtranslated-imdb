Last Sunday, we stumbled upon the documentary "Gray Gardens", and we "pulled" without warning. Everyone who entered the room was shocked on TV, and the obsessive images of Edith and Edie, who seemed to live their lives in practically the same room of a big dirty mansion on the beach, ate ice cream and corn on the cob (which was cooked on the bedside table) - and the cat urinating on Edith's bed, and her unbelievable words: "I thrive on this [smell]." We didnâ€™t see the beginning and wondered what we were seeing and how these aristocratic women managed to take the position they were in. Fascinating! must see !!!!
