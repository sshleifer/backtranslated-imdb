Well, it was a rather sensitive little room, but I can't help but think that I had seen it before. Reminds me of another VCA movie that I saw in Poitiers called OTHER DAYS RUBY RAY. He also performed pieces “Welcome to the Dollhouse” and “Pied Piper” and Lynn Ramsay. This does not mean that they are not tasteful references ... they just feel very modern and very fashionable ... which makes me feel that this is closer to advertising (as an approach in style and history) than the work is original and authentic author. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is just ... too perfect for me. Too coral filter (or coal) in my opinion ... too arched frame 12 mm. Therefore, the whole impression left me a little distant - beware of art that proclaims itself too willingly! The French (they are a conservative group) seemed to buy it as a jury however ... but the choice of Cannes short film is notoriously conservative compared to his choice of features, although I’m wondering what happened in the last few years.
