I just don't understand why this film is being beaten here. Jeez. It is meaningless, it is not polished, and this (as I read) is wasted on some. The actors of this film play their characters in 'T' (if you watched Permanent Midnight and became a Ben Stiller fan, then yes, you will be disappointed). These are misunderstood, unsuccessful well-meaning attempts, trying to save a city / world only with the help of determination and determination. The problem is that they do not realize their limits until a big showdown, and that's the point! This is three times more than the movie “The Spy That Seduced Me”, which is still undergoing panning by the same demographic group, probably by the same people who feel that the first AP movie is fading from the sequel. I just don't get it. Jokes work on more than one level; if you do not understand, I know what level you are at.
