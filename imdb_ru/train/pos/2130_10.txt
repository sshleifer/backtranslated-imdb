A wonderful film, filled with great understated performance and sharp, intelligent dialogue. What really distinguishes the film, however, is that which is hidden from sadness. The story is emphasized by deeds, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, fear of losing a job in a world where it had disastrous consequences. Most of all this happened in a world that no longer existed, torn to the beginning of World War II. In fact, the film is not a comedy at all if you compare the percentage of serious scenes with comic scenes. And yet it’s ridiculous - listen to Jimmy Stewart’s sudden dismissal of Margaret Sullivan and watch his painful expression when he replies that her comments were a wonderful mixture of “poetry and meanness. It is funny, sharp and sad at the same time. A remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest comedies on screen.
