This film, which at first glance seems to be entirely devoted to J. Edgar Hoover, who hits hard on the back, fighting with clanmen, chasing Indian murderers, hunting famous gangsters of the 1930s, fighting the Nazis in the US and in the south America during World War II and Commi in New York in the early 1950s. Of course, in 1959 we didn’t know about Mr. Hoover’s obsessive idea of ​​keeping secret documents about honest Americans, offending people like Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., but, worst of all, about his secret affair with his deputy, Clyde Tolson (If If you want to know more about this subject, I suggest watching the film Citizen Kohn). Hoover aside, this life story in the FBI, as Jimmy Stewart relates, makes for a decent, but outdated film. Vera Miles as his devoted wife is also good. But Jimmy is a movie. Despite the fact that Hoover controlled the production and always made sure that the FBI was seen correctly, Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human side, and this is a real achievement, given that Hoover always looked over his shoulder. Background score is also nice. I read the latest online articles that said this is a forgotten movie. Jimmy Stewart was one of the greatest movie stars of all time, and not one of his films should be forgotten. TCM was the last network to show this a long time ago, and I hope they show it again.
