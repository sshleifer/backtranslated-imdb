With films such as Wallace and Gromit and Running Chicken, kind people from the other side of the pond, Aardman Animation, now introduce us to their slightly perverted humor in the form of “The Being of Comfort”. <br /> <br /> Coming from a short plan, made at the beginning of their career, “The Pleasure of a Creature” is a demonstration of life where fragments of a conversation are removed from the context and transferred to some animal. <br /> Aardman Animation across the country interviewed people with such harmless questions as: "Are you a liar?" and then speed up the question of your sex life a little. <br /> <br /> Answers, although they seem boring and mundane, are actually quite funny when you understand that the dialogues first take place and the animals are added later. . <br /> <br /> How many of these animals look like a person making statements? One of the characters discussing what he is looking for in a woman: "I like them, as it were, thin." insect, cane. <br /> <br /> Two dogs discuss smells and smells, sniffing behind a poodle, and talk about the different smells of a woman. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in the cage. As a “wife” says lithium about her health, her long-suffering husband stands next to her, without saying a word. <br /> <br /> Although it may take some time for “Comfortable creatures” to find their “legs”, it should find a place on television for those who are tired of the usual. While reality shows are bigger than Carter’s liver pills, Comfort Creature is one of a kind, and definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> Some kind of humor may seem a bit strange, because the clay turns into a trap. children's attention (as in the old Batman series of the 60s, the jokes are thin enough so that the children would not hear them), and these are jokes for adults.
