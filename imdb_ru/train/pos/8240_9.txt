I was also on hand for the Toronto premiere. This film was a kind of consolation when I thought I couldnâ€™t come in to see my first choice. Well, I was completely blown up. By the time I got to the theater, I almost did not remember anything, except for the main plot of the film (yes, I really forgot who was in it). Stunning performances from the entire composition. Carrie-Anne Moss was gorgeous in truly avoiding her days as Trinity. As for Billy Connolly, I think not, since Chaplin's actor played so brilliantly, without any lines, that he ever did. The kids were great too. Be sure to check it out if you have a chance. <br /> <br /> And by the way, I still saw my first choice - and it was much better.
