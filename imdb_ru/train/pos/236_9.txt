This is a rare case when I want to watch a movie again. "The Amati Girls" is such a film. In old cinemas, I would stay in place for new shows. Was this story autobiographical for a writer / director? He has an aura of reality. <br /> <br /> All the actors who play all the stars present their heroes with believability and tenderness. Who would not want a Mercedes Ruehl like a big sister? I loved her work with "For Roseanna". <br /> <br /> With most films, you can believe it, because we know that this is the work of actors, producers, directors, sound producers, etc., to suspend such faith in "The Amati Girls". It feels such a part of this family! How I wanted to come to the defense of Dolores when her family is stifling her emotional life. And she wanted to cheer on Lee Grant when she criticized Cloris Lichman's hair color. Humor is everywhere - it is not the humor of laughter, but rather a pleasant feeling that satisfies much more than just slips and the like. <br /> <br /> The love depicted in this cinematic family should imitate and be cherished. <br /> <br /> It is not by chance that the name Amati translated from Italian means “loved ones”.
