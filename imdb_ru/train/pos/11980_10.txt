Full House was and remains a great show. This is a good show for people of all ages, as well as a good family show. There are no more such shows. Children are very cute, and although it is a bit silly, it is still good, especially for those who watched it in childhood. I would like to see an interview with the actors. Anyone who would like to see an interview with the actors, such as where they are now writing information about the features of the DVD, should go to the Petition spot site and sign the petition called “Full House Reunion” on DVD, because the petition is in the hope that the cast might want to do this. Yay for Full House!
