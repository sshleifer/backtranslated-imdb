Why on earth should you explore the fascinating nature documentary "Earth"? How much time do you have on earth so I can explain this to you? Well, I will not extend my review of the Earth to infinity, but I must stand firmly on why this "must see". The documentary film tells about a trip to nature for three family animals: a polar bear female and her cub with a plot from the real life of a bear father who dared to hunt for food on her isolated path; and mother elephant with its small (maybe not so small, they are elephant) offspring migrating to Africa. Directed by Alastair Fortegill and Mark Linfield did the work "from this land", also capturing the survival skills of many other animal species, in addition to magnetic shots of our three main characters of the animal family. The cinematically qualified team of Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Raavech and Andrew Schillaber was a film crew filming amazing natural places and animal instinctive behavior; not to mention that the animal sacrifices were unjustified. Earth is also a lesson on the effects of global warming on animals; Polar bear's Papa in the document is a poster boy on this investigation. So, earthlings, it is time to make a documentary journey to visit the "Earth" today! **** Good
