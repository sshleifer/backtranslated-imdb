This is one of the best Indian films that I have seen lately, instead of films about crappy songs and dances or slums. All the actors showed the right emotions with the right intensity at the right time. A distinctive feature of a good movie is that it forces the viewer to return and explore the subject, which I checked on Harilale. I always enjoy Akshay Hannah’s subtle style of play, and, interestingly, he had a rather difficult relationship with his father, Vinod Hannah, although not as dramatic as Gandhi’s, and I wonder how this helped him write this character. I was impressed with the direction and two fingers up for Anil Kapoor for making such a great movie.
