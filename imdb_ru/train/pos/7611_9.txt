“I looked into the eyes of this island, and what I saw was beautiful,” one of the main characters announced in the award-winning ABC television show Lost. The series can be summed up as a dramatic story about a group of survivors of an airplane crash on an unknown island, but this would be a disservice. "Lost" follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island, with each other and, ultimately, with themselves, when they struggle with their new way of life and their dependence on each other. The situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear that this is not an ordinary island, and that they may not be alone. <br /> <br /> My initial fear after I heard the concept of this series was the lack of a new one. stories that they could tell us after a certain period, but this turned out to be unfounded. The narrative flows naturally, the dialogue is witty, the characters are memorable, and the execution is superb. The island itself is a character, and to understand this comment, you need to see the series for yourself, which only shows its originality and greatness. <br /> <br /> At the time of this review, only the first two seasons were aired, and they are filled with strong episodes. My only light criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit, but fortunately it comes back in great shape for the final episodes. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend one television series, you should follow right now, of course, it will be this one. If you like excitement, adventure, character-driven stories, an extremely strong cast and crew, beautiful locations and an island that seems more spiritual than natural, “Lost” for you. Just make sure you start from the beginning.
