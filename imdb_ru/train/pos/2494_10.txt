The first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange, and they were not very funny and had a dramatic element in which Bill (mother) struggled with all the usual problems in life, but this element was a bit depressing and did not mix well with the elements of comedy probably therefore was discarded. After that, he soon became one of the funniest comedy shows ever created by the BBC! The chemistry between the characters of Bill and Ben was very funny, and in each series there were always so many brilliant and memorable sketches. Christmas specials were fun and a real holiday for Christmas. <br /> <br /> The show stopped when the main actor Gary Olsen, who played Bill, passed away, which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films like Up 'n' Under and a very funny man RIP <br / > <br /> This underestimated show, unfortunately, disappeared from our television screens and should not be repeated as often - Although it does appear on UKTV Gold from time to time, it should be repeated on the BBC one or two to show this brilliant comedy for a new audience
