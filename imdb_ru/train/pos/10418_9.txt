The story of a boyish thief from Baghdad (as it was once written) attracted filmmakers from Raul Walsh in 1924, who played the main role of Douglas Fairbanks in the first silent rendering of The Thief of Bagdad, in less impressive, more recent attempts. The best, however, remains the version of the 1940s, which at one time was an amazing, magical defense against high-quality special effects. These effects still work their charm. <br /> <br /> At least six directors are listed in the film “Technicolor,” in which Sabu starred as a boy thief, Abu, John Justin as the dreamy love monarch Ahmad and June Duprez. like a beautiful princess wanted by Ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier Jafar, played by the sinister Konrad Weidt. Giant genie skillfully acts Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> Ahmad was treacherously overthrown by Jafar, and when he later was arrested by this traitorous serpent, he and the boy Abu suffer from what clearly destroys fate. Ahmad becomes blind, and Abu becomes an attractive fool. Their adventures in the fun scenery of Hollywood are fun, but thanks to the special effects this movie will work. <br /> <br /> Two people are responsible for everything - from the magic flying carpet to the giant gin that pops out of the bottle with a black whirlwind like a tornado: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (By the way, Howard did special effects for the 1961 version of the film. Both men had a long and distinguished career in technical magic.) Duprez was incredibly good, although he was little called for serious play. Justin Ahmad projects a controlled, but dreamy romanticism, untouched by erotic impulses. Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes, and he is very good. For a film intended for both children and adults, there is quite a lot of violence, but bloodless. However, I don’t think that someone under eight years old should watch The Thief of Baghdad. <br /> <br /> This film periodically appears on TV, but today, with our teenage son, we saw him in a theater in which there were quite a few people. youth present. It was great to see how children obsessed with computers in a wealthy community respond with applause and special effects applause, which should seem primitive to them. <br /> <br /> “The Thief of Baghdad” is a pre-war Hollywood classic from a time when high production values ​​often led to consistently attractive and important releases. This is one of the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
