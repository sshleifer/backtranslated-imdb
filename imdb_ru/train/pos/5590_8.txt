(There is no need to summarize the plot, as others have already done so.) <br /> <br /> It is clear that many viewers find mistakes in the film, as in the current cinema film. Against this background, the film "Ecstasy" seems to have come from another planet. I think there are several good reasons. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, the film unfolds poetically, as the camera slowly moves across the surrounding hills, trees, clouds, etc., providing a calm and lyrical sense of the natural world that unites a man and a woman in its niche. Together, they reveal style and measurement that are almost completely absent in a modern technologically oriented cinema, where high-speed editing works to divert the attention of the audience, rather than focus it. In addition, the story is transmitted by eye, not by ear, almost without dialogue, to explain what is happening. This is equivalent to another extreme deviation from today's very literal fare, when visual elements seem to matter only when they excite the audience. But perhaps the most disturbing is that the film is sometimes eerily quiet, not in the sense that silent films are quiet, because we expect them to be that way. But in the sense that characters rarely speak when we expect it. Thus, the burden of history is divided between the director and the viewer. The first must skillfully select their visual effects to convey the narration, and the second must think about these visual effects, since they will not be explained. <br /> <br /> None of this is meant to belittle today's film. -Production. This is simply to indicate that a film like the film Machati is different from what we have today is completely different. I do not pretend to be better or worse. However, I argue that Ecstasy is a perspective that is extremely lacking in today's cinematic experience, when such “contemplative values” are usually discarded as slow and boring. <br /> <br /> The film itself is not a masterpiece, although at times it reaches artistic heights, as in the beautifully decorated scene of the beer garden, when its last tap shot rises to show the exquisite scene below. The slow panorama of the countryside with its pantheistic celebration of life, nature and rebirth is also beautifully expressed. These are scenes that do not overwhelm you, but instead - with half a chance - quietly accumulate in an experience that is as memorable in its own way as the tingling type of “Jaws”. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is sometimes heavy, as, for example, when Maschaty saves images, especially in the final ode-labor sequence. It is difficult to understand what to do with this rather destructive presence. Perhaps symbolism is associated with the heroic dimension, which hard work has for a hero in love and people in general - a topic promoted by influential Soviet cinema. However, his presence here is rather tiring. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have to admit that I was originally tuned to see the magnificent Hedy Lamarr in a positive mood. But now I have to admit that in the process I also got a lot more than just a romp in the forest.
