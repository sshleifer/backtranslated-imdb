I am from Belgium, and therefore my English is rather poor, sorry for this ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those little-known films that are shown on TV only once and seem to disappear into the air. I looked through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, I watched it, and its IMDb rating exceeded 7/10, thatâ€™s pretty decent. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that this is a very well-made film, and therefore I am puzzled. This is the only film made by this director ...? Why didn't he make a lot of films after that pretty good ...? Someone with such great potential should be forced to make another film, ha ha ;-) <br /> <br /> In any case, I would really like to see him shoot his act and shoot another good movie like this one please. .....?
