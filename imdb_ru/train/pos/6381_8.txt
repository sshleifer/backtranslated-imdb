Atlantis is a new and right move for Disney. A good choice is to make a film according to such a mysterious legend as Atlantis. I didn’t have any expectations from this film, but after watching it, I don’t quite understand why this film has such bad reviews. Even in my country, reviewers were not positive. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is not an ideal film, but still one of Disney's greatest films, even I doubt that this film will ever get the reputation of Disney Classics. Well, this is another case. It's funny to think that this sci-fi film was made by the same directors as Beauty and the Beast and The Hunchback (therefore, Kirk Wise and Gary Trusdale try to escape from their reputation for monster films, hehe, I just joke ). <br /> <br /> Enough nonsense. “Atlantis” is a watchable, fascinating and very pleasant movie. Even this film is a PG-rated action movie, in my opinion, it is also suitable for children (parents who mean the opposite, don't kill me for writing this, hehe). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit predictable, but it does not destroy the film. Comic inspired animation fits the film and is different from Disney’s usual style. It is colorful, dark and detailed. Deep Canvas sequences are impressive. The film is also sometimes funny, even I giggled more than I laughed at the movie. (SPOILERS) The characters of this film are also very cute, but, unfortunately, there is not enough time on the screen to recognize everyone, so some of the characters are left behind (SPOILERS). <br /> <br /> The score of James Newton Howard is absolutely magnificent. It is bold and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive thing about this film is how they make the sound of the Atlanteans very natural, ethnic and authentic. This is really cool (SPOILERS OVER) <br /> <br /> The script is very dense and well written, but there are still some unanswered questions in the story. But, fortunately, there are not so many of them. <br /> <br /> So love yourself, do not listen to the reviewers and do not watch Atlantis, because she is waiting for you ...
