I was a fan of the work of Edward Burtynsky for many years, and it was very nice to see a person at work, thanks to the documentary Jennifer Bachewal. The harsh beauty of a shipyard in Bangladesh, a stone quarry in Vermont, a huge assembly plant in China, besieged old quarters in Shanghai, which are just waiting to be destroyed: photographers director. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I recalled old television documentaries about abandoned coal mines and factories for the production of plastic forms; something like what i was looking at. The work of Burtynsky is of great importance, indicating that industrial activity only moved to Asia, but did not stop. The oddest scene for me was a computer dump somewhere in China - the trash had a threatening look, while the workers were very funny.
