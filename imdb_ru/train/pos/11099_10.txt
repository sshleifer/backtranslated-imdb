Chase created a real phenomenon with The Sopranos. Unshakable performances, impeccable composition and great music make up, perhaps, the best show ever. <br /> <br /> All the actors are strong, but Falco and Gandolfini have earned every inch of this Emmy. Anyone who doubts this should simply try a few episodes; especially from the first few seasons. James Gandolfini is absolutely fierce, absolutely terrible, and you still love him - he is hypnotized. <br /> <br /> Many people with whom I spoke about Sopranos (who have not yet seen this) will say, “I'm just not a fan of mafia films / shows.” No difference. Run - don't go - and get it. The same people usually love “ER”, but I bet that they don’t really care about hospitals ... It’s not a context.
