By the way, back in the 1980s, long before NAFTA was developed, and corporations began to lose their national identity, the United States and Japan were angry at each other in the global race for production. Remember statements like "Union yes!", "Japanese seize this country" and "Americans are lazy?" <br /> <br /> As the Reagan era drew to a close and corporations approached the global market, the director Ron Howard made one of several trips in the comedy genre with his loud “Goong Ho” in 1986, which attracted more than $ 36 million at the US box office. Despite the fact that in many respects, Howard’s outdated history of the clash of cultures in the workplace still offers the harsh truth for industrial life today. <br /> <br /> “Goong Ho” focuses on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), Representative of the automakers' union from Headville, a small depressed town in the foothills of Pennsylvania. Stevenson was asked to visit the Assan Motor company in Tokyo (similar to the real Toyota), which is considering an operation in the USA at an empty plant in the city. Hundreds of residents were left without work, and the city is on the verge of collapse. Assan decides to move, and Stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the conveyor. <br /> <br /> Hoang’s “Ganga” 112 minutes is a humorous look at these two sides, with equal consideration of their strengths and weaknesses: on the one hand, the American workforce, which values ​​its traditions, but often falls into insanity pride and the trade union movement; Japanese workers, on the other hand, are extremely committed to their work, but lack personal satisfaction and self-esteem. In Stevenson, we find an American worker with an average level of intelligence who can communicate with people through misunderstandings. With the survival of the jobs of his workers and most of Headville on the line, Stevenson turns out to be a pleasant guy who wants nothing but a fair chance, although his ingenuity will plunge him into a lot of trouble. In addition to answering the questions of the chapters of Assan, we are witnessing the delicate balance between Stevenson and his trade union colleagues, with many of whom he grew up. These include Buster (George Wendt), Willie (John Turturro) and Paul (Clint Howard, Ron's brother). <br /> <br /> The Japanese cast is headed by Gedde Watanabe, also known as “Sixteen Candles” and “Volunteers”. Watanabe plays Kazihiro, the manager of the plant, which is not lucky, and he begins to sympathize with American life. Saito (Sub Shimono), the nephew of CEO Assan, is desperately trying to take his place in the slander. Despite the light touch, these characters very well convey the ideas of the Japanese working culture. <br /> <br /> With Hant Stevenson dominating the screenplay, Michael Keaton must demonstrate solid work for this film. Gung Ho is a real success for Keaton, who also teamed up with Ron Howard in 1994 at The Paper. He made this film during a series of light roles, which included "Mr. Mom," Beetle-Sap "and" Dream Team ", before going to" Batman "," One Good Policeman "and" My Life ". It is also difficult not to like the performance of Gedda Watanabe in the role of a strange man who first wears Japanese tapes of shame, and then unites with Stevenson to make the automobile plant a whole. <br /> <br /> Auxiliary cast - Top Notch, including Wendt, Turturro, Simono, and So Yamamur as Assan Sakamoto’s CEO. Mimi Rogers is of romantic interest as Audrey, Hunt's girlfriend. Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz and Babalu Mandel have teamed up to create Gong Ho. Random Music, which received the BMI Film Music Award, was written by Thomas Newman. The songs of the Gong Ho soundtrack are written in the style of the 80s, including “Don't get me wrong”, “Tuff Enuff” and “The Man of the Working Class”. <br /> <br /> In fact, the success of "Goong Ho" led to a short-lived series on ABC. Although Ron Howard’s film is even more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago, it still has its comic value. It is available on DVD as part of the Paramount widescreen collection and is slightly modified. Audio options are provided in English 5.1 Surround, English Dolby Surround and French 'dubbing', but the subtitles are in English only. There are no add-ons, not even a theatrical trailer. On the other hand, the Paramount digital transmission is quite good, with a small amount of grain after the initial credits and high sound quality. Although some additions would be helpful - especially if Gung Ho was a box office success - there is little to complain about the presentation of the film itself. <br /> <br /> *** of 4
