To the attention of Chuck Davis and Amefi: I saw the Phantom Lady many years ago when I was not a jazz lover. Until the end of June, there will be an exhibition in the new Parisian MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY called LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, which should not be missed, as a special NINE entertainment program - excerpts from jazz films, including the famous PHANTOM LADY drum sequence. I saw Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr. - in almost all of their appearances in the film, and I can confirm the following: 1. Elisha Cook Jr. was duplicated in the film. This was some progress, as in most of his other speeches he was killed (mostly in Howard Hawks Больш The Big Dream). 2. Groats, probably dubbed Cook in PL. I could recognize his style, as he had already graduated from the volume that was used (and offended) at the beginning of his career, namely in the SING, SING, SING sequence of the Hollywood HOTEL of 1937, and eventually got everything that was possible what we call in French "la caisse claire". 3. The sequence from PL, at least as shown in the museum, is not subject to censorship. Harry Carasso, Paris, France
