"Tenant" - the greatest film of Roman Polanski IMO. And I love Chinatown, but this one is much more original, unusual, and just plain creepy. This is also a great black comedy. Some people to whom I showed this film were * very concerned about this afterwards, so keep in mind that this does affect some people. Polanski copes with the role of the protagonist in the "Tenant", and also directs it.
