Simple, meaningful and delivering an emotional blow. I regularly run around boring short films, and it is always nice to meet something that has a simple and enlightened message, without complaints or self-deprecating guidance. <br /> <br /> A boy at school must attend a lesson when his friend skips lessons and gets the most important lesson in his life, but discovers that when he has not enough copies, he has to share with the school bully. <br /> <br /> Unlike most short films with children or actors, these children keep themselves, and this is plausible. The soundtrack perfectly complements the emotions of the work, and the highlight of the film works well.
