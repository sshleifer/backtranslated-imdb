One of my favorite movies with a very nostalgic ending. The film tells about the Sullivans family, it is obvious that Michael Sullivan (father) is one of the main members of the mafia, a killer who says so, and an expert. One of the children wants to know his father’s work (a terrible mistake), so he is hiding behind his father’s car, and he sees Tom Hanks well in action to say so. <br /> <br /> Mafia does not know In the mafia, no one wins, when they want you to come out, they killed you. Of course, you can see anyone who works in the mafia with a giant house, the best car in the world, anything, but does the wrong job or does what your “boss” doesn't want, and you are fired and killed. <br /> <br /> You can see what I mean in the film, Sullivan Junior sees what he didn’t need to see, and almost all of his family die for this “wrong thing” his son did. The film is really interesting, you can see how Sullivan lives after being pursued by the mafia, or something like that. <br /> <br /> This film is rather sad, shows us revenge, these dirty deeds that people do, almost everything you like. I hope that the guy reads this comment, it does not work for the mafia, and if you work in the mafia, do yourself a favor and get out of the country before you are killed by your boss and their employees. <br /> <This movie gets: 10/10
