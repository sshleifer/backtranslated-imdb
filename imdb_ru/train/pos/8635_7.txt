"California" is a good Hollywood odyssey of expectation and terror, telling about two couples traveling cross country to California to share the cost of gas: a pair of losers (Lewis and Pitt) and two imitation artists, a photographer and a writer (Duchovny and Forbes). Pitt nails his character, which is the center of this somewhat predictable thriller. Good watch for those who are addicted to psycho-killer.
