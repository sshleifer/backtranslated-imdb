This is a really interesting movie. It is an action with mixed comedy. Foxx teams up with comedian Epps in this film to give it a comedic character. It makes you think about what will happen next with Foxx. It was a well-made film, the director used the correct colors in this film (dark blue) to give it the right look. Kimberly Elise also starred in this film, and it's always nice to see her on the big screen. She plays her part well. Even Jamie Kennedy in this movie. It is worth seeing that you did not see it. It is definitely worth having if you are a Jamie Fox fan. It deserves more trust than it actually is.
