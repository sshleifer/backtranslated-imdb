Hot Millions is a great movie in every way. A fun, unusual story with wonderful performances by four top professionals who have ever worked in business. Peter Ustinov, as usual, is magnificent, and Maggie Smith - definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time - causes complete admiration. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart complete the cast and are also excellent. If you want a movie that has the perfect cast, here it is. What is impressive is how these people work with each other in such a natural and easy way, creating lots of laughter and fun moments everywhere. Peter Ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor, and this is one of his most memorable ideas. Direction, photography and editing are also top-notch, and this is an excellent London time capsule in the 60s. This is definitely on my list of favorites of all time.
