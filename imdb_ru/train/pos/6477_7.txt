Five Days is something special, a crime drama consisting of a series of episodes, each of which takes place on one particular day of a police investigation. But in fact, this element of the story turns out to be much less significant than one would have thought at first, since the fact that the action in each episode is limited to 24 hours is hardly noticeable and distinguishes the program very much from countless others. crime stories. In fact, it is almost impossible not to make a comparison with the latest “Main Suspect”, since one of the supporting stories is about a lonely, cynical woman policing, approaching retirement: and not only Helen Mirren’s absence makes comparisons unprofitable, there are many serious excessive emotions, manipulative music and a set of characters, seemingly contrived, so that each of them is in some sense responsive, and in the other suspicious. And you can guess the guilty side long before the end, not because of the internal dynamics of the story, but rather because of the drama building in general: certain things must be true to justify how the series focuses on certain characters at certain times. Despite these shortcomings, the series has grown on me: by the end I was pretty gripped. But this is a sad sign that the BBC, which once earned the role of “The Singing Detective”, boasted about this, “perhaps the best drama of the year”: there is little genuine originality, and the lawsuit reveals a lack of ambition that terribly disappoints . “Five Days” is not really rubbish; but this is a formula, and one can hope that the best that the BBC can offer will be something more innovative and fresh.
