As soon as you lifted your jaw from the floor from the knowledge that they ... somehow ... managed to collect this thing so quickly that it was released the same year that the case ended, you would find that too bad, the plot is interesting and interesting, and the pace is fast, which covers many situations, and therefore often quickly moves on to the next one or two lines. Where it really stands out is acting. The performances are great. Neil and Streep are both flawless. It’s also great to hear so many Australians being spoken in a Hollywood film, and even those who don’t come to it naturally, at least try to emphasize. Cinematography and editing are good enough, but in fact they do not go beyond standard things. The story of this film is irresistible, and the fact that it is genuine makes it even more frightening. Although I did not read the novel and did not hear about what happened outside of this picture, I understand that it is quite close to the truth. It has moderate to strong language and disturbing content. Sometimes it's just a great drama in the courtroom. I recommend this to any fan of this. 7/10
