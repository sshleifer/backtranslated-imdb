Looking at some of the negative posts, you are really wondering what some people do for fun .... <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see the film during its too short theatrical performance. The audience laughed. I watch the tape with her when I type the text, and she's still damn funny! <br /> <br /> She also has a nice side, with unexpected twists of real pathos. The late, great Royal Dano is particularly effective as the lonely, unlucky farmer Renchm√ºller. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson is great as leading kids. And actors in Martian costumes, although limited to pantomime, do an excellent job. <br /> <br /> Another thing to pay attention to is the background details. The film is full of honors, meanness and references to other fantastic and fantastic films. Take a look at the martian costumes next time. One of them is dressed in a Marty McFly costume, the other is a ghost hunter, the third is dressed in the Atreides House uniform, and the fourth is in a Last Starfighter flight costume.
