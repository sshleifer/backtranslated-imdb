Not wanting to give away * anything * here, I would just say that this technically excellent, flawlessly acting and inspiring little film will reward the viewer with excellent entertainment for one and a half hours: it will amuse, surprise, sometimes embarrass and almost certainly pull from time to time in hearts, when it approaches the inevitable, but not obvious, it ends without becoming clich√©d or predictable. Definitely recommended. <br /> <br /> A previous user comment gives 8 out of 10 for a film and 10 out of 10 for outstanding performances Bran and Bonham-Carter - I completely agree ...
