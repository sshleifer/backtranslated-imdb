This film is so old that I never understood what young Ray Milland looked like in 1936, I remember how he played in the gorgeous film Lost Weekend. Ray plays the role of Michael Stewart, a very rich banker. This photo shows three girls who are not very happy that their father and mother are separated, and they find out that their father is going to marry a young blonde who is mining gold and is only looking for a rich dad. They hire a person who pretends to be a very rich earl, his name is Count Aristairs (Misha Auer), who is drunk all the time, penniless and a lot of funny laughs throughout the whole picture. Deanna Durbin (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was booked at the police station, and told the police chief that she was an opera star, and then Penny began to sing in the most fantastic soprano voice I ever heard, the entire police department and the convicts began to applaud That was a very interesting and enjoyable scene from this movie. This is Dina Durbin's first film debut, and she instantly succeeded overnight, and after leaving MGM she became an excellent movie star at Universal Studios.
