Not sure if this can be called an anti-war film, it shows the war on an elite level. These are elite troops who know what they are doing and are proud of it. Even when they are pacifists, they still enjoy the level of skill and defeat their enemies, even if it goes against being a pacifist. The films are slow and rather unprecedented, and in many ways they are rather boring, since war films go more by today's standards, not a single part of the body soared, as in modern films. It is cruel in other respects, although, as you see, the murder is on a personal level. This is more a movie about a thinking person. As soon as you start watching, you do not want to miss anything. Thoughts about the people in the film and their interactions are what the film is about, not the fight itself or the big exciting storyline. This can be called a war thriller. <br /> <br /> If you understand military art, if you read or see programs about SAS, etc., YOU WANT TO LOOK THIS FILM !!!!! <br /> <br /> Comparable films: The Hill (1965) with Sean Connery, the 49th parallel (1941) with the participation of all the stars, The Naked and the Dead (1958) with Cliff Robertson. All of them are unusual and show war on a personal level. Enjoy!
