Although time has shown how some of the effects were made, this love and adventure story is still special. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen this movie before you are shocked by how much later the filmmakers were stolen. I watched it with a friend who was amazed at how much Aladdin Disney had gained from the film. They liked the film, and he liked that it became such a touchstone for many other films and directors. <br /> <br /> I gave the film 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10, which is where most of this film lives because in the last 15 minutes the film falls apart at a pace. Everything is in a hurry, as if they should suddenly get to the end. From the moment of the genie's departure and ending with the end, he looks more like a sketch than a finished picture. It does not kill the film, but it weakens it. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is necessary to watch it for everyone who loves a good fairy tale or even a great movie.
