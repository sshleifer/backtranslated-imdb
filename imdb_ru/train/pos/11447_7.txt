This movie is probably for you. He had a total meditative quality from music to beautiful photography and listening to the often life cliches that Andy Goldsworthy would say when working or between shots. If you are familiar with Buddhism, this is the feeling I got from this film. The impermanence of life, the beauty of nature, the interconnectedness of all things, etc. However, what I did not understand embarrassed and eventually forced me to leave without end (I saw more than an hour of this) was redundancy. All of this. You will only learn why he received the order, and how he can afford to live at the expense of this kind of work. The work of art comes to life, but all his conversations without conclusions lead to a dead end.
