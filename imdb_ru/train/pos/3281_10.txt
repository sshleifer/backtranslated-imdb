Who would have thought that such an obscure little film could be so ghostly and touching? I am really impressed. It's a shame that more people have not seen this. I loved, as always, the account of Hans Zimmer. And what a directorial debut of Bernard Rose! And yet I wonder if I should call it a horror movie. It can easily be argued that this is fiction or drama. Well, no matter what, I love the interpretive potential that he has. Everything and everyone in Anna's dreams (played by Charlotte Burke) represents a real conflict in her life ... the house itself, the tree, Mark, the lighthouse, etc. It is these details that make the film so good for replays. I hope that soon I will meet another small film filled with emotions and psychological meaning.
