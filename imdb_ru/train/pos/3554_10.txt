Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra hated each other during the filming of this film and in subsequent years. Brando asked Sinatra several singing lessons, but Sinatra (who was already upset because he played Nathan Detroit when he wanted to play Sky Masterson) wanted to be a star singer in a production and didnâ€™t want anyone it was better than him. He told Brando to get lost, so to take revenge on him, Marlon ruined everything at the diner where Sinatra ate a cheesecake, so that he had to continue to eat, eat and eat. In subsequent years, Sinatra gave Brando the nickname "Mumbles" or "Mr. Mumbles" for the way he speaks.
