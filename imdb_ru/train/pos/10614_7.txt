Three girls (a media team consisting entirely of women, including iconic actress Barbara Bach, no less) visit a small town to cover the festival, and end up renting rooms in a house that they should have avoided like a plague. A well-made little shocker, a little suffering from some unnecessary scenes of dialogue and a rather thin storyline (which does not hide its secrets very well). One of the main themes, in particular, is rather alarming (as, for example, vintage shock material), and this is basically what the film thrives on. Performances and cinematography are largely above par (compared to many other films from the late 70s - early 80s in the same vein), but what really makes me recommend this film is a rather long climax scene in the basement. From the moment the Keller Junior character was introduced, his performance made me open my jaw and it didn’t close until the end of the movie. A very pleasant surprise when the actor Sidney Lassik (who was amusedly entertained in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” and now completely insane in “The Invisible”) plays one of the main roles.
