I really liked this movie. Britney is a great role model for teens and should be valued more. This film is about following your dreams and never giving up, no matter what people do or say, to discourage and criticize you. Holly fulfills her dreams just like Britney. <br /> <br /> In the life of every person there are cases when people judge him for who he is not. After watching this film, you will realize that you are special in your own way and that you should follow your dreams no matter what. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. She will never know how much this means to me. Bravo Britney. You are the best!!!
