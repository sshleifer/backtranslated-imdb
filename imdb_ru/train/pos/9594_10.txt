Although many, unfortunately, have passed away, the ballroom scene is still alive and continues its legacy. Some are still very much alive and well, Octavia is more radiant and beautiful than ever, Willy Ninja is very experienced and has a lot of support for the gay community as a whole, Pepper Labey has just gone past year for natural reasons Let the earth rest in peace. After the death of Anji, Carmen became the mother of the house of Stravaganza (she was on the beach), and she, too, looks more and more beautiful. Some balls have categories dedicated to those who passed, let them all rest in peace. Another project currently being implemented, known as “How do I look?”, You can visit the website www.howdoilooknyc.org.
