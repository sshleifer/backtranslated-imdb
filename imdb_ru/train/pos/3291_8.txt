A great movie, and a shame that it will attract little attention outside the arthouse houses and students who stay until two o'clock in the morning to watch it on Channel Four. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but it works very effectively, the blur between a child’s fantasy and a terrible nightmare is very blurry. The budget looks quite low, but, fortunately for those who participate in it, this does not manifest too often. It also did not date so much. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to record it on a TV set when it was several years ago, and it withstood half a dozen views. This is one of those films that not everyone will like; although, as usual, those who have a more thoughtful approach to the movie would have benefited a lot. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Burke played a good role in the role of Anna, a spoiled girl, and she seems to be ashamed to leave the acting scene. Cross is also very good, keeping his character well in the context of the picture. <br /> <br /> In this film there are some really (and I’m not saying that slightly) disturbing moments, both shocking half seconds and more tense tensions. Watch it with the lights off! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
