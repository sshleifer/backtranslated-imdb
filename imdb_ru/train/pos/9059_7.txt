This is a good movie, a good family movie to see if you have nothing else to do. If you expect this film to be word for word from a book, you will be very, very disappointed. I was somewhat disappointed, because I read a book several times when I was in elementary school. <br /> <br /> This is about a new baby in a city named Billy. He bets with a school bully, and this bet is not like most bets. Billy must eat 10 worms in one day, or the bully will win. <br /> <br /> The game is fine, perhaps the worst part of the movie. Kid actors are exaggerating in many things. They think it's an apocalypse if Billy doesn't eat worms. Halley Eisenberg did a great job. <br /> <br /> The storyline is as good as a movie, but sucks as an adaptation of a book. I could watch this movie, despite the time .... sometimes. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a good family film with some weaknesses. I rate this movie 7/10.
