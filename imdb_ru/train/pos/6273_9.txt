I really liked this film, yes, I know that it was rather far-fetched, since Shelby’s car would not have been able to stay on the road as well as the 540i with all the traction control functions and other gizmos, except for all of this the film was well composed. Cage was great, as usual, and the rest of the actors were also pretty good, except for the Brit Bad Bad Boy, he was a little “too”, wasn't he? Anyway, great movie, great cars and great acting. For example, I made sure that my car was locked and alarmed in my garage with a remote control that night. :)
