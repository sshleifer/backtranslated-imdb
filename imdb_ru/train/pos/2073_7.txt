In 1958, Clarksberg was a famous city of speed traps. A large income was received from the sheriff's department, which caught the speeders. Those who tried to overtake the sheriff? Well, it gave the sheriff a chance to push them away from the Clarksberg curve with the help of his cruiser in Plymouth. For example, at the beginning of the film, several servicemen on vacation, trying to return to base on time, are forced to die, if I remember correctly. Then one day a stranger drove into the city. Perhaps the coolest hot rodder in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is the name of the car, as in the McCord gaskets. Perhaps this is the perfect hot rod. Black Flaming 34th Ford Coupe. The colors of death, evil and hellfire. The sheriff specifically takes him for speeding. He checks the location of the earth. He is the brother of one of the victims of the sheriff. He knows how his brother died. The Clarksburg government is all in favor of the sheriff. There is only one way to achieve justice for the murder of his brother and rectify the situation so that “this will never happen again”: recreate the chase and approve the adversary's style of adversity to death. He goes to the curve and practices. Sheriff knows that McCord knows. The race begins ... This is a film that will be remembered by anyone who has ever tried to master maneuvering on a certain section of the road.
