My mom took me with her to watch this movie when it came out on 1976 Christmas. Then I liked it, and I love it now. I know everyone laughs at Barbraâ€™s hair in this one, but I think she looks and sounds great! ... And I seem to remember many women who copied this veiled look at that time! Also, the scene in the bathroom between Streisand and Christopherson is just so sexy! The music is great too. These are great grandmothers of the 70s at its best!
