A crazy and graphically bloody Japanese film about how little creatures capture people and turn them into necorg-like zombie machines that beat and smash each other so that the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of this, a pair of lovers becomes infected. <br /> <br /> A technically excellent horror comedy (?). Designed only for those who have a strong stomach, when blood and body parts fly. Good taste does not allow me to describe what is happening here, but let's just say that it is pretty awful. If you like these things with the form a few steps above the thin content, by all means watch this movie. Personally, I, as a rule, are not one of those who love such films on anything, besides how sick and perverted they are. Here I was so intrigued that I could offer it to people I know who like really awful movies. It is also a film with enough details that I want to see again, since now I know what is happening, how in the end I want to go back and see what I did not understand. Internal logic is rarely found in these films. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 for those who love blood and severed limbs is zero or, more precisely, running and hiding the alarm for everyone else.
