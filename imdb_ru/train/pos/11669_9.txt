Being the prototype of the classic adventure film “Errol Flynn” and having a good story, as well as two more brilliant colleagues in Maureen O'Hara (what a refined beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, I can recommend this film only to everyone even the slightest love of romance and adventure. <br /> <br /> Hollywood at its best!
