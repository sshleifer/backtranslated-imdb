In this 1934 film, Bette Davis plays the cool funny role of Mildred Rogers. The film seems to be rather outdated now, in 2003. Without a doubt, it’s worth looking at movie lovers and Bette Davis fans, but perhaps today it’s not so attractive to the average viewer. I was amazed to see how young Mrs. Davis looks like in this movement. Actors turn into performances that mostly sound, and the story makes sense and is interesting. Leslie Howard perfectly played the role of Philip Carey, a medical student. This is a movie with a strong message about who we love and why. However, “Of Human Bondage” did not seem to have a strong influence on me either mentally or emotionally. After watching the film, I felt a little indifferent and detached from the film. I have an intuition that this may be the reaction that the director hoped for. Be the judge! <br /> <br />
