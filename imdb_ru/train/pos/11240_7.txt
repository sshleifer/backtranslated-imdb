Brit Pop's low-budget melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to become a star, becomes her, and then finds it all too much. Good composition and a sense of time and place can not hide the fact that we have all been here before. Several scenes are a bit hysterical, and O'Connor's voice is very similar to the Mini Mouse! She disappeared from sight shortly after the creation of this film - so life can imitate art! Be sure to see if you want to see the punk version of Star Is Born.
