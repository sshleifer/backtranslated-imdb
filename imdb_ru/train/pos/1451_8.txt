I saw this movie about 6 times. And every time I look at it, I’m more impressed with the story and the actions. It's like watching the train fall apart. His subtle approach, but very effective in achieving his goal. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> In the center of the plot is a very good dichotomy. On the one hand, we have a deputy major, Eddie Calhoun (Cusack), who unknowingly tears the network of old boys, which forms the heart of a major in the New York administration, and on the other hand, we have a mafia boss, Zappati, who intentionally tries to maintain status quo by all necessary means. This situation finally ends nicely when Zappati orders Alselmo to simplify his life by killing himself, and Calhoun orders Pappas to do the same from a political point of view. <br /> <br /> The film also has some really good lines. for example (my personal weakness): - You don’t summarize a person’s life in one moment - The only thing that is new in this world is a story you don’t know <br /> <br /> In general, an excellent film that deserves much more high rating.
