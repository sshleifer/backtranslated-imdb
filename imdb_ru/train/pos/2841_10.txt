As a Paris Je'Taime fan, I went to New York, I love you with very high expectations. I happily went out with all my expectations. It was fun, cute, fast and interesting. The film begins with two funnels (Bradley Cooper and Justin Barth), who are trying to get to the same area, but argue in which direction to go. It was fun, and then the movie goes into some of the best scenes I've ever seen. Of all the good were four amazing. Those four that I'll start talking about. One of them is Shiite LaBouf as a messenger in a hotel who finds love with an elderly woman. In the next photo, Orlando Bloom is a music producer who does business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. On the other, Anton Yelchin and Olivia Tirbly are depicted as two people going to graduation, Tirbly’s character becomes an invalid. The best of them - Eli Wallach and Cloris Lichman as an elderly elderly couple. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Natale Portman makes an impressive directorial directorial debut and writes a parody about the caretaker, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as a flirting person and prostitute. New York, I love you, of course, is just as good, if not better, than the 2006 Paris Je'Taime. The parody is well developed, and the film shows what should be indie films. In the film, however, there are not so many famous directors as in “Paris Je'Taime”, therefore it was fantastic to justify his superiority. If you want to laugh, see great dramatic effects, see an amazing amount of great performances and just have fun, then be sure to go to New York, I love you.
