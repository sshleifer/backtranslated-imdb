I remember this show, because it became an ordinary viewing on Saturday evening. <br /> <br /> Sabrina is a young girl who comes with her aunts, who, as it turns out, is a witch, and she is alone. Therefore, Sabrina must learn to control her strength and use them effectively. She also has to deal with the school of the evil contender named Libby, her best friend and boyfriend Harvey Kinkle ... <br /> <br /> The show was fun and interesting. Saturday nights entertained a 10-year-old boy ... and made him laugh out loud ... And flirt with "Libby" ....
