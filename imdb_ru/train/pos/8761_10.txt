I love Claire Danes, and Kate Beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role. The film has flaws only because it seems that the two accused seem to be in some Monastery, working like monks in the grass and in strict discipline, similar to the martial arts. The acting, the filmography and the amazing colors of what is supposed to be in Thailand attract attention, but Claire Danes steals the entire movie and unexpectedly deeply learned the hard lesson of life itself until the very end in action. amazing unselfishness, unheard of and completely unexpected in the real world. The flaws are minor, and I recommend the film, which, unfortunately, is buried forever in rare television series. For example, I want a film for my collection - a collection of films with a rating of "10". Watch this, you will be very touched.
