We were lucky to see this fantastic film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. At the entrance to the theater we were given a small card with an opinion that will be used for our personal movie rating. Looking at the postcard, I turned to my wife and said: “What do you think, how many films in your life can you rate as excellent? For me, it's only about 5. ” But then, watching the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser, watching the breathtaking scenery in a movie setting in New York State, I gradually began to raise the movie into categories at a time. Of course, it was good, but the completely natural repertoire of actors and award-winning performance from a man who, unfortunately, will surely be remembered rather thanks to a detective in a raincoat, and not from this film, the film rose to an excellent level. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, there were few dry eyes in the house, and my usually stoic and heartless heart melted just like Grinch's heart, and in the end I got it perfectly. <br /> <br /> This picture is required for those who have parents. No violence or nudity, but some strong language.
