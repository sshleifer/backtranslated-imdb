What a masterpiece Take the conflict of the Cold War and transfer it to the future. This film is a higher order satire. In my humble opinion, this is ahead of Dr. Strenglova. <br /> <br /> The clever name of the two superpowers, the Confederation and the Market. Cons are communes and bazaars, west! outstanding. Clever use of gen joxs was ahead of its time. only we really see the dangers of genetic engineering. Robot Jocks solved this problem in 1989. <br /> <br /> This film tells about the friendship of a humble person and how he can overcome the wishes of the government. This film screams: DON'T DO IT, WHAT YOU THINK, ALL YOU KILL ALL. <br /> <br /> EXCELLENT 10/10.
