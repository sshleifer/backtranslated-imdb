This early film "Anime" was a pretty good film that I once shot on the channel "Science Fiction", when "Anime" was really popular here in America, and not a rating disaster, which, according to an adult swimmer, is in the network of cartoons . I, frankly, think that this is due not so much to being less popular, but to the fact that people now prefer to buy DVDs and watch episodes not cut on the Internet. Although this film probably did not have such a number of cuts, and dubbing was normal for a dubbed film, although I would prefer to watch the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use rather annoying voices for children in all that they call. This film tells about a boy who takes a train called the Galactic Express, in the hope that he will be able to get to the planet, which has technology that turns him into a robot. He wants to become a robot, to avenge his mother, who was brutally murdered by the hands of a robot that hunts people for fun. In the course of his adventures, he made friends with various workers on board the train, as well as with a woman like his late mother, a beautiful woman named Matel, who, like most women in anime films, has a secret that can really be good for our young hero or very bad. He also moves from planet to planet when the train makes various stops, and he encounters a space pirate named Captain Harlock, who appeared to be filming in his own animated series, so Galaxy Express takes place mainly in this universe. In general, a very good trip with a rather strange and unexpected finale. It would have been a continuation of this, but it was not as good as this one, however the final was a little more definitive than here.
