A typical comedy of the 90s, situational comedy, similar to our modern "My Family". Thatcher, who is the pinnacle of most political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) blames Thatcher for everything she can. Bloody Thatcher may have shared with most of us. David, a typical teenager cutting brains with bread knives, Jenny, a naughty older teenage girl, is interested only in boys and a large number of boys. Bill and Ben do their best to keep their family afloat, fighting in the economic climate of the early 1990s. Of course, the first two series were not as successful as the last, however, in Series 3 and then more and more laughter begins, which I want to count. Overall, this show didnâ€™t have a better viewing time, and they had to last a little longer. Obviously, they could not continue after the death of Gary Olsen, but I think that they should get rid of "Catherine Tate", "office", "Little Britain" and return the classics!
