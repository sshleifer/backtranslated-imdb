After watching WW1's rather sloppy spy thriller Madame Lily (1969) with Julie Andrews starring on television this afternoon, I suddenly thought that I had seen a much better WW1 spy thriller. All I could remember was that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. It took only a short search in IMDB to find the fraraulein Doctor. As soon as I recognized the name, the memories returned. For its time, this is a fairly well thought out story revolving around real events, such as the death of Kitchener and the German offensive in 1918. She also has a spy woman who is much more believable than Julie Andrews! Like other reviewers, the first and most powerful memory was of well-prepared battle scenes and of people and horses in gas masks. If you have an interest in war films and especially WW1, this is a film that is worth seeing if you have such an opportunity.
