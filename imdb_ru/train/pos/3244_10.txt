I could not agree with the comments of Nomad 7 and I A HVR. Perfect quiet Sunday morning movie. Subtle humor (the exact opposite of "farce", as one misled commentator noted). <br /> <br /> But it always ceases to amaze me how often I want to return to this film again and again. I originally copied this film on VHS about 12 years ago, when its premiere took place in one of the free preview previews of the weekend with cable television (maybe HBO?). Never heard of it before. I do not know why it did not sell so well. ?? When the DVDs were released massively, it was one of the first films I replaced. Great combination of acting and writing. In addition, the back of the Montana desert does not harm either (beautifully). <br /> <br /> It may not be for all the type of comedy, but what is it? If things like Adam Sandler are in your alley, it probably won't be your cup of tea. This film requires your full attention. Humor is mostly in dialogue. <br /> <br /> I suppose that my next review will be roughly my 12th. But I still know that when he gets to scenes like the one where police cars start dropping, I will lose him (Ed O'Neill's face is priceless!). 110% recommended.
