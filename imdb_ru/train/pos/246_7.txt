How could I miss the chance to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I could not, and so I removed this mess from the movie. <br /> <br /> I have never heard of Ned Kelly and was surprised to learn about the legend of this young man. I was also surprised at how mediocre this film was. Perhaps due to the fact that it was very, very late and at the end of the 4-hour marathon, or maybe because it was really a little slow, it was difficult for me to follow this story. Not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow history, Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting, dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Although I find it difficult to recommend it for granted, this is a great story of Australian history (considering how young the country is, it is very rare and should be appreciated), and there are some sequences of good actions in the film. <br /> <br /> 6/10 look at the historical value .... (yes, that's right ... and this is the only reason to see it ;;))
