A gang of roses. "Each rose has its own thorns." <br /> <br /> A blend of old westerns and hip-hop that blend perfectly with each other. Clothing styles, scenery and plot correspond to what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> The plot - in five years they robbed twenty-seven banks, and then disappeared without a trace. Now the little western city is under siege, and one of the first victims is Sister Rachel. The gang of roses is ready for the trip again. And this time it is personal. <br /> <br /> Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil Kim), Maria (Lissaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacy Dash), five female shooters who broke up after five years of driving together . When Sister Rachel is killed, she ends up gathering friends again and driving on the path of revenge. <br /> <br /> Good, dirty western version. (If you saw “Bad Girls,” it's a little better for female characters.) <br /> <br /> I gave it a 10/10, because the characters, the plot and the scenery made it for me,
