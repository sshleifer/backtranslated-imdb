Meek, tiny, almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes something huge out of it. In front and behind the camera, he creates one of the most awkward masterpieces that I had the pleasure of seeing, seeing and seeing again. It never let me down. People, even people who know me well, thought / thought that something was wrong with me, based on my attractiveness, or, I would say, devotion to "Le Locataire". it is something irresistiblely exciting in the darkness of Polanski, and I did not even mention the humor. The secret surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant, the secret that captures him and, of course, us, me. This is the building where the great Academy Award winners lived: Melvin Douglas, Shelley Winters, Joe Van Fleet, Lila Kedrova. For those who love movies, this is a must see. One, two, three, many, many views.
