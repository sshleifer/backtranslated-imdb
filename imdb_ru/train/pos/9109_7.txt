Basically this is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution. The competition was easy to understand, but usually the directors start with a historical fact to talk about something else, or they also show the period before or after this fact, everything happens during the couple of days when the revolution is working. This can also be viewed as a kind of documentary. The film focuses on these two people, showing, as usual, they are not like ordinary heroes, because the revolution comes from people. Although it was made from the name of the military army, you can understand that they were simply "capitals" as the main characters. Good colors and lights throughout the film, great work for the director, being her first film, she does not fall on the common path. Well manifested emotions and passion of people and the crowd. The character of Maya (the main one) is well done, and there is also a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi, who is able to show the limits of Maya, it is not to be a hero.
