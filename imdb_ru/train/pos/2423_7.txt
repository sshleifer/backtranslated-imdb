“Get into life” means that once a bully is always a bully, and no one can enter or exit Life for free. District bullies in New York sell drugs and scammers because they can't do it in the legal world, perhaps because they have a criminal record, or a drug habit, or because they are just lazy. This simple story with a couple of turns about the most disgusting characters managed to attract compassion to the audience of the main players due to their loyalty and compassion for each other. The film is written by producer and director Lawrence Fishburne, who also starred in the role of Mike 20/20 (all hooligans have nicknames), and is based on his play “Riff Ruff”. It looks like a game from start to finish, especially during the longest scene, where the three main players decide who to trust. Often the dialogue appears very quickly, much faster than on the stage, and I think this is the biggest drawback of the film. Memories reproduced in the film are mixed with poems from the street, a kind of iambic five-pointed rap, cruel and evocative of the world that this film reveals. Poetry makes it difficult to dismiss these people, these hooligans who kill, cheat and betray each other, as unworthy of our attention or below our contempt. The worrying thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but also how they suffer for the same reasons as we all do. One is too stupid, the other is an addict, and the latter suffers from conscience, while the public is surprised or even laughs at the irony of the executioners, who demand from him to hang on the gallows to tell jokes at the height of his death.
