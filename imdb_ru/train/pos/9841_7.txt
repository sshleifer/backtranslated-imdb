I love cartoons. They can show that films with “real” actors and scenery cannot, although computer effects change this more and more. They can push the boundaries of satire ("The Simpsons"), good taste ("South Park"), spectacles ("Aladdin") or reality ("Toy Story"). There are several good examples of this in the Ice Age, for example, when we see a colorful herd of extinct mammals migrating through the countryside and chatting like old friends. It is pleasant to watch such scenes, because we feel both familiar and strange at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. Although the Ice Age is not as good as the best animated films of all time, it is a really funny movie. Lean back, enjoy a deliberate anachronism, beautiful background and belly laugh. <br /> <br /> The story follows Manfred by a grumpy mammoth, Sid, an idiotic sloth, and Diego, a saber-toothed tiger, when they adopt The human child returned to his tribe for very different reasons. On the road, of course, they have a lot of problems. Also throughout the journey, Skrat appears, the most unfortunate rodent in history, who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter: in glaciers, on top of dead trees, in ice caves. His opening scene is a classic. <br /> <br /> This is a simple story with a very predictable end and middle, which is just a series of funny incidents with the addition of some character creation moments, but some scenes, such as diapers or dodo, are funny, cute animals, and it looks OK. There is another very touching moment when the mammoth cave paintings come to life in front of Manfred. <br /> <br /> Not necessary to watch, but have a good time or so. <br /> 7/10
