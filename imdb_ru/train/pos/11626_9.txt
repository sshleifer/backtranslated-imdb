This is a great, fast-paced thriller by Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street), which leaves the supernatural aside for 85 minutes and gives us something even more terrifying - the evil of people. We are more often faced with the good evil of Jackson Rippner, than with Freddy Krueger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) copes with the presentation of a sociable, friendly and even charismatic killer. The appearances of Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire, from The Wedding Crashers) are brilliant. Most of the film takes place on a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes, their faces. This action is on a small scale, not a wide coverage of the canvas, and it is no less convincing for these restrictions. There is nothing special in cinema, although, of course, it can only be done with a camera on a passenger plane, but the dialogue is excellent, the plot is tight. There are no distractions, no plots that confuse the problem, which is based on the battle of the main characters. By keeping the focus and avoiding distractions, Wes Craven can take a very minimal plot and turn it into an exciting, dynamic action movie.
