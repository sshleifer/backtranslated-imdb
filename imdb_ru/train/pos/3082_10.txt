What is really sad is that a show like Six Degree's and Brothers & Sisters is a real reality show, and not the garbage that is nothing but famous game shows. I think a surge of discontent has been there over the past few years with a very premature cancellation of numerous shows followed by a cult. But with a stronger negative reaction from Jericho fans (which I also like) and other shows, networks may begin to reverse this trend. I, like the others, will not support ANY new shows until they are given a second season. Then I may decide to watch and watch via DVD and online viewing. Until then, ABC, you lost me as a viewer on any new show.
