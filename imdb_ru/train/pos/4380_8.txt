This is a very good, underrated action movie / drama / and a bit of a historical film. <br /> <br /> The main story concerns Rob Roy’s borrowing £ 1000, his theft, and the problems he causes to his family and indirectly to his clan members. <br /> <br /> Cunningham (Tim Roth) is an amazing villain and character in this story. It is fiercely cold, and if you look at his face, he seems to be able to turn off his eyes and look completely evil. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is also great, but I think the authors used the word “Honor” 1 too many times. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strong and the whole movie is very well shot and shot. <br /> <br /> The action is exciting and the game of swords is very realistic, but not too bloody. The story is good and you really want Rob to win. <br /> <br /> In general, just shy classics.
