I agree with what I wrote “veinbreaker” about the feelings of “Aaaaa” that you experience at the end of this film. I really liked the places they chose to shoot, the songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic track on which Hans Matheson sings. This is trippy. Nyei was awesome in his role, Nail “nailed” him, Beano was a typical drummer, and Rea kept him together. Bruce Robinson was awesome. Helen was a beautiful girl. But I felt that Juliet Aubrey’s performance was great. The scenes between Aubrey and Robinson killed me! Well played, and the backstage music was at its best! Sorry, not many musicians checked out this movie! They have to! I told all my musician friends. Gorgeous quotation from Jimmy Nail's character: “It must be rock and roll, not the Ghost of this damn opera!”
