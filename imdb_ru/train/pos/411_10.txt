This film is well made on so many levels that I am delighted that its assessment is as low as it is (5.9 / 10 (576 votes) at the time of this writing). This film has incredible special effects, a real epic storyline, a complex interaction of great characters and amazing battles - you need to see them to believe! The only complaint I have is the subtitles on the HK DVD version I received (some lines were not translated - ???). <br /> <br /> I just don’t understand when I read and hear from various sources: “he has a complicated plot ...”, “I could not trace the story ...” or “the characters came from nowhere ...” From the very first time I watched this film, I understood it, followed it, knew why there were characters, and I really liked it! I watched it already 8 times, and each time it is pure pleasure. Oh, and this is not just my opinion, because I showed this film to many fellow citizens of America (people who have never seen the HK movie before) who feel the same way. None of them could follow the storyline, and each person declared his love for this film. Oh, man, why can't we have such things from Hollywood? At least, the Lord of the Rings had a good marriage of special effects, character development and storyline. <br /> <br /> This is not from a newcomer from Asian movie lovers. I have an extensive library of Asian films, and I must say that this film is one of my best DVDs. When you watch it, you will be amazed by the amazing special effects and the epic sensation of this film. You will be drawn into this fantastic world and do not want to leave! I have seen both the 1983 version, and 2001 (both made by Tsui Harkom), and 2001 is much better than IMO. <br /> <br /> Aside from the subtitles, I have another complaint about this film: I didn’t want it to end .... I beg you, Mr. Hark, please continue?
