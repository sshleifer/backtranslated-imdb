Surprisingly, the actress PJ. Soles did not become a big star after playing Riff Randall, the number 1 fan in the punk rock band Ramones, in "Rock 'n' Roll High School". Soles is so abundant, you do not mind that she is obviously too old to study in high school (this fact is evened out when all children look like 24). The film is a fast-paced joke that fails; in the end, everything shatters, and so it should be. Mary Voronov, an inbornly strange and funny figure, similar to the Nazi director, gets an excellent, unique piece of frisbee at the beginning, dangerously approaching her head (how many duplicates did they use on it, was it an accident?) And Day Young is very attractive as the best of salts, Kate Rambo. The weakest link, ironically, in this “High School” gang is “Ramones”. They cannot play, they are not funny, and their concert segment lasts too long. One Ramones song "I Want You Around" is perceived as fantasy and well captured; other random songs are good, especially the rare ballad of Paul McCartney, heard at the very beginning (“Have we met somewhere before?”). Great pleasure! *** from ****
