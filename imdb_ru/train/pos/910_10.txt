It's nice to see Suraj Barjatya return to what he is best at. History, woven around marriage. It's nice to have a movie in which there is not a single scene that you would not want to watch with your family. Although the story is simple and does not contain any new elements, you still like the film because of the presentation, the performances and, in fact, the entire processing. Hats off to Suraj. A film that engagement leads to love. Image changes in thinking, behavior, as soon as you got engaged, excellent. The director definitely thought a lot about it, and the actors made it perfectly. Although the film is slow, you donâ€™t mind it, because you are so passionate about the story that you just want to continue to watch the joy of this new engaged couple. Like the typical RajShree material, it has many sentimental scenes that are very likely to make the viewer burst into tears (especially women). But when you leave the cinema, you are very satisfied and you feel that the ticket was worth it :-).
