Most horror movies are actually horrible movies. They are becoming the same old. The same package every minute with a bit of thrill (usually “splashing”), and now they can pack every second with tasteless special effects. One of the goals of a really good horror movie is to stop the audience’s distrust. For example, I saw both recent films “Mommy” and almost circled around, watching funny special effects every second. Perhaps the creation of such films is worth a million dollars a second, and my sense of disbelief never stopped, it became the root. <br /> <br /> The trick can be more terrifying. Less - more. <br /> <br /> I first saw “Woman in Black” on channel A & E. After watching the usual 987 channels of very bad television, I stopped to watch it. This film is almost reminiscent of the play "Masterpiece of the Theater." It was good for me, I always preferred British television and movies. <br /> <br /> Most viewers find it to be too slow. But a slow tempo helps to lend credibility to the story. There are few special effects that make the viewer think that this film is set in the real world, which makes us a little more restless. Makeup and ghost costume are simple and believable. Hollywood would have made it look like demons from hell with burning eyes, fangs, claws, etc. Hollywood would have made an overkill and would have turned this idea into mediocrity. <br /> <br /> A woman appears only about five times in the film. Most of them are where it appears at a distance, and even this creates good fear. If she appeared too often, it could lower the mood. However, this film is so well made that for most of the film we feel that it is there all the time, but not visible. The scene where she “visits” Arthur Kidd late in the evening, and we see her a little closer, is a masterpiece of horror. <br /> <br /> This is just an extraordinary film, which I consider to be the best of the best horror films ever made. I have a copy of Ghosts, Changings, and another million. I have not yet seen anything that is headed by "Woman in Black", although I still watch. This film is so well made that it gives even the most seasoned skeptic (like me) a moment when I almost have thoughts of the non-existence of ghosts. I joke with people that sometimes I have short fears that she may appear standing in the middle of the road, or that I will see how she looks out of my window, etc. A look of hatred. This is what a really great horror movie should be. Like LaFanu's novel, “Woman in Black” very slowly draws you in and wraps around your neck, and before you realize this, she squeezes life out of you, and then it's too late. <br /> <br /> The closest thing I have to criticize is that it was made for a small screen ... and it is a terrible shame that it is out of print. I just paid over 40 dollars for my second copy of this movie. This is the main prize in my collection. Now I’m looking for an even better horror film that not only gives chills, but also defines sound drama.
