See also my commentary on the film Die Nibelungen, part 1: Siegfried. <br /> <br /> The second part of the grand staging of the Nibelungen saga in the UFA studio continues in a stylized, symphonic and emotionally independent manner of its predecessor. However, while the first part was an impassive depiction of individual acts of heroism, the second was a chaotic depiction of bloodshed on a large scale. <br /> <br /> As in the first part, director Fritz Lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm, with the pace of action and the complexity of the composition of the shot, which rises and falls smoothly depending on the tone of each scene. These photos should only be viewed with the notes of Gottfried Hupperz, which, fortunately, is on the Kino DVD. Now, when the focus is on mass action, Lang faces big problems in the production. The sequences of actions in his early features were often poorly constructed, but now he simply makes them part of this rhythmic flow when the level of activity on the screen swells up like an orchestra. <br /> <br /> But as part one made us witness Siegfried's adventures without a doubt, the second part presents the war as a destructive tragedy. In both paintings, there is intentionally no emotional connection with the characters. That's why Lang basically keeps the camera out of action, never letting us feel that we are here (and this is important because engaging the audience is usually a hallmark of Lang's work). That is why the performances are unnaturally theatrical, the actors moaning like a lunatic constipation. <br /> <br /> However, Crimhildaâ€™s revenge constantly deals with emotions and is in fact deeply humanistic. One moment of naturalism is when Attila holds his little son for the first time, and Lang actually emphasizes the tenderness of this scene, complementing it with a wild insane ride of the Huns. The fact is that Lang never manipulates us to take sides, and in this respect this version has more in common with the original saga than Wagner's opera. Climate slaughter is the complete opposite of the animating battle scene. Why then Hitler and co. so cry because of this fact that unfairly tarnished the reputation of these films? Because the unshakable racial ideology of the Nazis made them automatically treat the Nibelungs as good guys, even if they kill children and betray their relatives. For Hitler, their fall would always be a nationalistic, not a human tragedy. <br /> <br /> But for us, not the Nazi audience, this picture is pleasant because it has a wonderful sense of entertainment and musical rhythm. When you see these fully-designed, silent photos of Lang, it makes you realize how much he spent in Hollywood. Instead of burdening him with low-budget cauldrons, they had to force him to work on several of these epics with a sword and sandal, paintings that should not be believable and should not move us emotionally, where it is poetically Opera tonality that covers us.
