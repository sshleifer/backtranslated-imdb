Like many of you, I'm a big fan of this 1940s film noir, but Red Rock West has become a real treat for all of us hungry for the past. The term "neo-noir" has so often been used inappropriately in the last ten years, that it has lost its meaning and influence. On the other hand, the John Dahl film really deserves to be called one. Casting is perfect everywhere and would feel at home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Turner. The plot is so tight that you are hooked for the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would appreciate it. Many modern films make me wonder why they do not make them as they were before, and I'm not even so old. Films like Red Rock West give us hope for the future, paying tribute to the past.
