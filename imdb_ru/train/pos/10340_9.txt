Although this film was released a year before my birth, it is definitely one of my favorite comedies. He plays Redd Fox as a father trying to understand his son’s homosexuality. Like most parents, he doesn’t know what it means to be gay, and he has all these stereotypes about what gays look like. His son, Norman, is now raised and lives on his own. When his father, Ben, finds out that his son is gay, he visits his son in the hope of changing him. The name comes from one of the funniest lines in the film - when Ben gets to Norman's apartments, he encounters a female prostitute and thinks that this is his son in the drag (“Norman ... Is that you?”) The film made me laugh from beginning to the end. Redd Fox is great. Although most of the content is stereotypical, I did not find anything offensive in how the material was processed, and it even has a good ending. Highly recommended.
