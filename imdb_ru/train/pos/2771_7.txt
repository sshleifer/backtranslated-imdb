“David and Bathsheba” is a luxurious Hollywood biblical film created from the film “Fox of the 20th Century” by Darryl F. Zanuk, directed by Henry King, starring Gregory Peck (King David), Susan Heyward (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey ( Nathan), Kiron Moore (Uriah)) and Jane Meadows (Michal). <br /> <br /> The film is based on Samuel’s second Bible book from the Old Testament. This follows King David, who in childhood killed the giant Goliath, and now we are in adulthood as the second king of Israel. Being a tough and confident king, David, however, has heart matters causing great problems. For, since he spies on Bathsheba for a shower, this is the beginning of a journey that includes adultery and betrayal; the journey that ends with the judgment of God. <br /> <br /> As a rule, for the genre “David and Bathsheba” is a grandiose and grandiose work. From the superb design of the scenery to the positively gorgeous photograph in the style of Technicolor (Leon Chamroy), it is of sufficient quality to sit next to the best that the genre can offer in terms of production values. Atypically, however, the film goes at an elegant pace and relies on 99% of its value, driven solely by dialogue. This is not for fans of action films or those who need a little splash to go with a buckle. This is a very humanistic picture, in fact, let's not beat around the burning bush, this is a biblical love story, full of sins of the heart. But this is not bad at all, because by breaking it up, we find that he acted very well {Peck has a resistant but vulnerable thing that goes very well, and Hayward is trying his best}, and it will be a beautiful story founded on the knowledge of the often forgotten skill of Henry King. And while some dialogues are admittedly shocking, the flow of characters is never interrupted, as the script proposed by Philippe Dunn (“The Ghost and Mrs. Muir”) by Oscar holds attention everywhere. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a forgotten picture in terms of genres biblical / swords and sandals (most likely because it is a talkative thing, in the center of which is the heart), but in fact it is worth it that anyone is interested the most generous genres. 7/10
