Hmm, do you want some romance with your riddle? It has it. I think that if the novel was ditched, it would help create a better film. But how can you abandon the novel, if the story is borrowed from the novel "Harlequin's novel", whatever the hell it is. If the novel was ditched, the story might be too weak. The riddle here was not so bad, quite interesting, but nothing that was impossible at the level of the Mission of Impossible international espionage. Well. I thought Mel Harris was pretty good; her short skirts, I think, added sex appeal ... but this guy Rob Stewart might be better off playing maybe a better-known actor on a television movie. The direction was decent, and the writing could be improved â€” both could be a little sharper, a little darker, more adventurous. One thing that was good about it was the use of real European places. This could easily be changed to be removed in Canada, but they were indeed in superbly beautiful places, such as Budapest. Perhaps the disadvantage was the choice of director and / or filmmaker to create the perfect photo for certain shots. Not good. If it were a more dramatic film shot for a large screen, ideal scenes with postcards for photos would really have to take a back seat and just be a good part of the background. It was just a TV movie, so they had to add a little Ummmph to the picture, and some of that Ummmph came from the scenery. Overall, this is a good movie. I tell you what, it was absolutely the best Canadian-Hungarian production I've ever seen! (and the only thing I know.) I hereby proclaim it as a mediocre film made for television, with a C-rating
