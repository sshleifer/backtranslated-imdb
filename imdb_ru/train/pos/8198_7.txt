Dirty Harry must hunt down a rape victim who takes revenge by shooting her assailants in the cold before they kill them. Perhaps a more appropriate punishment would be to enable them to survive the first shot and allow them to suffer forever, like she and her sister ... In any case ... a fascinating story unfolding again in San Francisco and Santa Cruz. The main rapist, played by Andy Drake, is respectively disgusting and gets his punishment at the end (of course!). Not a classic film, but better than others, with the exception of the original “Dirty Harry”.
