Anyone who does not laugh this whole film was embalmed. I watched it at least twenty times, and I still have tears in my eyes in many scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect, like Celeste Talbert, a fading soap star whose support staff is trying to replace her in the hope that their own star will rise. The 45-year-old Fields still has that wonderful and beautiful quality of an elf and an ideal figure that contradicts the fact that she had three children. I'm prejudiced, I'm in love with her. <br /> <br /> In the film Soapy, stars are performed that fulfill their roles to perfection. Kevin Kline is flawless, like Robert Downey Jr., Elizabeth Shu, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of his early roles, Carrie Fisher as a hypertext director who plays a small role as a waiter without a shirt on. Katie Najimi is gorgeous as an unhappy costume designer, and best of all, Katie Moriarty as nurse Nan, who conspires to remove Fields from the show, is funny. <br /> <br /> This film should have won an Oscar for best comedy, best leading lady in comedy, best leading role in comedy and many other best characters, including scriptwriters, directors and actors and actresses. Get a DVD so you can watch it again and again over the next twenty five years. You will still laugh at this when the disk wears out.
