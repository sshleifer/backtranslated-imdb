I am a big fan of fairy tale theater, and I have seen them all, and this is one of the best! It is funny, romantic and classically. I recommend this for all ages. It's great for young children, because it's good, Cinderella, and great for adults and teenagers, because it's fun and not too much. I watched it when I was young, and I still watch it now. He has wonderful lines that I and my family constantly quote. The game is great and it never gets old. If you like fairy tales and romances, you will like it. I watched a lot of Cinderella movies in my time, and this is the best of them. (Excuse me, Disney) I highly recommend this film and all the performances in the Fairy Tale Theater. They all appeal to all ages and are unique and very interesting.
