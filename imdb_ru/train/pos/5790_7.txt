Blimey! All I can say is that if Elizabeth Montgomery is the enemy (she speaks Russian), then I give up right now. In her short skirt, high boots and pronounced breasts, she is a real baby, even if her zombie eye shadow comes and goes. These 30 minutes are without a doubt the sexiest of the series. Pay attention to the realistic and demonstrative struggle with Bronson, until he bravely hits her chin, destroying all the fun. Okay, I guess I should leave my hormonal response. <br /> <br /> This is a very well thought out half an hour due to the undervalued power of the success of the series, Buck Houghton. Naturally, manufacturers want to spend the third season with the output above average. This is America after a nuclear catastrophe (we know, because it is part of the invading forces), and only the American Bronson and the Soviet Montgomery remained, as well as about twenty tons of realistic debris. They wander among the devastation in alternating moods, while we wonder how long biology will take to outperform politics, which, of course, ultimately does (luck Bronson). And it's all. No real talk, except what Bronson says, which is pretty bloated. Nevertheless, the scenario is still interesting and quite bold for its time, even suggesting that not all Russian women looked like truck drivers (a popular Cold War stereotype). it is rather curious that the very Slavic Bronson (Buchinsky) will play the role of an American, and the glossy Montgomery - as a Slav. In appearance, everything should be the other way around. I assume that the producers did not want to put the American on the physically weaker role of the woman, regardless of appearance. Be that as it may, the usual fear or the atmosphere of TZ is small, but the episode remains very, very watchable for 30 minutes.
