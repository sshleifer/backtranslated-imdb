Samuel Fuller is an interesting director, mainly because there was a very controversial policy in his films. While Shock Corridor and Naked Kiss embodied the hypocrisy and insanity of America, and Big Red was an effective portrait of the horrors of war, Merrilla Marauders drew war as a necessary hell and Pickup on South Street. Spies. All his films are made for very spectacular viewing, and although he was often cursed as a b-film director, Fuller was as good as any of the major studio contractors. "Pickup on South Street" is no exception, and despite outdated themes, the style of filmmaking is noticeable but ahead of its time. It’s also a very fast-paced, tough and sometimes brutal film noir. <br /> <br /> The acting in all directions is fantastic. Richard Widmark is a great anti-hero, and Jean Peters is quite sexy as a girl who working for his fellow communist spy.The show kidnapper Tlema Ritter, however, in a completely delightful performance as a police chair.The angles that Fuller uses are great, which makes the acting episodes even more exciting and violent (this is very cruel no). The camera constantly rotates, as Tarantino and his school would have done forty years later. “Pickup on South Street” is a great noir-style action movie. Shock Corridor remains Fuller's favorite movie, but this is a very close second. (8/10)
