After watching most of the films of Ringo Lam, I can say that this is his best and most unusual film to date. This is an ancient Chinese era, full of flashy martial arts, where the location of an underground lair filled with traps and dungeons plays as big a role as any of the characters. The action is fantastic, the story is tense and entertaining, and the scenery is really memorable. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise was not available on DVD, and vhs is almost impossible to wear, even if you are close to the second largest Chinese city in North America (like me). If you can find it, do not miss it.
