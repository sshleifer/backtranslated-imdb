The name is the sound that one of the characters makes when he drives his imaginary cart through the garbage dump where the characters live. The film is based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who effectively live in dilapidated houses on the edge of a landfill. It is a mixture of laughter and sadness. <br /> <br /> I have long wanted to see the first color film made by Akriya Kurasova. Strangely enough, it was often stated as available only in an abbreviated version of the three or four-hour original due to a runtime error in some promotional materials. I was reaching for the full version, expecting to see what Kurasowa wanted us to see, only to find out in the recent release of Criterion that the 140-minute version is the full version. <br /> <br /> Finally, sitting down to watch a movie last night, I have mixed emotions about the movie. First of all, it is visually connected with each subsequent film. You can see the rest of the Kurasowals, the remaining six films reflected in this film, right up to the painted sunsets. This is an amazing film using color, and you can understand why he took so long to get to the film, which he would like (of course, there are some unsuccessful projects). The film is a visual work of art. (However, if you’re going to see it on your widescreen TV, note that this frame was captured at 1.33, so it will be displayed in the usual format.) The rest of the film is a mixed bag. Part of the problem is that the lives of all these people do not quite converge. As separate tales, they all work well, but as a whole they do not hang as one. I do not blame Kurasov, because it is not always possible to hit things out of the box, especially when someone like Robert Altman, who specializes in multi-part films of this kind, was sometimes bombed himself. <br /> <br /> This is not It is not to say that there is no reason to watch a movie. As in all films of Kurasova, there are always reasons to watch his films, regardless of whether they work or not. The first trolleybus ride is one of the best things Kurasova has ever done, and it is worth the cost of renting. This is one of the most magical moments in the history of cinema, when the cart is checked and taken out. The father and son who live in the car are in contact (although in the end it’s very sad), and there are other pieces that shine (for example, the cast, which is great in all directions), and you should at least try the movie as something great. from a man, we are usually associated with samurai films or criminal dramas. <br /> <br /> This is an intriguing misfire from the main director, which means that in this case it means that the success of most other filmmakers is higher than that of others. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 in general, much higher in parts.
