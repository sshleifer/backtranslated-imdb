After I watched this movie again from the VH-1 show in 1998, I just needed to comment. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this movie on TV, it was about 1981, and I remember shooting it. beta max to my mother. For some reason, it turned out to be recorded in black and white, which gave it a special look. <br /> <br /> I remember very clearly the film, starting with the song “My Bonnie”, as the Camera photographed the Liverpool scene. I also remember the opening scene, where Paul gestures to the girls and says: “Look, talent!” So, with great annoyance, I jumped out in my tape version of 1998 and “remembered” that the film begins with “She Loves You” instead of "My Bonnie." When you see how slowly the camera turns depending on the speed of the music, you see that "She loves you" just does not fit. In addition, in this “later” version, when Paul sees girls, he says: “Look, GIRLS!” ... and somehow recalling the earlier version, THIS word doesn't seem to fit either. I don’t understand why they felt that they should have Americanized this film for the American audience. Personally, if I am going to watch a film about a British group, I want all British spoken expressions and such that would be part of their speech, manners, etc. <br /> <br /> Another annoyance was how “Intermittent” editing was for television. For example, right after Stu was beaten up, the movie was interrupted by their commercial. Yes, I know that it depends on the network, but it does destroy the effect of the film, if you divide it, as we all know. What some people may consider insignificant in terms of dialogue (and therefore can be edited) can actually go by explaining a particular action or the next scene. <br /> <br /> My point of view - the “best” version of this film was probably an earlier version that I recorded on tape since 1981, in which the scene “Shake, Rattle & Roll” hit, which was not in my 1998 version. I began to assume that two different versions were created for television, and viewing the “alternate versions” link relating to this film confirmed my point. The fact that in the American version there were several shorter / cut / different scenes and / or dialogues is a big disappointment for me and something that is worth mentioning if someone cares about such things. In my opinion, it is best to try to get hold of the European version of this film, if possible, and (perhaps even less possible), the unedited version. Unfortunately, I had to abandon my old European version of betamax, because I did not know how to convert it. <br /> <br /> Despite this, I found this film, perhaps one of the best films about the story behind the Beatles' Birth. Realizing that the artistic and creative license is often used in movies and on television in depicting historical events, I did not allow any discrepancies to spoil my enjoyment of the film. Of course, you see the Beatles singing songs in the Cave, and this makes me think: “Did they write something then? <br /> <br /> In fact, for me, the most outstanding actor was the actor who played John Stephen McKennou. I just fell in love with him. His gaze, manners, personality, and speaking voice seemed accurate. He looked quite like young John, so I doubled the end of the movie when you first saw the Beatles performing on Ed Sullivan. In fact, I wondered if these were really Beatles shots until I saw other actors on stage. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an absolutely accurate life story and the Beatles, you can’t get anything better than the Beatles Anthology, as it was “written” by the boys themselves. However, if you are looking for a funny snapshot of their days before the Beatles ’, which preceded their arrival in America, and you leave your critical anal ratings behind the door, you won’t go wrong with The Beatles Birth - - REQUIRED for any“ real ”or random Beatles fan.
