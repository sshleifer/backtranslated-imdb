This is one of the few films that I watched twice in the theater. I really like this film for its atmosphere and the story about the life of the tragic hero Esteban Trub. He makes so many mistakes, but he gets a chance for redemption. Isn't it a comforting thought? <br /> <br /> When I first watched it, I thought that after the victorious election the film would end - I did not know the book. So, boy, I was wrong when the dramatic climax is yet to come! I was literally swept away by the power of the last half hour of the film. <br /> <br /> Many people do not like this film at all here. I can not understand this one bit. Maybe those who read the book in the first place — how often with the screen versions of the novels — are simply disappointed that so much of everything remained unspoken, invisible, inexplicable. But as a film telling a touching story — the story of the family, the rise and fall of a man, the deep compassion of a woman, the power of love and the madness of hate (and conservatism) —this film is simply magnificent! In addition, the soundtrack is incredibly good, and the actors are also great - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> So, of course, one of those films for which the movie was invented!
