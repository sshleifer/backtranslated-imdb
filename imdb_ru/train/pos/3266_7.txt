Another downey is a must see! If you are an obsessive fan like me, you definitely need to watch this movie! He plays Alex Finch, a 22-year-old graduate of Yale University, who understands that the life he just entered is the life he left 26 years earlier. Alex is the reincarnation of Louis Jeffreys, nonsense lawyer, happily married to Corrin (Sybil Sheppard). Louis dies on his one-year anniversary when a car knocks him down. He demands to return, only this time to the body of Alex Finch. Enter Robert Downey Jr., lots of confusion and lots of laughter. <br /> <br /> Although this film is 15 years old, it still makes you wonder if there is such a thing as reincarnation, And if so, how often do you meet the same souls life after life. I do not know the answer. But I know you need to watch this movie. This is a riot, and Downey looks so cool in a tuxedo. This film makes you believe in love, and true love never dies. It is just recycled.
