Darius Goes West is a stunning documentary about a teenager (Weems) with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and his 11 friends who take him on a rough terrain trip to see if Pimp My Ride will be shooting his wheelchair. I recently watched this film at the Sunscreen Film Festival. He played twice during the festival. This film is an amazing story about the human spirit and the spirit of Wim's friends. I do not say this often about films, but after watching this film I feel the desire to do something in this direction. At each festival in which this film participated, this film received some sort of award. This is in the Tribeca Film Festival, and it's going to London and Athens, Greece. I would not be surprised if this movie went all the way to Oscar. This is a snowball out of control. If someone has a chance to watch this movie, wherever it is, go! Take as many people as possible and leave! He heads to New Orleans for the film festival, then to Atlanta and Palm Beach, Florida. Darius is from Georgia, so I expect that tickets to the show in Atlanta will be quickly sold out if they are not already there. Please watch this movie!
