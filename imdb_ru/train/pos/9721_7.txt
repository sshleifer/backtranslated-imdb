Losing friends and alienating people is a decent comedy with a bit of a romantic approach. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is a story about how Sydney Young (Simon Pegg) breaks into journalistic and journalistic activities, and this is ridiculous. way. Simon Pegg looked normal, a little worse than usual. The film is not funny and not funny, or something like that, but it has its own moments, and these moments are really funny. <br /> <br /> I recommend this entertainment and it is worth watching American films with an English comedy about cream to anyone who just wants to sit, relax and enjoy the film the way it is. If you are going to watch this movie with a critical approach, then you must pass, if you do not want to give up and start to destroy it.
