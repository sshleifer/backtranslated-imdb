I like this film because it showed that they did not kill for fun, but to save those they loved! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job with the image of Ned and Joe. It has a few quick inappropriate scenes, but everything is fine except this one. The tongue is very soft and sometimes does not even know that it is there. This film shows that just because they are criminals does not mean that they are evil killers! I hope that people will watch this film and learn about such important historical events as this one. One thing that fascinates me in this film is that they took inspiration for their armor from the book that Ned was watching! And this is how people memorize them in their armor. I hope that people will watch this movie and become interested, as I do.
