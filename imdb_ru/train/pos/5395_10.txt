I remember watching this movie, it was so interesting to think. I really wanted to know what will happen next. I was amazed at how much they fit in 8 minutes. We start in the schoolyard. Two friends discuss the missing class. Baby B says Baby A: "Let's not go to class today." And Little A refuses, claiming that they can miss something really important. So child B misses, and child A goes to class. When he gets there, the teacher tells him that today they are going to learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn. They were going to find out the meaning of life. She gives everyone a pamphlet, and when she gets to child A, she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share. Well, the child will not share, so Baby A goes in search of a teacher. When he finally finds her, he receives a shocking revelation of what the real meaning of life is. I suggest everyone to see this short. It only takes 8 minutes of your life, but the message is so important that it can help you for a lifetime.
