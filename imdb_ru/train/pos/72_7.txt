I just recently watched this 1954 film with Vincent Price starring in Turner's Classic Movies. Price portrays Don Gallico, a wizard / inventor who is forced to kill when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (as well as his wife, who in the short role played by the beautiful Eva Gabor). Despite the fact that Price is a murderer, I actually caught him from being a fan of him, he is a sympathetic character who is driven by the greedy people around him who continue to use him. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not not having the “terrible” factor of some of his more famous roles (such as my favorite “House of Wax”), he nevertheless has enough to keep the audience interested . <br /> <br /> This is a must-have for Vincent Price fans.
