For all my life, why did this movie get R? Rating! Although it’s about flesh-eating zombies, whether you believe it or not, this is actually a pretty good family movie — at least if your children are 10 years old or older. Unlike traditional zombie films, it has an excellent sense of humor, as well as traditional values ​​- albeit slightly distorted! Language is not a serious problem, there is no nude, and the style of the film is definitely aimed at children (just like the old TV show "Creepy, Indiana") - but some kind of fist hit R for this! Believe me, most children have seen violence worse than this, and it seems silly to make viewers think that this film is for adults only. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in the world of parallel type. While fashion, cars and morals appear around 1953, a brutal zombie plague recently occurred in this strange world that led to a “zombie war” and massive changes in everyday life. At school, children are taught armed combat, and at the end of the film there is a cute scene in which the father gives his son a gun and tells him to keep him in a backpack “just in case”! As for living outside of school, this is also rather strange, as people now learned that zombies are not such bad things! Damn it, using shock collars and training, you can turn them into slaves who can do your homework, clean the streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really sick guy, be your “special friend.” <br /> <br /> This film tells about one particular family that is finally buying its first zombie slave (played by Billy Connally). Mom is excited, and her son is slowly becoming a zombie friend. Papa, on the other hand, is not convinced - because he was forced to kill his own zombie father a few years earlier, and he has not yet coped with this !! Funny, disrespectful and unique - this film needs to be watched by a much wider audience.
