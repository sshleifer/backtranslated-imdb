Yesterday afternoon, viewers did not have a dry eye after I left the cinema after seeing this film gem in a sold-out house as part of this yearâ€™s Hamburg Film Festival. And the tears flowed from laughter. This movie was fun, there is no other way to say it. There was not a single boring piece in it, I laughed through it, and with me, with all the rest of us, three hundred fans of French cinema. <br /> <br /> Alain Shabbat was absolutely awesome. A great clown, if necessary, and serious if the situation requires it. The performance was, of course, absolutely unsurpassed, but it was exactly what was needed for the story and what made it work so well. No less great was Charlotte Gainsburg, whom I love to see, and my mother was also very strong. The sisters could be a bit more detailed on the nature of the scenarios, but besides that there is nothing to moan about. I had a wonderful day when I watched this film, when on Hamburg street I sank in the rain, and I would like to see similar films from France regularly come out in Germany. But distributors in this country do not seem to understand that the French are making good films. I, at least, can't wait to find a DVD that offers subtitles (Hi, Australia? Please?), Because I need to watch this film at home a few more times!
