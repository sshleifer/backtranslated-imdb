I have not seen this movie for about 5 years, but it still haunts me. <br /> <br /> When people ask me about my favorite movies, I always mention this first. There are certain films (works of art such as this film, “The Dark City” and “Breaking the Waves”) that seem to affect the place inside you, a place so protected and hidden, and at the same time so sensitive that it seems for life in the view of the viewer, not much different from a life-changing event, such as the termination of a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... This film "shook me" when I first saw it. This caused me an emotional hangover that lasted several days.
