Good, funny, straightforward story, great Nicole Kidman (I almost always like the movies in which she is removed). It was a good "conductor" for someone who is well versed in comedy and drama, because they have both. A romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories, gorgeous closing lines. Chaplin, very good here, was also good at another good, but unpopular romantic comedy (“The Truth About Cats and Dogs”). Maybe they are too implausible. Ebert did not even publish a review for this. The great comedies about “chatter” were obviously completely implausible (“Raising a Child”, etc.). If you saw one improbable comedy, did you see them all? Or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s. Weird. Birthday Girl is a movie that I liked several times. Nicole Kidman can be a “killer app” for home videos.
