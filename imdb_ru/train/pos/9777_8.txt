one of the best low budget movies from Germany! is it the dark side of the new century? if you believe in esotericism, please do not watch this movie! it destroys all your positive fantasies. This film shows that behind the peaceful facade of the spiritual search for the soul lies the world of extreme disturbances and horror. I hope there will be a 35 mm copy soon! The first film by Andreas Marshall is just the beginning of a new area where films are shot for a few euros! I'm waiting for the second strike!
