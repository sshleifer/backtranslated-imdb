This film sat on my Tivo for several weeks before I watched it. I was afraid of self-indulgence yuppies that the relationship deteriorated. I was wrong; it was an exciting excursion to the New Yorkers' corrupt libido. <br /> <br /> The format is the same as Max Ofuls’s La Ronde, based on a play by Arthur Schnitzler, which is given an “inspired” credit. It starts with one person, a prostitute, standing on a street corner in Brooklyn. who has sex with her on the hood of a car, but cannot come in. He refuses to pay her. When he stops writing, she answers his mobile phone and accepts the message. She runs away with his keys. <br /> <br /> Then the story switches to a contractor who professionally calls a rich, bored New York woman Ina, who plays with him until he wakes up, then she pulls away, She tells him how desperate and unhappy she is, he tells her how beautiful and lucky she is. When he leaves, she asks if he will have sex with her She sits on him, bouncing up and down. This time he comes, he leaves. <br /> <br /> A woman and her husband are having a dinner for their fashion friends. Husband (Robert) talks about business, his wife (Ellen ) bored, and he switches the topic to sex and how often men and women think about it. The husband switches the conversation to the desert. Later, after the guests leave, Ellen tries to seduce Robert with sex. Robert wants none of this and puts on a jazz album. Ellen turns on the radio; Robert turns on the music; Ellen turns on the TV; Robert turns on another TV. Cacophony follows. Ellen climbs onto the roof, Robert joins her. Ellen admits that she needs more men besides Robert. Robert says he also needs to meet men. <br /> <br /> Next we follow Robert when he visits the artist Martin, played by Steve Buscemi. I would like Bush to have more such roles when he is a sexy, intelligent, absolutely welcome guy. Robert highly appreciates Martin’s work, much more than she deserves, promises to include her in the show. Martin is thrilled until it turns out that Robert speaks from his groin, it's all a mating dance. Robert tries to kiss Martin on the lips, and Martin pulls away, saying that he is not gay. Robert claims he is not gay too, Martin mocks. Both admit that the work is bad. Robert is about to leave when Martin lets Robert kiss him. They understand, and Robert falls on Martin. <br /> <br /> Next, we follow Martin as he prepares for an art show in the gallery of Manhattan. He is amazed at receptionist Anna, played by Rosario Dawson. (I had to shorten this review so that it does not exceed 1000 words) ... and they make love to each other. <br /> <br /> Next we follow Anna, who is sitting at the dinner table. Her boyfriend Nick (Adrian Grenier) enters, carrying flowers. She is cold to him; he is trying to figure out why. He pulls information from her that she had sex with someone when he was in San Francisco. She convinces him that he stayed with his ex-girlfriend in San Francisco and had sex with her. The last revelation turns out to be a lie. The two of them understand breakfast, but she decides that they have to part. Nick with a broken heart. <br /> <br /> And we follow Nick, who confesses his problems to an elderly woman he meets on a park bench, Joe (Carol Kane). Joey is a bit strange and childish, but a good audience for Nick, who needs a sympathetic ear. The two of them go to Coney Island at night and look at the stars. Nick falls under the spell of Joey, despite the difference in age between them. They return to Joey's apartment, and Nick gradually realizes that he is going to have sex with a crazy old woman. She is on top of him, does not want to let him go. But he manages to escape. <br /> <br /> (Incidentally, this is Carol Caine’s best role since she played Latke’s wife in Taxi.) Joey's phone rings, and this person calls the network of psychic friends. and Joey is one of psychic friends. Although she still suffers from Nick, she gradually falls into her mental disorder. A man in his office late in the evening and wants to have sex with her on the phone. Although this is not Joey's case, Joey goes ahead and persuades the person who will come. She wants to keep talking, although the man wants to break away from the phone, and finds out that he has appropriated a lot of money from his company, and will be found out tomorrow. His life is ruined. Joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide, and she tries to make him believe that she is his friend, that she cares about him. And she takes care of him. <br /> <br /> But the man puts the gun in his briefcase and goes to look for a prostitute on the Brooklyn Quay, and we return to the beginning, to the same prostitute who started La Ronde. She wants to give him $ 75,000 in cash if she kills him. He tried to commit suicide, but could not do it. The prostitute does not want to do this, but he insists, holding her hand, holding the gun in his mouth, telling her where to go. In the end, the gun will work, and we see the prostitute walking down the street and coming to the corner where she usually does business. A contractor who did not pay her earlier in the film pulls up and lowers the window. They look at each other. END.
