The jewel of comedy. A lot of loud laughter, scenes of shops and pubs made me laugh uncontrollably. The characters are recognizable, the dialogues are well observed - I know such people! Humor is surprisingly gentle, and the film (it may sound strange) reminds me of Ylingovaya comedy. This is an unusual little movie with lots of details. It definitely takes a few views. I watched it several times (I showed all my friends!) And each time I noticed something new - a bit of dialogue, something visual, which I had not noticed before. I could be very discriminating and find a couple of flaws in the film, but I'm not going to do that, because in general it is a very funny, pleasant to the touch film that is really worth seeing and which anyone who has a sense of humor should like. This is a film that will find its friends, and I hope that there are many of them. Oh .... and he has a great soundtrack.
