My friends and I were just discussing how disappointed we are with the way films are made and especially the romantic comedies. We feel offended by the fact that Hollywood is serving a sentence these days, when they act like all is well. <br /> <br /> Well, not everything is good ... except for a few bright spots, such as this film. He has no big-name actors, a big budget, I donâ€™t think he had a big release (I rented from Hollywood Video), there was nothing in him that was in the biggest budget romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> But he had something that most of them lack. He had a lot of chemistry between the love interests of "Parker" (Jonathan Shach) and "Sam" (Alyson Eastwood). Their love story was not imposed on us as many. The director was not in a hurry for these characters to really get to know each other. Their story reminded me of one of my favorite Tutsis. <br /> <br /> The cast added not only really funny comic moments, but also the depth of the story. The character of James LeGros was absolutely priceless. Sam's gay friend was hysterical. Parker's interaction with his psychic hotline colleagues was very funny. <br /> <br /> I laughed, cried, remembered how great it was to fall in love.
