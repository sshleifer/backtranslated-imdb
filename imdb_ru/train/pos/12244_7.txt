As winter approached, our state broadcaster, ABC, for some reason decided to hold a partial Jane Austen festival on Sunday evening. It began with a twelve-year old version of the film "Emma" last Sunday; later versions of three other novels, "Persuasion", "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park", are expected. <br /> <br /> A curious thing about this production of A & E Television Networks with the script Reliable Andrew Davis is that he appeared almost simultaneously with two much larger budget versions of films, one of which was Gwyneth Paltrow in the lead role, and "Clueless", a "modernized" version with Alicia Silverstone in the lead role, which brought the plot to Beverly Hills. Perhaps as a result, even with Kate Beckinsale at the head, this production sank without a trace. <br /> <br /> As a rule, a lot of things are lost when the novels are reduced to the length of the full-length movie. Adaptations that are usually liked and remembered are those that have enough space for the development of both the story and the characters. An outstanding example is the Return to Brideshead, in which there were 13 50-minute episodes in 1982. It is enough to compare the usual full-length version of the film “Pride and Prejudice” in 2005 with a magnificent 1995 mini-series of six parts. The point is not that the novel should be shot page by page, and some of the novels (often not very good ones) perfectly adapt to the film (The Atonement is a recent example), but the novels of Jane Austen need time and space for their manifestation. their full charm. <br /> <br /> Given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation, this production is in order. Kate Beckinsale gives Emma the right mix of self-confidence and vulnerability, and Mark Strong direct Mr. Knightley (he reminded me that Jane tended to rework characters - Knightley is a more sophisticated version of the sullen Mr. P & P darling). Samantha Morton was rather lethargic Harriet, but did Prunella Scales get a good little Miss Bates talk? Sybil Falti on speed. Bernard Hepton, like Emma's weak father, was also excellent. We saw wet countryside, mud and poverty, as well as chic interiors if someone thought it was a particularly idyllic age for everyone. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it was a tight adaptation, it was strangely slow in places ?? some conversations were rather unnatural, even with the formalities of the time. I would have to watch the movie again to be sure, but this may be due to the under-utilization of reactionary shots. <br /> <br /> If you like footage, this is a great example, and compares well with the Paltrow version. Anyway, that's not all!
