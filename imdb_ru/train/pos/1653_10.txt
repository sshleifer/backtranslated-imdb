I agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the “spy” genre. My husband and I were fascinated by this when he first aired in the United States and watched every episode. At that time, I tried to buy a series (I recorded everything on tape), but WGBH said that it was not available. I even thought to write to Ian Holm to find out if he had a copy! Like the others, I bought and read the Deighton series (partly to understand the complex plot.) If the original version ever appears on DVD, I will be one of the first to get a copy. Jan Holm portrayed the vulnerable but daring Bernard Samson. (He is always awesome.)
