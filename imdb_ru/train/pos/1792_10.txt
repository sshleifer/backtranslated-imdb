I had the pleasure of watching this wonderful movie last night, with a wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director after watching it. I suspect that the first commentator never lost his parents or someone very close to them in death. I had many such losses, and this film spoke to me. One of the main themes - as we are not dealing with questions / problems / stories with our loved ones, before it is too late - they are too incapable or dead before this happens. Talk to your loved ones, listen and write down their stories, tell people that you love them, resolve differences. I liked the message that there are no errors. I like the way the director portrays the relationship of two daughters - as one of six brothers and sisters, it is clear to me that he understood how complicated this relationship is. His story as a cinematographer also runs out loud and clear - what a beautiful film! Casting is outstanding - a movie not to be missed!
