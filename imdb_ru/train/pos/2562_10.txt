This is one of the greatest love movies I've ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts may seem outdated, but this does not distract from the film. We must try to observe, criticize and enjoy any form of art in terms of time. Obviously, by the standards of "Sex in the City" Charlie Chaplin was terribly boring. However, judging from the perspective of America in 1925, it was fantastic. Similarly, Sayonara is a breakthrough film that tells about the love of a mixed race, the arrogance and prejudices of the American “manifest fate”, as well as the complexities of different cultures. This is the natural next step for such films as the “Gentleman Agreement”. His goal, however, was not just a social commentary, rather, it was entertaining and pleasant, with countless lines that simply do not forget. <br /> <br /> However, even if we consider it as a love story, stunning. Although some attack Brando's accent, he is at his best in nuances and characteristics. Buttons and Umeks (which both got an Oscar) and the rest of the cast added a lot to the film. <br /> <br /> Taka, the real star, does an incredible job, making you feel the passion she has for Brando, while she is torn by a sense of duty and devotion. Her speech, when she first meets and talks to Brando, is classic and rarely seen in movies. The dialogue between Such and Brando in her dressing room in Tokyo at the end of the film is equally good. Of course, he has no mouth, no sucking and worse, which illustrates the love in today's films, but this makes everything better. He portrays true love and passion, not just “warmth.” If this movie does not touch you, then you are too young, too cynical or dead.
