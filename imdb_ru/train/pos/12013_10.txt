After reading the comments on this film and seeing mixed reviews, I decided that I would add my ten cents, which is worth saying that I believe that the film is excellent not only in visual beauty, writing, musical accompaniment, acting or directing, but telling the story Joseph Smith and the way he walked, experiencing difficulties and persecutions for believing in God, he felt and knew that this was his way. I am really very glad that I took part in the story about this wonderful man. I recommend that everyone see this when the opportunity presents itself, regardless of which religious path he or she takes, it only gives the person a determination to live the life we ​​must follow with the true values ​​of love and forgiveness, as the Savior taught us. to do.
