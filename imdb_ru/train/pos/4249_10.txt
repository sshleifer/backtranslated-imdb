Be it the three guys in their tight white clothes, knocking on the dude in the splits or the girl saying: Someone at Road Knill has something everyone likes in Knuckleface Jones. It is strange and surreal and not quite clear yarn ... but it never loses you. The first time I saw this, I almost laughed. And every night after I came home and watched it again. Forget about Ugly Coyote ... this is a film that strengthened my love for Piper Perabo. Look ... it's not too late!
