I found it very intelligent and artistic in all respects! I felt that the script conveys everything that I feel physically and emotionally when I came home from work and watched it. This is a tribute to the movie in the highest form and format. <br /> <br /> Holy Guacamole! I wish these days would come again. I tried to put a blister box on the side of my car (honda civic 1984), but the vacuum trays for the buns didn’t quite cut it. also in my civil position, sexual positions are limited and are not supported by a water bottom, as brilliantly depicted in the “van”. <br /> <br /> the “van” has extreme ridicule and can even replace .. porn if you watch some scenes privately <br /> <br /> I really expect Sam Grossman (director) to reach his opus <br /> <br /> John rating: **** 1/2 Sam: *****
