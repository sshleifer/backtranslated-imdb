This is one of the best movies about Fred Aster-Ginger Rogers, or at least one of my favorites. Most of the A-R films feature great danceable but juicy romantic stories. This is still encouraging, but not as pronounced as in other films. <br /> <br /> In this film, not only great dances were used, but also nice characters, as well as many good songs. Music is a central theme here, and what is nice is the addition of Rogers' solo tap. She was not only a super dancer, but also a very beautiful woman with a stunning figure. Of course, she also dances with Fred, and they are always happy couples to watch them on the dance floor. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s, when Ozzy and Harriet were watched on television, it was a real game. hit the first time I saw it to see such a young Harriet Hilliard. No wonder Ozzy fell in love with this beauty. Although she had such a short hairstyle of the 30s, I immediately recognized her voice. Also in this film, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball quickly appear, but I have to admit that I have not yet left Ball. I can't find her, but I know she is here. <br /> <br /> Aster, with the exception of some disgusting chewing of chewing gum in the first third of the film, was fun to watch and Randolph Scott - although better in westerns - also pretty. <br /> <br /> This is just a good, pleasant to the touch movie, good if you want to enjoy the great talents of Aster and Rogers.
