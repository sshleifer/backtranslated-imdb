I have seen this film at least 4 times since 1984, and it's still great every time I see it. This is a very convincing version of the opera “Carmen” with amazing flamenco dancing, naked bones and, of course, wonderful music. <br /> <br /> This is a story about Carmen - this is a story in a story, each of which runs parallel to the Other, to a double tragic end. Obviously, this is a low-budget Spanish production; the film contains dances from some of the leading Spanish flamenco dancers. The combination of floating opera music and the sound of dancing boots on a wooden stage makes the story more powerful. <br /> <br /> This is an independent film that is shot at its best and is probably my favorite one. foreign film.
