Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman is the latest animated film about Batman released directly on video / DVD. (Minor spoilers ahead) The plot revolves around a new crime fighter, Batman, who seems to be personally involved, for any reason, to stop a large batch of weapons. <br /> <br /> Although the film is quite interesting, it is not as good as Ghost Mask, Zero, or The Return of the Joker. The main reason is that he does not highlight the emotional appeal of other films. At the end of this film, we do not feel sorry for anyone, as in others, especially “Sub-zero”. There is no real tragedy that would make other animated films special to us. Even Batman is not really a “tragic” character (like Mr. Freese or Fantasm). Not only that, but the alter ego of Batman seems so incredibly “tough” and boring that the viewer doesn’t care what happened to her, what made her put on a mask, or what happened to her at the end, and that's the main reason. we do not perceive this particular emotional attraction. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. He has his moments, for example, when viewers find out who Batman really is and see the return of an old villain who was last seen in the original “Batman: animated series”. The action is also very pleasant with some very tense moments. <br /> <br /> If the story of Batman were more interesting, this film would be better than “The Return of the Joker” in my book, but as of now It is 4th place (out of 4th). <br /> <br /> As far as animation is concerned, this is the same as the cartoon “New Adventures of Batman” from the middle to the end of the 1990s. The score is not as memorable as in the previous three animated films about Batman, but, nevertheless, it is good. <br /> <br /> I recommend buying this DVD because, despite its flaws, it is pleasant. But remember that he is not as good as other Batman cartoons. <br /> <br /> 7/10
