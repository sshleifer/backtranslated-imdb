Full disclosure: I'm a cynic. I like my sad endings and dry socks. I didn’t cry when Bambi’s mother was shot dead. The new film by Smith Smith "Happiness" looks like a desperate request to the "Oscar". Basically, I was born without an artistic soul. <br /> <br /> So why did I like "10 items or less?" Maybe it was a double espresso that I drank before the show. Or (more likely), perhaps it was that even the coolest movie fans could use a random shot of sweetness. <br /> <br /> And that's cute. From the moment “He” meets “Scarlet” (an event far from Nora Efron, “meet the beloved”), the view goes on an intimate journey, when two strangers learn to care about where their lives are going. (With the excellent help of the cameraman Phedon Papamichael in the style of the cinematic style.) <br /> <br /> The main argument about the film is that it is too far-fetched. The film is far-fetched? I dont know. You tell me. I have not met Adrian Brody on the market yet. (However, not because of the lack of attempts). I like to think of adventures that can happen if this important event happens? Gosh, I do. That is where most of the “10 items or less” reviews are missing. They do not take into account that even we cynics have fantasies. And, hell, sometimes it’s worth being allowed to live them, 82 minutes at a time.
