Pearl S. Buck was a brilliant author, who was the first American lady to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1938, and won her prize with Enrico Fermi, an Italian physicist. <br /> <br /> She wrote this novel in 1931, which was the second one after her first novel (East Wind and West Wind) in 1930, and her beginning in literature was fantastic for her main novels. <br /> <br /> she won in 1935 (Pulitzer Prize) in literature about her eternal romance (The Good Land), which made a brilliant panorama about the life of a Chinese peasant (Vung Lung) and his wife (O-Lane) and their efforts to cope with the difficulties of difficult positions on their land in order to reach their big fortune with their shoulders. br /> <br /> Paul Muni succeeded in this role of a Chinese peasant, and he prepared himself for this role at meetings with the Chinese in San Francisco in their city, so that they would be Chinese exactly like real and real. <br /> <br /> <br /> Rainer succeeded in her role as (O-Lane) thanks to this brilliant proof that she won the Academy Award. I will be the best actress in 1937.
