As I said, this is a hidden surprise. It is well written, well acted and well cast. I liked everything in this movie. Look in Hollywood, all is well, except for the bright side. Angelina Jolie is great in this, and I watch every movie with her completely so that I can get my hands on it. Worth seeing.
