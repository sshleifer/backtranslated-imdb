Ecstasy (1933) (USA, 1940) Starring Hedy Lamarr (as Hedy Kiesler) <br /> <br /> The world's first glimpse of 19-year-old Hedy Lamarr occurs in the first moments of this treasure of the 1930s, when she sweeping across the screen in an angelic wedding dress. This was supposed to be the beginning of a legendary career. It was our great acquaintance with the most beautiful woman who ever decorated the silver screen. <br /> <br /> This is Eve's wedding night (Lamarr), and her elder husband does not seem to be interested in her romantic successes. She retreats to a lonely bed and fiddles with her wedding ring in a beautiful scene when the realization of her marital error overcomes her. It seems that the husband is more interested in accuracy and order than in love. Gustav Machati uses magnificent views and pristine shots to capture the great talent and beauty of Lamarr. Without the words said at the beginning of the film, she is able to understand our sympathy, our hearts and our support. It was this combination that prepared the audience in 1930 for what they were going to see when the film turned around. Ecstasy was considered shocking for its time ... Some considered it scandalous. <br /> <br /> She returns home to her father’s estate and files for divorce. The next day, she wakes up with a full sense of freedom and happiness. She just needs to go out and feel the freedom of the countryside and the fresh air. Eva goes on horseback riding and passes through a beautiful lake. And in one of the most famous scenes in the history of cinema, Hedy Lamarr became the first person who ever appeared naked in the main film. Her prank in the forest and her skinny adventure on the lake were legendary scandalous. But the audience could not stay away. As in many of today's films, the controversy made this film a must-see. <br /> <br /> Eva’s mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find a horse that has run away with her clothes. After an awkward meeting, they eventually fall in love with each other. Their first romantic date was almost as controversial as the nude scene with its glaring waves of eroticism. However, Machaty does an excellent job in these romantic moments. Machaty creates one adorable moment when Eva literally sinks into her new lover using a great early camera trick. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to exaggerate how bold this performance was on the part of Lamarr. Many could assume that it was a career suicide. Instead, he gained worldwide fame and caught the attention of Louis B. Meyer, who signed a contract with MGM with her. There are some really erotic moments in this film, even by today's coarse standards. It is impossible to imagine how they were obtained in the 1930s. Again, Machaty was very clever with his imagery, leaving much to the imagination. But we all understand very well what we see, and it is very well done. <br /> <br /> A meeting between Eva’s ex-husband and her current lover may be inevitable. However, the consequences of this meeting are not. The film takes several unexpected turns in its final act, and all this makes for a great story and a wonderful debut on the big stage of the movie star on Hedy Lamarr. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this controversial once, now Tame the movie and convince you to find it in a restored form on DVD. It's worth it, if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr. But the story is also irresistible, and the direction is ahead of its time. Ecstasy is an unforgettable early treasure. <br /> <br /> www.tccandler.com - TC Candler Movie Reviews !!!
