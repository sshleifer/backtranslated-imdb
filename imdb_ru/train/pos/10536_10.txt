Yes ... I'm going from 1-0 on this and here's why. Over the past few years I have watched quite a lot of comedies and have only stayed with a little laugh and a couple of late-rental videos, because the films were so easy to forget. Then I stumble on "Nothing." It looked interesting, although I did not expect much. I was wrong. It was probably one of the funniest films I've ever watched. Dave and Andrew make up an excellent comedic couple, and the humor was memorable enough to be remembered, but not too complicated to miss a joke. I do not want to celebrate any of the real scenes, because I feel that this film is worth seeing this time. With the emergence of new and new meaningless concepts in films (you know, such as murderous military aircraft and “fresh” remakes that destroy the old classics), this film will make you happy to say that you can laugh at “Nothing”.
