Sammy, Kerr, the god of metal rock, they tried to stop him, they tried to ban him, tried to censor his music !! (much like in real life Di Snyder from Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osbourne). The dead Sammy Kure was supposed to play Halloween at his old school for dancing. One fan, and the only one who knew how he was, and what he felt (or was he?) Nuke, dj on a local radio station (Gene Simmons) has and gives a single copy of Sammy Eddie's latest recording. But when Eddie tries to play backwards, he finds Sammy talking to him from the dead and telling him what to do to get back to the bullies at his school who hate him and his music .. Everything works until Sammy starts kill !! A great movie that must be seen by heavy metal fans, with a great soundtrack from Fastway, and in case you don’t know what songs sound or know Fastway, and don’t like them, they changed the voice a little and the style that sounds like the more famous Cinderella or Ratt. Is the movie a real horror movie? Well, it depends on what you call a horror movie. For me, a real horror film is a slasher, with a huge number of murders or just scary .. This film is not one, not enough deaths, but you can't call it a fighter, comedy, drama, suspense, or a thriller, which is why I think it should to be terrified ... So, if you want a “Rock N 'Roll, Rockin' in the middle of the night, then your soul !! Than Sammy Kerr and Trick or Treat for you .. I mean,“ what are you afraid of? It's just rock and roll!?! "
