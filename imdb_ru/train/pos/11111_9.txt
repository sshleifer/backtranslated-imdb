Soprano is perhaps the most open series you have ever wanted to see. He's smart, freaky, funny - and he is so well tolerated by the mafia genre that most people can't stop watching. The best aspect of this show is the stunning realism of the characters living in the underworld of New York crime families. Most of the time, you really do not know whether the wise men will strike someone in the back or buy them lunch. <br /> <br /> Another addition to the realistic approach of the characters of this show is the depth of their personality. These are dangerous people, most of whom are killers, but damn if you don't love them either. I laughed at their wise men, burst into tears when they were wrong in their judgments, and I was afraid of the mercilessness of a serious criminal. <br /> <br /> The New Jersey suburb is perfect for the subtext of this show - people are not always what they seem, and the sharp contrast between the noise and the actions of these seemingly petty criminals weighs even up the chances. <br /> <br /> If you havenâ€™t already done this, you should definitely do it.
