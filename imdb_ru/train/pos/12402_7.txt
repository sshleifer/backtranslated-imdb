**A warning! Spoilers ahead! ** <br /> <br /> This short part is the first of the two, which tells about the short part of the “Matrix”, in which Morpheus explains how this matrix appeared. Since we already know the story, the plot itself is not surprising; and the short is not so much interesting as informative. But how it is presented, as a file in the historical archives. Visual effects are better than average, and cold colors usually help short circuits. <br /> <br /> A couple of problems. Violence in a fairy tale is a little unreasonable and, in combination with a random dose of political correctness (the UN scene), distracts from the direct narrative of the short. Plus, you need to see it in the second part. <br /> <br /> Animatrix's concept is great, and despite some problems, this short film still does its job. It would not correspond to the original film in style, content or stream. This is the perfect way to uncover a story. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: good information. One could say a little better, but still solid 7 out of 10.
