Three sergeants in the British army stationed in India, sent to stop the uprising of the tribe of murderers, known as gangsters. One of the sergeants, Cutter, leaves the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by gangsters led by an ominous Guru. Gunga Ding, a regiment of the water regiment, returns to the camp for help, while the other two sergeants follow him, but are also captured. Now the major sends the full information after three, but does not understand that they fall into the trap set by the refugees. However, Gunga Ding saves the day. Excellent shot of the film, although today it is politically incorrect. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks do give very humorous and exciting performances with Jaff very well in the lead role, and Cianelli is very sinister, like Guru. Rating - 10 out of 10.
