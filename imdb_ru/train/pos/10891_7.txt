You can survive by surviving Christmas. I thought the TV version was a bit edited. I like Ben Aflek. He plays Drew Johnson, an adult without a family who is willing to pay complete strangers. “Valkos” with James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara starring as parents, and Christina Applegate as daughter of Lisa Valko. Drew is lonely on holidays because he doesn’t have his own family, so he rents a family in the suburbs of Chicago for a quarter of a million dollars. Bill Macy, whom I remember best for the role of Maud’s husband, Arthur, is hired to play Duda, grandfather. When the whole situation collapses, the truth can be painful. Valcos home improvement collapses apart from the Drew situation. Rich girl Drew and her parents make an amazing visit. You can not buy what you want! Acting and writing are mediocre, but a first-class cast gives them the final stage.
