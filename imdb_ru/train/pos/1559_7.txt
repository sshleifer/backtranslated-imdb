This particular episode of Smallville is probably the best episode on the air after the reunion. This is for many reasons. For example, he returns the series to his roots. He welcomes Lionel from a supposedly long absence from the Luthorcorp plaza office in Metropolis. This room has not been in Smallville for a very long time, and its re-visit brings back many memories from Smallville’s past. Not to mention the fact that Lionel's conversations with Lex are always admirable. <br /> <br /> Another pleasant return, you guessed it, is Bart Allen (aka Impulse), AC (aka Aquaman) and Victor Stone (aka Cyborg), Not only does Stephen Decnayt reunite the former lawyers of justice, he mixes them in a unique way with the Smallville formula that it seems like a full-length film. <br /> <br /> From there you get the main story: the green arrow forms the league, tries to blow up 33.1, Bart is captured, Clark saves him, and the object is transferred to the kingdom com. Everything is good and elegant, with a good combination of secrecy, action, pace and expectation. Yes, and Cyborg has some cool new features that are characteristic of the Justice League character :). <br /> <br /> The music probably makes this episode so good. If you remember correctly, the first episode, directed by Stephen Decnight, was Agless from the 4th season. It was a mediocre episode, but something seemed out of place. Maybe it was music, or acting, or the fact that Clark says at the end “we didn’t find you, you found us,” kind of made people lose faith in the formula. But, fortunately, Steve Deknight bought himself in this episode of "Justice". <br /> <br /> I had a few misunderstandings about Justice, because of which he did not reach as many as 10. First of all, the too stupid way out of the League of Justice from the Ridge of the object of expansion. I mean, it would be much cooler if, say, Green Arrow and Cyborg took off on Oliver's bike (remembering from the episode with the arrows). Clark and Impulse were supposed to run, and Aquaman had to swim a different route. But it was incredibly stupid, it scored 2 points out of a total of 10. <br /> <br /> Secondly, another funny moment, not as bad as the first, but when Green Arrow says: “Let's save the world” It made me cringe. In general, judging by the acting, music, direction and staging qualities, the pros outweigh the disadvantages, and this is still one of the best episodes in Smallville’s history and possibly the 2nd best episode in season 6. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 ...
