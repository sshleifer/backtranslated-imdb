It was one of my favorite movies for a long time. Recently, I was happy to see it on a DVD, which makes it easy to view old, grainy versions of VHS. <br /> <br /> I haven’t seen him for years and watched him today to be surprised at how well the film stands up to time. This is one of those rare, ideal comedy storms, where a magnificent composition (a really funny line after a really funny line) is combined with a great direction and outstanding performances at the same time. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore was nominated for an Oscar for “Arthur”, but lost (although John Gilgud won for the best male supporting role). If Moore’s performance in Arthur doesn’t win Oscar’s Best Actor, this is proof that no comedian can ever win a title (another example is Gene Wilder in Young Frankenstein). <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon creates the film, perfectly loyal to each of the characters and the heartfelt tone of the story. Simply put, IMHO movie is a rare gem. It’s just sad that Steve Gordon passed away just a year after the release of Arthur. <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, which is available from 1/2007, it is. Although the video quality is far superior to older copies of VHS, the widescreen version is still not available. <br /> <br /> There are some nice additions to the DVD, but this is not enough. One example is the director’s commentary, which says that he really wanted some deleted frames and scenes to be included (because they were hysterical), but he had to make a tough choice for final editing. A DVD, being the ideal format for including such material, would certainly have to offer it. <br /> <br /> This is the original “Arthur”, a classic comedy intended for books.
