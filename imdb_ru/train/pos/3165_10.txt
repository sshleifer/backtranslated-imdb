It was one of the funniest and greatest comedy shows on national television. Unfortunately, the show is not placed among the great sitcoms where it really belongs. The actors did an excellent job, and the first to sixth seasons were in full swing. Although the seventh season was not so good compared to the previous six, it was still funny. The eighth season has become a real challenge. Without Grace and Ashton Kutcher, the show just fell apart. Not to say too well that other actors wouldn't be good if one of the 2 main characters left, such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Walderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Joe Rapp, Mila Kunis and Laura Pripon ) left to show that this will have the same effect. And the inclusion of Randy (Josh Meyers) also did not help, because he was not well received by the fans of the show. I believe that if the show ended a year ago, it would surely go down in history as one of the greatest sitcoms. Season 8 was a bit boring, but the final was excellent. I'm going to skip the show, I just hope that one day I will wake up and find out that the show is back, like an 80s show with the same line-up, because I'm going to miss this hell.
