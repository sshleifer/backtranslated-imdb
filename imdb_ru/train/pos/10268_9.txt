This typical Mamet film gives a calm, even glimpse of what makes a person of confidence (Joe Mantegna) good. Researched as a psychological study of a famous psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), it slowly draws her into her world with the usual unpleasant consequences. The cast included several players found in several Mom movies (Stephen Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soul, William H. Macy), and they do their usual good work. I loved Lindsay Crose in this film and often wondered why she did not become a more visible player than she became. Perhaps I do not look in the right places! <br /> <br /> The film is moving at a slow pace, with a flat dialogue, but at the same time it maintains a voltage level that logically leads to the end of the collision. In the final, you expected real disappointment, but I find it encouraging and satisfying. I love this film!
