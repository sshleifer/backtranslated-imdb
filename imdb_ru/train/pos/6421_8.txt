People of Honor - the true story of a proud and persistent black-earth diver (the fabulous Cuba Gooding Jr.) is certainly a great movie that touches and entertains at the same time and is part of the absolute cream of the movie of the new millennium. Great game - the main reason to make this movie something really special and enjoyable, great experience. The charismatic Robert De Niro is amazing as the rude, cruel and ruthless leader Billy Sunday - the role for him is practically written. This film, along with the fantastic “15 Minutes” (2001), are the two most recent proofs that it still remains one of the best actors of our time. On the other hand, People of Honor include a wonderful performance of Cuba by Gooding Jr., who has been one of the most promising young black actors since Boyz n the hood. People of Honor go straight to Jerry Maguire, How Good, and Instinct. Cuba Gooding Jr. is a skilled and fantastic actor, and I’m ready to receive a lot of amazing films from him. The honor people also have a great storyline and perhaps the most exciting dive episodes in the history of cinema. This is a great, exciting movie, and I can only recommend it.
