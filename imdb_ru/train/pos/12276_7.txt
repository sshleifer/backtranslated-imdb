Can such surrounding production fail in achieving its main goal - to adapt the novel by Allende correctly? Obviously, yes. Bill Augustus managed to make a shallow, shallow film in which the main elements of the South American mentality are presented simply as side events, which leads to complete inconsistency. I can not believe that there was a whole production team that could not understand the book! Of course, in this film there is a technical quality, and I think that the actors did everything possible with what they had in their hands, but something was missing. And that something was the most important part.
