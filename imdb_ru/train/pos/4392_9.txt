I really liked this movie. Tobey Maguire as Jake gives an amazing performance. He has to be one of the best actors I've ever seen. And I was surprised that there were so many humorous lines in the film. He, too, was very good at it, although I had never seen him speak a comic before. The film involves you in working with the characters and makes you wonder what will happen to them all. I didn’t know what to expect from Juel’s speech, but I think she did pretty well. Many exciting scenes. Carefully good ride. I am absolutely a fan of Maguire. Check the House Cider Rules. One of the best of all time.
