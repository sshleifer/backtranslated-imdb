I saw it at the show last night too. I was just amazed at how much better this film was than I expected. Few films can combine dark comedy and drama about current events, nor will it collapse in prison. <br /> <br /> I will not rephrase the plot too much, because I think the less you know about this movie in it makes it a lot better. But I will say that the speech of Adam Sandler was really refreshing and real. He was funny and much funnier than most of his latest comedies. Don Cheadle, as always, was believable. <br /> <br /> This film is not as funny as Borat or Billy Madison, but it has a good tempo. I would say that 90% of viewers laughed at most of the film. Halfway through the film slows down to solve the dramatic end of things and does a really good job of tying it all together. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was really cool, like instead of playing a whole black friend / White friend, they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationship itself.
