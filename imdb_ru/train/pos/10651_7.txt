Some movies just do not need to redo it. This is one of them. By itself, this is not a bad movie. But it is not able to capture the scent and horror of the 1963 film of the same name. Liam Neeson was excellent, as always, and most of the actors stand, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who simply did not bring the right feeling to the character of Luke. But the main mistake of this version is that she is too far away from the story of Shirley Jackson in her attempts to be grand and lost some of the thrill of an earlier film in exchange for more vivid special effects. Again I say that in itself is not a bad movie. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the old version much more.
