One of the many Merrie Melodies cartoons that entertained American moviegoers during World War II, The Itch in Time by Bob Clampett depicts a flea stroller settling on Elmer's dog. The little guy turns into a real sadist when he arranges a house on the back of a dog, but Elmer warns the dog: “Another skryuch and I will give you a bath!” Meanwhile, the flea installs dynamite on the dog! * And this is not the end! I noticed that in one of the scenes, Elmer was reading a comic featuring Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig. Obviously, Elmer and Bugs often starred in the same film, but Elmer never starred in the same film as Porky (except for the very short “Any Bonds Today?”). But for me, the thought that Elmer reads about these other famous characters from his genre emphasizes the metaphysical nature of his world, as if he knew about their existence in his universe, even if they do not figure in this cartoon. <Br /> <br /> Of course, I probably went too far in my analysis. I’m sure that the cartoon was intended as pure entertainment, and it certainly entertains. As for the line “I might like this one,” it sounds as if it was something that the censors would not allow, but somehow missed it; For example, I really do not know how it should have sounded. Was it something sexy? As for the end, if I thought that I had seen everything, I would be tempted to look for more, and not to do what the cat did (although it was an elegant device). <br /> <br /> * The guys from these cartoons probably had something for TNT, right?
