I sat down to watch this movie with great trepidation and a little hope. I did not think that this film could fit my subject. But this is absolutely true, and then some. First, I have to say that Jared Harris did an extraordinary job like John Lennon. At times it seemed that Harris was directing Lennon. The resemblance was often strange, and he clearly studied Lennon's manner and vocal inclinations. Aiden Quinn was pretty good in the role of McCartney, also strikingly similar to McKee, although he sometimes stumbled over his accent in Skuse. <br /> <br /> This artwork was well written and well oriented. Of course, it was pure fantasy, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur, looking out of the keyhole at this reunion. The rooftop scene was especially touching, as McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard in childhood - that he was worthy and important, and he could never be to blame for the fact that he had been abandoned by his parents. I also liked the scene in the park, where they danced with absolute energy in front of a reggae band! <br /> <br /> My only complaint would be: I'm not so sure that John was as caustic as he. portrayed in the film at this stage of his life. He adapted quite well to his inner position, and in fact he was quite friendly when fans approached him. Only a few years later, he was very friendly when his killer first applied for an autograph on the day he was killed. <br /> <br /> Basically, this film reawakened those feelings about what could have happened if John lived a little longer. I am quite sure that the Beatles would return together at some stage. And Iâ€™m pretty sure that Lennon and McCartney will still be friends today. <br /> <br /> Great, VH1. I will watch it again and again. <br /> <br />
