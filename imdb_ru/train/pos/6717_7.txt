This documentary was very detailed and revealing, and at the same time entertaining, which, in my opinion, was quite impressive. I felt that they did a very good job, highlighting the sport from its origin to the present day, but, nevertheless, there is a reason why I don’t put such a high score in this film ... <br /> <br /> I it seemed that from time to time the story was too focused on the “nouns” of this sport, so to speak: too much in certain places where you can go surfing, and especially too much in certain people. I felt as though the documentary was more related to the nature of the sport, the ideology of the sport, etc. It would be better (although it was, of course, considered, I do not think it would take as much time as was required)). <br /> <br /> And for many people who are not going crazy about surfing, from time to time, hearing how they continue to talk about specific places and particular people can become boring. Despite the fact that video clips and detailed research are well respected, they could be presented in a way that is better for those who are not an avid surfer. <br /> <br /> Also, my biggest disappointment was at the time when they talked about how amazing and wonderful some of the events in the history of surfing were, they had no real unfolding shots, and all the time, while you are waiting to see on the silver screen this amazing, breathtaking event that these men say they are changing lives, and in the end everything you get is a lot of men, not actual shots. It was too tempting for me to hear these stories, and then not to see them. I understand the difficulty of getting the footage about everything, but please: do not brag about the event, and not show it. <br /> <br /> In general, a very fresh documentary that I enjoyed watching; not the best documentary due to the aforementioned reasons, but being very new and having some extremely exciting footage and a good soundtrack, this is a documentary film that I would advise everyone to check out.
