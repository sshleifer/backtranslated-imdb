A reportage based on real historical events, this horrifyingly brutal, bloody and shocking epic period keeps the viewers interested, creating a believability that is absent in most films made in a distant era. Ms. Bolkan portrays the rebellious nun as a tourist force. Her gradual transformation into a character from an obedient but unwilling partner in the social injustice of her day is convincingly shown by eloquent sequences: her evidence of the occasional violent activities of the hated local duke, her forbidden love affair with a Jew, her criminal flight to the Muslim invasion of the Force of sensual Prince Ahmed Anthony Korlan) In this film there are several painfully realistic bloody episodes (human spanking) that are not for the squeamish, but the viewer with a strong stomach and an interest in medieval history should find enough interest. Deserves attention, at least as an antidote to Hollywood images of the medieval world.
