My wife and I took our 13-year-old son to watch this film, and were delighted with the amazing fun of the film. This is especially attractive for boys and men who remember their childhood, but even women like the film, and especially the objection of Holly Kate Eisenberg: "The boys are so weird." It's nice to see a film that shows inexcusably that boys and girls really differ in their emotional and social composition. Boys really do such weird things and usually survive to tell a story and scare their mothers silly! We liked the film so much that my son and eleven-year-old friend, me and my daughters' 23-year-old boy went to watch a movie on the weekend for the guys the next day. The second time we were even more fun, and everyone was delighted. This is a pure and delightfully acting pre-teens cast, reminiscent of the Television Classic "Kooks and Geeks." We all feel that he will become a sleeping hit, similar to Freaks & Geeks, which did not survive its first season, but sold the DVD release. See this especially if you have boys, and you find that it stimulates a conversation about fun and security! Girls will like it because of the opportunity to say: “The boys are so weird!” Don't miss this ...
