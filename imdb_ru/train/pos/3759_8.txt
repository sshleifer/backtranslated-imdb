Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) become real rock stars in the present future, but still need additional work on their instruments. In the future, Bill and Ted end up in a publicly popular history, but then an evil person (Joss Ackland) is going to kill Bill and Ted, sending cyborg sympathies to destroy them. Cyborgs are sent back, and they actually kill the real Bill and Ted. Now both guys are spirits, and they need to travel through heaven and hell to save themselves and their future. <br /> <br /> Director Peter Hewitt (Tom and Hack, Borrowers) made a smart sequel with amazing visual effects. Much more fun and entertaining than the original. William Sadler (The Shawshank Redemption) shoots the show as The Grim Reaper. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a good anamorphic widescreen transmission (1.85: 1) and an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD has a theatrical trailer and fun backstage feature. This sequel was a box office hit, like the original, but also (believe it or not), one of the best sequels ever made (depending on your point of view). George Carlin briefly repeats his role from the original. Pam Greer also appears in a small role. This is a nice fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
