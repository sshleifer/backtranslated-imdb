Dude, if someone was expecting a good zombie movie after reading this title, then you are mentally retarded and deserve disappointment. As for me, I was expecting a low-budget zombie movie - and this is exactly what I got. I was not disappointed at all. I thought it was a cool little movie. The zombies were exactly as they should be, because all the zombies were JUST turned, so they are undead zombies. Obviously, they did it because it would be rather expensive if they made a complete rotten FX zombie. I understood everything, I have no idea how someone can seriously find fault with this film. This is called “WHERE THE LIVING DEAD” for the love of God! Would you watch the movie "Redneck Zombies" and ANY film by Uwe Boll and really EXPECTED that it would be great? Of course not! So why on IMDb there are some assholes who, like schoolgirls, whining about this film, I will never understand. Yes, yes, there are the worst films there, so stop saying that this is the worst thing you have ever seen, because you know that you are full of it! Have you ever watched "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "House of the Dead" ???? This is one of the worst I've ever seen. If you don’t see that it’s just a budget zombie movie made by fans of zombie movies, then something is wrong with you. I just had fun with it. From my fingers, and I would also like to see a sequel.
