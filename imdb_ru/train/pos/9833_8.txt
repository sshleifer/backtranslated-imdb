The terrorist tries to steal a top-secret biological weapon, and in the process of escaping, he becomes infected when the case of the lethal agent is hacked. Soldiers can recover the case, but the terrorist goes to the hotel where he is trying to escape. In the end, they get to the place where he hides, and "clean" the hotel and its inhabitants. Unfortunately, they get rid of his body by cremation, and if you have seen The Return of the Living Dead, you know what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 is widely discussed by critics and zombie fans as a complete mess of the movie. Although this is a fair assessment, it is not without its high points. First, he has a lot of bloody deaths to keep happy hounds. There are plenty of zombies that seem to appear wherever possible. They are in the water, rafters of houses, hiding behind trees, and for some reason they like to hide under a bunch of dead bushes, only to jump out when heroes try to escape. In the fridge, even a zombie's head is hiding. You have to see it to believe it, because this scene alone forces Zombi 3 to view IMO. It can be a terrible editing and a very dubious game, especially from the doctor, who should be one of the worst actors I've seen, but Zombie 3 is still a very interesting movie. Sometimes it's nice to sit back and watch a movie that does not require anything other than your time and impartiality. Zombi 3 is suitable for this account, and then for some. Even nicer if you open a few beers and watch it with like-minded friends. I give it 8/10, simply because of pure pleasure.
