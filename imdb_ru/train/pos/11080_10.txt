First of all, when people hear “RITCHES GUY”, they immediately think of SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone associates Guy Ritchie with Snatch. They do not expect him to explore new frontiers. This film REVOLVER is different from jerk; It is much darker and very difficult. The reason I gave it a grade of 10 is because I had to watch Revolver 3 times to understand everything. So this movie is playing with your head. It is very cleverly written. <br /> <br /> This movie is different from Snatch. It was done wonderfully, the cinema is beautiful, and you can recognize the personal touch of Guy Ritchie (the direction style) in it. <br /> <br /> I was struck by the difficulty of the main character and the way we were left with more questions than answers.
