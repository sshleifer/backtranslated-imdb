Born in Berlin in 1942, Margaret von Trotta was an actress, and now she is a very important director and writer. She is described, perhaps even unfairly caricatured, as a director, whose desire to convey the sensitivity of a woman to the screen outweighs her artistic merit. Rosenstrasse, which received mixed and even strange reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews I have ever read in this newspaper) is not an ideal film. This is a wonderful film and evidence of the rare merger of a successful opposition to the genocidal Nazi regime by all nations, generally weak Germans, demonstrating on one of the streets of Berlin. <br /> <br /> Co-author von Trotta uses the actual incident on Rosenstrasse in the context of a young woman’s search for information about her mother’s unknown life in childhood in the German capital during World War II. <br /> <br /> Husband Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) died and in an amazing return to the orthodox Jewish way of life, apparently still in a long break, Ruth is not only "sitting in Shiva" (weekly mourning ritual of the Jews) but she insists on following the strict prescriptions of her faith. Her apartment in New York reflects the wealth provided by the work of her late spouse. Her American-born daughter Hannah (Maria Schroeder) and her brother are a little embarrassed by her mother's suggestion of restrictive orthodox Jewish customs, but they agree. Mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah's fiancé, a non-Jew named Luis (Fedya van Huet). The internal crisis may well break out, as Ruth warns that she will refuse Hannah if she does not give up madly in love, handsome Louis. Stay with us. <br /> <br /> A cousin comes to pay his respects and tells Hannah, who is interested, about the mystery of wartime about the mother’s childhood in Berlin. Hannah is intrigued - she asks her mother, who decisively refuses to discuss this part of her life. It is very, very realistic. I grew up with parents who left Nazi Germany just in time, and I knew many children, whose families as a whole, but, as a rule, partially avoided the Holocaust. These days are simply not discussed. <br /> <br /> Hannah, learning that a German pagan had saved Ruth's life, went to Berlin in the hope of finding a savior who was still breathing. If she had not been, it would have been a very short film. But Ruth, pretending to be a historian, finds 90-year-old Lena Fisher (Doris Schade), now a widow. Lena tells about a happy interview, but shocked by overwhelmed memories, the scenes move quite smoothly from modern Berlin to the wartime capital. <br /> <br /> Young 1943 Lena (Katya Riemann) was an excellent pianist, married to the Jewish violinist Fabian Fischer (Martin Feiffel). With the advent of the Nazi regime, he was obliged to use “Israel” as a second name, just as Jewish women had to add “Sarah” to their names (by the way, I would like IMDb not to indicate Fabian’s name in his list of characters with the false "Israel" is included - it simply perpetuates the name that the Nazis use as a sign of classification and degradation. <br /> <br /> Although Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps, those who were married to "Aryans" have been released. Until 1943, when the regime decided to take them away (the majority were men; the minority were Jewish women married to non-Jews). The news summary is shown here in all its frightening intensity. <br /> <br /> Young Lena is trying to find of her husband. All she and many other women know is that they are enclosed in a building on Rozenshtrasse. A crowd of agitated women is accumulating, some of them regret to seek help from German officers, who, as expected, refuse help as well they are insulted (“whore who loves Jews” is one of the names). As a plot, Lena more or less takes the eight-year-old Ruth, who hid when her mother was captured (remember that Ruth is now sitting in Shiva in Manhattan). Sweet Lode depicts the child Ruth. <br /> <br /> As a result of more and more angry protests, women are finally winning. Men and a handful of women are released. As in the real story, the Nazis surrendered, one of the rare, almost unprecedented times when the madmen admitted defeat in their murder program (the other was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to save the Reich from mentally retarded and chronic invalids, but this is another story). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta creates tension, and the story of every woman is personal and universal. Hannah continues to push the aging Lena, who, slowly getting ready, begins to suspect that she is not dealing with an ordinary historian, but with someone who needs to know about the girl she saved, the child whose mother was killed. <br /> <br /> Contrasts between the 1943 Rozenshtrasse, the set and today's street in a busy, reconstructed, united Berlin provide a recurring thematic element. Today's Berlin bears a legacy, but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta confirms this very well. <br /> <br /> The protagonists are impressive. Lena's husband, although strong, is also shown to be completely helpless in the prison trap with the likely prospect of deportation (which, as shown, was clearly understood by all the characters — including the local police and military — as a one-sided journey into oblivion), Elder Ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long depressed in her happy new york life. Hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father’s death makes it necessary to discover the past of her family. These things happen (although the Times critic doesn't seem to know this). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta’s hand is sure, but not perfect. The scene with Goebbels at the evening where Lena plays the violin is not needed and distracting. The suggestion that she might have gone to bed with the propaganda minister, Hitler’s most fanatical top-level fan, to save her husband, distracting the demonstrating spouses and relatives from surprising achievements. Most German officers come from the central staff and are formed by the school of the Teutonic vileness of Eric von Stroheim. But it is clear. <br /> <br /> The Rosenstrasse story was the subject of books and articles, and some argue that this is a paradigm that claims that many more Jews could be saved if more Germans protested. Unfortunately, this argument is meaningless. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deep and understandable self-serving. Most Germans were somewhere between passive and violent anti-Semitism. That is why the Rozenshtrasse protest was practically isolated Whether Goldenhagen’s thesis that most Germans were voluntary accomplices of real killers buys or rejects cannot be denied that pre-Nazi endemic anti-Semitism has grown into a violent strain since 1933. <br /> <br /> Elderly Lena notes that women managed to make a “ray of light” in times of evil. Most of the men and women who appeared as a result of death survived the war. Thus, it was a “ray of light”, and von Trotta’s film is a beacon of light showing that some were saved by courage from mostly ordinary women, and for every life there was a reason to celebrate. And always will be. <br /> <br /> 9/10
