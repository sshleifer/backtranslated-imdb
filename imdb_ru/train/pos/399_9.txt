This film is very cool. If you're a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy movies, you should like this. This film is an Asian Lord of the Rings: a fantastic story based on Chinese mythology. (I understand that many critics have called this film without a plot, I think they probably have no knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you liked the Wanderers or the Warriors of Heaven and Earth, this one should be right on your way. This film is still very difficult to find in the United States, although it was bought for distribution in the United States along with "The Stealing Tiger", "The Hidden Dragon" and "The Iron Monkey". Well worth a look !!! This DVD is also worthy of ownership.
