Kureishi was not endowed with films that justify the quality of his writing. Recent adapted parodies, such as Intimacy, have destroyed a great letter. But Mother surpasses all her previous incarnations, overshadowing even My Beautiful Laundry. A middle-aged woman overcomes a widow, having a carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally weak daughter. The fact that you believe all of this is due to the quality of the action, as well as the ultimate gift of writing. And in Daniel Craig, we have a pompous, daring, rude anti-hero who doesn't let viewers ever wonder why a young stallion ponders bedding for sagging grandmother. Perfectly shot, the film fails only in the weak image of peripheral characters, but, as a study of inconceivable lust, it is a winner.
