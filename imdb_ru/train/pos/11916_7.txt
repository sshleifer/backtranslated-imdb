With all the "adult" insinuations in modern family films, it's nice to see one where you don't need to worry about it, and you can just sit back and enjoy the family with your children. Yes, there may be a few obscene words in this film (at that time Knox swears, but they donâ€™t let you hear full words), but for the most part this film is really as pure as they appear (and it includes films from the past to the day). Moreover, it is very pleasant, one of my favorites, and just a great clean and funny movie to watch with my family. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have against this film is that it is too short and I wish there were more memorable parts in it, I will not mention them, because here I do not want any spoilers . <br /> <br /> Overall, everything is well done and a great movie to watch; so go out and have kids, make cookies and watch this movie!
