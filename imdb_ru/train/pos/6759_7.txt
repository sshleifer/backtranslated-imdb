WHERE THE LOCK IS FINISHED, to become a more famous film by director Otto Preminger, the man who gave the world LAURA. And this time he has the same colleagues: DANA ANDREWS and TIRNI GENE. I must say that Tierney is underutilized here, which largely plays a supporting role, while the focus goes to Andrews. <br /> <br /> He plays a tough, seasoned cop who is used to dealing with a bunch of thugs too vigorously, until one night he accidentally killed a man in the process of his arrest. When the suspicion falls on the taxi driver (TOM TULLY), he begins to investigate the murder, but begins to feel guilty because he is in love with the taxi driver's daughter (GENE TIERNEY). By the way, Tierney looks too elegant for the girl with whom she plays here, and does not seem to fit into the poor background elements of the story. <br /> <br /> As the investigation proceeds, the story takes a grim turn. goes deeper, and it turns out that the dead man had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero. In the end, it turns into a story about morality, in which Andrews develops consciousness about his crime. <br /> <br /> This is an exciting film like a noir with capable performances from a strong cast. A good noir record, decisively directed by Preminger and well played by Andrews and Tierney, despite a slight error in her character.
