After the usual chase scene, Jerry accidentally finds himself inside an invisible ink bottle, which was part of a chemical set. He quickly discovers that he is invisible ... therefore predictable results occur, that is, he uses his new hidden state to torment Tom. Jerry is often simply defended, but he often has sadistic traits that torture a cat whenever it is possible, even when it is not provoked. <br /> <br /> Here he makes Tom think that his eyes are fooling him when cheese from a mousetrap disappears in front of his eyes or milk from a dish. Tom can't take it anymore, so he tries to sleep in this nightmare, but Jerry sets his paw on fire! Dude, I hope little kids didn't think to watch these cartoons back in the 40s and 50s! I always found Jerry, a little mouse, more angry than cute. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, in cartoons, as a rule, any damage done to a character disappears within a few seconds, and it returns to normal. <br /> <br /> The best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of the way, when Tom finds out what this story is with Jerry, and tries in various ways to determine where the mouse is (for example, put flour on the floor to see its tracks ).
