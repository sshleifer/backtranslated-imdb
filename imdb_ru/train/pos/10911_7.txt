I liked this 1936 film with a lot of classic veteran actors, especially William Powell (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), “Mr. Roberts,” who played the role of doctor and detective story. Dr. Bradford was once married to Gene Arthur (Paula Bradford), "Shane", and got a divorce, and yet they managed to live with each other, and fight all the time. Paula wanted her husband to investigate the murder, and did everything possible to convince him that it was very important. Gene Arthur plays a pretty crazy type, and in the 1936 comedy there is a lot, and the kill method is something you never believe in, especially with a jockey on the California race track. Robert Armstrong, (Nick Martel), King Kong, played an important supporting role as a bookmaker with James Gleason, a detective who needs the help of Dr. Bradford to solve this very strange murder mystery. If you see this film, just remember that it was filmed and filmed in 1936, and the audience in those days thought it was great entertainment, and it really was on Those Days!
