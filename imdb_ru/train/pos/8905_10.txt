Old horror movies are interesting, a lot of screaming, a lot of screaming and a lot of humor. “Blob” is a classic in its work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) plays a teenager who tries to become a hero in his city. Going on a date with your girlfriend is pretty typical for all teens. But when the old man discovers the same falling object from the sky, he becomes a victim, and Steve helps him with all his might. When it is up to teenage power, this film really provides it. I know that most adolescents have their own difficulties; when they begin to act, when danger arises, they must learn to forget the past and begin to do something good to save humanity. When adults in the city eventually find out how “Blob” walks around, they should learn to trust adolescents and not allow their behavior to overpower them. The wavering juggernaut was a pretty pretty day, and I think it was JELL-O! When everyone gathers to stop the threat, the city becomes safe again thanks to good old-fashioned cooperation. I still eat Jello and watch this movie all the time, if you don't like Jello, TOUGH! RATING 5 STARS
