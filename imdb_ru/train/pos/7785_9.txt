I just watched 2 films of the Pan brothers, "The Eye" and "One Double." When I watched The Eye, I was a little disappointed with these two guys, whom I had heard good words about them before. This film (The Eye) has a really bad script, especially the final (in my opinion, it's a kid, cliche and too coincident), but it is still good at photography and experimental images. So I decided to watch only one take and was no longer disappointed. Still a great photo, a terrific image, editing in the style of MTV, cool music, and this time in the history of a lot of indie spirit, logical and beautiful, you will see several tiny plot holes, but this will not cause any problems the plot line. The only problem with this movie is that I have a bad DVD.
