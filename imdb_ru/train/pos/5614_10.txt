It took a long time before I could find the title in a special video library in Berlin, and I was lucky to find the English version with Dutch subtitles. I think this is one of the best horror ever. It seems strange to me that some people call this film a black comedy. I must admit, I could not laugh when I saw it for the first time (and it was the same for the second time!) On the one hand, Trelkovsky seems so cute and even cute in his shy behavior, but this boy is on the playground, and there is no explanation. But the most tedious, of course, is his transformation in Simon Chole and the fact that he does not know who he really is. His hallucinations are the worst in this film. Of course, all this is in his thoughts, but this is the apartment that brings out this feminine side of him, or it was also before he moved - I think this is an interesting question. His schizophrenic behavior is difficult to understand, and itâ€™s terrible to see his two sides or personalities fighting against each other. As a result, he first cuts his hand, and then jumps out of the window. But this terrible cry - does this mean that everything will be repeated again and again and again ... that his soul is in a cage or something? And these Egyptian hieroglyphs and other Egyptian things? The fact that he / she looks like a mom in the hospital is not an incident, but the key to my point of view.
