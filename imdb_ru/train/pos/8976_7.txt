Starlift is a pleasant and interesting recollection of those stellar musical pictures that each studio produced during the Second World War. When there are stars in the film like Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon McRae, Randolph Scott, etc., and with people like the Gershwin brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Stein, and Sammy Kahn, delivering music Easy to film film. And the plot does not even interfere. <br /> <br /> Two Air Force soldiers, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerty, are trying to meet Warner Brothers starlet Janice Rule, using the fact that both are from Youngstown, Ohio, and Hagerty's father was a dentist. in the rule as well as half the city. The scheme works too well, since Luella Parsons soon places them as an element in its column. Yes, Luella is also in the film. She must have liked the Warner brothers or Jack Warner, who served her more than other studio executives, because she also used this studio to advertise her radio program at the Hollywood hotel that day. <br /> <br /> But the rest of the story also touched upon Ruth Roman’s real effort, also playing to get her studio and others to do shows at the Air Force bases for servicemen and women heading to Korea. Some of the names I mentioned, others sing and perform on the Travis Air Force base show, where most of the film was shot. <br /> <br /> One special number was filmed for Phil Harris's talents who sing / tell the ballad “Beware the Stranger”, I am a Texas Ranger, assisted by Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yes, Cooper looked as if he had been joking with his image for a very long time. <br /> <br /> This is the oldest cliché when you say that they don’t make it anymore, but in reality it’s not. because you don't have a studio system that has all this contract talent. This one thing about the death of the old studio system, which we can mourn.
