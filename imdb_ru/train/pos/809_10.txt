A very good movie. A classic sci-fi movie with humor, an action movie and everything else. This film offers more aliens. We see the leaders of the Rebel Alliance and most of the imperial forces. The emperor is a somewhat original character. I liked the Ewoks, representing somehow the local savages and Vietnamese. (Excellent links) I liked the fight between Vader and Luke, who is the best of the saga. In The Return of the Jedi, the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the Empire finally collapses. I also appreciate the celebration of victory when it performs Vader's atonement and returns it to the spirit of Anakin Skywalker, along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives sadness and tear. The greatest scenes in Star Wars are among this film: “When Vader Turns on the Emperor.” Luke looks and finds solace when he sees Obi-Wan, Yoda and ... his father (1997 version, not Hayden Christensen). The next best scene is when Luke rushes at Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a deep dark side in this film, despite a good ending. I felt that there was much more than it seems at first glance. And, as always, the music of John William will bring classicism into the Star Wars universe.
