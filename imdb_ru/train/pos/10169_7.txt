“Over Her Dead Body” was a cute little film. He was decent and interesting, although he was pretty funny. There were a few cliches, but I found most of the things fresh. At first I did not think it would be good when it started. If you can pass the first 20 minutes, the film starts to become more and more interesting. This film did not burst into laughter and was not Oh, MY GOSH is wonderful. It was just a movie, you can sit down and enjoy how pleasant it was. I do not understand how bad this film was. His rating is too low. I could deal with 5.5, but with 4.8? 1 is shameful. It was pretty good, and there was nothing terrible in it to give him the one that most people gave.
