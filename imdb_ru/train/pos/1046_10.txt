Probably my favorite film, the story of dedication, sacrifice and devotion to a noble cause, but this is not a sermon and not boring. He just never gets old, even though I’ve seen him 15 or more times in the last 25 years. The performance of Paul Lucas makes me cry in my eyes, and Bette Davis in one of her few truly sympathetic roles delights. Children, as the grandmother says, are more like “dressed dwarfs” than children, but this only makes them more interesting to see. And the slow awakening of the mother to what is happening in the world and under her own roof is plausible and astounding. If I had a dozen thumbs up, they would all be aware of this movie.
