My older sister was born in March 1985 and suffers from cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life, she did not see anything except the walls of our house and her school, which also has other disabled children. I was the subject of all jokes, because my sister is disabled, and I still think that no one will or will never give a damn about her and her condition. Then I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> I knew that the Christie family was going through. but they were lucky. Christie could talk, he could communicate, and he had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she cannot say a word, and she cannot use her hands to do anything except grab things. but this film made me realize that there are other people in the world, such as my sister, and the ending (to be honest) made me cry. And I SAW SHOUSHANK !!! This film is seriously undervalued and should not. This film tells people something. that people should be proud of their lives. thinking you can't write? this guy wrote with his foot. thinking you're not attractive? this girl was denied to many girls because of his condition. not the fastest runner? Christie could not even get up. <br /> <br /> My point of view: parents of small children, I suggest your children to watch this movie with you, so that they know when next time they see someone on the street they donâ€™t look at them as aliens My sister got millions of views, and it hurts me to think that it still happens to many people. This film will teach people that people who do not seem "normal" are people too. 10/10
