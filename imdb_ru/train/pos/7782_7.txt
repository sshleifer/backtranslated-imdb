the photo was beautiful, but it was difficult for me to understand what was going on ... was there a lot of symbolism? ... 2 goldfish - do they mean something in Thai culture? not much plot, not much is happening, and it just wriggles. there is no real beginning, no real middle and no real end. rather unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to understand the characters, since you never felt that you would recognize them ... it was difficult to understand which scenes were imaginary and which scenes were real. This step was chaotic and incoherent. I do not know what the brothers hoped for. Maybe if I were a Thai, it would make more sense ...
