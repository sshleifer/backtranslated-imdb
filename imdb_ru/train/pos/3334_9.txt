I really liked this movie because I have the same husband as in this movie. This film is about Lindsay, who meets Ben in the middle of winter when the baseball season did not start. She falls in love, but when spring comes, she is shocked by her life, when she steps down a step below her pedestal that Ben wore it. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with Ben's baseball obsession. He can't part with what he loves the most, which is what makes him so funny and why so many women can communicate with Lindsay in real life. In addition, the people with whom he sits on baseball games are as obsessed as he is. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie and you wonâ€™t beat it if you rent it.
