It was a great episode of two parts, although I never saw elders, I never thought that the doctor would go against something paranormal, extreme, of course, but not paranormal. <br /> <br /> This Episode tells about the things we fear the most, and how we humans would fight and defeat real living evil in futuristic time, when most chances are saying that this is impossible. I am surprised that they contributed some things, such as fear and faith, especially if it is also going to entertain the American audience. But who cares what the Yankees say, we swing! Doctor Who has since demonstrated his potential from the first episode of the new series in 2005, for the first time being so harmless, scary, from fun to seriousness, from light to darkness. I hope many old fans will one day say, “Old Doctor Who's back.” <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
