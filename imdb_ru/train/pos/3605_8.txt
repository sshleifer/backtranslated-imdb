Girlfight uses a well-known formula, as someone pointed out, however, I have seen many films that do not do so well or that are not credible. I believe that in the end itâ€™s easier for a woman to empathize with the character, and the film will be more touched. <br /> <br /> the film is inspiring both mentally and physically, even if your life and the environment are completely different and I think the viewer can still get a lot by seeing it. although it took me 5 years to start boxing and sports in general, this is the film that gave me the spark. <br /> <br /> so the plot is familiar / common. the actors are good. but the thought that he might spark, in my opinion, is above average. it made a big impression on me and I know that I am not the only one.
