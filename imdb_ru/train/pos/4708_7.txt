Yeah, Keaton looks like he really loved being in this movie. Having missed his step in striped suits, he will remind you of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is a young hood who does this only to pay his mother’s costly medical bills and send his younger brother (Griffin Dunn) to law school. No one even knows Johnny Kelly is Johnny Dangerous, until later in the film. Joe Piscopo is a parasite and does not like Johnny (and I do not like parasites). Marilu Henner has a wonderful singing / dancing routine, while Johnny enjoys it. I love this role when they are in a constantly changing car! The policeman who “calls all the cars” is a skipper from Gilligan Island! See it for the gangster laughter of the 1930s! The jokes in this movie are funny, but you have to catch them, otherwise you will miss them! Look at the background of each scene.
