Well, let's start with the fact that this film is not an exact transfer of crimes and prosecution of Andrei Chikatilo. Although the Politburo may have had an “official policy” that there were no serial killers in the USSR, in fact the legal system was dealing with others, and “Killer X” (as it was actually called) was already wanted when Fetisov brought Burakov for the cause. In fact, as soon as it turned out that they had many murders in their hands, the authorities appointed a whole group of dozens of officers to track down and put an end to the murder of a man who did not fit into what was perceived as a normal serial killer. options. It’s good that the director and the screenwriters constantly remind the viewer that the story is only “based on real events,” for a document that’s not true. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS ARE FOLLOWING ***** <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this is a damn good example of a fast-paced Hollywood-style thriller that still faces the basics of what happened. . It is easy to follow him, and in his version of events there is enough truth to make it attractive for viewing. Yes, Chikatilo raped and killed both children and adults, both men and women. Yes, the cheesy lab allowed him to continue killing for years. Yes, innocent men were accused of murder and “confessed” to their crimes at the insistence of the police. Yes, the gay community was harassed while committing crimes (albeit with the help of Burakov). And yes, Chikatilo was attracted to confession not because of the prosecution of special prosecutor Gorbunov, but because of a soft understanding of a psychiatrist named Bukhanovsky (although Gorbunov really was not close to the selfish martinet depicted in this film). If you do not take into account the truth and truthfulness, then all these events are dramatized in such a way that it consistently increases tension and fear. <br /> <br /> It doesn't hurt that the director and co-author of the film Chris Gerolmo has the perfect cast. Stephen Rea's growing emotional involvement in the killings and the development of clue-finding experience, Donald Sutherland's stinging manipulation by Soviet party hackers and the thin spine that becomes apparent, when necessary, the fury of Jeffrey Demanna, hidden by fear-filled behavior, Max Malchishy excitement von Sidov from participating in a criminal investigation enhances a keen dialogue and clear editing in ways that should not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Considering that “Citizen X” is almost perfect (“almost” because of one moment of self-praise at the end, which simply does NOT fit). Strongly recommended as fiction, well-narrated, not a fact represented ... but given the ridiculous "serial killers" of films that Hollywood usually spits out, this is quite enough for me.
