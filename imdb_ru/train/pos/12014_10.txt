This is by far the most incredible film I've seen in a long time. The actors gave beautiful images of the characters in the film. The story was accurately depicted. The story begins with a young woman from the British Isles and her father traveling by boat to Nauvoo, Illinois. She became a member of the LDS Church, but he does not. He thinks she is ridiculous on a trip and discourages. She encourages him to read about Joseph Smith, the Prophet. This is where the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith begins. The film accurately reflects his life and the history of the LDS Church at the same time. It was a graphic from time to time, but it was necessary. Emotional expression was very believable, which made my emotions run out. Shooting was awesome. The way of presenting the story was touching. After the movie was finished, we just sat there, unable to move. I was stunned. For people who know very little about Joseph Smith, the Prophet of Mormons, I would advise you to see this. If nothing else, how to get some insight into your life. For those who are members of the Church, I would advise you to see this. This will increase your testimony about this most incredible person. You should see this.
