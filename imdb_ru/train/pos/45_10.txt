Home Room was a great movie if you ever dramatized in your life. It makes you want to see more. I wonder what hides the secret of Alicia. I think I watched this movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest. Plus I don't usually cry because of the movies, but this one made me cry every time. I would like to find more films like this one. In general, I thought it was a great movie. The more you look at it, the more you become a part of it. The very end is the part that really woke me up when she cried when she received her diploma, because there was her daughter's name there. My heart felt as if it was then broken. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she had not yet received hers. I loved it so much.
