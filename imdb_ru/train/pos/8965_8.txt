Filmed in the same year as Vertigo, this is no less fascinating film, albeit in a much lighter way. It happens in enchanted New York in the winter: Kim Novak is a witch who casts a spell on James Stewart, but instead falls into her. An interesting point is that Novak's rival is played by Janice Rule, who created the role of Madge in "Broadway Picnic" (the role Novak will make famous in the movie).
