Although I saw this film many years ago, its influence never leaves me. Stephen Ria describes the investigator deeply and touchingly. His pain of not being able to stop death is obvious. Everyone in the cast is amazing from Sutherland, who is trying to adapt him and give the police the opportunity to coordinate their efforts to a worried citizen. X
