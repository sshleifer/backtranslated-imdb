Probably the best achievement of Bigas Moon is a delicate balance between meanness, eroticism and surrealism. The appetizing Matilda May, who has spent most of the “Vital Force” Tobe Hooper in a positive mood, is subject to the prejudiced attraction of young Bil Duran. He can not throw the May breasts out of his head and so much wants to suck them, as well as the breast of his mother. His chase for may is a movie. Since the works of the Moon, such as "Lulu" and "Hamon! Jamon! ”, The director brings a slightly twisted sexual sensitivity to his strange but beautiful story. Ordinary suspects will be offended, but those with an open mind will enjoy this frothy erotic poem for the female breast. The images of José Luis Alcain are magnificent, and the score of Nikolai Piovani is sweet and rich. Magnificent cinematic candy with the delicious anarchic sensitivity that Spaniards make so naturally.
