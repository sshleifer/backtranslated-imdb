... that the Bette Davis version of this film was better than the Kim Novak version. <br /> <br /> In spite of all the other comments written here, I really prefer the Bette Davis version, although the Novac version has a more consistent storyline. <br /> <br /> However, the rough emotions of Davis Mildred seem to me more inclined to a depraved girl, who seems to easily become a prostitute. <br /> <br /> And these are the coarse emotions that make up * part * of what the poor doctor is falling in love with. He has emotions of despair, failure, "otherness" - strong emotions that he suppresses. Deadis Mildred, on the other hand, shows his emotions immediately and without judgment. She has no feelings of despair, failure, or "otherness"; rather, she just survives as a poor Cockney woman in the Victorian era. <br /> <br /> Novak’s image was more vulnerable than Mildred, almost across the film. Mildred Davis was ** never ** vulnerable until she had to go to the doctor and ask for help. And when he condemns her — because of her method of retaining soul and body and constantly using his love for her — she probably releases the most passionate denial of snobbery you have ever seen on the screen: “I wiped my mouth I wiped my mouth ! “Novak’s vulnerability was excellent. Davis’s realism was monumental. <br /> <br /> IMDb votes for coincidence!
