I bought a DVD of this version to compare with the current version of BBC 2005 (which is great). 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopkraft, who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for television and died this year (2005). I remember a great acting game, especially from Rigg and Elliot, and touching music. (The music in the 2005 version is much more understated, but very revealing.) Just to get to other commentators on several points: Richard Karston is Ada Claire's boyfriend, not Esther. Esther did not have an uncle. Charlie Drake has never played Crook in any of the versions, nor has he played Toby Esterhaz at TTSS! Crook plays the comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version. Toby played by Bernard Hepton. <br /> <br /> Both versions are a worthy and admirable adaptation of the great novel by Dickens. Now read the book! It's not perfect, and sentimentality can sometimes make you pucker, but I don't want you to cry and laugh!
