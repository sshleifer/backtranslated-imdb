A great movie and a great example of how scary a movie can be without showing the viewer anything. This is a set of four stories revolving around the tenants of a charmingly old-fashioned house and their terrible and terrible destinies, connected with each other by the Scotland Yard story telling about the missing horror movie star. He begins with a story about a mysterious writer, whose main character becomes too realistic, then tells about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed with a wax figure in a museum, and then talks about a sweetly angelic little child, who except what happened to the missing movie star, and what he does with the inspector. This is a great print that allows you to truly appreciate the work of director Duffel and what he was able to achieve with a very small budget. Add to this the acting talents of Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and John Pertwee, and you get a film that you can enjoy again and again. Just donâ€™t answer phone calls if someone from Stoker Real Estate calls to offer you a bargain purchase of a beautiful home in the English countryside ??
