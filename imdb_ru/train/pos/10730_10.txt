Unfortunately, SpaceCamp came out around the same time as the Challenger Explosion. What really gets in the way when to get it out, or even if they should, get it out. I'm glad they did. I first watched SpaceCamp in the entry movie. Which really improved the viewing. <br /> <br /> Although I heard about Leah Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I have never heard of others in the film. So it was a big shock for me that all these young people act and behave very well! Of course, Kate Capshaw was great too. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the scenes where these children were shown how to act as a team. Scenes of children preparing for the trip, which they could only hope for. The actual launch of the spacecraft, of course, is old news for us. However, this one was different. <br /> <br /> In general, this is one of my most cherished films. Maybe an escapist, but it was fantastic for a space nut like me. After probably renting it for 30-40 times I finally found it available at a certain store and bought it. Now, if it only goes to DVD. I will probably have it forever. This film gets 9 out of 10 from me.
