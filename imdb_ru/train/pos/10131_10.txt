In the very first episode of “Friends,” released on September 22, 1994, “The one where Monica gets her roommate,” sounds the song in which Rachel sits in the window at the end of the show, and the line: “If you need to keep.” ... does anyone know the artist of the song or the name of the song? It seems to be a great song ... I would like to get a copy of it. Thanks for the help. I am looking for an album / CD on which it is included so that I can buy it. <br /> <br /> I have a show that can be purchased, and I enjoy this show again and again. It just seemed believable ... thanks for the hour entertainment that you have provided over the years.
