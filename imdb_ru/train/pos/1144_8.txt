Back in 1955, the British shot a comedy called Simon and Laura with Peter Finch and brilliant Kay Kendall. To this day, this is one of the best examples of British comedy and, in particular, how television comedies are becoming so popular. It was and remains an excellent example of self-referenced cinema. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Soapdish, a movie I had never heard of a few days ago when I saw it on a late TV. At first, I was a little dubious, simply because comedy is as complex as you know. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised and delighted to see a very clever satire about daytime American television. In fact, it's been a long time since I laughed heartily. So, if you like satire, I would recommend that you look. <br /> <br /> Main actors ?? Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Katie Moriarty just do an excellent job, showing just how fussy and acting is acting. Watching this, I kept thinking to myself: how much is this bitchiness being transferred to real life? That is, do actors have a real life? As you probably know, Peter Sellers, for example, was known for hiding his real identity behind a multitude of characters, so that no one knew a real person. So, when I watched Sally Field play Celeste Talbot as Maggie, I thought again about this earlier British film with Kei Kendall, in which Laura plays a character on the comedy series with Peter Finch ... <br /> <br / > Is this something? Interestingly, some actors have nervous breakdowns? And this feeling was crystallized when Celeste finally confronted her daughter (Laurie, played by Elizabeth Shu) and at an emotional moment repeats the fictional lines that she used in the previous episode of her day soap, when she came across her fictional daughter in this Are you confused? Well, not everything is so, but the dialogue is overwhelming with originality, comedy, bitch, anger, debauchery, duplicity and even ... love. <br /> <br /> History? Well, there are a lot of stories in this film, they are all intertwined, and that everyone gathers together at the end (of course, but not like the Robert Altman film, well!), And not all of them are finally resolved. In any case, life is not like that, right? The pace is almost insane, and you really need to carefully watch and listen to catch all the spectacles and subtle jokes. Spend 97 minutes out of your life and see this; You will not regret the use of time. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast all works well, although I never took a lot at Whoopi Goldberg. Perhaps the funniest exchanges take place between Robert Downey and Katie Moriarty, and, for my money, the latter steals so many scenes from others, she gets my vote as an outstanding player. I'm not kidding, she gives the term bitch a completely new face ...
