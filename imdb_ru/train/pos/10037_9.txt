The ship may have sank, but the film did not !!! Directed by James Cameron from the "Terminator" did it again with this amazing picture. One of my favorite scenes is the “Dining Table” scene in which Rose's family and friends meet with Jack after he saved her. Rose has a facial expression that every woman should have when you meet “ONE” ... I hope I have this look when I'm in a room with my future husband. <br /> <br /> Jack and Rose have a connection that is 'MOVIE STUFF', but this is good movie stuff. We have a greedy mother and all of her elite, stuck in the comrades who live off the wealth of their husbands. Rose almost commits suicide, but Gilbert Grape's star saves her. I really enjoyed hanging above the boat. It was a good risk. <br /> <br /> The film is long, but it is fantastic !!! Good story, good flow, good actors !!! Look at it twice, if you want, it's worth it !!!
