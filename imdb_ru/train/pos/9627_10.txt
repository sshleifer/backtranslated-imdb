This is by far the funniest short made by two comic geniuses. From the moment they enter, until the moment when Hardy just falls from the roof, it makes me laugh hysterically. I highly recommend every fan of Laurel and Hardy to see this short one. I also recommend all the Ghost series. If you are looking for laughter, watch this movie and you will be happy.
