Care Bears Movie 2: The new generation is not a bad movie. In fact, I really like it. Yes, I admit that the dialogue is banal, and the story is sometimes a little badly told. But the Dark Heart, although very, very dark, is a fairly convincing, shape-changing villain, and Hadley Kay did an excellent job of voicing him. Speaking of voice acting, it was great, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that. The animation is colorful, and some of the visual effects, especially in the beginning, were exciting. The songs and the score are beautiful, especially Growing Up and Forever Young, the latter has always been my personal favorite of the two. The bears that I like are adorable, and the human children are great too. And the final is a real tear. In general, harmless children's fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox
