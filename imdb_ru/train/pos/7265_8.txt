Good story. Good script. Good casting. Good game. Good direction. Good artistic direction. Nice photo. Good sound. Good editing. All is well. Put it all together and youâ€™ll have a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> The shame is that nowadays there are not enough films of this magnitude. We can assume that we are lucky that writers / directors like John Hughes can sometimes hear their creative voices. <br /> <br /> Whenever I notice that I watch a movie for the third or fourth time, I still find it completely satisfying, I must conclude that something about this movie is correct.
