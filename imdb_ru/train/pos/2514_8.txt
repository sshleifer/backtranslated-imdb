I voted for 8 for this film due to minor childish flaws. In addition, this film is one of my favorites! It's funny, if not more. The filming scenes, however, are ridiculous, and I think that Gack (who wrote the book) takes too much of his “obsession with the Matrix”. It seems their enemies are just standing there ... waiting to be shot. However, this film is touching, and it always makes me cry. He has a lot of GREAT humor, so I laugh too. I have to say, Gackt is a great actor. He shows so many emotions. This was the first time Hyde acted, and he managed. The role suits him. Wang Lee Hom is absolutely gorgeous. The whole cast, which I would say, is perfect for this film. DON'T MISS THIS! YOU WILL REFER ABOUT THIS!
