An American woman, her European husband and children return to their motherâ€™s home in The Watch on the Rhine, filmed in 1943 based on a play by Lillian Hellman, and starring Paul Lucas (who, I believe, repeats his stage role here), Bett Davis , Lucille Watson, George Koulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Woods. An anti-fascist, underground worker, repeatedly wounded and wanted by the Nazis, Kurt Muller (Lucas) needs a long vacation at the estate of his rich mother-in-law. But he learns that there really is no way out, since one of the guests (Coulouris) is suspicious of his true identity and is more than ready to sell him. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of great performances written in this movie. very much to push the liberal point of view of Lillian Hellman. It was certainly a powerful propaganda tool at the time of its release, as the evil of war and what happens to people in other countries reached safe American homes. The big argument of the film today is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar for Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. Humphrey Bogart had a wonderful on-screen presence and a terrific Rick, but Lucas is superb as Kurt. The monologue, which he has about the need to kill, is painful, speaking only of one scene. <br /> <br /> Although this is not what Bette Davis is thought of as a film, it gives a masterful presentation here, like Kurt's True and Loving wife, Sarah. Her acting jerks in the heart, and the love scenes between Kurt and Sarah are beautiful and tender. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film made me cry from the honesty of emotions. Lillian Hellman is not for everyone, but unlike the Little Foxes, she wrote several truly responsive, wonderful characters and a wonderful story told in the Warner Brothers film about the role of actors and actors. Highly recommended.
