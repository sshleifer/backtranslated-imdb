How someone can say that this is bad, I can not do. I loved this show before I saw it. For 3 reasons: 1. The story intrigued me, 2. Jessica Alba, and 3. James Cameron! Please ignore the bad comments and please review the entire first season before deciding that it is bad, because I know that if you watch the first season you LOVE it, go out and buy the 1st and 2nd season for DVD and then join the campaign to get the 3rd season! <br /> <br /> I hate Fox, and Iâ€™m sure many of you Dark Angel fans hate them too. They have a thing for preserving good shows! Do not you agree?
