"Broken bow" takes us back to where it all began. Upcoming 150 years and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This part of the Star Trek franchise, in my opinion, is the first episode after TOS to bring back the feelings of surprise, danger and excitement “To go where no one has been.” Scott Bakula played well in the role of Jonathan Archer, the first captain of the first Star Ship. He and the entire cast really show true reverence for the Star Trek heritage. John Billingsley Brilliant, as an alien Dr. Phlox, and Jolene Blalocke very juicy, as seductive, but logical officer of Vulcan science T'Pol. "Broken Bow", in my opinion, is the best premiere episode of any of the tracks, and I believe that Gene Roddenberry will surely be proud of it.
