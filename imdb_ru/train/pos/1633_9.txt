I loved this movie when it came out in the 80s and still! I still quote classic lines like “say it again” and “you said that you would break my balls sir”. Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Although it was underestimated and rejected by MAD, I must say that this little gem will always be my treasure and film, which I will take with me if I send it to an uninhabited island! I just want someone to release a DVD because my VHS tape is almost worn out! If you like comedy with cheese, then it is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic! This is military humor at best and worst! Rent it if you can't own it!
