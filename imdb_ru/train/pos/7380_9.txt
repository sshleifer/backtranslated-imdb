The three main characters are very well depicted, especially Anisio from a rock musician who first became an actor Paulo Miklos. He is extremely persuasive as a lower class criminal / invader. The film very well demonstrates the effect of snowball from engaging in an even more dubious business, the contrast and similarity between the lower and upper classes. How everyone is addicted to greed and ambition. 9-9.5 out of 10.
