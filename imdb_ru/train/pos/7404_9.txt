We just saw the Australian premiere of Soul [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. The notes to the program say that it was - perfect pleasure - skillfully made, touching, funny, dramatic and amazingly significant. I could not agree more. I just hope that the rest of the festivalâ€™s films will fit this standard of entertainment, and I look forward to seeing more Chinese films scheduled to be shown in Sydney in the coming months.
