There are several films or films that I consider to be favorites over the years. The gospel road was one of them. I watched it as a young teenager and would like to be able to watch it again. My favorite parts were that <br /> <br /> 1 / Jesus was blond, <br /> <br /> 2 / the last dinner was a great meal, <br /> <br /> 3 / he loved to play with children, <br /> <br /> 4 / His death was for all people and for all time. <br /> <br /> The film may not have been theologically sound or high quality, but it touched my heart at that time. In addition, I am a fan of Johnny Cash, and it was a bold venture. If he ever comes out on DVD, I will buy it exclusively for sentimental reasons.
