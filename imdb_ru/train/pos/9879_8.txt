The introduction of Lily Mars may have given Judy Garland one of the simplest roles she had in MGM, because Lily Mars is definitely a character with whom she can identify herself. A young girl with a talent of ten, she knows that she has everything to get to the theater, no matter how the producer Van Heflin from her hometown discourages her. <br /> <br /> I really liked Judy. one, as the girl decided to do it in the theater. Because this is Judy Garland with the talent of Judy Garland, you know in the audience that she has the right things, even if Van Heflin needs almost the entire film to be sure. <br /> <br /> Judy and Heflin hail from the same small town. Heflin’s dad was the town doctor who delivered her and Heflin, while he could leave and become a big producer on Broadway, their mothers, Fei Bainter and Spring Byington, kept in touch. This is her main task, but Heflin is constantly faced with the most inveterate children, but never with anyone like Lily Mars. <br /> <br /> There were no truly high-profile hits when she represented Lily Mars for Garland, although she sings all her numbers. The best thing about the film is the revival of the chestnut of the gas-light era, every little movement has its own meaning. Judy sings it with Connie Gilchrist, playing a cleaning lady in a Broadway theater where Heflin’s show is being prepared. Gilchrist was a star back in the days of the FloraDora Girls, and she and Judy and Connie composed a song in a great style. This is the best scene in the film, as Gilchrist encourages Judy to continue her. Composer Karl Hoshna died long ago, but the lyricist Otto Harbach was still alive, and I bet he liked what he heard. <br /> <br /> Star of European music Martha Eggert in the film “Representing Lily Mars” as a star of the show, which is first stunned and then angry, and finally understands Garland and Heflin. She starred in several films with MGM, and then returned to Europe for further work on the continent. I bet MGM didn't quite know what to do with her and her thick Hungarian accent, although Louis B. Meyer never met a soprano that he didn't like. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin succeeds as a patient producer who comes to terms with Garland and Eggert a lot. Last year, Heflin had just shot an Oscar for Johnny Eager, and he and Garland would not be the perfect on-screen team, but they are not all that bad. <br /> <br /> Imagine Lily Mars very well. Showcase for talent Judy Garland. And she did not have to share the screen in another backstage film with Mickey Rooney.
