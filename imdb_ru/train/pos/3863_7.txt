This is an interesting series, in which real people participate (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) ... and dramatizes a part of their real history with the participation of the character of the series, who continues to participate in this story. Rail Detective "Matt Clark" - takes part in tracking down famous criminals from the Old West in the stories, which are at least partially based on real stories. In this sense, it is almost an anthological series, and, as someone else noted, this strange structure gives rise to some time frames with real events, but this is a funny series with a lot of actions to satisfy the western hungry audience of the 1950s - still holding pretty good 55 years later. Clark cuts a powerful figure in his Western mechanism when he encounters some of the most evil villains in history. And his girlfriend, Frankie, is a real dish. If you are a fan of westerns, be sure to see if you have a chance.
