This is surprisingly above the average slasher, it's nice and well done, with decent blood! All the characters are decent, and the story is pretty funny, plus Molly Ringwald played the annoying bitch very well. I bought it at a pawnshop for $ 1, and it was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were damn good for the budget, plus I liked the mask that the killer wore, as it was pretty creepy. The final was really cool, as I liked the way they defeated the killer, and the final, although predictable, was also very funny, plus all the characters, except for Ringvald, were surprisingly cute! It was well done and written, and I thought it was quite creative and original, and some of the death scenes were very impressive. This killer did not mess around, and I liked it, and Slasher fans (like me) should really enjoy this film, plus the discovery was really evil, as they were making the film! This is surprisingly above the average slasher, it is nice and well done, with decent bleeding, and I say it's worth it! Direction is good. Kimble Rendall does good! working here with good camera performance, using eerie settings, good viewing angles and keeping the film at a fast pace. The game is solid! Molly Ringwald plays this bitch very well, and it was difficult for me to feel sorry for her, because she had to become a heroine, by the end she was better, but not much, I was surprised that she decided to make this film. Nevertheless, she did an excellent job! Frank Roberts is a fantastic killer, he is formidable, creepy, he had one mask, and this guy did not mess around, he was fantastic! Kylie Minogue plays a very good bitch in her little role. Jessica Napier is nice and copes well with the role of another heroine. The rest of the cast are fine. Overall worth a look! *** out of 5
