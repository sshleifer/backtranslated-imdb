“Stories of the Century” is a half-hour series that first appeared in syndication in the 54–55 television season. It was also the first Western series to receive an Emmy Award. Starring Western actor Jim Davis as rail detective Matt Clark, the series put Clark and his colleagues on rail detectives (Mary Castle as Frankie Adams in the first half of the season and Christine Miller as Johns in the second half) against a historic western outlaw from different periods, from the mid 1860s to the early 1900s. The series was very satisfying, easy to see and quite realistic, mainly due to Jim Davis's laid-back charm in the lead role. He seemed like a real western character. One more note. When Matt Clark arrived in the city after a long trip, he actually looked as if he were on a long horse ride, because he would be covered with dust. <br /> <br /> Very good early adult western.
