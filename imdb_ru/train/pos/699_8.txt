I first saw the Insomnia Nightmare not long ago, and I must say that I really liked it. If you are a Dominic Monaghan fan, you will like it. The film about the hole unfolds in his head - or not? The game from everyone else is a bit fussy and shaky, and some scenes can be cut, but in the end it will work. The extras on the DVD are as good as the movie, if not more for those Dom fans. There are a lot of candid moments from the set, outsiders and an excellent interview with the director. Anyone who has gone through an independent film will love to watch Tess (the director), Dom and everyone else in a very small personal series try to show this little creepy movie. It was quite nice, and I am glad to have it in my collection.
