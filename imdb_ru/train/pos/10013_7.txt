As one of the previous commentators said, this was the basis for a good movie, but something happened on the way to delivery. Such a waste, because Collett’s performance was creepy, and Williams was believable. I just kept waiting until it got better. I don’t think it was a bad editing or a different director was needed, it could just be a movie. It was like a Canadian film, something like the first few seasons of the X-Files. Not cheap, just hockey. In addition, you need a little more waiting. Something that makes you jump from your seat. The film reached this point, and then disappeared; kind of like a false climax. I see how excessive tension would take away from the “reality” of this story, but I thought that this part was achieved when Gabriel was in the hospital in search of a boy. This film should have a directorial cut, which is trying to solve these problems.
