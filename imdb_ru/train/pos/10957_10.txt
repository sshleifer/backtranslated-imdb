This show, probably not everyone will like it. Sarah does what she wants; she does not ask permission and does not apologize. This is a comedy with zombies, robots, dinosaurs, flying cars and a team of male fans who steal a wallet. The star of the series is not a hero, it is a spoiled fanatical pervert. If you cannot appreciate the unusual humor that he offers, the show is probably not for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. He combines the comedy style of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posen (Comedians Comedians), Jay Johnston (Mr. Shaw), Steve Agee (Bobcate Goldwate's Stay) and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House ). He also showcases the best talents of the growing online community on channel101.com. (If you participate in this show, pay attention to the “Department of Eligible Media” in vh1 in March of this year, it will come from the same talent pool.) <br /> <br /> Watch Sarah Silverman’s show, This kind of thing - the future of entertainment.
