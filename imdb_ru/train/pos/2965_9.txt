Very possibly one of the funniest films in the world. Oscar stuff. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are funny, and before you see it, I invite you to watch South Park, one of the funniest cartoons. Buy, you will laugh every time you see it. Pure brilliant move. If you don't think it's funny, you have no soul, no sense of humor. 10 out of 10.
