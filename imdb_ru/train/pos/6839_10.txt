In what should be one of the bloodiest films ever, a transvestite kills people in New York, and the answer to all may not be those people suspect can be seen how Brian DePalma gets some influence from Hitchcock with camera angles and so on. Michael Kane plays the most suggestive character, while Angie Dickinson is essentially a bored rich woman with a bad hairdo. Keith Gordon (who later starred in Christine) is probably the most interesting character in the film. But you can't understand this movie without seeing it. And when you see this, you will never know who you can trust. Also starring Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.
