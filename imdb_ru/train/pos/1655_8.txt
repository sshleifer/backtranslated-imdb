Mendes and Marichal provided us with a serious, persuasive and painful analysis of the social, spiritual, economic and political crisis that gave rise to 108 years of colonialism in Puerto Rico. A beautiful island with the most hospitable people I have ever met, and yet because our nation refuses to fulfill its imperial duties, Puerto Ricans are allowed to wither and die. <br /> <br /> The spiritual crisis caused by the colonial position of Puerto Rico created, if undermining families, and the main institutions that support any society. Corruption is rampant to the extent that people do not pay taxes (which led to the financial crisis for this country), and a sense of cynicism and mistrust permeates the islandâ€™s culture. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the grant made it possible to make this painful yet powerful film to be produced. <br /> <br /> Be sure to take a look. ,,
