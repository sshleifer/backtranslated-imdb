Although this film is somewhat sanitized (because it was shot at a time when people just did not talk about sex), this is a very useful short film showing premature girls so that they know what to expect during menstruation. It is not surprising that Kotex paid for it, although it may be surprising to many that Disney made this film - since they made many educational films in the 1940s and 60s. No matter how well the movie was made, I think the director missed a real opportunity. Instead of a beautiful female narrator and relatively modest visual effects, it would be great if they used Minnie Mouse and the rest of the Disney gang !! I know that this would cause old Walt to have a heart attack, but it would be a great movie! By the way, although the concept of sex in the film is hardly hinted at, it adequately explains the menstruation as a whole. However, it lacks certain details (especially with regard to sexual intercourse), which, I believe, were included in the accompanying booklet. <br /> <br /> Now, if only I can understand why I was watching a cartoon about menstruation.
