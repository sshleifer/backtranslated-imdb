good movie, good music, good background and acceptable plot. but most importantly, as his films show, this man is the best actor in India and can turn dust into gold. nana pidekar. this may be his second best performance after the parindians (others may disagree). although other films are not far behind. one person who will never disappoint you. <br /> <br /> a good movie, although I think that Shah Rukh was a luxury that this movie could do without. You can see in his films, others try very hard to reach his height and act from their skins. but this person is really something wrong. <br /> <br /> the movie is cool, the music and direction are excellent, the plot is a bit thin, but the on-screen game and the dialogue are again very good. must watch.
