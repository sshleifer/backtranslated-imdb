I loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963). It is a pity that Lydia Reid decided to be forgotten and not to appear. She was superb on the show. Of course, Walter Brennan was as good as Tony Martinez. I liked it when he called Amos Se√±or Grampa. I bought Season I on DVD and I can't wait to buy Seasons 2-6. If only there will be more shows on television, like this one, everything will be better. This show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999, but then disappeared. God bless all the departed cast members, and please, Llidia Reed, make yourself known again to the public. You are loved and respected. Real Mac Coys will live forever.
