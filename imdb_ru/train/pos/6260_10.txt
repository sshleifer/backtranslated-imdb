It was heartbreaking! I am an Iranian and live in the 21st century, I did not know that such large tribes lived in such conditions at the time of my grandfather! <br /> <br /> You see it today or even in 1925 on one side of the world a lady or child could do everything for him or her cleanly and on demand, but here, 80 years ago, people risked their lives so that go somewhere with a lot of grass. Interestingly, these Persians have difficulty finding pasture for their sheep, but they lose a lot of sheep in their path. <br /> <br /> I praise the Americans who accompanied this tribe, they were as tough as the Bakhtiarians
