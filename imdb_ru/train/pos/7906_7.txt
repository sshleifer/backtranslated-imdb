Gus Van Sant made some great films. I'm really a fan. <br /> <br /> However, I can't help but feel that the brain of Tom Robbins’s book “Even Cowgirls Get the Blues” is lost in terms of the big screen. One, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and outstanding talents. Ultimately, although this one just did not work. <br /> <br /> It’s not that the characters were underdeveloped, or the plot and content didn’t come to life. Just our imagination is much stronger when reading such a book. We are taken away to another time and place, and sometimes we think about the worst and / or best, and this adds to the general roller coaster of the book, as it neatly unfolds according to the accuracy of the author. Films, however, can leave one with less imagination and roller coaster emotions, distracting from the overall experience. This is what, in my opinion, happened here. <br /> <br /> I suggest reading the book!
