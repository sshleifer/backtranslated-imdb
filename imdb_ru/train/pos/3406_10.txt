In terms of visual beauty, this film is outstanding! I had no idea that Technicolor came out so early. Although I didnâ€™t like the final, the whole movie is fantastic and makes me want me to be in North Africa. The cast is excellent, and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus, and, of course, she is so charming, and I just loved her in this film. Vasily Rathbone is also perfect in this film. I could not overcome the scenery and scenery ... Hotel, palm trees, desert, everything is there ... legionnaires also bring to the film the feeling of "Beau Geste" They, of course, no longer make such films. Do not miss the opportunity to watch this classic!
