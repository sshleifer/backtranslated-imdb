One of the great classic comedies. Not a comedy, not a heavy drama. A funny satirical film, shoppers are wary of a guide on a new home. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of great characters in it, all of whom, as Cary Grant is convinced, are going to kill him in a dream house. br /> <br /> A great outlook on life in the late 40s. <br /> <br />
