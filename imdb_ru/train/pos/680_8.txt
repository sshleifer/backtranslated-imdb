“The Last Wave” is one of those films that is heavily dependent on reason. The name refers to the doomsday theory for the aborigines: there will be a last wave that will destroy everything. <br /> <br /> David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a lawyer from Sydney hired to defend some Aboriginal people accused of murder. Around this time in Australia there was an unusually heavy rain. Defending Aboriginal people, David studies the theory of the last wave and begins to wonder if this is just a mythology. <br /> <br /> The final sequence of the film is a metaphor for immersion in the depths of the mind. Peter Weir has created an amazing, but thought-provoking film. Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil (whom you may have seen in Walk, Crocodile Dundee and Rabbit Fence) provides an interesting supporting role as one of the accused. <br /> <br /> a chance, see the function of "making" on DVD. Peter Weir explains some shades of the film, some of which are related to Richard Chamberlain’s past.
