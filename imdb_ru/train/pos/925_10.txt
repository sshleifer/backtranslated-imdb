In a word: suPURRRRb! I don’t think I’ve seen something like this for a long time on a network or cable television. Watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid television programs filled with reality shows and boring repetitions. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I had reservations. In the end, critics were almost unanimous in crying and lowering the show. But when half an hour passed (by the way, thank you, NBC, for showing without advertising), I still have the feeling of instant love, love at first sight, true love that you feel in your guts, Everything in this show shouted EXCELLENCE. <br /> <br /> The graphics in this show were at least as good as Finding Nemo and Shrek. Considerable feat, given that these films have evolved over the years. <br /> <br /> Cast was amazing. I'm not indifferent to the voice of John Goodman, but the rest of the team was definitely on par with John. Special mention: guest Lisa Kudrow. She was on top of the game, creating a neurotic, puffy and attractive panda with a Jewish trait in it. (Panda from Brooklyn? Only on this show.) <br /> <br /> The script was funny, with lots of jokes inside and for adults who were sharp but not sticky. Note to all parents: this is not for children. This show has never been advertised as such, and there is a reason why it is set at 9 pm and not at 8 pm. Therefore, if you want to complain about "unwanted context", save your breath. Adults deserve a comedy created especially for them, and this is “Father of Pride”. <br /> <br /> Not everything was perfect. I was a little puzzled by the characters of Siegfried and Roy. Do I feel a “stereotype” when it comes to them? Yes, they are gay. Yes, they are bright. Yes, they speak with a German accent. But this is yesterday's news. Give us something new, something fresh, something funny. Putting old jokes on a new show is definitely the wrong approach. I understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the “star power” that these guys have. This is normal for me. But please do not stop at the fact that everyone already knows by heart. We hope that the rest of the show will not play the same old recording over and over again. <br /> <br /> In general, the show should definitely watch TV. Funny, witty, with a few unexpected twists here and there - there was no such good comedy from Seinfeld. I, of course, look forward to the next episode.
