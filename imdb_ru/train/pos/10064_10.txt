The King of Masks is a beautifully told story in which the family preferences of men and men are contrasted with the human preferences of love and communication. Being in China in the 1930s during a flood, we meet Wang, an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and thrill to all who see him. When a famous opera singer sees and then befriends Wang, he invites Wang to join their troupe. However, we learn that Wanâ€™s family tradition only allows him to pass on his secrets to his son. Having learned that Van is childless, Van is offered to find an heir before magic is lost forever. Taking the advice by heart, Wang buys an 8-year-old to fulfill his inheritance; he will teach his new son, the dog, the ancient art of silk masks. Soon, Van discovers a fact about Pesic, who threatens rare and dying art. <br /> <br /> Together, Van and Pesgi create a connection and experience a series of emotions that invariably accompany her. The story is exciting. The decor is serene, and the costumes are simple. In general, this is a feature film that has won an international award that cannot but move and inspire.
