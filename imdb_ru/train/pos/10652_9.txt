I do not know why the critics crushed this film. I hardly ever agree with them. <br /> <br /> The film could be a bit worse - I usually donâ€™t go to horror movies! I even had to recover myself to see it in the afternoon. I do not need to worry! ;) (The cinema was also full of children, heh !;) ... Liam was great as always. I also liked Katharina Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lily Taylor (Eleonora-Nell). <br /> <br /> The house was very gothic and beautiful in a terrible style. The special and sound effects were awesome. I also liked the music, especially the gentle melodies for Eleanor and her journey to save the children, how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life, and finally gained strength, peace and freedom.
