When watching this movie you should pay attention to the fact that this is not a regular movie. He has no real story, only characters, a group of gangster characters who gather in perfect harmony. The dialogue is wonderful, you can just sit back and listen. This film stands out, so it's hard to find the right way to describe it. <br /> <br /> That's why user comments on this movie are so mixed up. I love the movie and recommend it to anyone who loves one-liners and things that are different from "normal". You cannot understand what is so wonderful about this - this is just a comedic world in which gangsters rule. A place of love and danger. The film, which can be viewed more than once.
