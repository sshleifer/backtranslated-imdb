It was a very touching, bitter-sweet cartoon, an unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time. I remember it very well from childhood, it was funny, sad and very beautiful. Well, it starts a little dark, the dog that escaped from the pound, and killed by an old friend, goes to heaven and returns. But it becomes sweet when he makes friends with an orphan girl who can talk to animals. Some scenes were a bit scary in contrast to other cartoons, for example, a series of Charlieâ€™s dreams, but everything else was in order, and the songs were honest. The memorable role of Bert Reynolds and House Deluxe, I just adore this guy, hehe. And Judith Barsey from Jaw of Revenge, may God rest her soul, poor girl, she does not deserve to die, but she is now in heaven, all good people go to heaven. In general, this is a very good animated film, a classic of Don Blut, enough to shame anime and Disney. Recommended for the whole family. And know that if you have the original video that you find after the film, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, he needs to love this guy, hehe.
