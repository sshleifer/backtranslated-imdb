I saw this movie in the store in the cheap section. I actually remember very well how I saw an advertisement and a trailer for it many years ago. I thought “What the hey” and bought it, mainly because the plot sounded interesting, and Claire Danes was always talented in my eyes (this was before I became a big fan of Kate Beckinsale). <br /> <br /> So we are talking about two girls who are sneaking on vacation in Bangkok, are arrested for drugs (which they are innocent), and then sent to a Thai prison. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give excellent presentations, and the plot of this film ends up outside the box, and a few pleasant questions arise for moral discussion. <br /> <br /> I think this is a good movie, but there may have been some improvement. It could have been longer ... it would help consolidate these characters and help a deeper understanding of Thailand’s justice system policy. <br /> <br /> However, aside from this, this is a good film with excellent performances. <br /> <br /> PS For all of you, lovers of pop culture, in search of the two-minute role of Paul Walker. I didn't even notice him the first time I saw the movie.
