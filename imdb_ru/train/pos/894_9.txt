These are Prodigal Son and Oriental Condors - my favorite films are Sammo Hung. Fat Dragon in this adventure is fatter than in Condorce, but he is no less confident in the role of the director or actor. In fact, he is at the top of his form and provides a destructive, cruel actor who boasts half a dozen amazing episodes and can tell a sympathetic and sweet love story. Love and romance are not the director's priority here, but they serve as curious additions to the action and ensure that viewers do not press the fast forward button between physical collisions. <br /> <br /> The opening scene, which features an amusing, easy saber duel, sets a solid but deceptive tone. The sequence in which Sammoâ€™s bike chases the car is perfectly set and highlighted in a sharp, comical tone. A quick and furious stick battle between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a model of dazzling choreography and a sharp, excellent direction and, perhaps, one of the best of its kind. Violence in the film is growing slowly, until finally, when the climactic confrontation does not come, we will face some of the most violent quarrels that Sammo has ever seen. The attack of the director / actor on Billie Chow and the house, filled with angry, formidable opponents, is a terrific, physically punishing pleasure. <br /> <br /> Terrific at every level and one of the best martial arts films ever made. <br /> <br /> Excellent rating too.
