Eva (Hedy Lamarr) has just married an elderly man and on her honeymoon she realizes that her husband does not want her. Her disappointment at the marriage and the deprivation of love makes Eve return to her father’s house on the farm, leaving her husband. One afternoon, while swimming in the lake, her horse runs off with clothes, and a young worker takes it and returns it to Eve. They fall in love with each other and become lovers. Later, the husband misses her and tries to bring Eve home. Eve refuses, and luck leads the trio to the same place, tragically ending the case. I just watched Extase for the first time, and the first comment I have is about the terrible quality of VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network: the film is only 75 minutes long and it seems that different movie clips were used. Some parts are completely damaged, while others are very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the images is not achieved by the Brazilian audience, if he has a chance to find this rare VHS for hire or for sale. The film is almost a silent movie, the story is very outdated and has only a few lines. Consequently, the characters are poorly developed. However, this film is also very brave, with nude beauty of the chest Hedy Lamarr and naked fat body for the current standards of beauty. Another fantastic moment is the poetic and metaphorical use of colors, symbolizing the communication between Eva and her lover. The way the director guides the scenes to show Eve’s needs and deprivations is very clear. The inconclusive finish is also very unusual for the 1933 film. I liked this movie, but I hope that one day I will have the opportunity to see the restored version in 87 minutes. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "" xtase "(" Ecstasy ")
