If you read “Mother's Night” and you liked it so much (like me) that you just need to watch a movie, understand that you must understand the fundamental element of Wonguth's letter - that Vonnegut lies behind his story and that you cannot put a human mind on the screen. His spirit and humor simply cannot be deciphered by the script or even the best acting performance. I believe that this film is superior in posing the key questions that Vonnegut puts in his book, but those frequent cynical moments of satire that can be found on the page do not show up on the screen. Does this mean the film misses the mark? Of course not. In my opinion, the film is successful, because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading a book (this is not a tool for those who are too lazy to turn the page). This is possible because he takes the fundamental elements of the story created by one of America’s true artistic treasures and presents it in a frame without any pretensions. I have seen other versions of Vonnegut films, where the director is clearly trying to direct the genius of Vonnegut and lose control of his craft. I would not call this film one of the best I have seen, but it stands on its own feet and is worth seeing. Removing Vonnegut's “voice” from the film’s narration or trying to insert it as he can, Mother Night brilliantly tells her story and preserves the main lessons of the story without confusion, distraction, or disappointment.
