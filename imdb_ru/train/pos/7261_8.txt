I strongly disagree with ctomvelu regarding the talent of Jim Belushi. I really like Belushi. Admittedly, I was skeptical when he first appeared on the scene, because I was a HUGE admirer of his late brother John. But Jim has a charm on screen that gave him very far away - and he has developed it well over the years. <br /> <br /> Curly Sue is one of his earlier films - his weight is a giveaway (isn't that true for most of us?) - and I like the movie. Yes, it is touching and heartbreaking, so if you like car chases, explosions and useless sex, then you can skip this one - a warm film about three lost soles that find each other. Don't get me wrong, I am for the three aforementioned keys to a successful film, but I also like a good, solid story like this one. <br /> <br /> And while Belushi and Kelly Lynch demonstrate excellent performance, the real star of this film is Alissan Porter, and she is just amazing. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know what happened to her career, but who is responsible for throwing the ball (the agent? parents? herself?) should be shot. You could not ask for a better introduction to fame than this film, but since then nothing has been heard about it. <br /> <br /> Another sad Hollywood story ...
