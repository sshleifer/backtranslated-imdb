I have nothing to add to my resume, this film is rated there with Top Gun as one of the funniest films ever made, although it did not try to be. For example, I do not think that this should be taken seriously when it is viewed, because it is very nice. <br /> <br /> I don’t think it also lowers Christopher Walken’s reputation, as his reputation weakened anyway. It took Pulp Fiction to wake him from the sleep in which he was. As for Michael Ironside, he was in one of the most amusing, although he did not try to be serious films. Total Recall, Top Gun. What I think is amazing is the budget of this film. The scenes, the actors, the explosions, and so on. Quite amazing, so obviously someone really liked it, and he wanted to risk more money. Whoever he is, I like them, because I love this movie! <br /> <br /> If someone reads this in search of information about McBain (and I seriously doubt that there will be too many of them), just know that this is a funny movie and you need to watch it with a smile on your face!
