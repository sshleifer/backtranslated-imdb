Legendary filmmaker Sydney Lumet gives us one of his best films in his historic career in this very tense and, ultimately, shocking story about a family in which one of the children is considered unfavorable. The list of actors, led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (Oscar-worthy performance here), Itan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet captured not only elements of damning criminal stories such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories such as Ordinary People. <br /> <br /> Many viewers may get confused and feel not happy with the construction of the plot, which Lumet faced here. Instead of showing it linearly, he took the path of Tarantino and shows that the central scene of the robbery went wrong from different points of view, everything is not in order. I personally found it very joyful and left me constantly wondering what will happen next. The script is very strong, with several beautiful scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are fascinating to watch, and Lumet, obviously, is happy to lead a style in which he usually does not penetrate. A lot of action and tension to keep viewers for two hours in a row is a rare film that isnâ€™t disappointed for a moment.
