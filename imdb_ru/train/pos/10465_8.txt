Even at the beginning of his career, Capra was quite pleased with his camera work and time. This is a delicate story - and quite predictable at times - but it gets very good performance from its composition and has some rather complex camera movements that involve the viewer. The first part is similar to the story of Cinderella, although anyone who has brains can see the bottom fall out of it - the rich "prince" will lose his fortune. <br /> <br /> However, due to a successful throw and fast pace, it is easy to be caught in a clich√©. Then the film really becomes more original, since the couple must find a way to make a living. The ending is very predictable, but satisfies. I also want to compliment the writing of the title: very witty and fun.
