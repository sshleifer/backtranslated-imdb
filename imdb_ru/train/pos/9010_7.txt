A bit quaint and bordering on a bad taste; but smart enough to be worth watching. A young woman in a wheelchair, Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter) teams up with the reluctant trustee Richard (Kenneth Brande). Richard is an artist who dreams of human flight. He builds a plane in his garage and is going to fly it. He wants to resurrect his troubled life, caring for an independent, dying Jane, who suffers from a neurological disease that almost deprived her of speech and very little motor skills. Wheelchair-bound and full of spirit, her last desire to die is to lose her virginity. She offers herself to Richard, who does not help her directly; but ready to rob a bank to pay a gigolo to do business. I found this film ambitious and humorous. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and sympathy.
