This film is amazing for several reasons. Harris takes an extremely awkward documentary and turns it into an appropriate social commentary. Groovin 'Gary is a guy from a small town who (presumably) is well known for his many imitations. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John in a local talent show (for which he is very passionate), Garyâ€™s actions show that he is not at odds with the conservative social environment in which he lives. This leads to the fact that he makes various excuses for his actions so that people do not think that he is actually a transvestite or another such social outcast. In the second installment, Harris uses the struggle between Gary and Beaver in an attempt by the novice to make a narrative from the original documentary. The third and final edition of the trilogy is truly amazing for Harris's extreme sensitivity to the subject. Unlike the second part, "Baby Orkley" shows Gary as a really restless character. He struggles to gain recognition in his own community, but to no avail. His secret passion for dressing, like Olivia Newton John, further alienates him from people who already consider him a social outcast. The film is depicted so realistic that, like reality, it is amenable to many reactions. Of course, you can see Gary as a ridiculously pathetic character, but he can also identify with him as an outcast.
