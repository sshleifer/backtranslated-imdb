May 1938 Hitler in Italy. Preparing for a historic date with Mussolini. Emotions, tensions and forms of self-affirmation. empty city, housewife and journalist. Meeting two different worlds. Asylum for mom with a sad life. Short stuffing for a classic victim. The story of loneliness and silence. On the form of life nooks and desires, like a form of battle. A great character is a book presented by a spring day. This film is a poem remarkable for art, to describe shades of total loneliness. Beg for an ineffable connection with reality. And with your inner world. Pictures Il Duce, clumsy Antonietta, patience and brittle tension Gabriele, the art director, to give meaning to the script grace of two great actors, make this film sublime, anticipation of subtle delicacy, wonderful film about hypocrisy and arbitrary verdict, about the essence of life and repulsion of any tyranny. Loren and Mastroianni are masters of a great intelligent acting game. Clear masterpiece.
