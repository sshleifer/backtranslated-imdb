Initially it was assumed that this would be a film in which Gene Kelly was shot, but when the directors could not get it, they got “the greatest actor in the world”, and the result was pretty good. In essence, Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) has problems with what he does best when setting up a high-stakes dice game because he needs $ 1,000 to get a seat. Thus, in order to get the money he needs, he bets $ 1,000 with his old friend Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), that he cannot force Sergeant Sarah Brown (the victory of the Great Expectations in the Golden Globe and BAFTA-nominated Gina Simmons) go with him Havana. Meanwhile, Nathan is having trouble trying to get rid of a woman who wants him to ask for her hand in marriage, Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blaine). Also starring Robert Kate as Lieutenant Brannigan, Stubby Kay as Nicely Nicely Johnson and B.S. Pulley like Big Jule. Interesting romantic comedy musical, in which Brando sings all his songs, and Sinatra - calm and calm. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Artistic Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mokridge, was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Film from any source and received a Golden Globe for Best Film - Musical / comedy. Frank Sinatra was 43rd in the 100 Greatest Pop Art Icons, Marlon Brando was 30th in the 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was 11th in the 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was in 4th place "100 years, 100 stars - men, Sinatra." was number 35, and Brando was number 1 in “The Greatest Actor of the World”, “Good Luck, Lady” was number 42 per 100 years, 100 songs for, the film was number 23 per 100 years of musicals, and it was number 36 per 100 greatest musicals . Fine!
