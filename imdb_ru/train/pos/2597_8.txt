“Ulysses” as a film can never be compared with a novel, because they are two completely different entities. Nevertheless, as they say, the film still manages to preserve many of the elements that made the book work, but since it is a visual medium, it is harder to pull it out of the stream of consciousness. I think that this is the best film they could make with this material ... and this is from someone who usually talks about films that are not like their literary colleagues. I recommend the book, but the film is still interesting.
