No doubt, conceived as a total obscene joke, "Full Moon High" portrays a 1950s teenager Tony Walker (Adam Arkin), accompanying his father (Ed McMahon) during a trip to Romania. Of course, Tony bites, and he gets fur and fangs whenever the full moon comes. A particularly interesting aspect of this film is that he cannot grow old until he has the curse of a werewolf, and that he must fulfill his destiny - even if it takes twenty years. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, the film is just ridiculous as soon as it starts. Ed McMahon's character is Yahoo's overly patriotic right (he thinks everyone should have listened to Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars's trainer / leader is a tense Loser, and there is more. One of the most prominent actors is Demond Wilson, who is most remembered as Lamont in Sanford and Son, as the bus driver who gets a big surprise. But probably the funniest scene is the change of presidents; then the gag with Gerald Ford really let him down! Anyway, this is a real pleasure. Considering that Alan Arkin - who plays a mental psychic - just won an Oscar on Sunday night and thanked his sons, I wonder if he remembers that he starred with two of them in this film (except Adam his son Anthony also played a small role ). Pretty funny. Also starring Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> PS: director Larry Cohen is probably best known for his killer film It's Alive.
