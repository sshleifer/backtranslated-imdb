I am now watching TV and watching Casomai. It changes, it develops or better ... turns. It all starts with a curious wedding of the two main characters, which tells about their love story. After that, everything changes, the child is born, and everything else usually happens in pairs. This is not a special film, because it talks about a normal couple, and normality is the center of this movie. He does not want to show us something special, there is nothing new in it, it’s just a normal love story, a couple’s story, and, being normal, it becomes different from the rest. This is also a blinking movie, everything is short, each scene is only a few seconds long. This is a reported story, many things are known, because friends and parents talk about it, and their opinion is central, opinions create history and destroy it. As I said, this is a simple story about a couple, but it’s not boring, it just shows a couple, everything should be known, yes, but I'm sure that each of you will want to know what is happening, so don’t forget to see the end!
