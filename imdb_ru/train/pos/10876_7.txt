I was very happy to see this movie. I thought that in the end Australia made a good film ... but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This was the most pitiful attempt by the killer movie. I'm sorry that Molly Ringwald came to Australia to make a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The game was terrible (especially for the Australian who was trying to speak with an American accent), and the plot was also pretty bad. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about the release of this film, I thought the title was pathetic (because it sounds like a funny movie “Beat” in “Scream 2”), but I was ready to let it slide, if it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION !!! BASIC SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst in the film is the final. I expected a lot of wonder about who the killer was ... but the killer was not even a man ... who turned this realistic slasher film into a horrible horror movie. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. You will probably be disappointed!
