This is not a very good movie, but I still like it. The Clovis cat is gold in the bank, and also the premise of the cats themselves - in fact, against evil lunatics. I think that in this film there is something more than people think, basically, it is very sharp, but sometimes this sharpness can be good. It has banal lines, a sudden ending and a comedy element, passed on by clumsy cops. <br /> <br /> Did anyone find the incestuous element bothering a bit? Ultimately, this film is accidentally and at random fierce, which is very effective, I compare it with Psycho - the relationship between mother and son, the change of main characters. I think that sharpness also works, this is not the movie that you want them to lengthen, it only works if it is short. <br /> <br /> I am still not sure that the director lacked depth, or he did these things for the purpose, we know that Stephen King has the ability, but I didnâ€™t even read his books, only saw some from his films. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked it. If you like tough banal films with 80s overtones, just take a look. but don't expect too much. This is really so bad, this is good.
