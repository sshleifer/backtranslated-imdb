If you have trouble suspending disbelief, then this is not for you. Just think: a woman already in late middle age finds a newborn baby in pieces of cabbage and raises him as her own. I'm thinking about it; she is not trying to find a mother who can be a bewildered teenager in need of treatment, and it looks like no one from the Italian equivalent of social services makes any attempt to put the child in "care" (no social services? now I Know, this is fantastic). Before you find out, young Toto is about ten years old or so, and his adoptive mother dies, leaving him in a shelter from which he leaves as a happy man who loves everyone. Not only in one apartment did he not only give his suitcase to the person who stole it, but also organized the local homeless to the conscientious residents of Shantituna, and he leads them to encore against capitalism in the form of a businessman who buys land on which he slips discovered oil. This requires some swallowing without the subsequent "miracles" starting with Toto's dead mother (the old woman who raised him, not his biological), appearing before him and giving him a pigeon, which doubles as a magic wand, allowing him to fulfill modest desires and finale, in which the vagabonds fly away to the best place, supposedly located somewhere over the rainbow. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film with Charm comes up and is easy to surrender. On the balance of a small masterpiece.
