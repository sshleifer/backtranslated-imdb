Lost - an extremely well-made television series about some people who are lost on the island. There are so many twists and turns that you can't really decide who your favorite character is, he is his one minute, then he does something that he’s cool, then she’s going to do something, so she’s the coolest and then the tension growing and how you break the episode ends and yours like nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo as ... Suspension, action, romance, humor is everything except girls without topless, but this is good, as this means that you can really concentrate on the plot, and history is what this is all about. so if you like a good story and you like obscurity, then it is good, but 24, I think, probably better. (I also have a review on this topic so you can check it out.) I would give the lost 8 out of 10 mostly because it is so unpredictable, you never know what will happen next.
