a huge ramones fan. I like the Ramons, and I believe that if you hate them, then besides the fact that you are an avid supporter of Bush, you may not like this classic. <br /> <br /> she is much better than juicy John Hughes, who loves films for teens as it littered the 80s. infinitely better than the American pie that torments us now. <br /> <br /> There are several other excellent films for high school students: Sisters, Fast Times, Class 84, Three O'clock and Cheesy, but exciting (not possible) River's Edge. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because he is the funniest and most fun, plus you can get up and dance with him. <br /> <br /> I love you, Riff Rundell. <br /> <br /> 10/10
