Emma Jane Austen is an extremely pleasant story at the worst of times, and this setting of the story is the best I've ever seen. Emma Kake Beckinsale impeccable. Gwyneth Paltrow (with the help of a good script and excellent cinema) can effectively show a comedy, she does not manage to make Emma attractive. Paltrow does not help the fact that her hairstyles are simply “wrong” for the part (and I believe the era), and she looks bad in empire dresses. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, manages the comedy effortlessly and still shows what Mr. Knightley (the most romantic of Jane Austen’s heroes) actually sees in her. Mark Strong - the magnificent Mr. Knightley with the right combination of good looks, appropriate age, chivalry, compassion and gentlemanly behavior. Emma and Mr. Knightley are supported by a group of good actors, and the whole performance is quite amazing.
