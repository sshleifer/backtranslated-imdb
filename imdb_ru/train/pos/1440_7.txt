I liked the quiet noir of the first part, the game of Pacino and Chusaka, especially their scenes together. The mood of the situation and the juxtaposition of the old politician and the idealistic youth had an effect. I wish Bridget Fonda had more scenes in the film; she was a serious and attractive character. The film came off me when the assistant mayor began hanging around the mafia to understand that his boss clearly did not want him to interfere. No one in their right mind would meet a mobster on an abandoned dock. dump. Here the story has become implausible. Something that I donâ€™t understand: why did the policeman and Vito have a shootout if the latter gave information that could bring down a corrupt judge?
