After you have watched this little cute and comedic film, you will surely get better. Greetings to Willow B. Pelletier, who gave birth to this little great film, which, in my opinion, will be recognized as a landmark 2004 film for Quebec. Actors Isabelle Blaise, Emmanuel Bilodo, Sylvie Moreau and Stefan Gagnon perform a touching performance. I would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you to those that gave me Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am√©lie Poulain. So if you like the great Jean-Pierre Jonet film, I would say that you should also like the first film by Yves B. Pelletier, Les Aimants
