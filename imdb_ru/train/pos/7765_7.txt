Douglas Sirk directs this over-played drama about unfortunate abundance. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are childhood friends with different views on life. Kyle is the woman's son of an oil magnate; Mitch works for the Hadley oil company. Both fall in love with the same woman, Lucy Moore; but Kyle has the means to distract her from her legs and marry her. Sister Marily (Dorothy Malone) seems to be the city's nymphomaniac and carries a torch for Mitch, who seems to be always the one who clears the Hadley riots. Ambitious with a claim; a bit beyond that, but the stars make this movie to see. Malone struck me the most. The cast is completed by Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilk.
