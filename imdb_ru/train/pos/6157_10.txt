This is a film that I didn’t even think about until my 3-year-old saw him in a video store and grabbed him after he liked the picture of animals on Nubub Island. We got it and since then have repeatedly watched it; since then we have rented it several times. There are very few non-animated films that my son will watch and pay attention to; what a nice change from Dumbo and the Little Mermaid. The game is outstanding, the songs are irresistible, they penetrate into your head, and you can't not sing along. The storyline, although specifically about the Second World War, is eternal in its own way, and every time you watch it, you can see something new. I heard this compared to Mary Poppins, but I think that these are two completely different films, both great, but for some reason my son is not interested in Mary Poppins at all. This is one of those films that children will want to watch again and again, and parents will not mind obeying them. There are days when we watch him before going to bed and before going to bed, and I don’t feel the groan that comes when he wants to repeat any other film.
