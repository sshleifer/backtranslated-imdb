Ideal for families with young children who are looking for frivolous films that do not contain violence, and are fun for the child and fun, though completely banal, for adults. A good movie for low-budget work. Children will be amazed at Santa’s workshop and the “magic” that allows him to enter houses through too small chimneys or houses where there are no chimneys at all! <br /> <br /> Children will be delighted with the success of Santa in To prevent the nasty devil named Pitch (in the classic red dress with horns and tail!). They will sympathize with the poor little girl who most wants to have a little doll to love. And a poor little rich boy who only wants to spend time with his forever absent parents. And what kid doesn't know someone in school who looks like nasty guys recruited by Pitch to help catch Santa and spoil Christmas? In the end, everyone, including guys, gets what they deserve for Christmas! <br /> <br /> The film will appeal to the children of Santa and the message of love that he gives to people all over the world. <Br /> <br />
