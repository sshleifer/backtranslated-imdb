Initially, I appreciated Sarah’s show with a good fat eight, but I struggled a bit with her humor lately, and a skinny 7 is something that has been established. I will explain. <br /> <br /> You will also like Sarah’s humor or you won’t. If you do not, I doubt that anyone can convince you. You guys know who you are, and this is perfectly normal, but you know it too. Continuing, the first season gave us fantastic pieces about Sarah, her friends and family, and her activities in life. In one memorable episode, she is "stopped" by officer Jay, with whom she is dating for the first time. - "Do you know why I'm standing here?" he is asking. "Because you have all the C in high school?" she mockingly replies. It seemed like a genuine question. - These are fun things in my book. Sarah can come at you from all sides. In another episode, her love affair with God was especially funny. God, being petty and jealous, wonderfully added to the joke. It's clever, it's a distorted view, but it would show us the truth in humor, and we laughed. <br /> <br /> Then came the second season. Although we still couldn’t do without some kind of new and inventive comedy, we seem to have fallen into banal potions and farting jokes. Here and there I get a good laugh, but most of it looks like a filler, while she and the authors struggle to raise some kind of original material. Recently, I have experienced tedious and tedious feelings for the episodes, but I have gutted them because of the gems I find (the turtle), and wait for her to turn them over. I was a fan of her “Jesus is Magic” routine and I would like to think that I understand what she is capable of. Let's go back to this.
