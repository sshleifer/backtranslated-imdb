“The Sea Is Watching” was made from the original script of Akira Kurosawa, and this is a really lush and warm film. Watch it will be nice! <br /> <br /> Kay Kumai, as a director, certainly has no equal with the old but eternal master (especially in the crowd scenes at the beginning of the film there is a terrible acting game), but the general mood and landscape is very pleasant. Another thing that is missed here: Kurosawa always knew how to allow characters to be much more than they actually show and do. <br /> <br /> This was probably his magic on the set; and maybe this scenario has not yet been completely up to par. <br /> <br /> Maybe we just lose sight of the master. <br /> <br /> This is one beautiful and cute film, but this is not Kurosawa. Expecting that it can be very stupid ...
