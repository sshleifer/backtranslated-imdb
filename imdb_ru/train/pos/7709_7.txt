I know that I should like this film, and I do for the most part, but, as others have mentioned, it is a bit long in the teeth. I also found that the violent hormones of the entire male team are a bit annoying. Surprisingly, they did not begin to choke and howl at the moon. I also have to say that the whole movie leaves me cold. This is a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film. On the positive side, the effects are excellent (aside from the cartoon monster), as are the effects, props, costumes and, of course, Robbie. If the robot was not in this film, I do not think that it would be as popular as it was / is. The second half of the film is gaining momentum as soon as we start exploring forgotten gadgets from Crell. As many times as I have seen this film, Krell still leaves me to scratch my head to exactly who or what they were. Based on what was produced at that time, besides “This Island Earth”, “Forbidden Planet” is located in miles above the average science fiction films of that time. Being shot in color also adds to his enjoyment. Of course, a classic in itself, flaws and everything, and deservedly so.
