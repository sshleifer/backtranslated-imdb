In my case, I liked this movie, because when I saw it, I found more than I expected. I mean, this is one of the few animated films that made me think about his themes even after I finished. He speaks of death, revenge and hell in a way that hits you like a slap on the face, even suffering from a dream sequence in the middle of the movie. This is what makes this film so good: Don Blut’s (director’s) ability to play with people's feelings and make them love or hate a character in an instant. It is the fact that there are so many good characters in it, like Charlie and Anne-Marie, that in a sad but happy end you have to say “I have something in my eyes” to hide the others you cried. All that I have said is just some of the good things about this film. For the rest, you should see them in the film very honestly. Don Blut, thank you.
