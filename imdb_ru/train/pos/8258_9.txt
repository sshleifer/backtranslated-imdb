With the risk of appearing a bit blasphemous, on first viewing I’m inclined to put it on a par with Shaun of the Dead. Now, considering that I see Simon Pegg as an undeniable comedic genius, I understand that this is quite a big demand. And to what extent you agree with this last statement, it may be a good preliminary indicator of whether you like Fido. <br /> <br /> In a sense, the comedy starts from where Sean stopped, except for us. You are back in the original 1950s of the living dead of the era of the stereotypical middle American town. The Zombie Wars have ended, and the zombies themselves are becoming more fit, useful members of the community. This, as we know from the very beginning, largely due to the scientific progress made by good people at Zomcom - perhaps a good game in a romantic comedy? <br /> <br /> The film’s charm lies in the fact that it is a respectable area in which basic values ​​are preserved, as well as a place for zombies and the special dangers they pose. The charm and balance with which he does it are almost perfect enough. There are topics that you can expect from the more popular kitsch comedy - plywood good clean life, maintaining appearance, repressed emotions, confused parental values, social propriety and the plight of an estranged person. <br /> <br /> This is a story told with a happy heart and wide appeal, vividly brought to life by the comprehensive composition of the film. This is one of those works where you can see that all the participants enjoyed the participation. It’s also fun to imagine how Billy Connelly, while studying his script, looked something like this ... <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it’s likely that you’ll appreciate the humor of this film, unless your father tried to eat you.
