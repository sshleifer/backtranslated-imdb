I could not hold back tears when I watched this wonderful documentary. It was heartbreaking, exciting and inspiring - all in one. I recommend this documentary to anyone who is looking for something that will make them think about what they do with their lives. Or just something that makes you think. You see how John is going through the last couple of months of his life. You watch him go through his days with a positive attitude. At some point, you begin to see that he is truly an amazing person. You begin to understand that he has something to teach us all. His life and struggle will make you cry, laugh, and you will realize that it is much easier to live if you take it one day at a time.
