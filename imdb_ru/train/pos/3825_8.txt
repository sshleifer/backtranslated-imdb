A young woman arrives in her husband's hometown after he passed away in an accident. She barely calms down in this small town, but will soon lose her little son as a result of the abduction and all her hopes ... This can lead to all sorts of subjects in the usual film: find a new partner and, finally, be happy; or in sufficient depression to fight and, finally, commit suicide ... She tries to commit suicide, but not after a series of heavy battles with God. She believes in God, but discovers that God seems to forgive everyone, even the murderer. Well, I have to be careful with God here, the film means nothing against God. The way the film looks at the problem is quite interesting: not from the point of view of a woman or from the point of view of God (so there would be a lot of grass, growing clouds, I suppose). Rather, it is a third party view, the film allows us to perceive and does not explain anything. <br /> <br /> The film would not be so interesting if there were only a woman. There is this man who is everywhere around the woman and obviously in love with her, but in his own way. I must say, he is a funny guy, like a clown, who shamelessly hangs around our heroine. The combination of these two: a woman full of tension, always crying and throwing up, and a man, stupidly smiling and speaking, leads to a good balance of emotions: nothing is absurdly wrong or too exhausting. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
