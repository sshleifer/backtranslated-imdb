This film was released 12 years ago and became a revelation even for people who knew something about the dredge in New York. Drag and Drop textbooks do not say anything about these fashion houses. "Great challengers" Anthony Slide say nothing. Julian Fleischer’s Dragging Queens of New York: An Illustrated Field Guide, with its block diagram of influence that combines Julian Eltinge, Minett, Warhol Queens and the club scene of the 90s - and after the film - are completely ignored at home. Even Lawrence Senelik’s The Changing Room, the closest thing we have to the final drag-and-drop book, quickly zooms past the film and does not provide the background information one would expect from it. <br /> <br /> From the film itself and various articles that I found on the Internet, I understand that this home system exists decades ago. It seems that the main film, played by a family member before 1990, is “Crystal Bey” in the film “Queen”, 1968. The historical context is the biggest missing part of the film "Paris is burning." <br /> <br /> The film is valuable because it focuses on the stage, otherwise it is ignored. This is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989. The regrettable fact that Venus Xtravaganza was killed during the filming gives a very dramatic end, but this is not the only transsexual film that includes murder in real life. As we now know, Dorian Corey had a mummified corpse in its literal closet, but it appeared only after three years. <br /> <br /> It has historical significance, but we still need someone to make a book or documentary that provides more context.
