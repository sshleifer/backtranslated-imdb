This highly effective piece of British horror with the image of several Hammer stars revolves around the house and the fate of its previous tenants, whose stories are told to a detective from the Scottish courtyard in search of the missing actor. <br /> <br /> History number one, which is probably the least impressive of the four, is dedicated to the writer and his wife, who have just moved into the house and plan to stay for a short time so that he can write one of his horror stories . He creates a crazy character named Dominic, who looks like a terrible strangler, and soon finds himself going crazy when he begins to see this monstrous looking man everywhere he goes. After his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help, a story is introduced that, frankly, does not really work for me. I will not spoil it for you. <br /> <br /> The next story (the best, in my opinion) will play the wonderful Peter Cushing in the role of Philip Grayson, a man who moved into retirement and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museum (which is a dismal business) where he is very surprised to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past. Soon after, an old friend (who also has a story with this woman) comes to the city on business and calls on him. The two men await a rude awakening, for they soon discover that there was more in this woman than it seems at first glance. <br /> <br /> The story of the three stars is one of my favorite ... Christopher Lee, who plays John. Raid. Moving into the house with his special daughter Jane, the nanny he hires becomes terribly suspicious of how Reed suppresses his daughter. Well, let's find out ... if she knew what Lee did, she would surely understand. <br /> <br /> The Last Story is a rather carefree vampire story, starring John Pertvey and Ingrid Pitt. Having bought a raincoat from a mysterious merchant, the actor Paul Henderson found himself turning into the very creature that he had depicted several times in his career. <br /> <br /> In general, the pace and direction were very good, as were most of the performances. Here and there were pleasant gothic touches and an effective score that complemented the atmosphere. This keeper, and highly recommended.
