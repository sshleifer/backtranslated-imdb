After all, you do not go to the Orson Welles movie to watch a beautiful simple little story and cross out the image of a happy eternal star ?? <br /> <br /> You go to see theatrically elevated characters locked up in conflict with colorful and unusual settings, lit and creatively appreciated, bravely photographed, and all this is littered with unexpected details of surprise that the wise and boring director avoided or did not even think ?? <br /> <br /> As usual, besides directing, Wells wrote the script and he also played the hero ?? a young Irish sailor who understood the world and saw him evil, but still retained his clear faith in the goodness of others ?? Unfortunately for him, he abandoned this trust in Rita Hayworth, whose cool looks hid a bleak past and murderous inclinations towards the future ?? She was married without love with a powerless, crippled protector who behaved like an evil lizard from the brilliant Everett Sloan ?? <br /> <br /> At the base of all this lies youthful romanticism, and this quality was included in the turbulent play “The Lady from Shanghai”. Before the inevitable happened, did Wells run away ?? before the final triangular showdown in the mirror room, which became one of the classic scenes of post-war cinema ?? <br /> <br /> Wells did not miss the chance throughout the entire film to contrast words and actions with visual details that enriched the texture and raised the atmosphere ?? His camera seemed to caress Rita Hayworth when the sun was playing with her hair and her long limbs, while she playfully teased the young sailor on her web ??
