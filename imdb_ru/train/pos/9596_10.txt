This film documents a transformative experience for a group of young people, and the experience of watching it in itself transforms the viewer. Few films even aspire to this level of transcendence, and I cannot recall any other film — documentary or dramatic — that would achieve this. There is no other film in which I would laugh and cry so much. Yes, we are talking about DMD and available travel; Only on these issues is it a profitable venture, but it is more. This is about friendship. It is about life itself, about life every day when you are alive. And this is a great, fun, adventurous story. That's why God made the movie! Watch this movie !!!
