Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is on the verge of puberty, begins to have strange dreams that begin to affect her in real life, especially when it comes to a boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers) whom she meets in a dream. <br /> <br /> A very unusual fantasy with some truly scary moments. Despite the fact that we are talking about a teenage girl and has a rating of PG-13, this is NOT for children. Also, if you hate fantasy, stay away. But if you play for something else, it meets all the requirements. <br /> <br /> Well directed by Bernard Rose with a simply beautiful score and a few pleasant, terrible thrusts. The only thing that prevents this from being a truly great film is Burke - she is not a very good actress (not surprisingly, this was her only film), and it hurts the film. However, everyone else is great. <br /> <br /> Spiers are very good, like Mark; Glen Headley (very well imitating the British accent) is also very good, because Anna's mom and Ben Cross are frightening and sympathetic, like Anna's father. <br /> <br /> The sleeping hit, released in 1988, has since disappeared. This is very bad - it is really very good.
