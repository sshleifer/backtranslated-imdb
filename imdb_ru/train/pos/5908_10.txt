This is one of the most exciting films I've seen lately. Surpasses even any international film with any reputation. I’m really surprised why it didn’t get the recognition it deserved. Sonali Kulkarni, who won the National Award, is perhaps the only comforting fact. Renuka Daftardar is simply amazing when it says a lot about it. There are several scenes that stand out: when Gauri returns from the city to Krishna’s wedding, she meets Krishna for the first time in many years. Krishna notices a change in Gauri, but does not speak a single line of dialogue. The whole range of emotions is transmitted by subtle manners and eyes. There is another end when Krishna pleads with Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri. If you are not touched by this scene, you have no heart. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie to find out about its brightness and acting ability.
