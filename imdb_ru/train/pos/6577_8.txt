With a few exceptions, most of the plays of George Bernard Shaw these days have practically disappeared from the theater. Too harsh, too talkative, it seems like a general verdict. This BBC version of one of the funniest plays by Shaw does not refute this sentence. It is, of course, crooked and talkative, but it is also wonderful. And because of the quality of the British theater, it’s great for actors, about which, with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter, most of us have probably never heard of. Carter is great as a Bulgarian girl who sheltered the professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) and later fell in love with him. One could quarrel with a particularly ridiculous interpretation of Sergius (Patrick Raikart), a Bulgarian cavalry officer who led the attack in the enemy line and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for his machine guns. However, the role invites excessive action, and Ryecart obviously was ordered to excessive action. Other players are perfect for writing. Carter, as the Bulgarian “aristocrat” self-dramatized, and Torrens, as the Swiss soldier of fortune, of course, in the center of the play, and they are beautiful. Yes, “Guns and Man” looks like a shot of the play. But you can hardly ever see the movie Show, which does not betray its origin. Plots are usually smart. However, Shaw is all about dialogue. The action is minimal (even in St. Joan) and the sets don't matter. Enjoy that which is.
