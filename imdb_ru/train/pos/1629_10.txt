This movie is so cheap, it's cute! With Ron Liebmann (Major Von), representing the most entertaining on-screen recordings in film history. I have 2 copies of this movie in the video ... in one, Ralph Macchio is caught in the background in Major Vogne when he has a rant in Hash. Obviously, they forgot to edit this error from the film, but it shows how funny the film is when the actors themselves cannot keep their character calm !!!
