Filmed in 2017 (although it can easily be mistaken for 1987, judging by the hairstyles and clothes), the Running man sees a good guy, Ben Richards (Schwarzeneggar) everywhere, accused of a crime he did not commit. After a daring prison break, he was captured and presented as a participant in the cruel TV show The Running Man, along with several other fugitives and a pretty girl Amber (Maria Conchita Alonso). <br /> <br /> Used by the totalitarian government as a means of controlling the masses, the show forces to condemn against a number of bright (and often quite calm) opponents, each of which has its own unique style of killing: Dynamo launch electricity from a special costume, Buzzsaw uses chainsaws. In Sub Zero, a hockey stick with razor edges, and Fireball prefers a flamethrower to finish off rivals. But these murderers are no match for Ben Richards, who sends each of them in a dignified and terrible manner (accompanied by mandatory wit). <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Ben joins a group of freedom fighters in a battle against the authorities, and he wants revenge on the evil master of the show, Killian. <br /> <br /> Twenty years ago, Arnold Schwarzeneggar ruled the militant universe and, for his legion of fans, he could make no mistakes. The Austrian sponge cake had a successful formula that almost guaranteed the success of his films at the box office: violence against comics, a plot without logic, a pretty girlfriend, plus witty remarks, minus acting skills equaled huge profits. The running man faithfully followed this blockbuster recipe, and viewers of Arnie (mostly teenage men) bought him (including me). <br /> <br /> Now, two decades later, and just finished re-watching the film For the first time in many years, I find it a strange film, completely devoid of technical merit, worthy acting and convincing effects, but at the same time completely uninteresting . Directed by Paul Michael Glazer (better known as Det. Dave Starsky from the cult police show of the 70s, Starsky and Hutch) and adapted from the story of Stephen King (written under the pseudonym of Richard Bachmann), 80s Running Tattoo, It looks incredibly cheap and very outdated, but, despite (or perhaps because of) the paucity of the film, it has a special charm that is hard to describe. <br /> <br /> Not trying to create a realistic one - The future setting gives a lot of unintended chuckles. Check out the scene in which Ben discovers Amber's secret cache of banned tapes (!); marvel at the shitty “futuristic” graphics used on billboards and in the board game “Running Man” (for me, as a graphic designer, this seemed especially funny); marvel at the lack of compelling technological advances. <br /> <br /> “Running Man” may be nonsense, but this is a very entertaining trash, which I would not hesitate to recommend to fans of Arnie and sci-fi action. generally.
