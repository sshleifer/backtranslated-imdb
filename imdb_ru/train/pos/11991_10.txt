Aah, Talespin! What can I say that has not yet been said about this great show? Nothing! This is, without a doubt, one of the most well-written shows I've ever met, live action or animation. Newer things are too stupid for my tastes, and some of the “mature” things that I have to kick the kids out of the room. But not Talespin. <br /> <br /> Stories are interesting and believable. Some of them may even be stretched for an hour or two for a movie. Such episodes as "Stormy Weather" and "Her Chance to Sleep" are very dramatic, and at the same time enjoyable for both children and adults. Then there are pure comedic episodes, such as Bluest of the Baloo Bloods and Stuck on you, where the emphasis is on fun. I can laugh to tears in a few favorites. <br /> <br /> At present, the dramatic aspect is absent in most performances (at least in those that are not specifically designed for this), especially in cartoons. For example, in the episode "Stormy Weather", Keith Cloudkiker decides to join the air circus, but Balu thinks it will be too dangerous. In the episode's biggest duel, Balu shouts to Keith to stay away from Dering Dana, to which Keith shouts: “NO! You can't tell me what to do! YOU * NOT * * MY * * DAD *! ”And hides his face in the pillow. The next day he goes to the air circus. This kind of drama is a rarity in cartoons, and it could be welcomed in those that are currently created. <br /> <br /> Characters have a lot of depth. Balu is pretty much what it is in the Book of the Jungle, plus or minus several degrees of laziness. Rebecca is a sly business woman whose ideas about getting money, although good in theory, are rarely good in practice. Molly is a cute little girl, but you can't let this fool you. Sometimes she can be a real hellion. Kit Cloudkicker - the character is darker than the rest. He has little trust in adults, unless they turn to him, and he has a tendency to break off relationships. Watch his expression in “Looting and Lightning” when he grabs the catch hook: it looks as if he is ready to prepare it right through the pirate. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a drama combined with a very real chemistry between the characters who make this show number 1 in my book. The relationship between Balu and Keith is very real, almost father and son. This is well demonstrated in the book “The Whole Whale, which ends with a whale,” when Balu believed the word of Keith that Seymour was mocking the animals in his tank instead of taking the side of other adults. The relationship between Baloo and Becky is also realistic, because Balu’s motivation to work is to want to redeem the ducks, and not to help Rebecca. But something tells me that if he does return the duck, he will still do the work for Rebecca. <br /> <br /> “Sea duck”, not to mention all the other aircraft of the series, is quite realistic designed. Aircraft functions never change throughout the series (for example, it is difficult to achieve continuity), and, unlike most other “superplanes” of other cartoons, it does not have any weapons on board (except for mango!), And instead relies on the cunning pilot's magnificent mastery to avoid trouble. It is difficult to imagine a car-hero, who does not have any gun, laser gun or even a pistol on board. And the fact that they use their heads to avoid trouble is so hard to find in cartoons these days. Plus, it's a damn cool design! <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best cartoon. Ever Period. Definitely worth all ten stars!
