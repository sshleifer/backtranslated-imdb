This is what the music genre was made of. Humor, talent, romance and action - all in one. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was wonderful. Nothing more to say. Marlon Brando, though not a singer, did a great job, winning the hearts of many with his image of Sky Masterson. The fact that he could not sing added to his character. The ladies in the movie were fine, but the men in the movie definitely stole the show. <br /> <br /> This is a real classic that can be appreciated at any age. It connects to all viewers and makes you smile and laugh. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie to watch and enjoy!
