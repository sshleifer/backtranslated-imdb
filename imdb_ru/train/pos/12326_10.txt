I first saw this film at the Berlin Film Festival and have never seen a Hong Kong movie before. I felt like in a roller coaster: the action was very fast, and there was not a single boring moment in the film. There are martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic plot. My favorite scene is when a Taoist drinks, sings and fights for himself - one of many scenes that emphasizes the extraordinary musical component of the film. This film is a must!
