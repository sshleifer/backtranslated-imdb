This film has a powerful philosophical ending. But this ending only makes sense if you are watching a movie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The alienation of young people in the late 1960s, from the point of view of a young man and a young woman, is the obvious theme of Zabriskie Point. ". Neither Marc Fréchette nor Daria Halprin did not have much acting experience, which actually reinforces the meaning of the film. Unprepared actors create a sense of realism, since both players seem to be emotionally detached from the turmoil around them. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie script. Except for the first ten minutes, it’s mostly visual, with amazing cinematography. Beautiful naturalistic images seem otherworldly and perfectly synchronized with the emotional detachment of Mark and Daria. <br /> <br /> I would replace the thematically weak Pink Floyd music with more convincing The Doors music. Many scenes scream about "Riders in a storm." <br /> <br /> Despite this, I like this movie. This is different; it is unique; it is artistic and imaginative. And the desert barren land is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Over the years, Zabriskie Point seems increasingly attractive. He conveys the mood of the late 1960s in America. It is surprisingly artistic, in the bohemian style. And the last eight minutes of the film philosophically fascinate.
