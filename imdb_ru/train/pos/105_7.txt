We must start with Ed Furlong. You should. God bless this child. 5 dollars says that the character he plays in this film is what he really is in real life. He has one or two liners that made me almost snot because of the subtle humor in the script. You know all the trials that this guy went through in recent years, and it doesn't even seem that Furlong even works. Maybe that's why his performance was good. Same with Madsen. You keep thinking: "I bet this guy really is like that in real life." Should Madsen have to act at all? Just natural. Vosloo obviously switched from the typed Mummy guy. I think the biggest surprise for this film was the performance of Jordana Spiro. Her reactions in this film. I struggled whether she was hot or not, but I realized that I just wanted to see her more. <br /> <br /> Not a big fan of filming films like hostages. But what I'm a fan of, these are movies with a lot of turns to try and guess. It's not just your ordinary robbers taking a bank, they kill hostages, and the good guys win in the final type of movie. Turns keep coming ... and coming. <br /> <br /> Scenes in cafes work best with hand-held cameras to show what is really going on there. A little not embellished. Think of Bourne Ultimatum in the style of "light" in some scenes in the cafe. <br /> <br /> And for those fanatics of Bo Bis, that the actor Curtis Wayne (who plays Karl) will force you to double the double. These guys are twins. <br /> <br /> As I watched, I wondered why some actors had foreign accents and what they did in this small town. In the end, it made sense that these people smuggle things into other countries / states to have these accents. But even more is revealed in the bonus features of how some producers wanted to make this film for an international audience with their own stars, which we could not have heard. And some of them smoke hot. Moncia Dean? Do I need to say more?
