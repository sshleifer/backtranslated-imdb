I generally like these 1930 "Mystery / Police" Charlie Chan films, and this is no exception. However, in this film, something bad. A late attempt to move from the brain films about Moto, centered around the plot notions, to a salad bar spoiled by comedic relief, which also alleviates the pain in the legs. Out of nowhere, a typical jester appears, depicting a clumsy Englishman who plays a detective, and even other characters are drawn into a comedic relief. The plot may seem strange to us or just an excuse today, but then the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only real, but also commonplace.
