I wanted to see this movie for the past few months. I was really surprised at how good it was. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a group of teenage students who bully a boy named Marty. They constantly intimidate him, until one of them makes a monstrous mistake, as a result of which Marty was terribly burned. <br /> <br /> A few years later, a group of reckless teens are invited back to their own high school, which is now throwing a party. Although none of the reckless teenagers organized this party. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, teens begin to die in the most terrible way possible. I can certainly tell you that they are also terrible. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, you find that it was a dream, and none of this happened. But Marty is in a hospital with severe burns. Although the killings did not happen, burns and pranks obviously did occur. <br /> <br /> The game is terrible, but it's good. <br /> <br /> I like this story. I really sympathize with Marty. This is like Tamara (2005). In the end, the hooligans get what comes to them, and you end up feeling satisfied that the victim gets his sweet revenge. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for slashers from the 80s. <Br /> <br /> I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Good cheese slasher!
