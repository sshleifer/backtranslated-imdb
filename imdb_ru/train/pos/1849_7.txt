Antwone Fisher talks about a young black man recruited by the US Navy and a product of child abuse and neglect (Luke), whose hostility towards others makes him limit his shrinking base (Washington), leading to self-analysis, self-assessment and returning vegetables . Pat, sanitized and sentimental, "Antwone Fisher" is a serious film about reconciling past regrets and closing. Good old Hollywood entertainment, family values, entertainment with a hint of corn.
