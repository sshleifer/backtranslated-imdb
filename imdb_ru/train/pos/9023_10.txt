A very rough, bold image of a part of the history of the Second World War, which most of us in the United States did not even suspect. I would like to have this on video. This was only shown on television. Once, as far as I know, in 89 or 90. I asked about this film, and most video stores do not even know about it. Around great actresses, I wish I could see this again. High quality series.
