It was such a pleasure when this show was included, because it was such a fresh, innovative and original show. It makes every show I've ever watched, it looks boring. The moment the first episode came out, I was fascinated and so easily attached to all the characters (which usually never happens, because I always hate several characters). It is a pity that this show will not have a third season, because it must be one of the best shows I have ever seen, and it does not exaggerate my feelings for the show at all. Nothing can replace Pushing Daisies, because what can ABC find to replace this show? This is easily the best show on television. <br /> <br /> I came for Kristin Chenoweth and stayed because I fell in love with the whole show.
