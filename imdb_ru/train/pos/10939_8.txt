“Five Deadly Poisons” is a great Kung Fu action movie shrouded in mystery bastards. There are all the usual obvious signs of clicking kung-fu: excellent choreography, terrible dubbing, different “styles” of struggle and a wide range of greatly exaggerated, often cheesy human emotions. However, the plot is definitely better than average. It is interesting and keeps your attention on the scenes without a fight. Sometimes he is even able to stir up an audience, for example, when a character X receives a terrible injustice. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about Five Deadly Poisons is the beautiful simplicity of moral and film themes. Almost everyone gets what comes to them. Cowardly, greedy and corrupt lose. The bad guys, absorbed in selfish greed, are ultimately destroyed by their own betrayal and retaliation. Good guys use teamwork, planning and honesty to overcome the odds and come out on top. <br /> <br /> Poisonous clan swinging!
