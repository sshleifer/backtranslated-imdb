If you want mindless action, hot chicks and a post-apocalyptic look at Seattle, then this show is for you! <br /> <br /> The concept of the Dark Angel is not new (in fact, the argument about whether James Cameron stole the idea from the book), but I spend a whole hour watching her every Tuesday from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba smokes, and Max’s friends (original Cindy, Kendra) are just a shot. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are improving, but the dialogues between Original Cindy and Max should be a little better (slang sounds forced, and it sounds as if someone from the suburbs wrote this). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Dark Angel is a tremendous sense of guilt, filled with everything that a militant fan can ask for, but if you are looking for a drama that has won many awards, watch the film “West Wing” or something.
