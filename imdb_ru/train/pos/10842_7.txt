So I rented "Still Crazy". When I told the guy about the Hardcore Logo in the video store, he said that it sounds like Still Crazy. Therefore, I rented it. Was I disappointed? Well, yes, because Still Crazy focuses on a classic rock band, not a punk band, but that's fine. Still Crazy tells the story of Strange Fruit, a rock band that broke up in the 70s at the height of its popularity at a big rock festival. Twenty years later, the band members are struggling to make a living, and they have the opportunity to play a concert in the twentieth anniversary of this festival. They accept the proposal and decide to carry out a permanent reform tour of Europe. Following this, quite funny jokes take place, and all the characters undergo minor changes. Watching this film, you feel more like a spectator of a carefully edited documentary than a participant. And this is not bad at all.
