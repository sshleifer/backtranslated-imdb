"So far, The Birdie" is not one of the best musicals of all time, but it is very fun and accessible to many viewers. The original film might have been wonderful, with Dick Van Dyke playing the main role on Broadway, but instead they were fiddling with the plot, so the film is very unsatisfactory. This revision, released on ABC in 1995, is much more true to the original script and includes some original songs that were also used in the national tour, shot in this film, in which Tommy Tune and Ann Raking were shot (which are the choreographer of this film.) <br /> <br /> Jason Alexander is very different from Dick Van Dyke, but he is well shot in the role of Albert (before his “Seinfeld” days he started in the Musical Theater.) Vanessa Williams is perfect for Rose. This is also the excellent work of The Secret of the Daily in the role of May and Mark Kudish in the role of Conrad Birdie (the role he played in the national tour). <br /> <br /> This film is not without problems. The main responsibility is Chinna Phillips, which, no matter how attractive it is, just looks and seems too old to be teenage Kim A George Wendt, like her father, a bit boring, throws out a number of “children” (some original actors Paul Lind stole the show.) <br /> <br /> But overall, this is amazing, well done film that deserves the material.
