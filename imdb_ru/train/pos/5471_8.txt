During 1933, many cuts were made in this film because it was very overloaded with the content of the plot and the fact that Lily Powers (Barbara Stenvik) would do everything to gain great wealth and power. Lily's father forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14, and she grew up in a steel mill in a city with very poor people, and her father had a secret conversation that brought all kinds of male characters to his house that looked after Lily. Lily meets man after man and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is the president of a playboy bank. It's nice to see a very young John Wayne (Jimmy McCoy, Jr.) who was only 25 years old when this picture was produced, and Jimmy did not even get to first base with Lily, even for lunch. Very young George Brent (from Coutland Trenholm) is filming along with Barbara Stenwick and both gave outstanding performances. This is a great film of 1933, shot by Darryl F. Zanuk, who had been in prison for many years and most recently appeared on a silver screen. This film is rather mild compared to what we see on Hollywood screens today, but in 1933 it was very disobedient to watch this type of film. enjoy
