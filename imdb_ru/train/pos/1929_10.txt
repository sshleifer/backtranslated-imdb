I recently had the pleasure of seeing The Big Bad Swim on Ft. The Lauderdale Film Festival, and I must say that this is the best film I have seen in an entire year, and the only film I have ever experienced to write a comment / comment. This film was beautifully directed and combined the script with realistic dialogue, excellent acting and inspirational message. Ordinary lives come together in a swimming lesson for adults and become extraordinary in celebrating the diversity of life. This is vividly illustrated by the images in the first minute of this fascinating film, where we see how only the legs and torso of people of different shapes and sizes enter a pool of water. This film is brilliantly directed at actors who are placed in exciting scenes that hold your attention and imagination.
