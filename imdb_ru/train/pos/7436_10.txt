This filmed film “The Frost of the Ancient Sailor” is the most beautiful and interesting performance of Coleridge's poem. Striking cinematography, combined with a collection of two centuries of effort to illustrate the 1798 epic poem by world-renowned artists, and Michael Redgrave's excellent narrative, are very worth the time to watch this excellent visual work. <br /> /> In the era of television, such work as this is an invaluable tool that encourages young students and adults to explore and learn the value of great poetry. As far as I know, such work is really rare; This is unfortunate. As a student of world literature and a former college professor and academic advisor, I feel that greater epic poems, such as Coleridge's “Frost of the Ancient Sailor”, should be so “translated.” Although not a film critic, but as an avid reader of classical literature, I am happy to recommend this excellent production without any reservations.
