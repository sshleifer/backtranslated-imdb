The Korean War was called America's forgotten war. So many unanswered questions were buried along with 50 thousand people who died there. From time to time we turn to a play or film that deals with that distant, illusively frozen cemetery. Here, perhaps, one of the best. She is called "Sergeant Riker." The story of an American soldier named Sergeant. Paul Riker (Lee Marvin), whom the commander chose for a top secret mission. His task is to desert with the North Koreans and offer his services against UN forces. So successful is his cover, he is invaluable to the enemy and received the rank of major. However, after that, he was captured by the Americans, put on trial as a traitor and spy. Stating that he was ordered to retreat, he regretfully learns that his commander was killed, and he has no evidence or evidence of his innocence. He is convicted and sentenced to hang. However, his accusation casts doubt on Captain Young (Bradford Dillman), his prosecutor. After convincing Commander General Amos Bailey (Lloyd Nolan) of his doubts, he gets a new trial, and if found guilty, he will be executed. The drama in the courtroom is top notch, as are the actors in which Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell participate in the role of sergeant. Max Winkler Korea was a distant country, but the opportunity to denounce a communist and hang him hit very close to home in the 1950s. Thanks to the excellent script and powerful message, this drama has become a classic courtroom. Excellent viewing and recommended to all. ****
