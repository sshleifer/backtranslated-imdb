Red Eye is not the film that wins the Golden Palm, but Wes Craven has never been such a director, and his branding is a good indicator of what the viewer can expect. <Br /> <br /> The fact that Red Eye is a compact, undemanding package in 94 minutes is part of its charm and a sign of Craven’s skill in producing light but generally pleasant tickets at the box office. In fact, this is an ideal film that can be shown as entertainment in flight, attracting attention, without any intellectual or emotional problems for the viewer. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot is a stupid, vague terrorist plot. motivation and supporting characters, and the main section has the feeling of a television movie. Nevertheless, there are certain elements of Hitchcock’s uncertainty and echoes of Schumacher’s phone booth, which ultimately is a more complex (and pretentious) game with the same idea of ​​an emotional crisis that is played out in society. <br /> <br /> For a film that focuses mainly on two people sitting in airline seats, he lives or dies from the characters and the script. Ice but eloquent Jilly Rippner and resourceful Lisa Rachel McAdams Killian - the main reasons why the film is keen. Not only forcing the dialogue to lead a Zing, but also giving some dimension to the type of Adam's rib to their “male logic” battle against female “sensitivity”. <br /> <br /> In the final part of the film Craven indulges himself a little Screaming style as a man pursues a girl with a knife. The most surprising revelation here is what Brian Cox looks like after the treatment of the film “For Men Only”, his ubiquitous appearance in such diverse films as “Super Troopers”, “The Ring”, and this makes him a full version of Jude Law. <br /> /> Short fun.
