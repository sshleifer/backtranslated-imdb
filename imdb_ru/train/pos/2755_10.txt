When I first watched this film, I thought it was typical “love your neighbor” .... The more the film went on, the more I interfered with it. The actor's game is great for both actors, the direction was great, the plot was unusual. She cried my eyes for the first time in my life for the film. The present should be in any serious video library. 11 out of 10
