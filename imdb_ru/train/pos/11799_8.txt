Well-written summary of the real event! Well, actually, I wasn't there, but I think that was the way it was. I think there are two typically American points of view in the film: “communist phobia” and parallels with Adolf Hitler. This should be obvious to most independent observers. In any case, Booth shows a great game, like many other famous actors. The last twenty minutes of the film are unbearable - and I mean it! Anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal. (That's why it's so awful - it all happened, and it probably looked that way). But, in fact, did this last scene really take place at the aerodrome?
