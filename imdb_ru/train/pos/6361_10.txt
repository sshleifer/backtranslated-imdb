I was looking forward to the opening of this film for several months. Being a big fan of Jim Carrey, I easily saw how he could turn into Greench Seuss and make him his character. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure magic. Kerry is a master of his craft, and no one could play this role to perfection like him. There was a lot of fun, both for adults and for children, and this film is sure to become an eternal classic for everyone in the coming years. I already have a vision of how my little daughter sits down year after year to watch this remake on video, and I will undoubtedly watch with her and laugh as I did for the first time. <br /> <br /> Apparently In the film, Jim Carrey was written all over the place, and I don’t believe that it would have happened without him. However, the cast was charming and interesting on its own, primarily charming Taylor Momsen, who was the perfect foil for Kerry’s antics. Scenography, musical score and costumes - all this helped create a magical, fabulous finished product, and I believe that all participants can be proud of it. <br /> <br /> It’s not easy to turn a 22-minute classic into a full-length movie, but Howard succeeded with flying colors. For those critics who disagree, your hearts may be too small by 2 sizes.
