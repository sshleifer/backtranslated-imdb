In my humble opinion, this film did not receive the recognition it deserved. Robert Redford lives next to me here in Provo, Utah, in Sundance. I like most of his work, and that was my favorite. I wish more people appreciated it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read a book years before she appeared on the big screen. She let me read it after we watched the movie together. The film and the book struck my heart, and I cried for several days after watching the movie. Sometimes love is not enough for our loved ones not to harm themselves. We see this in our family relationships, but our love, our families, and their histories persist for generations. The cinematography was perfect and breathtaking - I was amazed by its beauty and how well it brought to life the words of the author of the book Norman Maclean: â€œBut when I am alone in the dim light of a canyon, the whole existence seems to disappear into the essence with my soul and memories. And the sounds of the river Big Black Leg, and the rhythm of the four graphs, and the hope that the fish will rise. In the end, all things merge into one, and the river flows through it. The river was carved by a great flood in the world and flows over rocks from the basement of time. On some stones - endless raindrops. Under the stones - the words, and some - them. I am haunted by the waters. " These words, taken from the book and uttered at the end of the film (Robert Redford, which speaks as Norman MacLean), in my opinion, are mostly sacred writing. Any possible shortcomings of the film can be overshadowed by the beauty and elegance of the plot and cinematography. It was wonderful!
