Like many pilots of the series, Dark Angel rookie shows off a mixture of great potential and a little trouble finding your own legs. Not that it was unusual anyway, but there is a feeling that it might work better if the story were drawn out and focused a little more. In today's world, where something has to catch or instantly cancel a face, the series has done some disservice without leaving at least half focused, with all the guns. <br /> <br /> Pilot for ninety minutes actually seems that two episodes are glued together, and both episodes have problems with focus. In the first half, we meet Max and tell her that she is leading. We also get some interesting procedures with Max, who uses her abilities to win bets, interact with a personal consultant or deal with colleagues' household problems. The problem here is that it is not unusual for anyone with a normal set of genes, on television or something else. <br /> <br /> When we get into the second half, we get a story with purpose and focus. Over the course of two halves, Max finds himself in the center of attention of a pirated journalist who feels that this is a vital mission - to save the world, exposing one dirty trader at a time. In the second half, the consequences are catching up with him, and Max reluctantly removes the resulting confusion. This creates the prerequisites for the rest of the series, and it works, but it doesn't quite click, if you understand my meaning. It looks like most parts are there, but the pair that makes up the full image has been omitted. Perhaps they are filled with later episodes, but this is irrelevant. The fact is that the content of this episode could be said with twenty-eight minutes less. <br /> <br /> The last minus is that many supporting actors have absolutely no sense. In particular, the original Cindy is annoying, and I doubt that this has changed over the next twenty episodes. Although acting is not as bad as day soap, it is not of such quality that I recommend it. Jessica Alba is not the worst actor in the world, but she lacks credibility when the plot needs it the least. <br /> <br /> The good news is that the premise and production values ​​are all excellent. In fact, this series was considered quite expensive in production, and it is a pity that it was canceled in order to replace it with another show that did not last a whole season. Especially when there was enough time for both shows - they could simply cancel one of the scraps of dirty garbage that they throw under the banner of a reality show. The fact is that we need more shows, such as Dark Angel, in which imagination is used to attract attention, not overestimation. <br /> <br /> In general, I gave the Dark Angel pilot seven out of ten. He never rises above the level of one-time television, and he never had the opportunity to realize the potential that he demonstrates during his work time. But there is potential, and that is often all that matters to pilots.
