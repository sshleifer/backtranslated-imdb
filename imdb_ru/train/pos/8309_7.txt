It is always a pleasant surprise when a film made for television turns out to be as interesting as Little Richard. This is a very watchable film about the history of Rock and Roller, Little Richard, played by an actor named Leon, whom I have never seen before, but which does a very good job. Like most TV movies, it's a bit more daunting than if it were made for Cinema, which is a shame, because I'm sure there is a lot that we could see about Little Richard who was controversial. Instead, we see a lot of religious trash, which is the only thing that spoils the film and ultimately messed up a very promising career. In general, this film is good, and acting is above average for a television film. 7 out of 10.
