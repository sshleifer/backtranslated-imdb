I am actually outraged by the comment I read, stating that this film was “boring,” and the beautiful landscapes were clouded by black and white frames. It was made in 1925 !!!! I think this is absolutely incredible for its time! <br /> <br /> The journey that these people had to go through is absolutely amazing. It took them a week to just cross the river. Women carried their children in heavy wooden cradles on their backs, climbing hard rock, sometimes barefoot in the snow. I would like someone to do it now! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a wonderful movie with really amazing shots and an incredible story.
