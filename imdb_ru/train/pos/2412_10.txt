I feel that Monarch Cove was one of the best “dramatic” series that have appeared on any network for a long time. This show had a lot of potential, and I couldn't wait to watch it every week. This can be turned into a great Primetime soap. People are looking forward to this type of game, because “Real-TV” is experiencing us unnecessarily. I miss the type of writing and acting that shows how Dallas, Landing Knots, Dynasty, MelRose Place, etc. Provided. Monarch Cove has updated this concept quite well, and I expected it to only get better. You can tell a lot with these characters, and they were all very interesting and exciting in their own right. It would be a loss not to explore and develop these characters after they dragged us into their world. I really enjoyed this show, because it was mysterious, interesting and sensual, not going overboard and not insulting. Loved it.
