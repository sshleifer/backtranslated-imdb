Vincent Cassel plays the role of Paul, a former prisoner assigned to an office job, where he meets Carl, the secretary who is “completely deaf” when she has hearing aids in “very deaf”. when not (played by Emmanuel Devos). Together they help each other develop as humans. <br /> <br /> What was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters ?? does not fit into obvious stereotypes. Paul looks uncomfortable in the office, isn't he just suitable for work? This faith is dispelled when he takes a job at the bar and shines. <br /> <br /> There is a certain immorality in the film, which, in my opinion, refreshes and shows how easy it is to act criminally, even if we think it is harmlessly justified. <br /> <br /> Finally, this is a film full of wonderful moments, touching and humorous. First, when Carla looks after the children and tries to console the screaming child. She keeps hugging that ?? but takes her hearing aids for her own comfort.
