An uncompromising look at the 21st century suburb in Vienna, in which the stories of six character groups of the former documentary director W. Zeidl are mixed - a provocative, minimalistic and rich cinematic film. <br /> <br /> After the worldwide spread of Big Brother's reality show, Hundstage takes modern voyeurism to an alarming, deep level. It is difficult to love, but an unsightly sample of European art cinema may seem cruel and tattered, but it still manages to convey the nihilistic alienated sense of modern society with praise. <br /> <br /> A must for lovers of world cinema.
