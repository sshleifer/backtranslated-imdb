"Young Victoria" is a beautiful film in which Queen Victoria is presented in a completely different light than everyone thinks of her. The films erase the impression “I'm not surprised” by Queen Victoria and show that she was a fun young woman. <br /> <br /> Since I love history, especially Victorian, you can imagine my reaction when I first saw this movie advertised, I was so excited and counted the days until it came to the cinema. I was a little worried that it would not be historically accurate, but it was and I liked it. I learned new facts about Queen Victoria that I didn’t know before, and that really interested me. <br /> <br /> Queen Victoria in many sources was one of our greatest monarchs of all time, and this film paints her picture of a real person and what her life was like. Her mother’s advisor, Sir John Conroy, treated her so badly because she wanted Britain to have a regency. This is what inspired Victoria to become the fantastic Queen, which she was! The romance between her and Albert was so deep, and it was very well done by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, who were both great! "Young Victoria" is a love story that is felt in the heart, but at the same time it fits perfectly into the main part of British history ... I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt about it!
