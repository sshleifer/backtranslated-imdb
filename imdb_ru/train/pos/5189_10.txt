Another masterpiece of Wu! <br /> <br /> This is the best movie ever I've ever seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except for some Hollywood moments ...). John Woo is a great director of the century. <br /> <br /> He may be no more intelligent than many of the major directors ... But he is the lyrical and spiritual idol of all people of free mind! <br /> <br /> His films love great poetry! Woo is a Shakespeare film! Wo is a Biron movie! Wu is Mozart from Blood Blood !!!! <br /> <br /> IMHO, cruel in the films of Wu - not the director's thirst for blood, but an instrument of art. Wu movie themes are more humanistic than new movies.
