When I first read the story of Armistead Maupins, I was involved in the human drama shown by Gabriel Nobody, and those for whom he cares and loves. However, we have now been given a great story for the film, and it is expected that we will see the past of Hollywood brilliance ... <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have really succeeded! <br /> <br /> With sufficient restraint, Robin Williams captures Gabriel’s fragile essence and allows us to see his struggle with trust issues both in his personal life (Jess) and in the world around him (Donna). <br /> <br /> When we get to know the players in this drama, we are reminded that nothing is as it seems, and that the slightest event can permanently change our lives. A request for a review of a book written by a young man turns into an event that changes lives, and this helps Gabriel find the strength to continue and move forward. <br /> <br /> It’s bad that most people avoid this film, I just say it because the average American will probably think: “Robin Williams is in a serious role? It didn’t work before! ”PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE CHANCE! Robin Williams is concerned with the darkness that we all must find and walk through in order to become better people. Like his film “One Hour Photo”, he became an actor and made another high-quality work of art. <br /> <br /> Yes, and before I forget, I believe that Bobby Cannaval, as Jess steals every scene he is in. The lead man of the 1940s looks and screen presence. This is a hacker opinion that he can carry his own movie right now! <br /> <br /> S ~
