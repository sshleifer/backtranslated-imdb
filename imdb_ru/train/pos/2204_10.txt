I think the film was a bit strange. At the opening of the scene a man was killed without a reason. He is not mentioned again. The special effects could have been better too, but I enjoyed watching an old horror movie. This is not the best example of a classic horror movie, but still it was a good movie. I give it about 5 out of 10 scales.
