The beauty of Clara Bow and her appeal is the main reason to watch this movie. "Hula" is not exactly on par with the best films of Clara, but still it is a pleasure. she dances, she rides a horse and pursues the man she loves. This film lasted just over an hour and was filmed by the future Oscar winner Victor Fleming (blown by the wind). The film moves fast, and Clara Bow has a lot of screen time. if you like Clara, I would recommend "hula".
