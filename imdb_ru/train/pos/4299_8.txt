In your video store you can find this gem. <br /> <br /> The human condition in our time in Los Angeles. No exaggerated drama, just dumping events that can eventually happen to any group of people. <br /> <br /> Helps you understand the joys and despair of city life. <br /> <br /> Top grade guiding and cutting. Cinematography and music follow mood and situations very strongly. AND ACTOR !!! <br /> <br /> Excellent cast and great cast. No one is relevant and not devoid of character. <br /> <br /> And this is not really as strong as you would expect. I gave it 7 out of 10. If you have not seen, DO!
