This is one of two or three of my favorite Stooges shorts, and undoubtedly the best performance of Christina McIntyre in the trio. She is good at many other shorts, but here she is absolutely brilliant. Her singing is not funny at all, in fact it is absolutely beautiful, but the plot is constructed in such a way that singing enhances humor, and does not distract from it. We listen to McIntyre singing “The Voice of Spring” at least three times, but he never gets old, partly because we do not get tired of her voice, and partly because he so well combines with the tricks of the Stoj. The use of opera soprano in a comedy resembles the role of Kitty Carlisle in the Marx Brothers film Night at the Opera, but singing here is much more of a comedy than the Opera and McIntyre (perhaps more in other performances than here) put out his own comedy talent that Carlisle never did. The cunning style of the Stooges, MacIntyre singing and a well-constructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars.
