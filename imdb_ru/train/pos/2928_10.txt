EDDIE MURPHY DELIURIUS is the funniest concert film I've ever seen. Most performances usually have lulls at some point, but not at this. For 90 minutes there is not a single moment that would not be funny. From the moment Eddie got a funny impression about Mr. T., the laughter does not stop. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was done in 1983, and Eddie didnâ€™t do anything so funny. Incredibly, the person who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show wrote a movie called HARLEM NIGHTS, which was not at all funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie, if you are there, please come back and make a concert A film in the spirit of NOBLE. Believe me, your fans will love you for it. And I think you know that.
