I really liked this movie for two reasons. First, it gives an idea of ​​the world of loyalism in northern Ireland, which is very rarely seen in films, most of which tell us about the Republican struggle. The second reason is the performances of the actors. I thought that they gave very honest and convincing images of a very sinister underworld, about which few people hear outside of my native shore. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a fascinating ganster film with star performances from “who is who” in the north Irish actors were shooting. He will not move the earth, although he may slightly open the eyes of some people to the dark world of paramilitary forces.
