Well, at first I hate to comment on this thing, but I felt that I should stand up for this film. So many people scolded him, and I felt that people who would like to see him should get a second opinion. <br /> <br /> First, bend it like Beckham is not intended for the deepest film of the century. If this is what you are looking for, go somewhere else. The fact that this is an independent film does not mean that it should be tricky. It should make you feel good, and you should enjoy watching it, and these two things are easily accomplished. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the action, although not “Halle Berry at the Monster's Ball”, is still good. The film does not need to behave honestly, so do not look for it. This is a family movie. If this is what you wanted, you would not or should not even honestly watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, he has a very nice story. I think it is well thought out and fun to watch. This is also very true for life for the most part for this culture, so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good when you're done. If you are looking for something with deeply thought-out plot lines and large dramatic scenes, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
