This is a good example of a film that, despite its low rating, is more than worth seeing. The story is fascinating, and it won't take long before the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin draws your attention. The acting is first class, and the characters are well represented. Sometimes it seems that the director cannot decide between the drama and the romantic comedy. Drawing Ben cooler from a law-abiding and shy Englishman with porn S.M. magazines, hidden in the bedroom, create a lot of moments for laughter! Like the expression in the eyes of Nicole Kidman, when she offers John his first taste of intimacy for a long time ... In other cases, the actors and especially Nicole Kidman give this comedy a very clever dramatic bias.
