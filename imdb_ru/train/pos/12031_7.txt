(ATTENTION: minor spoilers) <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon it halfway and watched from there, not knowing what it was and what the plot was. This, of course, kept my attention; Until the very end, I did not know that it was based on a true story! The guy with whom she was doing dirty things came out looking like a very nice guy who was just twisted by his dodgy girl; I have to doubt how true this image is for life. Anyone who would kill a husband and wife while they slept cannot be quite sweet. However, I had some sympathy for him, since he was created and used; about it became clear. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is the ending (here is the biggest spoiler! skip this paragraph if you don’t want to study it). A few minutes before it ended, the truth did not seem to be revealed. How it was discovered was a “sting” operation, but my question is: how did the police get convinced of this? The film did not show us this, and it seemed too convenient without explaining how they were persuaded to do it. <br /> <br /> I think how they coped with this was done for dramatic purposes, since the omission of the explanation gave an aura of uncertainty to the critical scene, which otherwise would not be there (we would already know what this scene was about and what happened to Brad in her). <br /> <Otherwise this is a pretty good movie; I give it 7/10. It made me think. Now I am interested to know the facts of the present case. <br /> <br /> One more thing: the film was shot in 1996. Some reviews seem to see it as a more recent film. <br /> <br /> PS Meadow Sisto is beautiful. I have not seen her before. She can act a little too (always a plus in her work, laughs).
