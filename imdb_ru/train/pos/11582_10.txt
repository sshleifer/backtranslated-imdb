For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror cartoon striptease, watching this movie is an exercise in nostalgia. In this context, this is wonderful, but young viewers, of course, find the comedy weak-willed and lose sight of the fact that the actors are cartoon characters. The storyline is also a bit weak for today's audience, but very well reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s. You must remember that Jane was part of the escapist fantasy of the war years, created to increase the morale of the troops. She gave double meaning to the “strip” in the cartoon “Strip.” <br /> <br /> This story echoes the tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Ryder Haggard. The topic would be familiar to readers in that era, a bunch of clumsy Nazis, upset by several equally clumsy British, and, of course, in the African jungle. <br /> <br /> For Jane fans, be sure to see. For everyone else - a wet jacket. <br /> <br />
