Wow, I really liked this movie, William H. Macy is great as the silent killer Alex. <br /> <br /> All the performances here are really good, the plot is interesting and interesting. <br /> <br /> Alex, a married killer (like his father) with a young son, is experiencing a mid-life crisis and wants to quit the family business, so he turns to a psychiatrist for help, and in this place he meets young free will spirit Sarah, in which he falls in love. One day, Alex does not know what to do when he gets a job to kill a person he knows. <br /> <br /> I recommend you watch it if you like mature interesting movies. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
