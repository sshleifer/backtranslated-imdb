I first saw this mini-series a few years ago on British television and was immediately fascinated by this story. That surprised me a lot, since I'm not a big fan of Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights; I believe that the heroine of the first was a complacent bore, and the second part was a bloated cotton. <br /> <br /> Tenant Wildfell Hall, as well as the above work, is also somewhat depressing. piecemeal. However, the darker parts of the film were offset by Helen’s excitement, the breathtaking wild and beautiful scenery of Yorkshire and Toby Stevens’s sexual magnetism. <br /> <br /> This film successfully depicts the disappointingly restrictive lifestyle of all women of that time. At best, they suffered from minor home tyranny, which was reflected in the treatment of women from the Markham family. At the other end of the scale is unfortunate Elena, who is married to a rich man of high status, but is subjected to cruelty and humiliation, alternating with long periods of neglect. She escapes and experiences a brief moment of freedom, but, being a mysterious woman living alone in the countryside, she inevitably becomes the subject of malicious gossip and speculation. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald is great because Helen Markham has been suffering for a long time. Not only incredibly beautiful (despite this terribly unflattering hairstyle) with the most amazing cheekbones, she is also more than able to play a major role in the film. Tara is worthy and alienated, while at the same time allowing us to see that Elena is still in dangerous vulnerability. Rupert Graves — the depraved but curious-looking Arthur Huntingdon — after seeing him, I could never imagine another actor playing this role. Pam Ferris deserves special mention for her role as Gilbert's condescending mother, as well as the actress who played his sister Rose, and Simon Carter, who is a gracious vicar with a taste for good things in life. Finally, I could watch this film only for Toby Stevens; he is so handsome, rude, sexy, sensitive (but not sickeningly sentimental). I'm not even sure that he is a good actor, since my hormones prevent me from objectively judging him! <br /> <br /> If there is an error in the film, then this use of memories that I felt was interrupted by the flow of the story and made it a bit confusing. Other people who watched this film with me also had problems with it, and I found that I had to explain to them that some of the scenes were actually retrospective. <br /> <br /> I am extremely grateful for the people in charge. to create this movie. I not only bought a video (a rare occurrence), but also made me buy Anna Bronte's excellent novel. Naturally, it was better than the film, but only by a small margin. I recommend everyone to watch the movie, and then read the book in that order. <br /> <br />
