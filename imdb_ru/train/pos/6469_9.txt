This is a really great shortsur from Hal Roach. This is due to two main reasons: the smallest children in a short film are among the cutest ones that have ever been in films, and there are so many funny and well-written elements in the plot. <br /> <br /> As for the smallest Little scammers, I honestly canâ€™t think of a prettier child than Spanki at the age of about four years. Despite the fact that he was a rather plump and unattractive child in recent years, he was just precious here. And the appointment of a little boy, responsible for looking after the children of even younger children, was not only amusing, but also, thanks to a good factor. <br /> <br /> After the older children blackmailed Shanki with this terrible work of caring for children, all sorts of ridiculous lawlessness. FINALLY gains control over the little ones, being the most memorable. I have not seen these shorts for decades, and I'm glad I gave it a chance.
