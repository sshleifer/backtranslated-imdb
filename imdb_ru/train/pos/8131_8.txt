<br /> <br /> If you like rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, although it’s funny if you don’t get a reference as a direct comedy. <br /> <br /> I haven’t seen much of the highly promoted CB4, but what I saw did not have the heart that this little sharmater has. <br /> <br /> Since then, no one has heard of him, which is surprising. The film is very similar to Spinal Tap, which is not so bad, and I think that many dialogues, while at Tap, are priceless, funnier, probably because I like rap more than rock theses, so my own opinion mist this point. <br /> <br /> Rap songs are funny to hell, and basically this is the place where you can watch most of the movie, but not all of them are in your face, which means physical comedy and the one-liners get priority over takeoffs. <br /> <br /> Very fun, one to watch twice, if ever there was a movie.
