The old Vaudeville team of Willy Clark (Walter Mattau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) was one of the most famous, but they broke up, hating each other. More than 20 years later, they agree to come together for special television ... but they learn that they STILL hate each other. Nephew / agent Willy (Richard Benjamin) tries to get them to work together. <br /> <br /> Great success in due time, and he got George Burns Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for me. I (several) liked it. It was written by Neil Simon, thus, his non-stop lines. Some of them were funny, but joking over Willie and Al's insanity was NO. I also never liked Mattau. I never thought he was a good actor, and something in him just rubbed me wrong. In addition, his character is so eater that you quickly get it. It was all fun. Byrnes just wonderfully breaks away from one line, and even Mattau suited him well. Their verbal battles are the best episodes of the film. In addition, Benjamin is very good as Willy's nephew, trying to get them to work with each other. For me, it's worth seeing only for Burns. This jump marked the beginning of his career, and two years later he received another hit with "Oh God." So this is good. Just good is not great. Mattau's character really makes it hard to love. I give him 7.
