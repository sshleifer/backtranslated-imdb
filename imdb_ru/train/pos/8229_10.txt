This is a rather slow film, slowly building the story of a former stripper who is starting a new family life with a complete stranger. The spectator slowly feels that something is wrong here ... <br /> <br /> I really liked this film, although at the end it leaves a bit bitter taste. It is clever, with a good pace and very well acted. Both Philip Toretton and Emmanuel Seigneur are deeply passionate about their characters. <br /> <br /> The little son Piero is also very touching. <br /> <br /> Thriller, which is not like that. A very unusual film, a very special atmosphere throughout the film, although you may feel uncomfortable several times with a couple of scenes. <br /> <br /> I will give 8/10 !!
