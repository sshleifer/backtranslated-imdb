The film was shot on location in Gerard Gardens in Liverpool, and was the UK's response to films such as The Blackboard Jungle. The film stands the test of time well, and all moral stories are still (or even more) relevant today. The film features some great performances of some famous British actors, such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Ann Haywood. Baker plays a Liverpool police officer assigned to a juvenile liaison, provided that if you catch children at an early age, they will eventually become responsible adults. <br /> <br /> Freddie Starr (Fred Fowell) and Melvin Hayes (Gloria) are among the famous roles in the film. Tsai Chin and Michael Chow are playing brother and sister (they are brother and sister in real life), who got into the arsonists network. Cai Chin is still playing, and he can be seen in Nicole Kidman’s latest film The Interpreter. <br /> <br /> On the Violent Playground playground at the school, a rifle is fired, so it is unlikely that you can watch it on TV after such events in Scotland / Russia. <br /> <br /> I lived in Gerard Gardens, where the film was shot (although I wasn’t born at the time), and I still have fond memories of this area. I recently finished a documentary about Gerard's gardens, which includes excerpts from the Violent Playground and a small British film From Coast to Coast, in which Lenny Henry and Pete Postlevate were filmed. Apartment buildings were demolished in 1987, and the films somehow retain their memory. <br /> <br /> Residents complained that the film was released due to poor light. Time has helped heal these wounds. <br /> <br /> A small film gem, I would recommend you find it.
