This film is a bit like the German film “The Endless Story”, because the child is magically transferred to a foreign country to become a hero. However, thanks to advanced modern technologies, dolls and computer graphics are used to create an amazingly realistic looking world that will amaze your socks with its realism and scale. <br /> <br /> I liked this film, but the boy was at first a chore! Unfortunately, for most Westerners, this film can be thrown very quickly or abandoned because everything in the film seems so strange. However, give it a shot. Do not think or try to understand everything that you see - just let the story unfold and you will likely like the movie. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this is exactly the kind of advice that I would give. Give adults who look at Miyazaki's "Spiritual Path" because it is very similar and contains tons of yokai (Japanese mythical spirits). The big difference between the two is that the GREAT YOKAYAN WAR is a live action, and SPIRITED AWAY is much more child friendly. Although I think that THE GREAT YOKAI WAR was conceived mainly as a children's film, in the USA most parents would not like to show this to younger children, because it is so cruel, scary and has some peculiarities in the behavior of adults. So who is the public in the West? Well, adult children and adults who appreciate foreign films with non-Western themes and compositions. This is really a rather narrow audience! <br /> <br /> While you look, look for all the strange little touches. In fact, you could watch a movie dozens of times and notice different details every time. A few funny links that I liked were a comment about Gamera, a scene that came with the comment “KIDS: don't try it at home”, and the use of Kirin beer to allow a person to see Yokai (hmm ... maybe this scene should have been contain this warning)! <br /> <br /> By the way, director Takashi Miike can hardly be called stylistically, except to say that none of his stories that I have seen seemed “normal”. Some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing, and I hated them (especially AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER), while some of them are magical among the best films I've ever seen (KATAKURIS'S HAPPINESS). One thing is certain, it’s hard to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction anyway.
