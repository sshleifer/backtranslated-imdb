In general, a good film, and better for the fact that if the film had not been shot, the story might have remained hidden to the masses. Brosnan does a good job as a Native American with a hidden past, and the photo is stunning. For some, it may be too moody, for others - boring - for me it is a gentle, well-told story, perfect for family viewing. Now it is not that you get much lately.
