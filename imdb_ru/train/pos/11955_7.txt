Allow yourself to be transported to another, old school type of storytelling. Scoop is a classic woody allen. <br /> <br /> Allen's last muse, Scarlett Johansson (who also appeared in Match Point last year, also Allen), is surprisingly able to soften her sultry sex appeal of a kitten and turn into a Normal-looking student with boring glasses and outfits, but still not able to make the audience believe in how Hugh Jackmanâ€™s arrogant character can be so impressed with her, given the origins of the royal family (don't worry, no spoilers are here). There are no grand transformations for the character Johansson, since she constantly plays the same character, despite the fact that the script says otherwise. You even forgive the obvious lack of logic of her character by continuing the affair with the suspected serial killer, simply because he is His Royal Hotness Jackman, who is refreshing to see without Wolverine. <br /> <br /> If anything, consistency is what 70-year-old Allen does. He continues to tell his stories about celluloid just as always; as if he had never encountered modern filmmaking, which probably makes his quiet, simple films attractive. It seems they never aspire to a certain market; as if Allen makes films to his taste, regardless of whether the public likes it or not.
