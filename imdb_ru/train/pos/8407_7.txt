... this is, first of all, the typical programmer of Crown International Pictures (read "passion"). The 1975 Sammy Jones hit album "Chevy Van" repeatedly sounds on the soundtrack (this film is even reissued with the title CHEVY VAN), despite the fact that the main film of the film is Dodge. Danny DeVito only appears on the screen for six minutes, but countless VHS reissues are falsely considered to be his movie star. The film is a relatively sexist story about morality - will Bobby find sexual satisfaction at one overnight stay, which his individual van facilitates, or should he wait until Tina, the girl of his dreams, gives him the time of day? Nevertheless, he is the representative of the prevailing carnal dream of American male high school students of that time, and only on this basis did VAN almost contrary to himself become an artifact of that period, which should be referred to in any honest retrospective period of popular American cinema
