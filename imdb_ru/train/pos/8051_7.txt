“One of the best early works of Hung. Humor is partly dead, as Hung tries to imitate Lee's movements and facial expressions, and also little when Hung makes fun of Drunken Master Jackie Chan. The action is also pretty good, especially when Hung takes the trio to martial arts experts at the end. It's not the best movie, but pretty good for the 70s kung fu, especially if you're a fan of Hung and / or Lee. Be careful: most videos of the Movie version are of a pretty cheesy quality. There is also a black-faced character that some people may find offensive. <br /> <br /> Sammo Hung is a rural pig who moves to Hong Kong to fight off the bad guys Sammo turns on his ruthless imitation of Bruce Lee when he fights! <br /> <br /> This film is often referred to as Bruce Lee’s “War with the Dragon” parody, but this isn’t quite so ... Sammo Rural Shepherd of Pigs - obsessed with Bruce Lee - who moves to Hong Kong to help his relatives run a small restaurant under open sky. In the new job, he is forced to protect the eatery from local gangsters in search of money for protection. When Sammo switches to battle mode, he turns on his imitation of Bruce Lee, who needs to be trusted! This film is rather messy, in many scenes of the fight Sammo fights with people who are clearly actors and not martial arts masters, and there is one character who must be black, played by an Asian man in heavy (and ridiculous) makeup. But the fact that this film lacks budget and accuracy is more than it fills in the atmosphere and energy. Highly recommended for a good mood. "
