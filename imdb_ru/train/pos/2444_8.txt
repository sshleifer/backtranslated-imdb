“GEORGE LOPEZ”, in my opinion, is an absolute classic of ABC! I have not seen every episode, but I still enjoy it. There are many episodes that I liked. One of them was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) entered the moving mechanism. If you want to know why, you should have seen it yourself. Before finishing, I would like to say that everyone always gave good results, the production design was impressive, the costumes were well thought out, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, despite the fact that you can now see new episodes, I strongly recommend that you catch it in case it goes on the air forever.
