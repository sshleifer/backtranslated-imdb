I picked up this movie based on the plot and critics' quotes on the back of the box. I am not great in foreign films, and did not know what to expect. I, too, are not indifferent to subtitles. But I really liked it! It has a simple, attractive quality that makes you feel good in life. I found myself laughing a lot. I recommend this picture to everyone, even those who hate foreign films with subtitles. It is worth the effort.
