Perhaps one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films that I have seen in the last ten years. Excellent performances (especially yiannis zouganelis is wonderful), a well-written script and effective guidance on a very special, for Greek very average standards, the author. The film is obviously influenced by Sam Pekingpach's Straw Dogs, which could have been a masterpiece if he had avoided some obvious and exaggerating situations and symbolizations at the end. Nevertheless, this film deserves our attention and belongs to the rare category of Greek films that should be watched outside of Greece. It is a shame that in Greece they did not work commercially, in addition to other fake and runaway productions, such as The Cousins ​​Politics.
