Since Douglas MacArthur influenced people's lives for the better than any other non-elected American, he deserves a better biography of the film. Not that Universal's MacArthur was bad. This is not all that was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, there was potential. Starting from the earliest episode of Star Trek, The Corbomit Maneuver (1966) and ending with the recent HBO films Something The Lord Made (2OO4) and Warm Springs (2OO5), director Joseph Sargent became one of the most directors with an expressive human role in the film, a person who is able to subtly form the emotional shades of his actors' performances and carry the audience exactly where he wants. The producer, Frank McCarthy, also gave us Patton (197O), the legendary Jerry Goldsmith won both films, and Universal widely touted the fact that the film was “four years in preparation and production.” However, for all this, "MacArthur" is perfectly adequate - and not much more. <br /> <br /> The film begins in early 1942, shortly before President Franklin D. ordered the besieged general. Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihi) flees from the Philippines to avoid capture by the Japanese. Thus, this film missed: <br /> <br /> · The birth of MacArthur in 1888 in the border barracks in Arkansas, which is still being attacked by Indian tribes, and thus proves that his remarkable life covered the distance from bows and arrows. to thermonuclear weapons; <br /> <br /> · his West Point ending is first in class 95. <br /> <br /> · how he joined his famous father, General Arthur MacArthur (who received the Medal of Honor) in the Missionary Range in civil war) on missions in Japan, China and, most importantly, in the Philippines; <br /> <br /> · his heroic feats on the excursion of Vera Cruz in 1914; <br /> <br /> · how he jumped through the trenches of the First World War, like a mountain goat, often wounded and rising with dazzling speed to a brigadier general; <br /> <br /> · his post-war service as the youngest and most progressive commandant of West Point; <br /> <br /> · his participation in the military tribunal of Billy Mitchell in 1924; <br /> <br /> · his rout of the Bonus Marshers in 1932; <br /> <br /> · his efforts to maintain an extremely under-funded army as chief of staff in the early 1930s; <br /> <br /> · his resignation from the US Army to become a field marshal (!) of the army of the Philippines; <br /> <br /> · and the renewal of his assignment by the FDR shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. <br /> <br /> All of this is omitted in favor of the lengthy shooting of MacArthur trying to fight him off. motion sickness during evacuation with the help of a boat. Thus, we know that “General Mac” is a legend, but not why; We also can not understand why the accusations of cowardice were so offensive for the "Dougout Doug" ?? and so clearly unfounded. <br /> <br /> The rest of his career is now straightforward: his jumping around the island "Hit them, where are they not" campaign, fulfill his promise to Filipinos ?? "I'll be back!" is his main achievement, conquering the world in of postwar Japan, and then disagreements with President Harry Truman (a truly courageous Ed Flanders) over the Korean conflict, which led to his outright shooting and, finally, his proclamation to Congress that “old soldiers just disappear”, after which he did just that. All of them are quite historical. Accurately accurate, and all presented with a deliberate lack of commentary. <br /> <br /> Sargent and producers almost painfully distance themselves from decorating historical records with their own approval or disapproval: if MacArthur’s actions seem noble, let them be presented as such ; if they seem selfish or pompous, let these concepts be recorded without comment.Since Joe Sargent is quite adept at fine manipulating the reactions of his audience - again, see Worm Springs - this one tkaz comment seems quite deliberate. Historically, this can be commendable, but it almost negates the viewer's efforts to put this extraordinary person in any rational perspective. <br /> <br /> And finally, something like “done cheaply”. The feeling for the film, like for “Midway”, was released at about the same time. Both films were transmitted to the directors of "television" - in this case, Sargent, Jack Smythe on "Midway", and both have the appearance created for television. Even the march of Jerry Goldsmith, although he is perfect for work, lacks the subtle nuances and grandeur of his Patton theme — just another way to perpetuate a man who transcends life with a very ordinary film. <br /> <br /> There was vanity and pettiness in this man, no doubt; there was also greatness and love him or hate him, you need to recognize the fact that MacArthur did what no military commander did before him: he won the world. <br /> <br /> In the end, “MacArthur” “Like many other film biographies” is a good place to start exploring this wonderful person, but a bad place to complete it.
