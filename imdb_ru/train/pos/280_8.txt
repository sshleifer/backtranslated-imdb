Undying is a very good game that brings new elements to the weary first-person action genre. He tells the story of Patrick Galloway, an expert in occultism and a formidable warrior whom a friend summoned to his estate in Ireland to investigate some strange Finomenes. The game takes place in Ireland after the First World War, so do not expect to find weapons such as chainguns or rocket launchers. All weapons in the game can be considered antiques, but the real pleasure in the game is the spells and the system on which they work. Our hero is ambitious, so he can use both hands at the same time: he reads spells with his right hand and uses a weapon with his left. So you can shoot and cast spells at the same time, which, as you understand, is very funny and also unique to this game! The graphics are gorgeous, and it can work very well on medium P.C. power. The design level is also cool and atmospheric. Basically, the game revolves around the Covenant Manor and the mansion, but there are many other locations awaiting discovery as you progress. Thanks to the talent of Clive Barker, the game has an excellent storyline and plot (something very rare for a first-person shooter), and I said that in front of a great and very creepy atmosphere, the voice acting is also good, but not great. But the game has two major drawbacks. Firstly, itâ€™s rather linear, so when your mission, for example, says that you go to this room, all the doors in the house will be locked, except for those that lead to the room of your mission, it can save time, but it limits your freedom. research. Secondly, the fact that all weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high-tech weapons. As for difficulty, the game is very well balanced. Most of them are medium difficulty, but sometimes it becomes more difficult, but not difficult. In general, the immortal is a great game. Definitely one of the best fps out there.
