Indian summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I found it funny, warming, and absolutely loved it! Anyone who went to camp as a child and sometimes would like to return to “Olya's good days” for a short time really should see it! It begins like 20 years later, a group of old tourists returns for "reunion". I will no longer comment on the plot, because you have to see it yourself. The actors were great, and it has all the stars. Everyone played an amazing role in this. You really felt like you were part of a movie watching him. Alan Arkin was especially good in his role as Uncle Lou. He plays the kind of guy that everyone would like to have in his life. It is also a good family movie for the most part. I would like to offer it to someone in an instant! Highly recommended!
