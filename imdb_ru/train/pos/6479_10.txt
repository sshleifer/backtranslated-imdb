This is a fantastic series first. It is very well done and very interesting. As a huge fan of World War II, I learned a lot before I saw this show. One of the best things that it has for this is all interviews with past people when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, comparatively speaking, this is so. Nothing contradicts the men you meet in today's programs, just the fact that most of these people were not really involved in the higher echelons of what was happening then. One of the best parts is the story of Sir Lawrence Oliver. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about World War II, but actually thinks that only mortals (for example, I) will want to buy it or watch it several times. My only real complaint about the entire series is that some facts are not as accurate as we now know. Moreover, information about the Soviet Union is exaggerated or simply inaccurate in some places. This information is now different, which we now know because of the collapse of the USSR. In general, a fascinating look at the Second World War, which should be seen by any serious historian of the Second World War, professional or personal.
