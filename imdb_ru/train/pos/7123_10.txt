Sometimes I watch a movie and am really impressed with it ?? and yet it is not easy to explain why I liked it so much. Is this basically true for unusual films ?? those that can hardly be compared with the rest. Good night, Mr. Tom, one of these special films. Is there a lot of emotion in this movie? and the game was so good that while watching the movie I cried and laughed as the story went on. Young Nick Robinson is a young boy (William) who was evacuated from London because of air strikes there during World War II. Mr. Tom, played by John Tau, is an old man leaving the village where the evacuees were sent. <br /> <br /> At first, Tom refuses to take on any responsibilities — for example, to care for a restless young guy but accepts, as he remained without choice. During his stay, Mr. Tom discovers how terrible life was for William. next to the luggage, his mother sent a belt and instructions to the owner of her son ?? feel free to use it. Is this belt berry in the field ?? will never be used in such a cruel manner. Mr. Tom provides William with a real home, and the boy is happy with his new life, he goes to school, makes new friends and discovers hidden talents. All of a sudden, a letter from William calls home to London with a letter that mentions that she is not feeling well and that everything starts all over again. only this time it gets much worse ?? Are there many feelings you can feel in this movie? love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope ?? and much more. Good night, Mr. Tom - another masterpiece of British cinema, comparable only with such as Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot ?? if you compare. I really enjoyed watching and highly recommend it. Before concluding this review, I would also like to point out Thomas Orange’s magnificent performance in the role of Zack. reminded me of my friend from my childhood (:
