The Hanson brothers - Andy (obviously, he acts together) and Hank (obviously, does not act together) need money. Andy comes up with a scheme to get a dough that will have implications for the whole Hanson family. <br /> <br /> This film brings results. This is a multi-layered, full-blooded hill that knows exactly what it does. As a crime drama / thriller, I would gladly compare it with “There is no country for old people”. While both films have an adequate supply of drama and thrills, “The Devil” is more on the side of the thriller due to its fast pace. “No Country” is a colder and darker film that you can really admire, while “Devil” is a bit more enjoyable. There is definitely less violence in The Devil than in No Country. Acting also delivers. Ethan Hawke, sometimes wooden in the past, brings trembling, sweating, and deer stare in the headlights to besieged Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman, like Andy, has the hardest scenes in the film, and he quickly becomes an actor who you think can do anything. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing special. He jumps back and forth without tangling. Events go out of control, but the film never goes out - the script (from Kelly Masterson's first timer), the direction (veteran Sidney Lumet) and the editing remain as tense as the drum. In many categories, this material is of a premium caliber, although perhaps films such as "The Departed" and "No Country" have pushed this film out of the spotlight. If you like these, you will like it.
