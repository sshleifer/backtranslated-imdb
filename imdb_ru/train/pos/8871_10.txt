It was a great movie with a lot of hidden problems. This concerned the problems of racism and class. But it also contained a message that you should know yourself and take responsibility for yourself. This film was very deep, he made it clear that you and only you can control your destiny. It also showed that knowing yourself and feeling comfortable is the only way you can fit into society. What others think of you is not important. I believe that this film showed it beautifully. The actors, I think, were able to perfectly convey each character. I just thought it was amazing how deep this film was. Just by looking at the look, you will not see the depth of the film, but with a further look you will see the underlining meaning of the film.
