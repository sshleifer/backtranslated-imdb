You know the story - a group of brave hopeless participants takes part in the contest, which, apparently, has no chance of winning - this is the story that was made to death by Hollywood (Bring It On, The Karate Kid, Escape to Victory, Best of the Best and ect. D.) Now in Korea there is a taekwondo team that is fighting for fame ?? and guess what ?? the result is predictable, but ultimately satisfactory. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film does not look indifferent depends on a talented young actor who really makes you take care of the characters, and this in turn keeps you looking to the end. <br /> <br /> Fans of your typical martial arts movie may be disappointed ?? Taekwondo does not deliver the usual movement and acrobatics, which can be seen in most Kung Fu movies; The action is limited (albeit impressive) by kicks and a random kick. It does not matter, since it is the interaction of the characters and their struggle that do something for themselves that makes this film a success.
