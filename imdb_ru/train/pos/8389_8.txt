This is the best of 43 films shot by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; his most successful at least. He was one of the leading directors in New Germany after World War II. <br /> <br /> Hannah Shigulla was great because the cold, calculating Maria Bruan, who lost her husband in the war, found him after she took the American soldier as a lover, lost him again after he went to prison for her, and found him at the end. Her one and a half day of marriage before his disappearance was longer than their joint pastime. <br /> <br /> This is life. Things come and go, and you do everything you can. You can give up or change your mindset to survive. Despite the fact that Maria changed her thinking and did what she had to do, she never stopped loving Hermann, which leads to such a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Great drama.
