Cliffhanger is a worthy adventure crime with some flaws from director Renny Harlin, whose remarkable work on the film is about a mountain climber who was taken hostage along with a friend from a gang of dangerous criminals in search of lawsuits full of stolen money rocky mountains. Sylvester Stallone is impressive, as Gabe Walker is an experienced climber, especially in the sequence of actions / battles, but some of them definitely border on the line of unreality. For the sake of the film, although I am ready to suspend my disbelief. The remaining actors, including John Lithgow, Michael Rucker, Janine Turner, Rex Lynn, Caroline Goodall and Leon, are respectable characters in the film. The action / combat sequences are well executed, but, as mentioned earlier, some are not very realistic, no matter how cool you are. However, the sequence of ascents is very well done, because instead of shooting the entire film in the studio, the places they chose seem very real, and Arielâ€™s view of the mountain ranges is amazing, adding a touch of reality to the movie. Death is inventive, while others are predictable. The villains are solid, but it would be better if they focused on the more central, and not on many of them. The course of the film was a bit slow, but the good outweighs the bad. If you are a big fan of Harlins or Stallone, most likely you will also like it. In general, Cliffhanger has a character development with enough actions, drama, some tension, excitement, thrills and good performances from the actors who make this film worth watching.
