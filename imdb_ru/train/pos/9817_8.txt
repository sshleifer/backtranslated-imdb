I remember this movie. Pretty intense for an 11 year old. Good editing, I felt terrible for the St. Bernard. I would watch it again if it were relayed, but the signal is transmitted by Pluto when I write it. Robert Culp The highlight of his career. I'm just glad I didn't live in the area. Oh, those 70s. What a decade. If they remade it, I bet it would be very cruel and bloody. So what are they waiting for? Great movie for pre-flight suburban boys. It was very intense. I think it was filmed in Los Angeles. Of course, not made in Lodi New Jersey. The St. Bernard photo was the best and obviously the most obsessive image from the movie ... and then they left the corpse on the porch. Rotten children.
