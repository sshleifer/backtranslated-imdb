Dragon Hunters must be the best animated film I've ever seen. It was awesome. The film tells about a pair of robbers in search of money, their strange fluffy blue dog who writes fire, and the girl who dreams of becoming a knight, and they are sent in search to go to the ends of the world to kill the Gobler world, an incredibly huge dragon. But honestly, it doesn't even matter what the film is about. Because it's awesome. Gravity in this fantasy world is different, so architectural blocks and spheres of the earth hover around cathedrals, castles and villages, and forests of floating lilies hover around. The world is so creative, so extraordinarily beautiful, with some muffled story. The world looks like a set of magnificent paintings. Monsters are also visually stunning, like a fire dragon consisting of a swarm of evil red bats. Part of the plot is not too original, as, for example, the main characters who want to have their farm in the spirit of "Mouse and People" and it seems that they can never create it in the world; but great graphics, some ominous scenes and an emotive dialogue make this film exciting.
