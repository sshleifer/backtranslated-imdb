I have no words to describe how good this film is. Only a genius like Amrita Pritam could write such a real depiction of the days of separation. The film haunted me for many days. <br /> <br /> Urmila played the role of her life in this film. She put life in the role of Puroo, and Manoj Vajpai played no less in his role as Rashid. It is difficult to imagine anyone other than these two playing the role of Puroo and Rashid. The Punjabi costumes looked so natural on Urmil, and Manoj looked like a natural Punjab Mussalmaan. <br /> <br /> Sandhali Sinha as Lajo and Suri as Ramchand did an incredible job. Priyanshu Chattarji did a great job as Trilok. <br /> <br /> Some scenes you just can not get out of my head. When Puroo first meets Lajo, you have tears in your eyes. The climax is just a killer. I expected a tragic finale, but fortunately, it was wonderful. <br /> <br /> This film falls into the same category as Pakes, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras, etc. Do not miss.
