I like the films of Ralph Bakshi (“Wizards”, “Cool World” and the Undervalued Animated “Lord of the Rings”), I am a collector and a fan of Frank Frazetta. I am also a fan of sword and witchcraft who loves the worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. <br /> <br /> I missed the theatrical release of Fire and Ice in 1983 and I was looking forward to seeing it on video or some kind of animation since then. Therefore, the release of 2005 was a dream for me. Nevertheless, I bought it with some trepidation, because I hoped that it was worth not only seeing it once, and then putting it on the shelf as “collector” dust until the day I died. Fortunately, my fears were groundless, and I was pleasantly impressed by this film. <br /> <br /> As with the Frazetta art, this is a sandy film with physicality and sexuality that is difficult to find in most fantasy / swords and magic films without being cheesy or dirty. Art is good, and you see Frazetta glimpses at its best. Even my young boys loved to watch it with me and asked to watch it again and again. However, my wife has some objections because of the poorly dressed princess (very Frazetta-esquire). I do not mind this, because it is plausible, and there is no sex scene. <br /> <br /> Rotoscoping is used, but I personally like rotoscoping. It gives smoother and more realistic movements to characters that are hard to find in animation. <br /> <br /> Despite some problems with continuity, I recommend this film to everyone in Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan, as well as to lovers of sword and magic. Enjoy!
