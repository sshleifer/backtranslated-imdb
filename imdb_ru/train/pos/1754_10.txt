This film starts at a 15-second mark and continues throughout the entire film. I can't remember the scene where I didn't turn to look at people laughing with me. he is the perfect actor for this roll because of how he looks and how he is dressed. <br /> <br /> The comedy episodes were great to see them not very big and popular actors. As you can see, people like this movie, currently it is estimated at 7.9 on IMDb. I think it should be at 250. Let's just say I have not seen such a funny movie since the days of the American pie or vacation. look if you want to laugh. I give this film the two biggest toes I have ever given since I found out about IMDb, a great movie site.
