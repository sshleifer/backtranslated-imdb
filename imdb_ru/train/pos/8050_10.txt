The most clever fat man in martial arts does it again. In Sammo's early film, in which he imitates the hero of his character Bruce Lee, Sammo is strikingly similar to Lee in his actions and battles. The way he immerses himself in Bruceâ€™s style, and then returns to his more familiar kung-fu, is a joy to see and show how perfect he is and adapt in his art. Add a little humor to the farce, so beloved by this film, and this film that has it all - comedy (unintentional, for example, fake black guy), an action movie and incredible battle scenes. <br /> <br /> An excellent film about beer and friends, which is worth an hour and a half someone's time.
