I thought this movie was fantastic. It was fun. Something reminded me of a spinal cannon. This is a must see for any 70s rock fan. (I hope that my friends and I haven't been able to do this for twenty years!) <br /> <br /> Bill Nighy does an excellent job with the role of the vocalist who is trying to regain this old spirit, <br /> <br /> Stephen Rea is excellent fits into a movie like glue trying to keep a group together, but not successful. <br /> <br /> If you love music and have ever been in a band, this film is definitely for you, you will not regret seeing this film. I know not. Even my family was funny, and that says something.
