<br /> <br /> There is a canon STAR TREK - there is a lot of it. From the canon we know the history of the future. Advances in technology, events, places, first contacts with new creatures, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE largely ignores most of Canon ST. Unfortunate fact for serious fans. As one, I assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of TOS and retro from there, but no. <br /> <br /> Phase pistols, like most technologies, look much more modern than TOS. I expected to see the old Starfleet laser gun in the old style, the slow effect of transfer of speckle-gold. In addition, I did not expect to hear sound effects based on a pure sound signal, similar to TNG, but far from TOS sound effects. <br /> <br /> In the earliest form of TOS (initial pilot: CAGE), we see Starfleet with a more formal military aspect — a bit of an old earth fleet. With ENTERPRISE, we see a shocking disregard of rank. The STAR BLAZERS cartoon has more military code than ENTERPRISE. <br /> <br /> It is good that Captain Archer is unsure of the needs of the Universe (unlike Kirk, who never lacked confidence in his application of human justice). ), but inside ENTERPRISE everyone seems to be equal. Unprofessional, insecure, more distant from the sensation of formal military service than in any ST series - and that says a lot! <br /> <br /> A casual song that opens country music foreshadows the family’s journey, not the adventures of an important major warship. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE is likely to show us a mostly fun, fuzzy study of human relationships, and will not lead us into a historical, bold, hard, and sophisticated exploration of space. <br /> <br /> I would choose Adrian Paul to play Captain, and the older one - the doctor. However, I liked the actors for the most part. Linda Park, an outstanding ballroom dancer from Boston College, will undoubtedly develop well. The characters that make up the team seem thoughtfully created. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE starts working harder than in the previous three STAR TREK series. Let's hope for a good future!
