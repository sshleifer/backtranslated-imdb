I donâ€™t often give a film or a show of ten, but this show touched my nerves like no other show. I found the entire series on mysoju.com and thought that the room looked interesting, so I looked at what to see. I was not disappointed with what I saw; I was touched. This story remains on the tender side, as the main characters move us through the scenes. Sumire Iwaya, thoughtfully played by Koyuki, shows us human nature, because she wants the problems not to be shown. No one really wants to spread his soul in front of a promising partner. So instead, she replaces the person played by charming Matsumoto June as a pet. This pet, like any other creature that we consider to be a pet. Differences; he can take revenge in the same way, because Momo is a man, not a dog. Because he is treated like a pet, he reacts to situations like a dog can react. She spends time with a new guy, Momo becomes jealous. When she realizes that her pet is not just a pet, the sexual tension between them starts to get stronger - Momo - the dance prodigy. Her thinking slowly changes when we begin to look at his own thoughts. Matsumoto leads us from seeing a character that is very one-dimensional at first, to two-dimensional, when we see him as a dancer, to a three-dimensional character, when we see that he begins to fall in love with his master as a person, and not as a dog. In my opinion, it is worth looking at this story to see the development of this character. Besides, Matsumoto plays Momo with such tenderness that you almost start to want her to be with you. Nobody wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but how does Momo say (the name she gives him, how can you call them a new puppy) ?? we both knew that it could not last long. Watch this show with an open heart, it's worth it.
