This film is so misunderstood that not even funny. If you think to see it on the set ... stay away. This concerns the consequences and injuries that survivors must survive. Even detectives are looking for an answer that we all do ... WHY? The fantastic game of the two leading ladies, when we see how those we ignore are influenced by the very things we are exposed to. Yes, the language is sometimes harsh, but it suits the characters well. There are some loose ends, left or unanswered, but all films have them. The main problems are considered, and this film tells how all of us adults feel after such serious incidents. Highly recommended for teens and adults.
