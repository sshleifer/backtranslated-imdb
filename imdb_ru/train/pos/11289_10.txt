There is something surprising in the fact that the film, shot in 1934, may be a head taller than every Tarzan film that followed him, including Greystock's bloated and boring film of the 1980s. As soon as the viewer passes the first three scenes, which are admittedly boring, Tarzan and his assistant take off like a shot, offering non-stop action, humor and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful, like Jane, and leaves with the film. Weismyuller is also solid. Highly recommended.
