Street Fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. This is not a movie that you just watch for fun. This is not a very pleasant experience, although there are moments of laughter in it. This is a movie that you watch when you need food for thought. <br /> <br /> To say that this film is just racism is to completely miss the point. This is not only a satire of "Songs of the South", but also a sharp commentary on the prejudices that Americans still have in society. Each ethnic group depicted in the film is shown as grotesque caricatures of their stereotypes, which, in turn, are grotesque caricatures of real people. With this wild exaggeration, the director shows how absurd these really tough beliefs are. <br /> <br /> If you're the kind of person who is willing to recognize the ugliness of common prejudices that American culture still maintains, and if you are not afraid to look your prejudices in the face, this film may be for you.
