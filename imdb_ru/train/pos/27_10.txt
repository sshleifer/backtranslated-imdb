"The Red Queen kills seven times" (1972) Emilio Mirallo is perhaps the most perfect example of hyallo that I have ever seen, mixing all the necessary elements into one sinister stew. First of all, and this is of paramount importance to me, it has a complex, tortuous plot, which ultimately makes sense, and the killer here does not go completely out of the left margin at the end. The story of a series of horrific murders (you already know how much of the film’s title, right?), Which takes place in the seemingly fulfilling ancient prophecy about the two sisters, is an engaging one, and the killer, dressed in a red cloak, is crazy and crazy at once and memorable. Every great performer needs some great lead actresses, and here we have a whole assortment headed by ridiculously beautiful Barbara Bush as one of her two sisters and in one of her earlier roles, Sybil Dunning, as a lascivious vagabond at Barbara's fashion house, Other Necessary a component of superior hyallo is a memorable, humble account, and Bruno Nikolai offers it for this film, which should stay with you for a few days. Magnificent scenery? Check again. Filmed mainly in Würzburg, Germany, the picture is really pleasing to the eye. Good, good, but what about these murders? In the end, isn't that what gialli is all about? Well, I'm glad to say that most viewers should be completely satisfied with the various knives, shootouts, punctures and other battles that this film tastefully draws ... not to mention crypts, a bizarre sequence of dreams, rats and bats (and Their a lot too!), Drug references, a scene of rape, a mandatory red herring and, in the person of Ugo Pagliai, a wild leader for female viewers. As I said, perfect hyallo. And even better, this DVD is from great people from No Shame, and you know what that means: a great print and lots of extras to download! Thank you, guys!
