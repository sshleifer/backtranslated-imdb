This is a great series. You will laugh, you will cry, these wonderful people will become part of your family. The way this family cares about each other and helps each other in a crisis is a great example of how we should live. There are many good things they do and many bad decisions, but they never turn away from the family, they work through problems. Michelle, youngest daughter, is the sweetest thing I have seen. Stephanie, the middle daughter, suffers from the middle child's syndrome, and with the help of EVERYONE in the family is better. DJ, the eldest daughter, is growing regardless of whether her father wants it or not. One thing they all share, they miss their mom. Danny (dad), Joey and Uncle Jessie are very fond of these children, and this is evident in every episode.
