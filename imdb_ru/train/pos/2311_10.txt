Reese Witherspoon's first film. Loved it. The plot and acting was top notch. You are emotionally connected with the characters. In my opinion, you need to look. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie you will understand why Reese Witherspoonâ€™s acting career was so successful. <br /> <br /> Other actors also did a great job. <br /> <br /> The film flows very well. There is no boring moment in the whole picture. The man at the length of the moon is just right. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, I think this film was excellent. I have seen it many times and enjoyed every single viewing.
