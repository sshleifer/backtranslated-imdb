*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Directed by Richard Shepard. <br /> <br /> A well-articulated plot and film put together, Brosnan was never better in a movie role than his Bond films. After 2004, "After Dusk" his new role brings laughter and a wonderful time. A professional bounty hunter, so to speak, Julian Noble at work in Mexico City ultimately meets the exact opposite of high-ranking businessman Danny Wright (Kinnear, perhaps one of his best roles) who also works there. Two screen duets create a funny, funny riot and do not give a laugh. Davis in one of his best roles since American Splendor gives another charming and witty performance. One of the most enjoyable and best films of the year. My final rating is 9/10
