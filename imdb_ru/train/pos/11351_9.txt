A great movie. The whole picture was shot in Budapest, so I feel proud. My small problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the Hungarian State Railways (M√ÅV), and it is clear that they were used on a large train, not on the local railway - according to the story Chikatilo picked up in his victim local railway stations. In addition, the film is great.
