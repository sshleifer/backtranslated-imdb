I watched SHORE LEAVE the other day. I have seen it so many times, and I never get tired of it. Oddly enough, every time I watch it lately, it brings me back to the very first time I saw it. Including this time. It must be a sense of mystery and "What's going on here?" about it. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, one part of the story that ALWAYS felt embarrassed and uncomfortable for me, this time, in fact, had a HUGE effect on me - Ruth. I think that in many ways it was Gerald Fried's account. A real masterpiece! The romantic part was reused - much more widely - in THIS PARTY OF THE RIA. But, of course, it debuted here. I have the impression that of all the girls that Kirk has known over the years, she may have been “the sweetest.” When she said, “Do you have to go?” In combination with music, I really felt the pain that she must have felt when she couldn’t make him stay with her. <br /> <br /> Someone commented online that Ruth looked older than he, but she didn’t have to grow old at all in 15 years.

Considering how much attention Dr. McCoy threw at her, this is another disappointing example of a potentially good character who appears once and then never appears again! Shish. <br /> <br /> Of the last few things I’ve watched that snuck up here, lacked one thing: Spock smiled. He was! I saw him. I really prefer to know that there are 2 sides I am all the time inside rather than in this "sunken" business. When he said, "Enjoy, sir." at the beginning you could see that it was not just his address to the senior officer, but a conversation with his friend. And at the end, when he unnecessarily says: “It is completely illogical!”, I can not help but think that he is doing this solely to cause a reaction. Perhaps he does not smile or laugh, but I think he likes to see his teammates happy.
