In October 1945, a descendant of American German Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrives in post-war Frankfurt, and his bitter uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Yaregord) takes a job on the Zentrop railway line as a sleeper of a sleeping car, traveling in a train, learning his profession , he sees the destroyed occupied Germany and meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukova), daughter of the former influential transport business owner and Zentropa owner Max Hartmann (Jørgen Renberg). Leopold remains neutral between the Allied forces and the Germans and learns that there is a terrorist group called "werewolves" who kill sympathizers with the Allies and carry out subversive actions against the allied forces. He falls in love with Katharine, and earlier she reveals that she was a "werewolf." When Max commits suicide, Leopold is also subjected to pressure from the "Werewolves", and he needs to take a position and make a decision. <br /> <br /> “Europe” is Kafkan’s impressive and painful story about the great Danish director Lars von Trier. Using an expressionist style reminiscent of Fritz Lang and alternating magnificent black and white cinematography with some color details, this film reveals a difficult period of Germany and some of the problems faced by this great nation after the defeat in the war. Very impressive is the actions of the occupying forces, destroying resources that may allow a faster reconstruction of the destroyed country, and corruption with a Jew, who must identify Max. Jean-Marc Barr has an amazing role in the role of a man who wants to maintain neutrality, but he is manipulated everywhere. The hypnotic narration about Max Von Sydow is another touch of class in this award-winning film. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Europe"
