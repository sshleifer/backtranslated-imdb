Super Speedway makes an excellent demonstration of your new DVD / big screen / 5.1-channel sound system. The IMAX camera puts you right in the race car, where you travel along various tracks at high speed, recalling the sequence of races in the Grand Prix (if only it would appear on DVD!). I like to watch it again and again. <br /> <br /> The only minus and why I didnâ€™t give him 10, is that some sequences of movements look suspicious, as if the film was accelerated. The soundtrack also requires some suspension of disbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine. You will not hear the buzz when you go under the bridges.
