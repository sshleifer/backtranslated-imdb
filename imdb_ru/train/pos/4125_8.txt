I loved watching Sea Hunt that day, I studied at the gymnasium and came home to do my homework, and by 4:30 I would be ready to watch Sea Hunt and Mike Nelson in his underwater adventures. I like it ! He took you a place, not very accessible at that time, under the great blue sea. Before the Thunder Ball, or even before Cousteau became commonplace, Mike Nelson ignited the imagination of children. I would be willing to bet that more than a few children have developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences from watching this show. Underwater photography also progressed, the exploration hobby is easily stimulated through watching this show. Watch and enjoy !!!
