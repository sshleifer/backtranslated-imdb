This is an interesting look at the gospel presented by Johnny Cash (in black, of course) who sings a lot and also tells a little. If you like Johnny Cash, this movie is pretty enjoyable. Also notice the bright image of Jesus in this work ... just for fun, try to think of five Jewish men who have blond hair ...? Anyway, this is a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all.
