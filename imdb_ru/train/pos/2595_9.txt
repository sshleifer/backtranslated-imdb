The brilliant adaptation of mainly the inner monologues of Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom to Joseph Strick in the re-creation of the amazing portrait of Dublin on June 16, 1904 - Blooms Day - the day to be celebrated - a two-man intended! Director Bravo Strick, screenwriter Haynes, as well as director and filmmaker in the creation of this masterpiece. Günther Grass’s novel The Tin Drum, filmed by Volker Schlendorf (1979), is another excellent film adaptation of an internal monologue, which I positively compare with Strick's film. <br /> <br /> Although the original novel has clearly recognizable sights in Dublin and there are also recognizable characters in the film, albeit with different names in the novel. For example, Buck Mulligan, with whom Dedalus lives, turns out to be a famous Dublin surgeon. <br /> <br /> This film, despite its superiority, was made even richer due to the additional views. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@aol.com June 15, 2008
