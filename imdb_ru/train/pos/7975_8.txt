I just love Malle documentaries. They are so light and simple, but still so exciting. I have no idea why this documentary works. It's about Glencoe, Minnesota. 5000 people live there, and nothing happens, really. But still, Malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting. His love for humanity, even for racists or homophobes, is so overwhelming that you just can't help falling in love with them. <br /> <br /> Mallet directed most of this film in 1979. He returned after 6 years to see what has changed. It would be a good movie without material 6 years later, but this small addition makes it great. It may seem that Malle was just doing what was done in the Up series, but in fact it is not. Up series about people. Malle does not focus so much on what happened to each person, but on what happened to this community. And the change is great. 1985 - Reagan's era, and farmers suffer. Once a proud community, now no one sees a great future at all, and parents hope that their children will learn and do something other than farming. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very relevant today. Our financial crises started today because of what happened then. Just take a look at these final words in the film, uttered by a senior lawyer from the city (in 1985): <br /> <br /> “Well, I have high hopes for this country because everything is going right. Now I can only describe it like an obsession with greed. And the nation does not live long with this obsession. And especially democracy, which ... There is good - there is good - there are many good things in this country and many good people, and they are not going to - they will not subscribe to this philosophy of greed that is happening now. It's terrible. ”Unfortunately, it took more than 20 years and a hell of a headache before this happened.
