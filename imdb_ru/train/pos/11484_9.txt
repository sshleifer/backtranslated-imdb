I just came back from the Zero Day's Montreal premiere ... and I'm damn surprised to find a negative commentary on the film. In fact, the fault lies in the fact that Kochchio makes an easy and undervalued social message ... well, Mr. I-reviewer, this is a simple and undervalued critic of films with a social charge. <br /> <br /> Not that I want to show my life here, but I'm from a small town with a similar school than these guys. Reject and ignorance in the menu. The fact is ... I understand how you can make young children do such a horror. High schools have become a battleground of conformity. This is really a terrible sight. You need to get through to become like others. It is difficult to explain, but many people do not understand that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence. In the meantime, parents close their eyes and smile at how beautiful their life is in their comfortable suburb. <br /> <br /> The real motive of the film is not what motivates them. We are talking about this, like a peaceful suburb of death, and everyone closes their eyes and try to create the atmosphere of an ideal city. Cal expressed it well. This is a wake-up call. Drama is everywhere, and it can take any form. In this case, small dramas (for example, Andre, who is called a fag on the shirt J.C Penny) turn into the worst nightmare of the whole city. Andre & Cal chose the most extreme way to express their pain. The disease of disagreement in an era when you need more than ever to be like others to be accepted. <br /> <br /> I especially like the last scenes where some guys burn Andre and Kala crosses, for example, if with the pain they reported, Cal & Andre reported their blind rage to the community, their refusal to think about the reasons for some action. <br /> <br /> This may seem aggressive, like in a movie, but Kochchio meditates more than he whines or denounces. The fact that Andre and Cal live is a reality ... and terrible, which can get to other children. <br /> <br /> Anxious movie ... A homely creation and a strong feeling made Ben Kochchio shoot a very disturbing movie.
