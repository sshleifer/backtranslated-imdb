I have not seen the movie with Nolte, which I did not like. However, as they say, he shot a lot of films, and I saw only a few. In my imagination, I store the images of his performance here and in the “Thin Red Line”. Nolte has a full range of acting talent. When it is necessary to shout, he roars like a wounded lion. His best moments are those that I appreciate in the actors: when he simply expresses emotions through gestures on his face, hands and body, without saying anything. Having concluded that our current generation of actors, by and large, has no assessment of what an actor can do, not to mention, without having any conscious assessment of Keaton and Chaplin’s skills, this generation of actors rely too heavily on the mechanical magic of computers. Of course, this is also just a sign of the time in which we live. If Chaplin lived in our time ... who knows, he might as well have become a fan of CGI tools. <br /> <br /> I did not read the novel of Vonnegut from which this film comes to the screen. However, the plot is not so far-fetched and confused that we cannot follow the intended path, even with all its surprises. Of course, from the very beginning it seems ridiculous. However, this is also not impossible. <br /> <br /> Think about it for a start: a spy in the center of the Third Reich: he has the extraordinary life of Fritz Kolbe, America’s most important spy in the Second World War from Delattra and Prichard (look at Amazon for more details). Think: undercover history: piercing the Reich: American spies in Nazi Germany DVD (I saw it here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=75054) seems to be the production of a story channel. <br /> <br /> So, funny story? Thoughtfully yes, impossible, no. Back to the plot. The character Nolte is recruited and takes on an incredibly dangerous mission, and, unfortunately, the script does not give us enough reason why he agrees. Was it a type of passivity when he was dragged into this role, as they say, because it was the best story he ever wrote, and he got the role? It’s hard to imagine any of us understand. But it was an unusual time, and people did extraordinary things. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the whole cast is excellent, and, as people say, Alan Arkin, always fantastic, is very good in a small film. Role. <br /> <br /> I was shocked by the end of the film (no, I won’t spoil it), and it made me feel horror at the choice. Did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had said all that was necessary, and that there would still be chapters added to a life already filled with many burned pages? It is hard to say, but it is really amazing. <br /> <br /> Nolte gives one of the best performances you can expect .... The premises of the film make you think about many things. It is very interesting and defiant. What wonderful movies should be. A little long, but worth it. By the way, the film’s music has choices from one of the best living composers: Arvo Party.
