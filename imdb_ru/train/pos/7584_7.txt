This production of PM Entertainment is riddled with enough bullets for John Wu to say: “Enough!” Of course, this is not as beautiful as Wu can do, but in 90 minutes he does his exploitative work. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is an undercover cop in the near future. When his wife is substituted for killing the governor by a group using a cyborg like him, Eric must clear her name. Wilson performs the duties of Van Damme when he plays the heroic leadership and his evil cyborg counterpart. Why the Academy did not pay attention to it, I can not do it. Being in PM manufacturing, there are plenty of car chases, blasting machines (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And shooting out. I especially liked the van that turns over in the air even before it approached the touch of an exploding truck. My other favorite episode is a neighbor girl who came up to perfect karate in Don's simulator. This is just a chance to show some cheap effects of LAWNMOWER MAN around 1995.
