I first watched this film when I was a child, and this is the only case in my life that I remember when I looked with horror at my hands and face in one particular scene. I remembered it again with a misunderstanding with my university friends and immediately bought it on video with a great hesitation that I could add (to my surprise, I found it only on the Internet in the States when it was done in England!) again my reaction and my surprise were almost the same from horror and fear, and my heart never beat so much. In my opinion, this is the MOST TERRIBLE movie ever made, Hollywood movies seem tame by comparison, and a little Pony and Trap (shit), sorry for the pun. What is surprising is the strength of this film, and at the university, when I watched it with my twenty colleagues, I never heard so many screams guys! Even watching this video makes me fear of God in front of this particular scene and leaves me with the feeling that I will never go alone in the dark again !!!!
