One night I stumbled upon this at the satellite station Bravo. At first out of curiosity, I decided to watch it. To be completely honest, I was not disappointed. The main character is beautiful, and her body is clearly visible. You would think about her talents. would have been wasted as a hangman, but apparently not after watching the whole movie! My only real nuisance is the cast, in particular the cast that plays Melnik. Christ is bad! Prison guard Hank is terrible too. get drunk and make bad attempts to get into his co-guard Vande, although fortunately for us, the viewer, and for Hank he falls and is dirty with Vanda at the end. The music used is quite intense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the performance. This movie looks good alone for a beautiful, talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas
