This is all the more aggravated when the widowed husband uses the killer to assist Colombo in his investigations: a feature that facilitates many good quality scenes, especially in the first sequence, when the three central characters and the extremely deceptive qualities of Colombo meet are obvious evidence. <br /> <br /> Directed by Bernard L. Kowalski with a talent and acted at a proper high level, this really set the tone for the entire series (since “Killing by the Book” was disappointed with a bad ending). The script by the creators of Columbo Richard Levinson and William Link is accurate, well-structured and well thought out and based on a steady, productive pace and meaningful sequences that truly demonstrate the unpredictability of history.
