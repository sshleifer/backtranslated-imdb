I liked this movie much more than anything made me expect; Reading here other comments, I suspect that it is extremely useful for viewing on a full-sized screen in a movie in the company of a cheerful and enthusiastic audience. I was lucky that I got this experience, experienced a wave of laughter from all sides and had a very good time with this unpretentious comedy. <br /> <br /> Because it's like a comedy that shines, if it shines anywhere at all. There is nothing special about music - in fact, I didn’t realize that it * was * a musical, and I was very surprised when the ancestors gathered broke into half-spoken lyrics - but I have to admit that this half-threat, half-promise “Oh, what will I do ... ”turned out to be much more catchy than it seemed at the time, as it is still circling in my head! <br /> <br /> The plot thus, it largely revolves around the past history of the same name by Francesca, a portrait of the sixteenth century with a clearly anachronistic hairstyle and a fur coat. Her idea of ​​the sanctity of marriage does not quite coincide with the idea of ​​her distant descendants, Countess Angelina, and it is almost audible how the plotline creaks at the seams under the onslaught of the Production Code to ensure that the heroine arrives unspotted in her very late marriage bed with a suitable man. . <br /> <br /> The novel is hardly stunning, and in fact the first few scenes, played quite well, are tiring. But where the script and film really come to life is the battle of the sexes that follows it. The insolence of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in courting married Angelina Betty Grable equals only the pursuit of Betty-Grable-as-Franceschi, in turn, culminating in a complete change of roles in the fun fantasy sequence, where she literally sweeps away his legs. This is probably the comic climax of the plot, although the consequences of the colonel’s understandable confusion are worked out with a deft touch of the remaining two “acts” of the operetta structure, and the spectacle of Fairbanks’s blissful, stunned awakening is worth more or less the admission itself. <br /> <br /> Grable is completely convincing in creating two of her contrasting characters, wisely receives almost all (limited) chances of singing and shares honors where dialogue meets in various verbal fights. But in the area of ​​unspoken reaction, she is indeed surpassed by her leadership males; In particular, Fairbanks is an absolute pleasure in a series of wordless episodes, whose settings and humor are worthy of a silent screen. <br /> <br /> This film is too uneven in style to be classic, in contrast to the glittering reper in tedious boredom. But at best, it is really very funny and caused spontaneous applause and laughter in the hall at the end, when the lights came on. Perhaps, not keeping pace with the times, he was unable to attract a modern audience, but at this show it really didn’t deserve to deny Grable and Preminger, the (uncredited) director. This is not a masterpiece, but a very interesting background work, and I, for example, smirked, remembering all the way home.
