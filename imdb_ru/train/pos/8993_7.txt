Rock and roll is a dirty business and a DiG! demonstrates it masterfully. The creator of serious ambitions and, perhaps, reckless actions, the creator of the film is able to combine the seven turbulent years of following two cumbersome rock bands. At the same time, the abundance of quality material ensures the film's ability to captivate the audience. If you have ever been interested in any area of ​​the music industry, this film will undoubtedly be an exciting viewing experience. The music in the film, although it suffers minimally from the required cut-and-paste, is worth one price per entry. the morning after I saw DIG! I went straight to the record store to get the Brian Jonestown Massacre album (I was already accustomed to the sounds of Dandy Warhols). The film, primarily determined by the study of rock music, succeeds at other deep levels. Dig the ground! This is a sincere and fairly objective view of the destructive and changeable nature of the creative process and the people who are trying to destroy these forces.
