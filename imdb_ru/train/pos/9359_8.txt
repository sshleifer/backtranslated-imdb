The feeling of this film was awesome. The speech of Adam Sandler was very inspiring. Since he played a very timid and fragile character, he used his abilities to the very edge and really worked on this role. His character was really interesting. I can see how I am reading the script for this film and not as interested in this role as Sandler. For someone who plays mostly comedic roles, he played a major role with what seemed to be his own quirks and contributions. I especially liked the scene in which the characters of Adam and Dona rode on a motorized scooter through the city. I got acquainted with the moment, because it seemed that Don had witnessed what Adam was doing to get away from it all. With his video games, music, and many other things that he does so that he does not think about the past, riding a scooter with headphones seemed a salvation from his thoughts. This movie is definitely worth seeing.
