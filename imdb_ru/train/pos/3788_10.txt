This movie is great. This is real and to the depths of the soul, but at the same time completely insane. It's easy to fall in love with heroes, because they have so many different minds, but each of us can refer at least to. In Canada, we donâ€™t have so many films from Eastern Europe, and for the few I have seen, Loners is one of the best. It is very funny and magical. If you want to see something new and refreshing, go to Loners.
