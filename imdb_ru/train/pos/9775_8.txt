“Tears of Kali” is an original but imperfect horror film, which tells about a cult group in India consisting of German psychologists who learned to control their will and their body to such an extent that they can force others to “heal” through radical methods. (which can cause nightmarish hallucinations and physical pain and torture) to free the restraining demons inside them. <br /> <br /> The film is shown as a series of vignettes about the Taylor-Ericsson group - the aforementioned cult group. The first segment is somewhat slower than the rest, but it is great for creating the background for the rest of the film. Everything else unfolds as mindf @ ck, in which some basic clips are added to the mix (full frontal nudity, some blood) to make you happy. <br /> <br /> I say check it out. It may not be impressive, but his concept is pretty neat, and it delivers in the right places. 8/10.
