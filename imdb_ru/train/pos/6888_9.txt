I watch movies on life, choosing which ones are good enough for distribution ... Throwing aside those that don't make the cut. I'm not saying that I know more than anyone else, based on this, I just lead you to how I came to see "The Gospel of Lou" ... In any case ... So many bad films fall on my the table and I actually sit through all of them. In fact, I don't “watch” everything, usually I just watch TV from time to time while I work in scanning to evaluate performance, productivity and how well the story is told. If something catches my eye, I will find the time to watch it. “Lou” attracted me for the first few minutes when I closed my laptop and turned the chair over to the TV so I could fully tune myself. Needless to say, I was delighted throughout the entire film. The story is told well, the characters are either cute or repulsive (depending, of course, on the actor and the director's intention of the character), and they are all very well played. Sometimes I noticed occasional amateurish errors in working with the camera and editing, but the emotional nature of the story makes it easy to eliminate these shortcomings. I heard the comments of other people that sometimes the film caused tears in their eyes, and sometimes - strong delight ... I laughed one minute and cried the next, and this film was incredibly touched. Unfortunately, I could not get it, because I, as they say, was a week late, and the dollar was short. Sometimes it happens ... but at least I had the pleasure of seeing this one, and I can't wait to see what kind of answer he gets. Good luck and good luck to you, Bret Carr (if you read this), you are, without a doubt, a talent to follow.
