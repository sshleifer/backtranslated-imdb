“American in Paris” is an integrated musical, meaning that songs and dances blend perfectly with history. The film was inspired by the 1928 George Gershwin orchestral composition. <br /> <br /> The story of the film is interspersed with dance numbers stopping the show, staged by Gene Kelly and putting on popular Gershwin melodies. Songs and music include “I Got Rhythm,” “Great,” and “Our Love Is Here to Stay.” This set a new standard for a subgenre known as the musical “songbook” with dozens of Gershwin melodies buried in underscore. The climax is the ballet “American in Paris”, an 18-minute dance with Kelly and Caron, staged at the play “American in Paris” by Gershwin, depicting an impressionistic period dream in the style of different artists, one of the longest continuous dance sequences of any Hollywood film. Ballet alone was worth more than half a million dollars, a staggering amount at the time. <br /> <br /> It's funny to think that such a work of art is born above a pool game between director Arthur Freed (SINGIN '). In the rain, the Wizard of Oz, on the City, Meet me in St. Louis and the Wagon) and Ira Gershwin. It was Fried’s idea to buy the title so that he could use the idea in the film about Paris and Gershwin that he would only use Gershwin’s music. <br /> <br /> Sid Charisse was supposed to be in the original cast, but she found herself pregnant. before the shooting started. The main reason that Gene Kelly suggested Leslie Caron as the main role was that he felt that this film needed a “real” French girl playing Lisa, and not just an American actress playing one of them. Gene Kelly discovered Leslie Caron while on holiday in Paris, where he saw her ballet performance. When the audition was called, she said: “Who is Gene Kelly?” According to Leslie Caron, her opening dance sequence, which included a seductive dance with a chair, was recognized by some censors to be too suggestive. Gene Kelly shot short fantasy dance episodes, shown as Lisa. <br /> <br /> Vincente Minnelli first sought out Maurice Chevalier in the party of Georges Getari, and Celeste Holm as Nina Foch. <Br /> <br /> Minnelli was the pioneering director of the musicals Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), American in Paris and The Band Wagon (1953). He used color and songs as they had not used them before. He used space and time creatively. Best of all, however, he allowed himself to free himself from the long ballet episodes that end all of his films. The ballet "American in Paris" may be his best work. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Vincent Minnelli is considered the only director, he is sometimes associated with a divorce from Judy Garland and other directorial projects, leaving Gene Kelly to take on leadership responsibilities. <br /> <br /> Among other important points: the execution by Guberial of “Stairs to Heaven”; Oscar Levant's fantasy about the staging and performance of Gershwin's "Concerto in F" (see Why he was a favorite of Oscar Levant.) <br /> <br /> Ballet sequence, now that we know that he was successful, now everyone wants Fried, Minnelli, Kelly, but before the film was finished, MGM’s New York office refused to spend half a million dollars on the ballet. Thus, Fried went to studio head Louis B. Meier and made him agree. New York said no. Finally, Gene Kelly showed the New York office how the British film THE RED SHOES used a long ballet sequence, and did this film become a world hit ?? and is still considered the best example of a successful feature film. Well, the financial guys finally gave up and signed the checks. <br /> <br /> After November 1, 1950, there was a break in production, after which Gene Kelly began to rehearse ballet choreography. By the time the production for this final sequence resumed on December 6th, Vincente Minnelli had finished directing another film, The Little Father's Dividend (1951). <br /> <br /> Irene Sharaff developed a style for each of the sets of ballet episodes, reflecting various French impressionist artists: “Raoul Dufy” (Place de la Concorde), Edouard Manet (flower market), Maurice Utrillo (Parisian street) , Henri Rousseau (Fair), Vincent van Gogh (Place de l Opera, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (Moulin Rouge). It took six weeks to create the backgrounds, and 30 artists worked without interruption. <br /> <br /> Roger Ebert said after seeing the recent restoration: “The American in Paris has many qualities, not least his famous ballet a stop, with Kelly and Leslie Caron, symbolizing the whole story of their courtship in dance. ”“ American in Paris ”is often compared to“ SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN ”, in which it sounds like the greatest musical, and one critic expressed it best when he said: “SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN” makes me happy, and “American In Paris” makes me feel good. "The ballet represents Kelly's fantasies depicted by great French artists (Renoir, Rousseau, Lautrec, Dufy) whom he admires. Having organized a film viewing for the then patient Raoul Dufy, the actor and producer dodged to the end of the film. There, with relief, they found the artist, agitated to tears, asking for a second aid for the luxurious finale. <br /> <br /> The film was also the first to receive the Golden Globe award for the best film (comedy or musical). .) This year, Gene Kelly received the Academy Award for "his versatility as an actor, singer, director and dancer, and, in particular, for his brilliant achievements in the art of choreography in cinema." It was his only Oscar.
