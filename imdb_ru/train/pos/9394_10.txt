Red Rock West was far and away one of the best suspense thrillers of the 90s with an excellent script (John and Rick Dahl), which kept you guessing in everything and on the edge of your place for most of the movie. It was brilliantly directed by John Dahl and featured an amazing cast, including Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and especially J.T. Walsh (in an unforgettable performance) making this thrilling and exciting thriller that you can't miss. The film has never been very popular with the release (in fact, I first learned about it on television), and therefore it is one of those special little gems that you should look for, but this unique film is now gradually gaining momentum. <Br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams, who has no job when he finds himself in the small town of Red Rock. Mistakenly mistaken for a contract killer named Lyle of Dallas, he is shocked by the offer of $ 10,000 for the murder of the wife of the owner of the bar, Wayne Brown (excellent J. T. Walsh). He plays along with the plan and decides that he should go and warn Brown's wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle), but then the plot thickens and so many turns, surprises and double actions arise that Cage moves from one crisis to another. and is trapped in a terrible situation from which he cannot pull himself out! Then, in order to further complicate the situation, a real Lyle appears to perform a contract killing (in which everyone's favorite heavy Dennis Hopper plays). When Hopper finds out what happened, he follows Cage, but no one could have foreseen the amazing events that followed. <br /> <br /> Some favorite lines from the film: <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage (Lara Flynn Boyle): “I don’t want to see how an innocent woman gets hurt, but it's a terrible lot of money.” <br /> <br /> J. T. Walsh (Cage): “Michael Williams. Well, Michael, you are going to spend some time with us until we figure it out. ” <br /> <br /> Boyle (Kage): “You're not a killer?” Cage: “That's right, no. But the guy I just had to go to the city, so you need to get out of here. ” <br /> <br /> Boyle (Kage): “Well, how are you? are you going to explain how to impersonate an assassin and take away $ 10,000 from my husband? ". <br /> <br /> An unusually interesting little thriller (only 98 minutes) with a storyline that never fades and a powerful game of all the main roles. Any film with the participation of J.T. Walsh is OK in my book "Red Rock West" and was one of his best. What a pity that the career of this exceptional actor was tragically cut short by a heart attack in 1998. The most fruitful period for the film "Noir" was without doubt the fortieth year, but “Red Rock West” is a good modern example of the genre and got right into my “top ten” favorite movies of all time. I’m not Patience waiting for more from director John Dahl. 10/10. Clive Roberts. <br /> <br />
