Dick Tracy is one of my favorite films of all time. I have to admit to those who have not seen it. You will either really love it or really hate it. It came out a year after the success of Batman. So all expectations were so high that many were disappointed simply because the plot was very simple. But it is based on a comic book ... what did you expect? Creatively this movie is awesome! Scenes, make-up, music, costumes and an impressive game make this movie fantastic. In the film, bloodless cruelty and foul language are a rarity these days. Directed, produced, and stars Warren Beatty as an ace crime fighter, rising against the evil Big Caprice of the Boy Al Pacino and his crowd of thugs. Madonna steals the show as a seductive lifeless Mahoney. This is one of the best characters of Madonna. She has the best liners that I heard! Madonna fans will love this! One of the coolest things in the film is that they used only seven colors to make it look like a comic. This film is truly a work of art that, unfortunately, is ignored by the public. To summarize, this film reveals a child in all of us. This is a movie that will make you smile at the end.
