I don’t know which movie some of these people watched, but they must have seen “Joseph Smith: The Prophet of the Restoration,” different from the one I saw. <br /> <br /> I think both films were well-made and inspiring. I think it is definitely worth seeing. From the outset, it is obvious that much attention was invested in the creation of this film. The background scenery is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I think the film shows well how Joseph Smith is both a man and a prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are depicted with taste and reverence. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend watching this movie.
