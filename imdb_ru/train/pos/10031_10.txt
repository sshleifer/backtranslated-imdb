I used to write that I love Titanic, I cried after it ended (many times), and I am a guy in his 60s. I also wondered why this wonderful film, which won so many awards and applauded so many critics, was rated only 7.0 by imdb.com users. <br /> <br /> Well, I looked at the breakdown of user ratings. While 29.0% of all votes gave it a rating of 10, 10.7% gave a rating of 1. These 10.7% of these irrational IMDB users, in fact, lowered the overall rating to 7.0. <br /> <br /> In my previous comments I blamed this very unusual voting model (a sudden jump in 1 rating with a high rating of 10, falling only gradually, and then suddenly changing course and jumping at the level of 1 rating) only about one thing: hate to Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I set up enough chat rooms to see the banter of young people (mostly young people) who defamed him left and right. They absolutely hate this person and will not be involved in giving him credit in the Titanic. (To answer to another user: I am NOT talking about someone who really doesnâ€™t like the film very much and gave him 5 or 6, etc. Everyone has and has the right to his taste. But no one can convince me that that an imdb rating of just 7.0 points for Titanic, which reached this level due to an excessive amount of ridiculous ratings 1, is a good reflection of the overall moving picture.> Let me show my point by comparing the Titanic users voting scheme on imdb with 5 randomly selected box office and to iticheskimi "bombs" (they are much more, but these 5 will confirm my point of view). "Heavenly Gate" (1980) were quickly removed from the cinema after a very bad box office, and imdb voter ratings were: 23.2% of 10 ratings and 9 2% 1 ratings (overall rating 6.1). "Big Top Pee-wee" (1988) received 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating 4.5). "People-cats" ( 1982) received 6.1% of 10 ratings and 2.6% of 1 rating (total rating of 5.8). Blind Date (1987) received 3.0% of 10 ratings and 2.8% of 1 rating (overall rating of 5, 3). Jumpin 'Jack Flash (1986) received 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating 5.2). WHAT ALL THESE FILMS COMMUNICATE WITH TITANIUM? ALL PERCENT THEM 1 RATING BELOW !!!! THAN TITANIC, AND ANY OF THE PRESENT, has never been nominated for one award. Again, the Titanic received a 10.7% 1 rating! Compare this to the other 5 films that I just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Can there be any explanation other than hatred of Leo factor? <br /> <br />
