This is one of Sammo's best early comedy films. This is not a parody of the entrance to the dragon, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and very strangely imitates him for a man of his height. Nominal story of how his struggle continues to cause trouble to his relatives, and then - the fight. Oh, a fight. Good, fast-paced scenes with a strong impact (the white guy who plays the boxer looks like he really hurts from one of Sammo's punches). <br /> <br /> The funny thing about this movie was purely unintentional. There is a guy who looks like Jim Kelly (one of three experts hired to kill Sammo), but he was a Chinese man with a black face and an African wig. C'mon, in 1978 there were no real blacks in Hong Kong? Well, I think I have seen enough white “Chinese people” with fake features in old American films. <br /> <br /> This is one of them for any Sammo or Bruce Lee fan.
