This film is Evil Breed: the legend of samhain contains very little thought or effort. This is ridiculed with the specifications for superfast death in the slasher style and the simple abominable acts of death. Acting was rated as D, because the actors show very little ability, and their stupidity in the film is too dubious. The way they portrayed people of their own ages was incredibly different. The odd split of porn is fit in the thought that it does not really offer much, and any area that is respectable, but rather quickly run down with an absolute gut painful death. An example is the poor fellow who has an anus removed from his face, and the scene lasts about 5 minutes. Itâ€™s scary how little children quarrel. This film is a good choice for those who like to watch horrible deaths and almost torture.
