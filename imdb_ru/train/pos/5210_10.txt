It is a pity that she did not receive recognition on the screen, she certainly did the best work in the film: “The Girl on the Cross”, the best part of the film. She had a far greater impact than Avril or anyone else in the film. She almost made S / M look like fun! She really had a believable S / M model that is afraid of her situation. Although they seem to have really spoiled such a dreamy feeling that they were looking for a bad guy, these sets were very well built, but they just seemed to slide on the surface of what was shot. This is one film in which both cuts should be available. It seems that they put aside much of what was filmed, and almost all of the really dark things that would make the film much more insane. It seems that they stopped at the mark, which went during the filming. What was shot would not have received a rating of R, probably NC-17 or X, but this is what is needed for the film to turn out the way it should be.
