“The Man in the White Suit” is one of those delightful comedies that Ealing studied so well in the 40-50s. A plot of this follows a man who invents a fabric that does not get dirty and does not break. Of course, this is a huge breakthrough in the world of textiles. However, things are not so simple, as the fabric will threaten the lifestyle of many people, including fabric manufacturers, the work force of the factory and even the old woman who wipes it every week. “A man in a white suit” is a film about scientific achievements and how they do not always help; as the old woman once said in the film: “Why can't you, scientists, just leave everything alone?” <br /> <br /> As in many of Ealing's comedies, Sir Alec Guinness is in this film. Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor; he has the ability to light up the screen with his presence (and he does it in this film, literally), but he also manages to portray his characters in a mundane and believable way. He is creepy enough in this film, and he captures only the atmosphere suitable for his character; intelligent and ambitious, but slightly naive scientist. Along with Guinness, the movie “The Man in the White Suit” also features Joan Greenwood, a deep-voiced actress who played the lead role with Guinness in the simply divine Good Hearts and Coronets, and Michael Gough, who will play the role of himself. Alfred in the movies of Batman. The acting role in the film is not always great, but it is always decent, and it goes well with the film. <br /> <br /> “A man in a white suit” is a clever, thoughtful and witty comedy with a moral one. Comedy is not always obvious, and it does not always work, but the film should not be a film that causes laughter in the stomach, so this is excusable. I recommend this movie, mainly to anyone who loves movies.
