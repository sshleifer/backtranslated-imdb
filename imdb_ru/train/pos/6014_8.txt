All reviews about how much ZP lacks the plot, acting, orgy scenes, and so on. Everyone misses the point. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest. This is a film shot in turbulent times of the late 1960s and early 1970s in Los Angeles. This is a movie intended to be watched while you are in your mind because of some psychedelic substance. <br /> <br /> Find some bud and smoke, or get a slight acid bump. Seriously, these direct and sober reviews of the ZP miss the point. You can not get anything from this movie in direct mood. <br /> <br /> Until you watched this movie on the big screen (which, fortunately, I did three times in the 1990s, when ZP was quite rare), when you left the game, you have no idea what is this movie about. <br /> <br /> If you insist on not being intoxicated, you can at least appreciate the finale when the shit explodes before the soundtrack to Pink Floyd's wonderful rework “Be careful with this ax, Eugene” "Come to number 51, your time is up."
