When I first saw this film, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what caught my attention first. I was expecting a grand celebration, but instead I had to watch a very clever killer mess with my head on the frightening soundtrack (in fact, this is my call at the moment: P). The fact that I could not predict when he would kill, and when he would disappear, was a major plus in my book. Predictable horror movies fed up with me. Now, I know there were some discrepancies in the storyline, but if you are like me, you wonâ€™t even notice them until the movie is over and you are lying in bed, tormented by the fact that you just became witness the masterpiece movement. Finally, as I said, the soundtrack is timeless. This is one of my favorite theater productions, so I was very happy to hear that Rob Zombie leaves him untouched in his remake. Speaking of the remake, I read a very complete article about it, and now that I know that Mr. Zombie respects John Carpenter, I have high hopes for his taking this classic. This film is great for any occasion when you crave for tingling in the spine, but this is the perfect complement, newcomer, final, you name it for All Hallow's Marathon Eve. :)
