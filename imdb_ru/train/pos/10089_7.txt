In the end, not one elephant is shown dead during the film; it is not even meant that anyone was hurt. On the contrary, the owner of ELEPHANT, John Wiley (Peter Finch), complains that he cannot shoot any of the thick-skinned animals - no matter how threatening - without government permission (and his tone says that such permissions are not limits kingdom of probability). In addition, elements of the conspiracy — in the form of an unusual drought and an epidemic of human cholera — leave the home of the Vili plantation vulnerable to the complete destruction of people by elephants (as the locals call them) to close the story. If you are lucky enough to see the current version of EARTH, you will find that Elephant People live worse today.
