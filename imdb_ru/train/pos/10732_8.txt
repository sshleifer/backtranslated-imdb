I could see that this movie is super. He didnâ€™t surprise himself when it happened for the truth, thus, in itself, as he flew to someone who had no place, but this is just such a conspiratorial theory, Right? <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie when I was a kid. It is interesting to me that it would be so if it turned out that such a flight did indeed take place, of course, for him it was not for the faith, because it denies logic and common sense. Who in their right mind sent the children from a spacecraft to orbit. I enjoy reading on the subject, American and Soviet space programs. I know that several missions of space shuttles remained provided by the CIA with the TOP SECRET clause, of course, this is only my reasoning, but who knows?
