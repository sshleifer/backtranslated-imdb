I just saw The Drugs Years on VH1, and I like it. I think this reflects the history of drugs very well, and most importantly, it is a strong message to all generations. There is a forest, there are deaths of Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison, there are many examples of drug use and addiction. It fully covers the time frame and evolution of drug use in America in both good and bad ways. In my opinion, this documentary is well made, and I would like to congratulate its creators, because this is exactly what it takes to play on television these days. I'm waiting for the DVD. You must see this !!! This movie is awesome - BIG TIME!
