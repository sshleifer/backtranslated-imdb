I believe that now JEDI is chronologically considered the “latest” record in the popular saga, and this is very good, as are some of them. I liked how this sequel appeared immediately after “EMPIRE”, and I appreciated the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character (and also Mark Hamill as an actor). Having heard so many negative words about the Ewoks, they were not so bad. I liked the exciting chase in the forest, and I felt that there were many well-realized emotions in this chapter. The ending (I suppose, with some new additions) successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful fairy tale about fantasy. I know that many of the true Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for the changes he made in the original films, but, being quite a newcomer to these films, quite late and not missing what I did not know, I think he made these 6 films work perfectly as one. Oh, and, uh ... Carrie Fisher looked quite adorable in her meager outfit.
