BEWARE SPOILERS. This film was fine. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the best at it. Okay, the stupid foreign guy who (SPOILER HERE) trades with the biker for his clothes was funny. This guy's boss was good too. But the film really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn. These two had to have much more time on screen together. They were great with chemistry. Bathroom scene - WOW! Romantic, sweet, tasty. <br /> <br /> Hawn is a stupid cocktail waitress who rescues a foreigner and finds herself in the White House in the middle of a conspiracy because of the greed of politicians. Talking about Sarandon means giving a lot. SPOILERS This is a rather atypical romantic / political comedy, and it satisfies both sides - the political side is much more than the romantic one. It involves political issues and almost does not affect the romantic areas. <br /> <br />
