The film has a great (albeit crude and rude) humanity for its entire vicious face - the lightning / lyrical evaluation points to the comic side of their misadventures, and even when they are at their own cutthroat (like terrorism is a woman in a train). ), a half-century vulnerability is never hidden far away (Dewaere sucks her breast like a baby). Blir detached from the scene where Depardieu might be going to rape Devera, so we are never sure how to explicitly read the clearly homoerotic aspect of their relationship - in any case, this incident is the beginning of their relative humanization (so the film could, of course, need to read how pro-gay, although you can probably read it as a pro-whatever you want). There are many unpleasant scenes and moments of sexual politics in the film, and it is probably best seen as a general caricature of the weaknesses of both sexes, mocking the whole concept of sensitivity and honesty and hitting numerous points of possible depth on the grounds that if you shoot enough shots, some of them will fall.
