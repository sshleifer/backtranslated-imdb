This is a stunning classic monster from the 50s! I just adore the look of the 50s in general, like cars and music. In any case, I like what a drop looks like. I love it when everyone is in the late night horror film in the theater, and the baby enters and destroys the party. Another thing I like is that everything happens overnight, just like Halloween II. <br /> <br /> When Steve and Jane understand, they see a meteor falling from space. Inside the meteor is a drop. Whenever a drop absorbs a person, it becomes more and more. They try to convince the inhabitants of the city about the monster, but no one believes them until late. Can anything stop this plump creature? I highly recommend the BLOCK !!!
