A tidy “race against time” premise is that dead John Doe has a pneumonic plague, so although the health authorities and the NOPD are fighting everyone and each other trying to find his contacts on the quay, the killers think the fever is because the infected cousin of the victim keeps on them <br /> <br /> This film is freely available in the online archive and is worth downloading.

Of this film was made in the original places of New Orleans, which makes it interesting to consider what is now part of the period, although for me it looks underexposed, even for noir - maybe then mobile lighting installations are not what they are. There are also a lot of background noise that distracts a little - car honks in the love scene, anyone? There are a lot of non-professional support artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pace of the film sags a little - there is not much chance of repetition or replay, although it is worth holding on to the last chase. With the main actors, too, there are not so many problems: Jack Palance is truly frightening as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath - a later scene when he alternately comforts and threatens his sick cousin, stunning, while Widmark, as he often did, throws righteous anger. on a mission on a plausible level - most of the time. <br /> <br /> Someone has to redo it - no supernatural, no mysticism, no special effects, just good yarn, full of character conflict, and a hot topic. Another reviewer mentioned writer John F. Kennedy O'Toole, and this is precisely related to the number of strange New Orleans types that permeate this grim, sloppy, round-the-clock drama. There is even a small newspaper seller. <br /> <br /> "Community? What community? How do you think you live in the Middle Ages?"
