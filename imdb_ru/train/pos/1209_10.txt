In an era of such horrible cartoons, I was rather shocked that a movie with such good morals got into the bottom IMDB list for animated films. <br /> <br /> This film contradicts the first one. I will not deny it. However, when I was in the target age group for this film, I didn’t even notice, and it wouldn’t matter if I did. People who did this may have used the “New Generation” to notice that this is another way the Care Bear family could start. Perhaps we ourselves should decide how the Care Bear family really originated. <br /> <br /> It was my favorite movie at the age of 3-6 years, and he did not frighten me at all or embarrassed me. <Br /> <br />
