"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best films of the 80s shot by John Hughes. Everything happens in the world of chewing gum color, where everything is attractive, there are some easily resolved conflicts that sometimes distract from the mostly happy process, and a huge number of scenes are summed up by montages tuned to vigorous pop melodies. There is nothing wrong. “Bend It Like Beckham” is an absolute pleasure from beginning to end. My wife and I were completely obsessed with the game of cornball, even when we laughed at it, and at the end, ashamed to admit, we applauded (and we saw it, by the way, in our life room, not in the theater). Watch this movie and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
