When I first got my N64, when I was five or six years old, I fell in love with it, and my first game was Super Mario 64. And I liked it! The graphics were great for their time, a good storyline, great courses and above everything, the best music I heard in the Nintendo game. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t remember the story completely, but I think Princess Peach was abducted by Bowser, and Mario must save her. The game is to get 120 stars from the curses at the castle. Each had about five or six calls to get stars. There are separate parts of the castle where you can get more stars. But, of course, you beat Bowser. * I think there are three levels to beat Bowser on * Let's start with the characters. Mario is the main character, and he receives helpful advice from Toad, so he is basically one of your only alliances. I heard that Luigi and Yoshi are in the game near the end. The main villain is Bowser, and there are a bunch of other characters like Boo and Gumba. The characters are really great. <br /> <br /> Next, how about people say that gameplay is more important than graphics, and I totally agree. But with its great plot, there is great graphics. Especially for this time. I have a variety of other Nintendo games, such as 007, and their graphics do not compare with Super Mario. Bright colors, great effects and amazing sound effects. I found the graphics on the waterways very very good. In addition to the Bowser world, it has the best graphics in the game. <br /> <br /> Now the music. This is my favorite part of the game. When I played as a child, I happily left the game all night so that the music would put me to sleep. Especially the music from Jolly Roger Bay, which was peaceful and wonderful. There are others who are also great, especially in the worlds with Bowser, which hold me the most and are my favorites. <br /> <br /> This game was my favorite past as a developmental gamer, and I like it. This game gets 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) PLAY TO THE GAME!
