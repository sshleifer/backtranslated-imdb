After watching “Marriage to the Mafia,” I almost lost faith in the Korean film business. But it returned my faith. <br /> <br /> The main character, a university student, is forced to train a pampered, rich but charismatic high school boy. He is actually the age of the female character. After a few funny quarrels, the two eventually became great friends. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised that rookie Kwan-san Wu did his job with excellence. He was such a revelation !! Actress Kim ha-nul was also charming as usual. <br /> <br /> In this film, we tried our best to avoid the clichés that can be seen in typical romantic comedies. And it did not show us unnecessary nudes, sex scenes. It was gorgeous, sweet, fresh, made me want to see it again. <br /> <br />
