I saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and there was no dry eye in the house. It's incredible to see not only that a great man, Darius, but also how amazing the rest of the team is at such a young age. <br /> <br /> It also made me think about how disgusting MTV was and how they were given the opportunity to engage and inspire positively, they refused. Shows whether they really care about young people and their viewers. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful and warming true story ... take your cloths, but it's nice to see how caring and inspiring modern youth can be.
