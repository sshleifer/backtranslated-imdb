I really liked this movie. Of course, the idea pretty much exists ... the federal government is organizing the implantation of a tracking device into the little thief's jaw to lure a more dangerous thief / computer hacker from cover. But Alvin Sanders, the man whom the feds "volunteered" to implant the device, is a very likeable person, and it turns out that he is very pleased to reflect a little with him. Alvin even ends up being much bigger than a good-natured, but passive or one-dimensional character, when he shows that they are not as easy to manipulate as it may seem. Definitely worth a look.
