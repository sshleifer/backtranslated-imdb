Let's face it: the final season (# 8) was one of the worst seasons in any show that I ever liked (basically, I never met dry spells to last a whole season). But if you judge this show from last season, of course, it will look worse. This is a completely unfair assessment, because the Show of the 70s at one time was a brilliant and cheerful sitcom about a bygone era and that the people who lived there were not as different as we are here in our time. <br /> <br /> Okay ... not paying attention to the 8th season. <br /> <br /> Eric Forman, excited teenager with eternal love for Donna (Laura Prepon), the feminist next door, plays Topher Grace. Playing with friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) give fantastic performances in (almost) every episode. The best is probably Fez, an exchange student who is as mentally heterogeneous as possible. What country is it from? Try to figure it out! In another dimension, Debra Joe Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are Eric's phenomenal parents. Rupp, like Kitty, is both formidable and cute, sort of like Mrs. Brady is greeted by Marie Baron, while “Smith Red” exists mainly to scare everyone away. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well against each other as Donna's parents, chauvinistic but cute Bob and the airy Midge. Tommy Chong occasionally appears as Leo, a stoner who acts as Hyde's father. <br /> <br /> In addition to the anachronistic mistakes that occur quite often, and the excessive lessons that sometimes come (and this terrible final season), “70s” is an amazing show with amazing writing, precise guidance and a pleasant atmosphere, pulsating in every episode. They are all fine.
