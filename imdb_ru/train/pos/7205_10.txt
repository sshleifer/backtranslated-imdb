Deathtrap - this is not a bastard This is the one who first will do it with whom. It is very difficult to describe this film without giving anything away, so I will not mention the plot anymore. As for acting, Chris Reeves plays a major role in the role of Clifford, the young playwright. You really see the range of his acting abilities in this film, from “exhaling cheeseburgers” to completely frightening. Clifford plays a very difficult role, and in the production of this film I have never seen Clifford play well at both ends of the spectrum. The actor plays him for a little puppy or killer maniac. Reeves is the only person I have ever seen who has character throughout the journey. As for Michael Kane, he ... well, he is Michael Kane. One of the best actors of the last 50 years, and in this film he is as good as ever.
