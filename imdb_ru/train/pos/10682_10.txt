A few years ago, satellite channel U.K. Gold advertised the replay of "Men Behaving Badly" with a stir: "Here it is, the original comedy series!" It was actually not true. "Man About the House" was also a sitcom sitcom and worked from 1973 to 1976. <br /> <br /> This was the brainchild of Johnny Mortimer and Brian Cook, the creators of the popular “Father, Dear Father” sitcom. When it ended, they decided that they wanted to do something more harmonious with time. <br /> <br /> In the first episode, Chrissy (Paula Wilcox) and Joe (Sally Tomsett) clean the apartment on their terrace Middleton after a wild party when they find a man in their bathroom. This is Robin Tripp (Richard O'Sullivan), a student at the culinary faculty of Southampton, who does not have a permanent residence. While his clothes dry, he puts on a woman’s robe and cooks them food. They are so impressed with his culinary abilities that they invite him to stay. But there should be no disobedient affairs. So Robin should be pretending to be gay ... In the BBC film I Love 1973, shown in 2000, Julie Burchill claimed that House showed her a way of life that she envied . She was not alone. One of the most iconic (for me, in any case) images of British television of the 70s was Sally Tomsett, coming out of the London Underground with an umbrella, and the "blind" man doing a double double when her cheeky back swings past. <br /> <br /> A man living with two girls was a perilous subject for this time, but Mrs. Mary Whitehouse did not need to warm up under the collar, it was innocent, good-natured fun. Scenarios of Mortimer and Cook came as close to the edge as possible, without crossing it. <br /> <br /> Richard O'Sullivan still played Bingham in Responsible Doctor IV when it started. In fact, the second run of In In Charge overlapped with the first of House. He was born to play the crazy Robin. Paula Wilcox's “Chrissy” was more street-like than “Beryl”, her character played in “Lovers”, while “Joe” Sally Tomsett was an attractive dizzying blonde. In time, he became almost an older brother for them. <br /> <br /> For many viewers, Brian Murphy and Uta Joyce stole the show as rival Ropers. George lost interest in sex, and Mildred did not. They went to their own show - just named "George and Mildred." The late Doug Fisher was a good assistant to Robin Larry. It worked so well that it was turned into ordinary. <br /> <br /> A year after his debut, the inevitable release of the film occurred. I'm not a big fan of the movie "Man About the House" because I think he was stretched to fit the big screen. Most of his characters never appeared on the show. <br /> <br /> The format was sold to America, where it became a long-term "company of three", which starred the late John Ritter and Suzanne Somers. It was much more suggestive than the British original, with Somers, who was often seen in sexy clothes. <br /> <br /> After six seasons, “House” ended up chrissy married older brother Robin Norman (Norman Ashley). The fans were devastated to see that Robin could not find his girlfriend, but there was some consolation in the fact that he also received his own show, Robin’s Nest.
