Full House is a wonderful comedy series about dad Danny Tanner, whose wife had just died in a car accident. Therefore, Danny asks his son-in-law, Jessie Katsopolis, and best friend Joey Gladstone to help raise her three girls: Donna Joe 'DJ' Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner. This is my favorite show, and I can watch it all day. And something on Full House always makes me laugh, and there are sad moments. Full House is never boring. The main characters: Bob Saghet (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Katsopolis), Dave Kulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Jody Sweeten (Stephanie Tanner), Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michel Tanner).
