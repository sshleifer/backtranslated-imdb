I must admit that I was very skeptical of this documentary. I expected this to be the type of all-American propaganda that we do not like here very much in Europe. I was wrong. This is NOT propaganda, in fact it is hardly political. <br /> <br /> She depicts the events of September 11 through the eyes of firefighters who were called to the scene immediately after the crash. It's amazing that this documentary was shot at all! This film was originally filmed as a documentary about how a recruit from New York became a "man." We can only thank the directors for continuing their work during the terrible ordeal they faced. <br /> <br /> Great job. Absolutely awesome stuff. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Regards,
