RKO had a reputation as the creator of the commoner pieces of Americana. <br /> <br /> Ann Shirley (like Don O'Day) starred in movies since childhood. By 1933, she was in limbo - she played Ann Dvorak as a child in “Three at a Match” (1932) and “Flower Girl” in “This Side of Paradise” and “Key” in 1934 George Nichols Jr. remembered Anna's work from the previous film, and that's how she got this part. She also adopted Ann Shirley as her stage name. There are memorable stories here - Lady Shallot in a flowing boat, a “stolen” brooch, an incident with “red hair”. Anne was so eligible for the role of a talkative, spiritual orphan. She was heartbreaking in her intensity, her desire to please, as well as her hot-tempered nature. O.P. Heggie was beautiful because Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley's understanding was good, as was the firm of Marilla. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who starred in films as a child, was fine, like Diane Barry. Sarah Hayden proved that she could play someone other than Aunt Millie on the Andy Hardy series, was Mrs. Barry.
