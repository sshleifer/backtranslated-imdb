Unlike the other user, who said that this film sucks (and that Olivia Hussey was terrible), I disagree. <br /> <br /> This movie was awesome !!!!!! Olivia Hussey is gorgeous in all that she is! Yes, she may be older, because many people remember her in Romeo and Juliet, but she is wonderful! <br /> <br /> This storyline can be used quite often, but it is a unique film, and I will resist anyone who disagrees! I enjoyed this movie just like any other Olivia Hussey film. Olivia is “my girlfriend,” and I love her work. <br /> <br /> I first saw this on Saturday (April 14, 07) and fell in love with her. Not only because it is Olivia’s film, but also because of its unique storyline and wonderful direction.
