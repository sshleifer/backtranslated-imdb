This film is a funny and sarcastic look at pop culture and its producers. I was impressed with the photo, which consisted of bright colors and rotation settings, especially when you think that this is Zhukovich's first large-scale attempt. <br /> <br /> One warning, do not take seriously the idea of ​​the film. It is not for mass consumption (and it is not a compliment). A message is a somewhat stylized view of society on a post-college neophyte. <br /> <br /> I really liked the storyline of the fictional "Zina editor", verbally discrediting the mokratocracy of the 90s.
