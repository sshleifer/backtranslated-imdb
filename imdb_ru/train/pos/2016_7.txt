“Higher and Higher” was one of the most Broadway musicals “Rogers and Hart”, in 1940 there were only 84 performances on Broadway. And yet he gave one of their greatest hits, "He never entered my mind." <br /> <br /> However, with the exception of one minor Song “So Disgustingly Rich”, the entire account of Broadway was written off when RKO bought the rights to the film. Instead, a completely new score was written by Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson, mainly in order to accommodate Francis Albert Sinatra alone, who debuted in his full-length film. <br /> <br /> Sinatra, who has played several vocal cameos in previous films, takes a sheet from the page of her singing competitor Bing Crosby. When Bing made his debut in the feature film “Big Broadcast,” he played Bing Crosby. Frank Sinatra took on the role of Frank Sinatra, and I can't think of anyone who could do a better job. <br /> <br /> Chairman of the Council is in third place after stars Jack Haley and Michelle Morgan. He is a butler, and she is the cleaning lady of Leon Errol. In fact, Errol is a millionaire who has not paid his help for seven months. Mostly because he is about to start reading chapter 11 or so, he reports this to the staff. <br /> <br /> Errol is a delightful old soul that you can work for, and no employee wants to lose a good thing. They pool their resources and force Michelle Morgan to impersonate Errol's daughter, who is in Switzerland with her mother. The idea was to get a rich bankroll in the hope of saving family luck. Only Michel begins to look at the other. <br /> <br /> This is a small story and, of course, no worse than a whole series of musicals, but RKO has put this film into a good group of players. Barbara Hale and Elizabeth Risdon play another debutant and her mother, who suspects that something is wrong, Victor Borge is a fortune not looking for an account, Dooley Wilson, Paul Hartman, Grace Hartman, Marcy McGuire, Mel Torm and Mary Weeks are played by others from the Errol family of staff. Not bad at all. <br /> <br /> Sinatra sang three good ballads and they all had some commercial success: “The music stopped”, “A wonderful way to spend the evening”, but I could not sleep with a wink. Last night. The latter was nominated for an Oscar for the best song, but lost to Alice Fay, which you will never know. <br /> <br /> 1943 was the year of the Union of Striking musicians against the recording industry. Frank Sinatra recorded songs from Higher and Higher with an a cappella choir for Colombia to receive their material. Bing Crosby recorded songs from his Dixie film in the same way for Decca. Both of them were declared strikers by union president James Petrillo, and both did not cross the picket line again. The strike was not fully settled until 1944, although Decca left the other record companies earlier and settled earlier than Columbia, RCA Victor and others. <br /> <br /> The strike gave Sinatra several disturbing moments. He had just left the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra when the strike was announced. This closed the necessary space for his mastery, when he was not sure whether Dorsey would be leaving the right career step. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, higher and higher were accepted well, the legend was launched.
