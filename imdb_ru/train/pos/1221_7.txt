For a long time I liked this film better than the original Care Bears film. Well, last summer I looked at them together and decided that I was wrong. The first one is the best Care Bears movie (you guessed it after reading my review). This is not a BAD film, it's just ... VERY STRANGE. <br /> <br /> Well, first, as several people have already mentioned, he completely disavows any knowledge about the first film. I can not think of another continuation, which is so clearly contrary to the original (especially with the sexes of some characters and how they all met). When I was little and watched it, I was a little confused and confused. I felt the same when watching him as an adult! <br /> <br /> For reasons why the film is actually pretty good (IF you tear it off from the first film). I can't think of another movie for little kids with a DEMON, as this is Villan! Now I do not for a minute assume that evil demons who want to steal the souls of vacationers and caring bears are good, I just find it cool that in the film for young children there is EXTREMELY EVIL! It's like that strange Santa Claus vs. Satan movie from Mexico that you sometimes hear about. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the demon's name is Dark Heart, and he wants this chick to help him get the Care Bears in exchange for giving him special abilities. Very dark for children's movies, eh? And I mentioned that Darkheart appears before a girl more often as a WHINEY VOICED 10-year-old boy ??? Freaky! In the meantime, some other children are taking care of the children, caring for the BEARS CARE FOR CHILDREN! Oh man! Demons and bears to care for a child in one movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> There is no need to say that everything becomes clear at the end (but not before we see that the Dark Heart traps the bears' soul to care for a scary chandelier in one (surprisingly) deeply disturbing scene). I am still wondering if this film has found the cult audience it deserves so deservedly, I could just watch it again myself.
