Hidden Frontiers is more than fan fiction, it’s a well-thought-out and organized series supporting Star Trek worlds, alive and developing. From a fun little fan project to a famous online series; Hidden Frontiers has something for every Star Trek fan. Set in the “Late Star Trek: Next Generation / DS9” and “Voyager” timekeeping. “Hidden Border” covers topics and issues raised in other Star Trek series, with a set of stories using well-developed characters, plots, and story arcs. Star Trek Hidden Frontier captured the plots of social context that Gene Roddenberry could not display, and showed character development in long-term space missions - real things that happen in close circles, as well as exciting spatial wars and conflicts. -For drug addicts know and love. Made in the studio "Green Screen"; Hidden Frontiers brings a stunning array of regulars on the screen and in your hearts. A large cast of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project. The ingenious use of green screen technology, props, make-up and costumes all make the hidden treasure worlds in Star Trek fascinating and believable. “Hidden Border” went where few people could step into the world of science fiction, and flourished when they got there. Hidden Frontier offers a great bonus feature of a well-designed web site, with interesting discussion forums, access to creative, production and operating staff and a fun weekly chat. I highly recommend taking the time to download and watch.
