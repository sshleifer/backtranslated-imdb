I was surprised by the low rating that this film received from viewers. I saw it late on TV on the night, and he got to the point - in fact, I think it was in 1989 when he first appeared. Yet I remember it pretty well, with a good twist or two, and an interesting atmosphere on a windmill farm. Michael Pollard looks shabby enough for his role, which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays him fairly straightforwardly. I definitely recommend it as a rental, although some of the topics that might have seemed a bit sharp in 1989 may now seem boring, which is a shame, given that modern “acuity” is often just used as a necessary marketing tool such as demanding noticed.
