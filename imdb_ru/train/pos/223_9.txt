in one of Neil Simon's best plays. The foul-mouthed, eccentric ex-Vaudeville stars, played by Walter Mattau and George Burns, come together for a special television comedy. The problem is that they have not even seen each other for more than ten years. This story is full of lightning liners and jokes in showbiz, accompanied by an inexhaustible stream of humor. Good work is also Richard Benjamin as a tortured nephew, Rosetta Lenoir as a nurse and Howard Hesseman as a director of television advertising. Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller appear like themselves. Note to trivia: The editing material contains footage from the Hollywood Review of 1929 and shows Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Charles King, Gus Edwards and singing sisters Brox.
