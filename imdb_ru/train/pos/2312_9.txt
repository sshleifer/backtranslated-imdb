The young man named Kort is loved by all. His painful bloody death brings everyone closer. You can find other characters and hints throughout the entire movie. Whether predictable or not, and regardless of church beliefs, this is a touching story, full of medium and sensuality. <br /> <br /> Another thing, someone mentioned that his fate was so fast that it did not seem plausible, But the elements for this are finely tuned. Notice that his mother says that he brought his lunch to the field. Notice how he holds the steering wheel and his gloves. It is sweaty and exploits dangerous equipment. To this day, tractors are quite dangerous.
