Yes, this is a slightly stupid film, so if you are looking for an Oscar performance, forget about it ... but if you like John Candy's humor, this is a must-see. We lost John Candy before he made enough of his great comedy, and he only got better in one movie: Planes, Trains and Cars (with Steve Martin). Great game with the support of Eugene Levy, perhaps his best work as a hot actor, Sala DiPasquale. Richard Libertini, Ellie Mills and Pat Hingle also play well. You should see this little-known film if you're a fan of John Candy or Eugene Levy.
