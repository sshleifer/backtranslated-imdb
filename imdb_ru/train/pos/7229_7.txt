A cat and a mouse participate in regular chases when Jerry sinks into a bottle of invisible ink and finds that it makes him disappear. Instead of taking the opportunity to spy on a girl and mouse in the dressing room or something else, he uses his newly found invisibility to torment Tom. And this is quite funny and rather inventive, despite the fact that it is a somewhat funny cartoon. And the action never leaves the interior of the house, which is usually a feature of T & J shorts below average. Still worth 7/10. <br /> <br /> However, Iâ€™m not sure how an invisible mouse can cast a shadow on a wall, it challenges the physics and the very nature of invisibility.
