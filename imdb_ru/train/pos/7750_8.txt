The bartender sent "Any way the wind blows", as he sang the song DEUS. Anarchy governs the logical and general tension of thought. The story of this film just goes in any direction where the wind blows. And it can be really refreshing if you are ready and ready for it. Viewers who claim that the storylines have nothing in common are right. Who the hell is this windman? And yet I really liked this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful, lively place, and Any Way captures this feeling. It also reflects stupidity, racism, bureaucracy, addiction and violence, which goes unnoticed in a seemingly friendly city. The film is entertaining, funny and slightly superficial. Barman's on-screen debut will not have such a strong influence as his musical debut. In this light, some may be disappointed. But on the other hand, “The worst case scenario” would be a subtitled “Any way the wind blows”.
