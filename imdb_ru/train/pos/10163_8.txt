It had a good story ... she had a good pace, and all the characters evolved dramatically. <br /> <br /> Over the past two weeks I have watched a whole bunch of movies, and it should have been the best movie. I have seen in two weeks. <br /> <br /> Although the character of Jason Bigg was the best. <br /> <br /> Although he was small, he was thought out from the start. <Br /> <br /> This may be a romantic comedy, and I donâ€™t like it the most, but the script, the direction, the performance, the sound, the design as a whole were really pretty cool in every respect. <br/>> This film was quite appreciated from all the films that I saw lately, while the rest were on a large budget or were better advertised. <br /> <br /> Good job in writing.
