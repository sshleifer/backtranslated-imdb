All the people who sit here and say that the weakest link in this film is the Ramones will probably say that Amadeus was fine, if not for this annoying harpsichord. Rock and Roll High School was centered around the Ramones. How someone can watch this and not get pleasure from the fact that Joey Ramone eats bean sprouts backstage, trying to keep him in good condition - this is obviously the raw dad. Miss Trogar, exploding white mice, the hall patrols ... an instant classic. Never mind Riff Randall's character. <br /> <br /> If you don’t like the Ramones, you don’t know rock and roll and you don’t deserve to watch the movie ROCK AND ROLL High School.
