It’s not easy to make a film of 18 different stories. Although 18 different international directors accepted the challenge, not all of them are good, and some are even boring. But in its essence “Paris, I love you” is breathtaking, showing that, as it says, “In fact, love”, “love around”, especially in the city of love. Here is a summary (I will try to make it as free as possible from the spoiler) of 18 different stories. <br /> <br /> MONTMARTR - a kind of boring introductory sequence, nothing special about that. A man finds a place to park and sees a lot of strange couples who are wondering why he cannot find a girlfriend. And then suddenly a woman loses consciousness next to his car ... <br /> <br /> QUAIS DE SEINE is another boring sequence about three teenagers who are looking for some "piece of ass" when suddenly a Muslim girl stumbles right in front of them, getting help from one of the boys. Really simple, but with a sweet heart. <br /> <br /> LES MARAIS - it was a huge disappointment! Although the great Van Sant could be interested in the love story of two guys with an artsy past. In the end, everything that comes after the monologue of Ulliel is good, everything before it just annoys. <br /> <br /> TUILERIES is an entertaining sequence of Coen brothers. Bushemi - without even saying a single word - is fascinating, and the whole sequence is just ridiculous. This one made me hook me to the very end, and this one makes you really get carried away with the movie. <br /> <br /> LOIN DU 16IEME is also a beautiful story, even if the penalty is bad, the heart is there, This is a story about a Latin American woman who leaves her child early in the morning to take care of another child in the suburbs. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> PORTE DE CHOISY - this segment should be the weirdest and strangest of the entire film. Some shampoo salesman arrives in a place similar to Chinatown in Paris. If I understand correctly, the story of inner beauty, but I think I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> BASTILL is a really wonderful sequence. A man meets his wife in a restaurant to break up with her so that he can escape with his mistress. But my wife has some devastating news. Pretty simple, but really sad and beautiful! LOCATION DES VICTOIRES - sad sequence as well. Juliette Binoche plays a grieving mom. One night she wakes up when she hears her dead child. When she arrives at the scene, the cowboy tells her that she can once again say goodbye to her child. One of the best segments! TOUR EIFFEL - two lovers of mime could be great, but although there are some good cinematic tricks in it, the story is not at all intriguing and not funny at all. <br /> <br /> PARC MONCEAU - really Original and excellent sequence, one of the best in the film! A young girl and an elderly man discuss their future and their fear of a certain man ... Cuarón does an excellent job with the director’s work, and the actors are just awesome! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS ROUGES - American actress (Gyllenhaul) falls in love with his drug dealer. again a beautiful piece with a very sad ending PLACE DES FETES - a woman comes to a homeless man, he starts talking to her romantic ... because she is the love of his life. Beautiful, sad, shocking, romantic, ... Place des Fêtes will make everyone cry. <br /> <br /> PIGALLE is a boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins, who are looking for new thrills in their relationship ... very Not funny and not romantic, Pigalle is a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Quarter de Madeleine - bringing diversity to the film, QdlM - relief. A young guy (Wood) finds a vampire who kills a victim ... A tourist and a vampire ... fall in love! Dark, scary and strangely romantic, Madeleine is gorgeous. <br /> <br /> PERE-LACHAISE is another disappointed segment. Directed by Wes Craven, with the stars of Mortimer and Sewel, it could be great, but Per-Lachaise is just plain, not at all original. <br /> <br /> FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS - the rumors are true, Twyker's short film is beautiful, stunning and well done. Blind picks up the phone and hears from his girlfriend (Portman - really amazing) that she breaks up with him. He reflects on their relationship. <br /> <br /> APARTMENT Latin - although this segment was directed by Depardieu and has such stars as Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu, this segment is also disappointing. Nothing happens, the lack of chemistry between the actors. <br /> <br /> 14th arrondissement - the last sequence is both cheerful and sad. An American woman tells a French lesson about her trip to Paris. Her French is really terrible, but at the end of the segment she understands that Paris is much more than it seems at first glance. <br /> <br /> Against the backdrop of Feist, "Paris, je t'aime" ends in a sweet tone, not letting me down at all, although I am tired of some episodes, the essence of the film is gorgeous! A real cinematic experience for young and old. Paris, I love you!
