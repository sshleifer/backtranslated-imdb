The first of the official Ghibli films, Laputa is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but while Nausicaa was a SF epic, it’s rather an action adventure with a rather weak SF prerequisite. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour of the film, I thought I would like it. You are once again delighted with Miyazaki’s attention to detail and his ability to evoke the imaginary world in a meticulous, beautiful perfection. The animation, although still not in the league of the later Ghibli films, is slightly better than in Nausicaa. <br /> <br /> I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more “lupine” anime style. Here are a whole bunch of them: pirates. They provide a comic element in the film, although I'm not sure why he needs a comic element. There was nothing funny in Nausicaa, and I think it was better for this. Still. Having said that, Dola, the leader of the pirates, is easily the most memorable character in the film (even if she is mostly a woman Long John Silver. Do not be surprised if you are sometimes reminded of the Treasure Planet) and are well voiced by Cloris Leachman in the American dub. <br /> <br /> The English cast is basically worth it. However, something in this film became pear-shaped for me, about halfway through. I think the best way I could describe this is that the characters are absorbed in a huge amount of history. I will come back to this later. <br /> <br /> There are so many things to admire in Laputa, and so many people obviously love him, that I almost feel like I just want to give him 8 out of 10, but for me here they call “admire ". It was more impressive than a personal impact, and after two hours it was just starting to tighten. <br /> <br /> For me, the decisive moment was the following: I really found that I don’t care about any of the characters. Disney would take care to develop characters, make you really fall in love with them, and not leave them in the form of relatively two-dimensional figures that can be moved while you look at the amazing prospects in the film. Even this would be tolerable if there were some kind of tough fantasy in history to make up for it, but basically it was a lot of words about princesses and magic crystals. That's where Laputa falls, as far as I know, and this is what keeps him from being a potential 10 out of 10 film. Having said that, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was several leagues ahead of Disney in 1986, given that The film of the same year was a rather scary "Great Mouse Detective". <br /> <br /> Laputa A good film is in a sense an amazing film, and you should definitely see it, but I feel that it is overvalued. I definitely prefer the earlier Nausiku from the Valley of the Winds. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you manage to look at them in chronological order, watch the fox protein from Nausika jump out for a short time in Laputa.
