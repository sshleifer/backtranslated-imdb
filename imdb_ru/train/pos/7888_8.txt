Freddy Krueger, the pursuer of dreams from Elm Street, the great character actor Robert Englund is back in the sequel to the film “Nightmare Baby 5”. Hope I understood the number correctly. There were so many of them, and this one is one of the best, especially for cameos: Roseanna Barr (then Arnold), Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp (who made the very first nightmare at 84) Alice Cooper (singer), you will see Freddie as an exhausted child , a teenager who loves pain, and as a family guy (creepy), the effects are very funny and creative, the cast also includes Lisa Zane (Billy's sister) Brekin Meyer (trip) Yafet Cotto (alien, live and let die) and Amanda Donahue ( father knows better), I was one of those who saw it in 3d, well, in the end. I love 3d movies. I missed the first 3d wave in 1953 (I was not even born yet), the second wave was in 1983. I liked all the Freddie movies. this one stands out as one of the best, not counting the first one, which was absolutely brilliant, Freddie became the new monster of the 80s and 90s, along with Jason Voorhees, Chuckie, Michel Myers and a leather face. Can you imagine a movie with all of them? I recommend this to all Freddie fans and terrible fans alike. That Freddie is such a lesson 8 out of 10.
