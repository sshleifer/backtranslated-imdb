This film is witty, watchable and quite touching. And now do you often see how Gene Harlow (or any actress of this era) strikes another woman with a quick blow to the jaw? (Twice!) <br /> <br /> After Rubin Harlow is sent to a correctional facility after being confused with Edward Hall Gable (he has this crappy but charming smile curve), her predicament becomes even more difficult when she discovers that she is pregnant, and she is convinced that this rake left her, but in fact her love reformed him, and he visits her, despite the fact that he will be arrested and with the help of the minister married. <br /> <br /> The wonderful relationship that Harlow shares with his cellmates is second only to her electrical chemistry with Gable, who was her most frequent leader. Her cynical character is perfect for the smooth chatter of Gable. What don't you like? <br /> <br /> "You know, you would not be a bad-looking lady - if not for your face!" Ruby speaks sharply about the gypsy, her rival. “If you are going to come closer to me, I will have to open another window!” Priceless !!!
