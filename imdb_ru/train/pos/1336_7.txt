This is generally a good film, with a good story, great actors and great songs. The cinematography was unfortunately bad. One of the weakest points of the film is the annoying chain of episodes copied from Pretty Woman. What for? Does it hurt to try something original, Abbas? Mustan? Anyone? <br /> <br /> A film about newlyweds, Raj and Priya (Salman - Rani). Priya cannot become pregnant after an accident that occurred during a previous pregnancy, and they finally decided to use a surrogate mother who will carry their baby. They choose Madhubalu, the vulgar prostitute played by Priti Zinta. The film is not quite realistic, I mean, is not it easier to accept it? And even if they choose a girl, does this mean that a man should sleep with her? Have you heard of fertilization? In any case, I think that if the writers had heard about all this, the film would not have been shot, so the concept is apparently intentional. <br /> <br /> Salman works very well. Nice to see him play a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love for his wife and how hard it is for him to sleep with another woman. Come on, this is stupid and unreal. Rani is almost normal; In general, she is effective and is trying to do something with the role, but it is completely overshadowed by Priti Zinta. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Preity, who in many ways exposes the series with its impeccable performance. She easily and naturally turns from a loud prostitute into a sensitive woman. She lives the film, loves and makes you love her and admire her at the same time, partly because of her role, partly because of her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of the best performances in her career. There is no doubt that she is more talented than her contemporaries. She just has to play more of these roles. <br /> <br /> The end of the film only underlines what I said above. This is a jerk, exciting and very well acting. Look at this for Preity. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for the movie! 10/10 - for Preity!
