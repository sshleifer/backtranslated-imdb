Note. These comments are intended for people who have watched the movie. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a brilliant, complex, and exciting movie that details what the tag says: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Maybe the plot of the film may be the focus of confused viewers, if you look at it from a different angle. <br /> <br /> Considering the following: <br /> <br /> Now I have not painstakingly left through the scene of the film, so I will have to further examine my statements (and I welcome your thoughts), but try and see, not Will the film take the place of: where exactly is the controversial “splicing” going? <br /> <br /> Now I’m not talking about connecting, as explained by the LE “technician”, since this sequence itself could actually be interpreted as rationalization in the state of mind / sleep / coma of David Ames, but the true connection between reality and sleep. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the reality for a car accident, the way it was shot (for example, without an explosion), is a likely point of "merging", and that any particular sequence containing existential / sleep / coma / unreality , feels it - whether it is shown on the screen before or after the crash - in fact, it is part of Ames's personal journey to self-realization in his own mind. <br /> <br /> In this regard, we have two questions at the end (if you know more, let me know): is Ames really disfigured and where does he wake up? <br /> <br /> If you are not completely immersed in the exact sequence of details in the plot, or at what point his dreams are scattered around, this film becomes a fascinating exploration of a person in a journey to find himself and that means in modern pop cultural society. <br /> <br />
