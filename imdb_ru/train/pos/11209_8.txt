“Buddy” is a fascinating family film made at a time when “humanizing” animals and turning them into likeable people has become the accepted way to interest them. <br /> <br /> Based on the real story, Buddy shows the main characters' great love for animals and for each other, and that they will do everything for each other. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a perfect movie, the animated gorilla is in most cases quite realistic, and the chaos occurring in the house usually amuses children. <br /> <br /> This film missed an opportunity to tell that wild animals got into the house as pets, but it shows difficulties. <br /> A recommended movie that was the first for Jim Henson Productions.
