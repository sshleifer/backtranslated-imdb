I just watched the first episodes on DVD, but summarized The Sopranos as a Shakespearean plot with a Tarantine script. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino, and almost as good as The Godfather (hence not “10”), and much better than any of Guy Ritchie’s works. Although there are many actions, some of them are rather bloody, the story is based on character. Even some minor characters contribute to creating gorgeous storylines; for example, the relations of the priest (or his absence) with Carmilla and the restaurateur’s wife, as well as with Christopher and his stupid friend (who did not last long (nominee for Darwin Award?)) <br /> <br /> In addition to the plot, script and acting, the reasons why I liked him; <br /> <br /> 1. It made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with tomato sauce. 2. Music. 3. This shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems.
