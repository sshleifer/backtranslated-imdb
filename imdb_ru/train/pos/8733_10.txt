When I bought my “Toy Story” tape, when she came out on “Video” after going out to the theaters, I saw a trailer for this, in which the creators of Toy Story told me. As soon as I saw that I knew that this would be a good trait! I was right! Bug's Life, like Toy Story, is a great story, great characters and great animation. My favorite characters are Dim Rhinoceros, voiced by Brad Garrett, and the Hemlich Caterpillar, voiced by the late Pixar narrator Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when Thin Stick (David Heid Pierce) picks up Hemlich, trying to distract the Bird, and Hemlicha, like You, Mr. Early Birdie. How about a good tasting worm on a stick and Slim, as if I'm going to break! I'm going to click! I just died laughing on this scene. Being a big fan of insects, I think A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar, although I know that many people consider it the worst Pixar movie! I don't know how you can hate the Pixar movie! I think they are all pretty good movies! Good job PIXAR!
