This is a classic 80s action movie featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Install in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything, including television networks. One of their most popular TV shows is The Running Man, where convicted criminals are tracked down and killed for the entertainment of millions. This is set up as a game show, where viewers vote for their favorite “stalkers”, trained killers, who track down and kill unfortunate “contestants” of the show. Audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will kill whom. And as the host, it is none other than Richard Dawson from Family Feud, whose gaming experience makes him suitable for this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game. <br /> <br /> This film is full of classic Arnold one-line players, such as his famous “I return” just before he enters the arena. And he scoffs at a stalker armed with a flamethrower: “What about the light?” I I could go on and on, but I don’t want to spoil the film. It’s a funny thing! <br /> <br /> This film, as conceived or not, serves as an excellent parody of the craze for today's “reality TV.” There are already numerous programs that show people experiencing pain and humiliation for fun viewers, and even court cases are televised for their “entertainment value.” A running person demonstrates what happens if a reality show reaches the bottom, and this is a terrible picture. One can only hope that the networks have common sense to prevent this . <br /> <br /> In general, this is a fun movie and I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!
