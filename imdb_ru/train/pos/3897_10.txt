This video was my first encounter with Eddie Izzard. We had several friends overnight and, for one reason or another, during the evening we went to the channel on the HBO. Someone named "Eddie Izzard" was included. I tried not to laugh too loudly in the first few jokes. I did not want to be “responsible” for the rest of the group enjoying something that clearly killed me. After I kept laughing more than healthy, I let go - like the other of us (by the way, we were not stoned, we were not talking about insurance, or about pensions ...). We were strangled after that. Subject lines, plot, whimsical, but still ingenious connections in the sketches are nothing but brilliance. Since then, I have become addicted to every Eddie-Izzard comedy I can get. His work is simply brilliant. His comedy seems easy. He looks more like that hysterically funny friend who hangs out in your house and talks about this or that ... This is convulsively funny. He gives you the impression that the joke is between you and himself, the only true connoisseurs of humor, after all. If you are disappointed in this video, you have no sense of penultimate humor or humor, as they say in the UK.
