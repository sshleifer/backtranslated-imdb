The DVD for "Danaza Macabra" (The Castle of Blood) is very strange. This is because part of the film is written in French with subtitles, and the rest is translated into English from French. Sometimes the characters switch between the two in the middle of the scene! When I tried to make a film simply with subtitles or simply dubbed, it did not matter! Strange, but still watchable. <br /> <br /> This story is based on the Po story, although I can't remember which one. In fact, the character Po appears at the beginning and end of the film - although it did not look like him. <br /> <br /> A rich man bets with a guy on his luck, that he cannot stay all night at home. It seems that winning is easy - even if the house is very creepy. However, it cannot be so easy, as the rich guy says that all those who had previously accepted the bet are dead - and yet this fool still wants to bet! While at home, he meets the beautiful Barbara Steele and falls madly in love with her. Later, however, he learns that she died more than ten years ago! How can it be?! I could tell you more about the plot, but I don't want to spoil the wait. See for yourself to find out the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> This film received very high marks for creating an eerie atmosphere. Home, black and white cinematography and music work together to make the movie look scary. As for the plot, it is interesting - especially because at the end of the film there are so many turns - so much that you wonder who is and who is not among the undead. <br /> <br /> The only negative is that I felt sorry for the poor snake that was killed without need. No matter how crazy it sounded, I felt sorry for him, and it hardly seemed necessary. <br /> <br /> In addition, parents may want to know that there is a bit of nakedness in the end. A strikingly beautiful woman looks topless, but this is hardly necessary for the plot.
