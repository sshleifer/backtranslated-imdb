I saw this movie yesterday on Turner, and I could not stop watching until it was over, although I could guess what would happen. Farrell was great in her role, and everyone else did an excellent job. Some of them seemed to go beyond, but overall, I liked it !! If you have the opportunity to see this, please! I actually cried in several scenes, but then, I think, if you were a mom, you would. Loretta is beautiful, and I was just amazed by the very idea that they were not married there, it seemed ahead of their time. I say: SEE, if you can, and do not listen to criticism. As they say, I laughed, I cried! I thoroughly enjoyed it!
