I saw this show about 3-4 years ago. It was a lady Funny! When I first saw it play on ETV (Estonian television), I liked it. It is a pity that this show at the wrong time for me. Hyde is like a cool guy who likes to sing Frank Sinatra! And he comes to stupid ideas. He got these glasses brown. I like it . And there is a fez. Group Pervert. We all know what he does when he is alone ... He wants to be poorly packed. He even had this with his boss in one episode. He is from India. And there is Michael, the stupidest guy in the whole group, perhaps the stupidest guy in the city and his cop! He is so stupid that I remember the following: Hyde says: did you call the police? - No Michael comes and speaks. Does anyone know how to turn off the siren? He is a city playboy. Then comes Jackie, Michael's ex-girlfriend, and then she is Hyde's girlfriend. Then Eric, the son of a grumpy war veteran and the son of Kitty, a housewife. His one big pussy. But he loves Donna, his girlfriend, with whom they plan to marry. Donna is one hot girl. Hmm, what did I forget? ah Hyde lives in the basement.
