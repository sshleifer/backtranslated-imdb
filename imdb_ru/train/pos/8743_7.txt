A good movie with strong performances (especially in two major roles). A film about two American girls who were caught with 6-pound heroin at the airport in Thailand. They are both imprisoned, and one of them signs a confession. Bill Pullman plays a lawyer who tries to pull them out. All they have to do is find Nick Parks, who put the drugs in the bag of one of the two girls. As for the story, which is not so original (it is in many ways similar to the best return to paradise). <br /> <br /> The acting and beautiful photo of Newton Thomas Siegel make this film worth seeing. 7 out of 10.
