I love this anime! I laughed at all these jokes, and the violence (mostly because of the reluctant but quick-tempered “bride” Akane Ranma) is such a rude hindrance, however Ranma deserves it, but he tries hard to correct the situation ... awkwardly. The protagonist Ranma goes to China to train only to fall into the damn source of Dzhusenkyo, and turns into a girl when she is filled with cold water. Since then, it is pure chaos one by one. Among the prominent people are the irresponsible duet of the brother and sister from Kuno and Kodachi, the sexy shampoo, the pervert Happosai, which brings trouble to our hero / heroine. However, it is Ranma's selfish father, Genma, who is the cause of the disorder in most cases. If someone wants a funny anime, then it is one. It is better and better with Japanese dub.
