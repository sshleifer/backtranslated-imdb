It was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - without a doubt in honor of the original film "Angels" that "chased" the Pittsburgh Pirates. In this remake, they "pursue" the Californian angels. <br /> <br /> In any case, the premiere took place at the long-gone “Three Rivers” stadium, which at that time was home to Pittsburgh pirates and Pittsburg steelers (pirates). currently housed in PNC Park and Steelers in Heinz Field). The premiere took place on a cinema screen, which was five floors high inside the stadium, and held (and may even continue to hold) the record of the largest movie premiere in history, which was shown by 60,000 fans. Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd attended the admiration of thousands of sports fans.
