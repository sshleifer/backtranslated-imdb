ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK (1988) <br /> <br /> Director: James Signorelli <br /> <br /> Starring: Cassandra Peterson, V. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Green and Edie McClurg <br /> <br /> Story: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) comes out of her television show and heads to the small Christian town of Falwell, Massachusetts, to collect the legacy of her dead aunt, hoping to earn big money to open a show in Vegas. Unfortunately for her, all she gets is a creepy old house, a poodle and a magic cookbook. While in Falwell, Elvira is trying to make money, breathe life into adolescents, win the stallion's heart (Daniel Green), avoid burns at the stake and keep the cookbook from her creepy uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard), who plans to use the book to end the world . <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter ego Elvira. She is a very successful, beautiful and funny woman, and, like Elvira, she is the same plus, painful and cheerful naivety, not to mention that she has an amazing pair of hammers. In this film, her charms have found good use. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie “Fish from Water”. You have Elvira, with her black dress of low cut, with her big black hair and her huge “twins”, and she is in a Christian city where most girls are not even allowed to wear makeup. It also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Green) a lot more interesting. <br /> <br /> W. Morgan Sheppard is as great as Elvira Vincent’s uncle / archenemy to steal a book and use it for evil. He has a lot of presence, but he still does not interfere and steals scenes from Elvira. <br /> <br /> What the film actually does is not a plot, but a lot of jokes. It has everything from jokes to horror, and it makes me laugh more than anything from the sequel to SCARY MOVIE. I heard that in this film there are about 56 jokes with tits, and any fan of Roger Corman’s horror films will like to fake in this film. <br /> <br /> If you love Elvira, you will love this movie.
