I give this film 7 out of 10, because the villains were interesting in their roles, and the unknown bat creates an interesting game “guess who”. The film, however, needs more Robin in it. He appeared in the film at the beginning and from time to time throughout the rest. I always thought that the new animated series is not very well suited for the neat new character of Robin, not to mention the Nightwing. This film just continues this bad tradition. The film spends too much time on Bruce Wayne and his romance, which would not be so bad in one film if the romance were not so incredible. This is a good movie if you are a Batman fan, and I would recommend to watch it.
