“Indian Summer” is a warm multi-symbol film, from which you will get a wonderful day movie (with a little editing). <br /> <br /> The film begins in the past when a group of children are shown an elk, which sets the tone well before plunging into the present, when a group of adults from the “golden age” of the camp is again invited to return to spend a few weeks on vacation at the camp head Uncle Lou. The film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters when they recall their time in the camp, and to form new memories during their last stay. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds due to the fact that he demonstrates his characters in this magnificent setting and gives them the opportunity to develop without worrying about the development of the plot. Watching the memories of these people and their relationships with each other is what the film is about and why it works so well. He never goes beyond melody, always maintaining his warmth, charm and realism. I have never seen a film where nostalgia is so well captured, and I was drawn in, although I myself have never been in one of these camps. <br /> <br /> For a warm, nostalgic film about characters, I sincerely recommend.
