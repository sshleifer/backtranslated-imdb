"Scoop" - this is probably the most funny film by Woody Allen of the 2000s. Allen, although finally looking his age, is at the top of his game as a low-brow magician Sidney Waterman. His one-liners and behavior are fun. Do not let critics influence your opinion. "Scoop" - a first-class picture "Woody Light". <br /> <br /> The classical music score is a great addition to the action on the screen. Scarlett Johanson looks great in this swimsuit. Jackman famously Cinematography glows. "Scoop" - a great escapist fare from start to finish. The last shot of the movie is worth the price.
