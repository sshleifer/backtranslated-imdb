This film has it all. Emotions, strength, affection, charming naked beach dance by Stephen Rideau ... Exposes the need for real internal communication and external communication in any relationship. The fact that Cedric and Mathieu are a gay couple does not mean that there is nothing useful in this. I would probably classify him as a gay movie, but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people. Mathieuâ€™s inability to cope with his emotions reveals how our society does not encourage us to behave differently, and this is what causes differences between him and Cedric. This is definitely a must see !!!!
