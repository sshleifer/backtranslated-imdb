Of course, the average Star Fiction fan of Battle Star Gallactica will hate it. It makes me happy. I don't like these stupid science fiction shows, especially Battleal-star Gallactica, and that is why I like this show. <br /> <br /> The creators of the series received a lot of heat for creating this (unconventional science â€” by the way) and it was worth it. I read on the wiki that they wanted to appeal to everyone, including women, and not just science fiction. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most promising show since Lost. He has the most interesting, intelligent and deepest script of any show of all time, and he is truly unique. <br /> <br /> What I like most about this show is that it plays like a great anime! From young teenagers running around, shooting weapons, to an extremely well-balanced and complex scenario, to robots - this reminds me of something that came from Japan, except for a little better (most Anime is too confusing).
