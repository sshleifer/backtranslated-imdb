In a sense, this movie reminded me of "Jumping Jack Flash." Remember Whoopi Goldberg on the chopping machine? Whoopi turned off tranquilizers? Whoopi like Blind Lemon and imitating Mick Jagger? Great moments captured on film, but the film sucks anyway, right? That's how I feel about "Rich In Love." A man hears his wife singing for the first time. Post-comical teens talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney eats ice cream from a bucket and, in another scene, has a wonderful waking moment regarding his absent wife. Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character to his wardrobe. But there is only a whisper plot, and you can not wait for it to start moving. Only when ex-Go-Gos' Charlotte Caffey's The Graces releases a great pop song, the picture wakes up ... and then it's over! <br /> <br /> This picture is equivalent to a lazy summer day in the deep American south.
