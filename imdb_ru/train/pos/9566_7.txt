Ultra-dark crime drama from Pou-Soi Cheang, director of "Home Sweet Home". Tonically, it reminded me of Billy Tan’s “Run and Kill”, although not as well as that. However, this is a fascinating, flawed story about the Cambodian lonely Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. Running away from the scene, he kills policeman Sam Wai’s partner, who, in order to add insult to the wound, is in the process of communicating with his dying father, so Sam begins an insane, obsessive hunt for Pan, which results in almost a dozen dead bodies and ruthless violence. There must be something in the air lately, because I have never seen so many people beat out the flesh of each other like they did lately. This is a gloomy, unpleasant material, which is why I am so partial to him, and I welcome his depressing atmosphere. It visually captures, and the sound design is very unique. Dramatically, everything turns downward until every character is in a world of crying pain. The plot, which includes Pang's attachment to a girl who has been sexually abused, adds depth to the story and gives rise to an unexpected fourth act that boasts a wonderful act of grotesque surgery.
