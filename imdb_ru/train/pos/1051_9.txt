This is a powerful documentary on domestic violence in Cameroon. The “sisters” by law are women lawyers and judges, who in 2004 successfully pursued their husbands for mistreatment of their spouses and won one woman, whom she desperately wanted to get through divorce through Muslim council. This is quite a long time - about two hours - but fascinating from the point of view of both the individual plaintiffs and the defendants, and the lawyers who successfully represented them in courtrooms chaired by women judges. This will leave you, like me, many questions about exactly how this change occurred. How and when did women begin to occupy leadership positions in Cameroon? Have several of the cases described in this film had a significant impact on the attitude of women towards their spouses? Was a divorce by a Muslim court against her husband’s obvious desires a one-time event? I do not assume that the filmmakers could answer these questions. They made the film two years ago, not yesterday. And the film they made deserves a wide audience.
