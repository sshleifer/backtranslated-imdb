Most people (36) gave this film 10, and those who are not too critical or may have expected something else. This is one of my favorite movies of the 80s, he grew up on you, and it has everything. I just got it on DVD, and 20 years later, he still doesn't disappoint, having a lot of action, drama, romance and even comedy. Add to this the excellent car chases, automatic shooting and lots of explosions, and you will enjoy the thrill! You will even hum or whistle the main theme of the song for several days after seeing it. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie with your wife / girlfriend and you will love it. Guess the hero of a paperback book such as Doc. The savage who really exists and helps people fight evil so that he can write a story almost corresponds to life here. Actor Jake Speed ​​is also the director, producer and screenwriter of many films. In THIS film, Jake Speed ​​(character) is a type of Indiana Jones adventurer, he usually uses his head to get out of unpleasant situations, but sometimes he uses rough firepower (yes! And just stupid luck too!). Follow his one high-tech equipment, "James Bond" - an ultra-modern SUV, falling from the sky. <br /> <br /> The heroine is a very beautiful young love interest of the early vampire Jim Carey. the movie "Once bitten", and here she is a little older and still knocks out even compared to her young blonde younger sister. <br /> <br /> Bad guys are “very bad” men and the worst villainous scum I love to hate. The finale is just perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel, unfortunately, never held - but you can only imagine what will happen next! <br /> <br /> You should watch this movie only because it will entertain and amuse you and it is worth the price of the ticket.
