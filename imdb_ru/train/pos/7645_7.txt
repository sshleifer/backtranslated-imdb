Belushi in his most ingratiating role and Courtney Cox in front of Friends is playing a small role. I often think that Belushi is not used enough in Hollywood, and this movie role is one of his best. For those of you who watch his series, this is a completely different and pleasant character. The film itself does not destroy the earth, and is not a new message, but rather it is sweet and attractive. The supportive composition of familiar faces and unfamiliar names is the perfect balance, although nagging Lovitsa can become tedious, and charming spiritual mentor Michael Kane has a slightly sinister, if not well-meaning edge. Hamilton, as the wife of Belushi, is unfortunately two-dimensional, and the question arises as to why he married her. In addition, Ren√© Rousseau wasted and not very convincingly in the "prom queen" who escaped. However, a good way to spend two hours.
