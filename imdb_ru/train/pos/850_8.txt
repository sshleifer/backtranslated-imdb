MATADOR (2005) *** _ Piers Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker. Brosnan gives one of his best non-Bond roles as a middle-aged assassin, faced with a mid-life crisis, while on a business trip in Mexico, where he became friends with a square but handsome American businessman (Kinnear was at his most affable) and found that in life there is something else. than death. Newbie director Richard Shepard makes his debut on the big screen with a sharply angry black comedy with a sharp look at the visual details and nuances of the dialogue and character development, which makes him able to look at the comedy of his friends in this breath of fresh air. â€œThe formula will turn over what is expected from his leads, and allow Brosnan to withdraw his I-I with devilish glee. Sleeping gem indie hit.
