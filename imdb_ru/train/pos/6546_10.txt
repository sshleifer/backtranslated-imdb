I am probably one of the biggest fans of Nancy Drew. I read each book three times, and I played Nancy Drewâ€™s many games. I like this movie. It took you all the time while you were watching. I went with about 10 of my friends, and everyone loved it. Three women sat behind us, who seemed to be in their 30s - 40s, and I asked them how they liked it, they said they liked it! So you see, it will be fun for all ages. You just have to give it a chance. And this is also a lesson, just be yourself, even if everything around you is absolutely the same. Overall, this move was great. I'm going to see it a second time now! So stop beating, please. This is a really good movie!
