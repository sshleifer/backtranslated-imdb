Well, there are many ways to spoil a political thriller. Usually they are derived or too ambitious, often they have a conspiracy that is completely paranoid and incredible. But the municipality does not do any of the above. The plot is thought out, the story is believable. As for the characters, I would say that this film is a good average. No character seems out of place, and Al Pacino, as always, is great. His portrayal of the charismatic mayor of New York is excellent and once again proves that Al Pacino currently belongs to the absolute pinnacle of American actors.
