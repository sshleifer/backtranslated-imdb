I have something for this kind of old black and white films, the films of Will Hay and Abbot & Costello, especially because they are my favorites. I made this film on DVD, because it used the same idea as in Will Hay’s Oh, Mr. Porter, which is one of the best comedies ever made. I just finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago (the movie ended at 0:45 am). I believe that films of this kind related to ghost trains, etc., are best to watch in the dark with the lights off. Thus, you are more immersed in the storyline, and watching a movie at night works well. <br /> <br /> Some clips in the film may seem a bit outdated to some viewers, I think it depends on the viewer. They are not dated by me though. I am 28 years old and although I’m not old enough to be there when this film was first released (although my dad was). I still appreciate some old movies of this kind. Sitting in a room in front of the TV with some snacks and drinks and relaxing and relaxing at night while watching these films, not many things can overcome the feeling you are experiencing. For a while this is an escape from reality. <br /> <br /> I noticed that one of the men in the film (he has a black mustache), he appears about three-quarters of the way the film after his car accident and he is looking for the woman he accompanied to the station. This man was also in the Will Gay classic The Ghost of St. Michaels. I just thought that I would point it out in case no one noticed :). <br /> <br /> The film’s plots are very atmospheric. Outside, the abandoned station looks good and as if there is not a soul for many miles in any direction, and inside the station it is very cozy, looking away from the rain storm that is outside. I felt like I would be there in the movie with the actors. The atmosphere in this film is now missing in many films. He keeps you in view from the beginning of the film until its completion. <br /> <br /> We need more films of this type in today's market. But, unfortunately, this could be overestimated in favor of films with nudity, expletives and rude humor. For me, this era of filmmaking (Ghost Train, Mr. Porter, etc.) is the golden age of cinema!
