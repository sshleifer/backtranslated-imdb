Masayuki Suo, who shot this beautiful film, plays a role. After a decent “Unusual dance” and a classic (in any case, in Japan) comedy of the sumo college “Shiko Fungatta”, Suo with great success followed in his own huge footsteps. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting. We both laugh a lot (Naoto Takenaka is hilarious, as in the two previous Suo films) and really cheer for the characters. But for me, a big bonus is the look that this film gives the viewer to Japanese society - real life in Japan. Suo has the ability to show real action with an interesting talent. The result is a film that attracts you, makes you laugh, makes you think, entertains you, and gives you an idea of ​​modern Japan. <br /> <br /> Also notice the main 8 actors from Shiko Funjatta, as they all reappear in various roles, from supporting characters (Takenaka) to short cameos (many).
