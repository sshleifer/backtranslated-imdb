MGM MINIATURE Short Topic. <br /> <br /> Cole Clarion County editor must decide what is the real IMPORTANT NEWS for his readers: the impending frost that could lead to a disaster for their harvest, or the sensational shootout of the notorious gangster on the main street of their small town. <br /> <br /> This is a nice little prankster, with an excellent performance by comic Charles "Chic" Sayle.
