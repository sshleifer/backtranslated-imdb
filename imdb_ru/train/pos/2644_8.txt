I donâ€™t know what I like in this film so much, but when I first saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield and the war dramas, but I was really interested in how and when Winfield would find his child. All he knows is that the boy has green eyes. In truth, I have not seen this film for years, and it has not been shown on television for some time, but this film is a kind of odyssey of one person after the hostilities. Winfield shows a very sympathetic and heart-warming image of a man lost by his memories. In this film, there is a basic idea that he is looking for the last piece of human morality after this war and the reality that he faces. Why this film is not on DVD or video is a mystery to me.
