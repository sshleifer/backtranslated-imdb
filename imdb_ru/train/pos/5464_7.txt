Babyface is Barbara Stenwick's infamous film, where a local professor tells her that she has the power — he is trying to get her to read Nietzsche — she says that the books never did her any good. Soon we learn that her father is basically a pimp, she went to a local political institute and others. In the end, she had enough from her and she moved to a big city. We follow in her footsteps of men up the ladder of success in an international bank.
