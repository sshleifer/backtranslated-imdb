I definitely recommend reading the book before watching the movie. This book received an award from the National Board of Books in 1978 and is a very exciting reading (pun intended). It is not too difficult to read for those who do not often read, so do not be afraid! The book seems to reflect the passion of the relationship more than the film, and the film will make more sense after reading the book. Growing up in Melbourne, I really could relate to this book and film. Very few Australian writers were around the 1970s, so very little has been documented about the lifestyle of a woman in an urban city in Australia during this era or in a lesson. This is a precious piece of the history of Melbourne. It is a shame that is documented as a kind of 80-soft porn. Far from it, and as another reviewer mentioned, please do not read the DVD cover, it doesn’t represent what the film is about. Those who rent a movie based on this description will only be disappointed. Just remember that this film was made in 1982, so don’t expect Hollywood to turn into a dramatization that they seem to include in our days. This is what I like about it. It’s also great to see Noni Hazlehurst in this role, she’s just fantastic, like Nora, and great to see how she really plays, because if you're close to my age, you will remember her best for her participation in Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens . Who knew she hid this talent? This film will give you a completely new impression of it. A classic Australian story!
