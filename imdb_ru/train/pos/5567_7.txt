And I will tell you why: whoever decided to edit this film to make it suitable for television, he was very rash. ALL ABOUT DRUGS, CUT AND CLOSED! You ask how they do it? Well, they don't do it very well, that's for sure. In any case, instead of marijuana, which Cheech and Chong should have at their disposal, they are said to have diamonds! However, the heroes walk in the haze of marijuana, stoning others along the way, without any explanation!
