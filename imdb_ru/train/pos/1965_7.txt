I found this film very good in all areas. The game was brilliant from all the characters, especially from Miss Stone and Morrissey. Tremella's character is getting smarter and more psychologically perverted by the minute. The plot is interesting, though, this film is more for the mind, playing between the main characters, and for how Catherine continues to write new ways and turns for his novels. The setting was also incredible, and the whole atmosphere of the film was a mysterious, thriller-like masterpiece. Watch this film now, it deserves better than the one it received from the audience, which was misled by some erroneous horrible reviews about the film (even before it began) ..... You will not regret it if you go to see it ...
