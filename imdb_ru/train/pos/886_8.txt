It was one of the DVDs I recently bought in a set of six pieces called Frenchfilm to refresh our French before our planned holiday in beautiful Provence this year. So far, we have not only improved our French, but also significantly increased our appreciation of French cinema. <br /> <br /> What a breath of fresh air for the stale, predictable, unimaginable chatter that takes place in Hollywood, What a good example for writers, actors, directors and filmmakers. It was so cool to see two identifiable characters in the main roles, and at the same time they should not be glossy figures on the covers of magazines. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I liked about this film is the slow nature and plot that made you guess how it all ends. Is there any real benefit in this selfish thug who constantly considers his seemingly naive benefactor with the type of contempt that a former prisoner will show? Will our sexually disappointed poor half-deaf heroine prove the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has bestowed upon her? The audience is intrigued by these questions, and the actors slowly and convincingly solve the answers, encountering events that challenge and shape their feelings towards each other. <br /> <br /> As soon as you see this movie, like me, you may want to see it again. I still have to figure out the psychological motive of the director for the plot as an parole officer, and some subtle nuances of camera work deserve a second look. The plot requires a bit of imagination when our hero is given the opportunity to help our abused and overworked heroin in the office. You also need to be broad-minded to believe her brilliant lip-reading and how some actions fall into place. But if you go on an exciting trip with this example of French cinema at its best, you will get more than satisfied. Four stars out of five for me.
