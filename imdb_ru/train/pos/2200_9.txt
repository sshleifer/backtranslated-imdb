100 black-and-white half-hour episodes of the early situational comedy “Mr. Pipers” were originally broadcast from 1952 to 1955 on NBC. Like many baby boomers, this and “School of Ding Dong” are my earliest memories of television. Since both of them worked later in syndication, it’s hard to say how many of these memories are actually related to the original broadcasts. <br /> <br /> Mr. Pipers is worth checking out not only because of its nostalgic significance. He is a completely different style of comedy situations than the show "Honeymoon" and "I love Lucy." In those days, the genre could evolve in two different directions and ultimately take the loud abrasive path of these two shows; probably, therefore, they still seem modern. <br /> <br /> Mr. Pipers, distinguished by his clever, restrained tone, may seem slow and boring in comparison. But in fact, it is rather a question of adaptation to another style. As soon as you get into the characters, he will win the most intelligent viewers. Pay tribute to the producer of the show Fred Coe, a key figure in early television, whose dramatic anthologies also deserve attention (“Philco Television Theater”, “Lights Out”, “Playhouse 90”, “Showcase Producers”, “Playwrights”) 56 "," Theater by the Fireplace ", etc.). Even on a kinescope. <br /> <br /> Mr. Pipers suggested a much softer style with Wally Cox (to become the voice of" Underdog "a few years later) starring Robinson Pipers , a high school science teacher. His glasses were his trademark and symbolic reference to his name and the role of passive observation The giver. <br /> <br /> The series provided Cox with outstanding support. Tony Randall played his cheeky best friend, history teacher Harvey Veskit. Jack Warden played Frank Whip, a loud gymnastics teacher, whose gentle mockery gave the show most of his conflicting elements. < br /> <br /> There are several love interest contests involving school nurse Nancy Remington (Patricia Benoit), the audience quickly joins Mr. Peppers, who seems to be much better suited to tender Nancy. Their marriage on the screen closer to the end of the 1953-54 season attracted the attention of the whole country, an early version of "Who Shot JR?" Madness. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
