To all haters: to condemn a episode with one episode is the same as judging an entire book after reading the first few pages. Nevertheless, I was a big fan of BSG, I thought it was one of the best television dramas (not only science fiction) on the air. But the time has come for this to end and the story continues. I liked the BSG epilogue “Plan”, but it caused as many new questions as there were answers, so I was looking forward to “Caprica” and was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> I hoped that he would not try to be another BSG, and I was glad that “Caprica” was something different, and I personally found the story exciting, differently than the flaming space battles, explosions and fantastic special effects (don't get me wrong, I like it too) Erik Stolz and Esay Morales give solid performances, but Alessandra was just gorgeous. I can't wait until next week.
