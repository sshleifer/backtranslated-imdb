I watched this movie again and noticed how close it was to the novel if we ignored the part about Carey’s childhood [Leslie Howard]. Given that the <br /> <br /> isn’t so much on the screen, [not so much in the novel], the obsession with the character with Mildred [Bette Davis] is very well conveyed to the audience. I recommend this film to anyone who has ever fallen in love with another person, and the other party has tried to use him or her. I read that Moham was asked to record a novel for sale, but when he started in the studio, he wept and couldn't finish more than a few lines, and the whole project was ripped off. We can say that the novel is written from the heart, and the film, at least, is a good adaptation of its part.
