I was so excited to see this film, because I always heard that it was very scary. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, this is a Japanese film that they decided to bring to America, but they actually shot it in Japan with the original team! I think it made the film ... more Japanese (perhaps that is why it was quite successful unlike most horror films from Japan to America), but it also made it a bit inaccessible to the American audience. The difference is that it scares Japanese culture and that scares American culture was felt in the film. It worked well in moments when they were about to catch the main characterâ€™s nervous fear: a frightened fish in a big, busy, unfamiliar Tokyo pond. <br /> <br /> The storyline was also quite confusing. In a typical Japanese fashion, this is extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the film is actually the middle of the story, and from there we constantly move back and forth until at the end of the film we see the end and the beginning of the whole story. This constant viewing time is very confusing to me. In addition, I do not think that some things were explained so well, and I had to ask my friend to explain them to me (she already saw this, as well as a sequel, which obviously reveals more history). <br /> <br /> In general, American viewers have something to love, tons of bizarre images and dark details that represent a healthy splash of jumping scenes.
