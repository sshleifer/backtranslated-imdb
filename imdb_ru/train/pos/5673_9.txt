I think Blackadder the Third is the best of the TV shows. <br /> <br /> In fact, all the episodes are funny, personally I really like the episode with the “French invasion”, but the episode with superstitious actors. “MACBETH” is also very funny, the way Rowan continues to play with them is really (English) humor at the highest level. <br /> <br /> Actors: “Never say that, always call it Scottish Play; Blackadder: Oh, so you want me to say a Scottish play? Actors: YES Blackadder: Instead of MACBETH ...! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Rowan, and I have most of his work, but I think he made the Blackadder series especially good. <Br /> <br /> I hope Rowan will continue his great style, but I think we can count on him, because he is already working on Bean 2, which will be released this year, I can't wait. .. <br /> <br /> I give this third Blackadder a rating of 9 out of 10.
