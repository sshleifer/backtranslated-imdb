I'm a pretty big fan of most movies that were based on the books of Stephen King - this one is rated as one of the scariest and most memorable. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching it at about the tenth time, and I still find it heartbreaking and frightening. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Gage is on the right path of collision with a monster truck is highlighted. And “Not fair”, pronounced by little Miko Hughes near the end, is a touch of brilliance. <br /> <br />
