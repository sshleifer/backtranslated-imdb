Of course, the plot, the script and, especially, the casting is strong in the film. So many beautiful things to see. One aspect that I especially liked was the idea of ​​the antagonist - Luzhini (Turturro) - a former mentor who works with evil aside. His chess contender - the Italian dandy from three parts and a cane - turns out to be a real gentleman and a really good chess player. To his credit, the "opponent" nobly agrees with the plan at the end to posthumously complete the final game for the championship (Luzhin pulled the flyer out of the window - sadly, but letting it out) because of the unstable genius Widow (Emily Watson). After death, due to the courage of the honorary master of chess, the protection of Luzhin (which he developed at a late moment of clarity) is allowed. Italian gentleman appreciates the game and calls it brilliant. Talk about the dramatic "end of the game!"
