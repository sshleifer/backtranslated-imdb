This is a great start to the film career of Mickey Rooney. His talents here show that he has a long career. The pursuit of cars and trucks is fascinating for the era of 1937. This is the beginning of the Andy Hardy series - American treasure in my book. Byington's spring results are excellent as usual. Please, Mr. Rooney or film owners, take a chance and do it on DVD. I think it will be a winner.
