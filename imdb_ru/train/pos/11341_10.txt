This may be the most nostalgic journey through time and time, when childhood begins its journey to memories, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, up and down and around. Jimmy Boy, H.R. Puffinstuff, Dr.Blinky, Cling & Clang, Ludicrous Lion, and even the evil Witchie Poo to the end. Inspiration of the last day in Leedsville, “Special Edition“ Saturday Morning on Saturday ”from Brady Kids”, “Sigmund and Sea Monsters” and “Country of Lost New and Old” - this is what this performance has overcome Donnie and Marie show, Brady Bunche's Hour of Diversity, known as Brady Bunch's Hour and even Paul Lind's Special Halloween. Maybe even other things between & Beyond the Buck just keep moving on and on, even beyond expectations, as well as unexpected boundaries. Now that we are updating in March 2006, we know that Jack Wilde is gone, and now he does it even more symbolically for us to really feel nostalgic. Including now, in August '06, and the fact that Jack Wilde is invited to play a major role in the role of Sigmund and Sea Monsters, as well as when in the last episode HRPuffinstuff does the same, and recall all the other nostalgic journeys through all the characters of Sydney and Marty Croft, including the Goodtime club HRPuffinstuff, the Donnie and Marie show, the Brady Bunch variety hour, the so-called Brady Bunch hour, etc. In truth, Steven "Steve" G.
