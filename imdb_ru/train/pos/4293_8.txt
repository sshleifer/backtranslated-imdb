Alain Chabat is a wonderful actor, writer and director, but perhaps a trifle is mistaken to take the “idea” for the story, which probably caused them to ride in the aisles, when Aristophanes was still learning that it was me to “e” except after "with". But, as I said, Shabbat is a wonderful actor, and he can create charm when he needs it. I also gradually overcome my disgust for Charlotte Gainsburg, which also turns into a perfect performance. If you absolutely insist on knowing, the “plot” is a story about a guy who is over forty, and more than just content. It does not fit well with his mother and five sisters, and to remove them from the back, he agrees with a sister of a colleague to pose - for fifteen thousand euros - as his new girlfriend, to allow the romance to come to perform with the wedding, and then move it thus taking it off the hook. Naturally, they are together, but along the way there is some duel between sub-Benedek and Beatrice, and everyone thinks that this is quite a painless ninety minutes and performs so well in the French ticket office that continuation is out of the question.
