it was a favorite Christmas special edition that I would like to release on a VHS or DVD, since my 33 rpm was lost, and all my tapes were also long gone. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m not even a big John Fan of Denver, but I was very impressed with the music, which was mostly a traditional favorite with the Muppets (especially Little St. Nick!). It also had a few little known songs (original?). <br /> <br /> Even if it was done in the late 70s, this show was timeless. Hope to find a copy soon!
