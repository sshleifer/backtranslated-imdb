I was lucky to see this film many years ago in England. Since then I have watched hundreds of films, but never forgot about it. Although Sinatra didn’t play a very nice character, he did an excellent job with this role. Many people seem to think that he really did not come to his own until he played his role in “From here to eternity,” but, in my opinion, he was magnificent in Koncho. Another role I remember is that of William Conrad. I have never seen or heard of him before this movie. Konrad plays a terrific role in this film. I remember his deep and harsh voice, and he uses it perfectly to reinforce the few words he utters with the help of a threat that sets the tone for his character. I also remember music that simultaneously represents Conrad and, it seems, surrounds him whenever he appears. A great film, and my only disappointment was that I never had the opportunity to see it again. It seems he disappeared from the face of the earth. In the titles I see a black and white image in the film, but when I saw that it was really full color, I remembered Sinatra’s blue shirt.
