This is an amazing film that is so stunning that my wife, my daughter and I thought it was irresistible. The plot is just crazy, but “it sounds believable” to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous improbability and impossibilities. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the speeches of Kevin Kline and Sally Field. I am not better than Klein, I play THICKheaded. Field's really desperate need for attention and approval — and her almost bipolar mood swings — played well against the famous (infamous?) Field: “You like me!” Exclamatory Oscar. People who can pick themselves up with so much salt are too rare in this world. <br /> <br /> I think this is the only film in which I have not lost my patience to characterize Whoopi Goldberg; I thought she was "in place" in every note she struck. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Katie Moriarty and Elizabeth Shu were also top-notch. Just a great movie if you have the mood to go for a walk and LAUGH!
