I have never seen Richard Thomas play the bad guy. I was not sure that I would like it that way. And I was not sure that he would cope. But it struck me. He made me shiver in the spine and made me take a closer look at the street people. The film is fascinating and fast paced. Bruce Davison is convincing, but all he is capable of is a good guy. The real talent here is Thomas. The ending was a bit awkward, but perhaps this is how real people would fight ... If you're a Thomas fan, you MUST see him here at his best, because he's bad!
