It was a well-written story about the creation of the Batman Sitcom, which in fact unites our heroes in great quests, and also offers stories from their TV shows. Unlike the documentaries about the family of Brady and Partridge, we not only learn about the past and present lives of Adam and Bert, but also watch them again in action. Batman, filled with books by Kapou, Catven and Riddler (s), returned to a well-told story that not only gives us a satisfactory conclusion to the series about Batman, but also fills the modern fan with all Hollywood stories that have not been heard about them in 35 years . <br /> <br /> Glory !!!
