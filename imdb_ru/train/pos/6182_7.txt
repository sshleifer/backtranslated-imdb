This murder mystery with musical numbers is long in the atmosphere and character, but rather short in expectation and probability. Based on the stage performance of the Broadway showman Earl Carroll and others, he combines the plot of whodunit with a backstage atmosphere (the murder investigation takes place at the premiere in the theater, where a musical revue takes place). <br /> <br /> The cast is impressive and diverse: stupid Victor McLaglen in the role of a police officer who conducts an investigation and never stops foolishly looking at what is in sight of the dancer; Jack Okey (pre-war Jack Lemmon, or Jack Lemmon - post-war Jack Okey?) As a haunted director who must coordinate the production, as well as the chaos behind the scenes; Jessie Ralph is always cozy as the hostess of wardrobe with deep dark secrets; Dorothy Stickney, who has a terrific large monologue near the end, like a trembling maid who is madly in love with male leadership; Karl Brisson, the Danish star, as the very male leader, sings the classic “Cocktails for Two” not once, but twice; Kitty Carlile, quickly delivering "Where they come from and where they go" and other songs of Johnston-Koslow; the glorious Gertrude Michael, who broke up with us too early, as a mean actress, whose love for Brisson is rejected; usually ridiculous Toby Ving, who, at least here is the center of a joking joke. <br /> <br /> When the plot is out of control, there is always an interesting performer or a fun and melodic musical number that distracts the viewer. The most famous sequence of the film is the number “Marahuana”, which is headed by Michaels, but besides his controversial history, this is indeed one of the less significant musical proposals. All the songs here are set as if they could fit into the standard theater space for the front stage, unlike the cinematic fantasy in Busby Berkeley style.
