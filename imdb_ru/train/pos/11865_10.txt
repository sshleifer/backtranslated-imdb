Once I heard several friends say: “A person with a scar ... some idiot tried to arrange another godfather in the early 80s”. Now I usually listen to idiots / watch CNN, so I decided that I would stay away from that. Then my friend handed me a DVD and said, “This is # 1 with pelicans,” in confusion, I tried. This is the best movie ever made. This is more realistic than all this bullshit about racing stolen cars that are too expensive for anyone in the area (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *) Although there is some humor ... that is, Pelicangi and light music of the 80s. And yet, what's better than Al Pacino, owning m203? I give this ***** of ****, perfect for fans of Ala or GTA: Vice City.
