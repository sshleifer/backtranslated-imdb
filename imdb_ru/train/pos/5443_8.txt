For what it is, it's a pretty good movie. I like both Johns -Stamos ("Full House") and Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). They both give strong performances. Love interest is fine, but it's more like a movie about a guy than a movie about a good date. I love Harley, and I could not stand to see how they paint over "14 layers of lacquer rubbed by hand" with the good old army olive drab. There is a small history lesson in which Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in World War II. I don’t know if the training was absolutely such. The film fully supported my interest, slowly, with good action shots. I love to look at the demographics of the history of voting - one 18-year-old man gave film 10 (I think, a real lover of bikes). I would not give him 10, but I gave him 8. I do not weigh each film with the same scale. There are films with a big budget, with great actors that you expect to be good, so when they fail, they fail. (“Star Wars” - “Episode I” is my best example). I liked the first three SW-films, but I thought that Episode I was weak in comparison. So he gets a lower rating from me than this movie. I expect more from George Lucas.
