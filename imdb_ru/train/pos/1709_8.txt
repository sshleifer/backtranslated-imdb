After mistakenly accepting on Halloween the repeated broadcast of Orson Welles' classic War of the Worlds for a real Martian invasion, a group of moronic Martians appear on Earth, hoping to subdue only their plans that are not justified because they really go out of their element and really all alone. <br /> <br /> It really is often pretty good and funny, with some decent lines (just check the memorable quotes) for download. This is likely to appeal to fans of fiction. It passed the test of time for me, because seeing it recently, it turned out to be much better than I expected. Despite the cast consisting of nameless stars, this may be the most fun Martian invasion ever filmed. Interestingly, the Martians themselves seem to represent almost all the classic stereotypes about Action Hero / Sci-Fi Hero (a cool 50s teenager, a fighter pilot, a fearless astronaut, a brave soldier and a strange scientist). Fun for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Get ready to die! Earth scum!"
