I thought the movie was pretty well made for a television movie, and there was a lot of action and humor in it. I found the value of entertainment that is worth seeing, and see again or a similar show again. I'm disappointed that Sean was not credited here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> I see an opportunity for a series of militants based on this concept, or continuing with Sean, again playing at even higher “cash” stakes, since his life will be on the verge again. <br /> <br /> I felt that Sean played this role well, and reminds me of an actor named Matthew Ashford, who plays Jack Devereaux in "Days of Our Lives" - Soap Opera.
