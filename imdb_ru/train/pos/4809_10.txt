With all the recent British monarchy films, is it really time for another? Answer: YOU STAND! Young Victoria is another contribution to the British cinema wave dedicated to the royal family. In this case, we are talking about the early life of Princess Victoria and the events that led to the coronation of her becoming the queen of all England, as well as her romantic and possible wedding with Prince Albert. The film also tells about the turbulent life and career of the Queen and Prince of England, as well as some other events (political unrest, etc.). In her youth, Emily Blunt plays the radiant Victoria, and Rupert Friend - her beloved and best friend, Prince Albert. The rest of the cast is rounded with the likes of Miranda Richardson, like the Duchess of Kent, and always greeted on the screen, Jim Broadbent as King William, as well as throwing others who shine on the screen. Jean-Marc Valleis (C.R.A.Z.Y., Loser Love), director of the winning script, Julian Fellowes (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, A Separate Lie). I’m completely crazy about the look of the film (from cinematographer Hagen Bogdansker), who gave each frame of the picture a picturesque look (with the help of production director Patrice Vermette), as well as some hard editing (Jill Bilkok) and Matt Garner). In the Fellowes script, I also rated the use of the game of chess as a metaphor for the political motivation of the film (the film’s characters move like pieces on a chessboard). This is a clever, well-written, directorial, filmed, edited and acting entertainment (and enlightenment) that makes a well-spent movie night. PG rating from MPAA for several scenes of sensuality, some short-term violence (a bit bloody, though not too bloody), a rude outburst of the language, and some - smoking on the screen
