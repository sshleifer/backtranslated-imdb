This film is an amazing job. I saw him in the theater when he came out, but I was only 13 years old, and I didn’t quite “understand” ... I saw it again when I was 20 (in the video, of course, and now I own it), and was just blown away Steven Spielberg created a wonderful film that keeps you in it from start to finish. I also read a book, but there is something in the film that really animates it. Casting, acting, music, costumes, scenery, everything is just wonderful. you laugh, cry, cheer ... it brings out all thoughts. This is one of his best work not to be missed!
