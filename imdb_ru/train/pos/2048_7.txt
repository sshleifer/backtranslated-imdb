The brutal depressive script and several excellent modest speeches by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed, as well as the good location of filming in Ohio, trigger this beautiful television film about hard times in rust. When plants are closed and union jobs disappear, everything threatens the workers: management, owners, their wives and children. Strauss is quite plausible in her role, and Pamela Reed is, as always, wonderful. See if you can get to know John Goodman before he gains weight. <br /> <br /> Heavy metal - was someone making a pun? - sometimes annoyingly annoying, but Frank Stanley's cinematography is a knockout, especially the scenes of the mill.
