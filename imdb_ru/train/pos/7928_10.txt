Let's first deal with some things: a zombie does not exist, so the director can make them walk, run, damn, even fly if he wants to. That's what makes this original zombie movie so good. Everything they did was pretty damn original. I hate when filmmakers do everything like Romero or when fans expect everything like Romero. Some idiots believe that zombies should roar only as a typical Romero film, again, there are no zombies, so the director can make the zombies whistle if he wants. All the zombies in this movie look very good, but it is EXPRESS that they do not disintegrate the corpses, since they JUST die! Although they are pretty spoiled and full of split faces and blood. One of the coolest scenes was a half-eaten cat. It looked so damn real that my daughter cried when she saw it. This film received good reviews in Fangoria and Morgue Street, so I wanted to watch it. I'm glad I listened. They are always right when it comes to the tastes of true horror fans. 10 out of 10! Go rent it!
