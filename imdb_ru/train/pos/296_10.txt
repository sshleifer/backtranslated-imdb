Magnificence is how we should achieve Beauty. And the hill - the material from which this film is made. If not his best, then this is my favorite of all the films of Bogdanovich. <br /> <br /> This unique masterpiece reminds us, like most other films from the director, what (or should be) life: love, lost (or failure) and hope and faith and charity. Like the song from which the films take their name (Gershwin's famous composition), the film makes the impossible true and tries to make us realize that no one can judge anyone; all this with the ease of comedy and masterful time (the first ten minutes when the detectives follow the ladies, almost without a line of dialogue built on the views and looks of the characters - with this “touch”, based on the point of view - this is a movie lesson , which PB has learned well from its admired directors from the Golden Age of Cinema.) With a great cast and a great soundtrack (including the best of Sinatra’s Trilogy), this film, full of self-awareness and compassion, is far from indulging in its desires and emptiness ( Some critics wrote), it deserves a better place on the history of American cinema than where it was placed. It is not “long in style, not very content”: it is complex in its simplicity and beautiful, absolutely beautiful.
