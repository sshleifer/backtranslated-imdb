I think this film was one of Kurt Russell's good films. Kurt Russell is my favorite actor, so I think he is a good actor in every role he plays. But there was a lot of action in this movie, and I know that it should be more than 5.6 out of 10, but many people didnâ€™t like this movie. Oh, well, I thought it was good, so I think everyone should watch this movie. If you watch this movie and you like it, I think you should see Back Draft also with Kurt Russell. I give the Soldier *** 1/2 of *****
