Very intelligent humor. Excellent performance. I can't believe how people think it deserves 1/10! I hope that this film will be shown everywhere so that everyone can enjoy it. If you ever have the opportunity, watch it ... don't miss it. There is a part when the main actors go and sing "Happy birthday" and "el payaso plinplin" (Argentine song for children (I think ... it can also be South American, I'm not sure)). These are two songs that have the same melody ... but people usually donâ€™t understand it ... it's just great! I tried to write it in Spanish and English, because this is an Argentinean film ... but the page would not let me :( I hope you enjoy it!
