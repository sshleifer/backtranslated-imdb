One of the best films I've ever seen was an Irish film called Philadelphia, Here I Am. I read the play before I saw the movie, and I loved them both. This is a story about a young man preparing to leave Ireland to go to America, because he cannot make a living in Ireland. This is indicated both from the point of view of a young person (who can be seen by other characters of the film) and by another young person, who represents his uncensored thoughts and feelings, but which are not visible to other characters in the film. This is a very sad film, but deeply touching, and I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to think something. I like any Irish film or almost any film about Ireland, and any film in which the late Irish actor Donal McCann is present gets my vote. I would watch this person chew the cud for 2 hours on the screen, and, unfortunately, I have it. shame losing him so young.
