I just finished watching this movie and have to say that I was very impressed. Everything about him was great. Active characters, history. A believable child who has grown up to be brave is always ready to help others. His mother should be proud. I couldn't take my eyes off this movie for fear of missing something. This is a fable of a prefect with tales of morals, sweet and terrible sprites and "monsters", but nonetheless a heartbreaking people. The child is poked and bullied at the school, which becomes a hero. Chosen to be a rider at a local village festival and travel to Goblin Mountain, where he discovers the Yokai, which are amazing creations that Brian Froud would be proud of. And the evil Kato and his supporter, who definitely needed a hug. These evil people seize Yokai and throw them into a red pit along with unwanted objects, such as motorcycles and other mechanical things, and they unite into one awfully strong monster robot whose only task is to kill. Takashi is a boy who will become their savior, along with a red man / dragon, a tortoise man and a river princess, as well as a cute little creature who, if it were America, could turn it into a nice toy and sell it generally good toy stores . The lines are good, especially do not try to do it at home, children and other jewels that cause a smile on your lips. Stop the faith and watch it with your child or on your own and enjoy! Although I must admit that the end was a little sad. And not necessarily so. Chera Furdion
