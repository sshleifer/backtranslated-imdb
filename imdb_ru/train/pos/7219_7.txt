Unlike the Tinseltown HELLO, DOLLY !, version of Jay Presson Allen’s screen adaptation to Ira’s Broadway thriller, Levin couldn’t wait for his stage performance to close before putting it on a silver screen, so the producers wisely decided to make the most of its duration. White Way Run! The opening and closing scenes of the film are filmed in the intimate New York Theater Music Box, where DEATHTRAP has been playing for almost five years. Even the final disappearance of the film on the theater tent is a version of the famous theatrical production logo. (Although marketers decided to go with a more fun Rubik's cube icon for the film.) <br /> <br /> Now on an inexpensive DVD release, DEATHTRAP looks as fresh and inventive as before. The cast is correct (better than their stage colleagues), and location scouts should be welcomed to find a suitable eerie building for our “three rooms with two actors” to take place. Opened in surprisingly simple and innovative ways, director Sydney Lumet wisely ticks any “new” material at the beginning and end of the film and leaves the angry, sinuous center of Levin alone. <br /> <br /> The last scene of the film is a big Hollywood break from the boards, and it slightly undermines one of Levine's plot points to an earlier one in the film [Helga (about the dagger): “It will be used by another woman because of the game” .]. As in the case of Robert Altman's “PLAYER”, our new final helps the film to open up again and blurs the lines between the stage, the screen and (can it be?) Real life!
