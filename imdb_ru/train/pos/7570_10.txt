I recently bought a very underrated Dreamcast and went to the city to find some games to use them. I bought a Soul Calibur (Classic) and then stepped over the Resident Evil Code Veronica area. I have Resident Evil 1 & 2, and I played Res Evil 3 many times, and I was impressed with all of them, especially No. 1, which should go down in history, has classics. <br /> <br /> But none of them came close to trying to make an amazing game in the game Brilliant Gory. If it's just for the sake of buying a dreamcast for this game, it is worth every moment of your time and effort, I have never been so passionate about computer games as it won me over. <br /> <br /> In any case, the story continues from the 2nd story, in which Claire Redfield is looking for his brother (Chris from 1st story), who is supposed to go missing in collusion with a scary corporation. Little is known about this corporation, except for the fact that you, although you destroyed them 3 times in previous floors. <br /> <br /> So, when you help Claire along with super-helper guy Steve, you must uncover the truth about your brother's real whereabouts. The second CD allows you to control Chris, that is, if you manage to move so far without running out of the room in fear. <br /> <br /> The controls are very smooth, and the movements of the characters are superbly realistic, when the character notices the danger, he / she faces the direction from which he emanates. PURE GENIUS !! <br /> <br /> In general, I gave this game 10/10, because itâ€™s just the game of the year, the game of the decade and the best game in the world! Please buy this game as soon as possible.
