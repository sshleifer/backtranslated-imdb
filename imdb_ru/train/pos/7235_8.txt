Madness of the Girls is a kind of comedic, semi-modular view of the film industry of the mid-1910s. We get a glimpse of life in an early film studio, where we watch a film set assembling, jogging around the stage, adoring movie fans, even lunch at the commissary. We are also familiar with little-known cinematic facts - for example, did you know that “often the actors of the cinema don't know the plot of the picture in which they work”? <br /> <br /> The plot of the film This film is essentially the discovery of movie star Kenneth Driscoll and the young budding starlet, which he discovers during filming in the country. I believe that the 30-minute version that I watched was shortened and included in the same tape as Cecil B. Mill's “The Deception”. This is a very trustworthy movie - a light watch with a wide range of add-ons. As a bonus, it includes some of the best illustrated signatures I've ever seen accompanying silent movies.
