This is one of the most amazing stories I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If this film were shot by Larry Clark, then this story about school shooting would probably have been shown through the eyes of the killer and what made this person go crazy from the very beginning. <br /> Instead, the plot focuses mainly on the effects of school shooting and on how it affected the survivors. <br /> <br /> I have seen Busy Phillips in other films before, but her performance in this film is definitely her best. The only other film I’ve seen with Erica Christensen is The Float Fan, which I almost didn’t want to watch this film, but she herself played very well. <br /> <br /> This is one of several films I have seen that could really make me cry. Believe me, when I tell you, it doesn't happen very often. <br /> <br /> Home Room is a great movie, and that's all it takes ...
