A shocking, well-made chiller is an underrated story about brutal murders and evil forces. <br /> <br /> A small town doctor is trying to figure out who or what is committing a series of violent sexual killings. <br /> Incubus is a fierce mystery, with some horrific murder episodes, which turns into an unusual and eerie climatic turn. Murder scenes are intense and bloody, so this is not a film for squeamish! The direction of John Hough along with the bizarre musical accompaniment create a dark atmosphere of fear that permeates the entire film. It also carries a gothic atmosphere. Also stand out good places for filming and stylish work with the camera. <br /> <br /> The cast is also good. The great John Cassavetes perfectly copes with the role of the new doctor in the city. Kerry Keane as a local reporter, Helen Hughes as a city historian and Duncan Mackintosh as a harassed psychic are also good speeches. <br /> <br /> All around Incubus is a forgotten horror movie that needs to be repeated. -discovered and overvalued. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
