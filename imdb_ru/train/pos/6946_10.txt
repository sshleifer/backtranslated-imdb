24 must be the best spy / adventure series ever broadcast. The very idea of ​​telling a story for 24 hours in real time is dazzling. Shooting style and tempo - that's what attracts us to view. And Jack Bauer is one of the greatest main characters of the series for a long time. I appreciate it along with my three favorite shows, The Simpsons and The X-Files. <br /> <br /> This first episode begins with a plot to assassinate US Senator David Palmer, who is also running for president. Bauer is summoned to his office to find out who is behind all this, and, at the same time, to find out his daughter’s way to the unknown after fleeing from her bedroom. Thus, the adventure begins in the best political style, and, best of all, it is that it always happens in real time, which makes this series a real original work at a time when it seems that almost every television program shows us some and the same things over and over and over.
