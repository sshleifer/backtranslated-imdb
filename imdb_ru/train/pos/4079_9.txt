I first saw this film when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK (where it was called “Lapta: Flying Island”). I absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it happened some time later, and I missed it. I was fascinated by history and characters, but most of all by haunting and beautiful music. This would be the original English dubbed version that I saw - sometimes mistakenly called “Streamline Dub” (in fact, it was recorded by Ghibli themselves and distributed only to Streamline), which, unfortunately, is not available, except for a part of the ridiculously expensive laser disc. box set. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel that the release was partially spoiled by Disney. The voice acting is fine, but the dialogue does not have the same raw energy as that of the “orderly” dub or the original Japanese, and I think that James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the main role. They made some meaningless changes, such as changing the name of the protagonist from “Pazu” to “Patzu”, and added a dialogue. But worst of all, I feel that they destroyed many scenes of obsessive music — for example, the initial airship scene was initially quiet, but was spoiled by the Disney’s retarded requirement that when someone doesn’t speak, the music should sound, which I find annoying in many Disney movies. <br /> <br /> This film still amazes with the latest animated films, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. The plot is simple, but fascinating, and the film shows talent, which, unfortunately, is absent in most modern mass markets, homogenized animation.
