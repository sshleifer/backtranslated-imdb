This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I watched it on a DVD and there are no special features on the disc or even a menu, but this is not necessarily what worries me. <br /> <br /> I am inclined to judge the films in each specific case, depending, among other things, on whether it is a large studio production or a small film. This is a small film, and I'm ready to forgive the little things. Nevertheless, I believe that he has one of the most original and original title series I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I liked the game of all the major players. I especially liked Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has the funniest features. The character depicted by Claire Forlani may seem unrealistic for some people, but I personally know real people with emotional problems who look at life decisions very willingly just like her character. This helped me to understand the nuances that could cause her pain to manifest through the veneer of her humor. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is not a film for children, but it is NOT engaged in unreasonable sex and exposure. However, there is not much adult language, but sometimes it can be very funny. (In particular, the character of Alan Arkin, who can not even swear correctly.) <br /> <br /> Also watch out for cameos from famous characters actors.
