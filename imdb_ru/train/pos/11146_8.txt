A fascinating story about a potential man in New York, forced to live in a doomed building with a crippled fraudster. An extremely dull study of modern moral and social decay, extremely well directed by John Schlesinger (who never led his work here) and acted superbly by John Voight and Dustin Hoffman. In general, this is quite difficult, but the “fantastic” scenes, some of which are played out for laughter, are a bit intrusive, like the “fashionable” drug party. The relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental, but the filmmakers try not to become soft, and this gives the film an advantage that it would not have with a smaller director than Schlesinger. Initially, the X-rating in 1969, and the winner in the nomination "Best Oscar Film"; screenwriter Waldo Salt (who adapted the book of James Leo Herilhee) and Schlesinger also won the statues. *** 1/2 of ****
