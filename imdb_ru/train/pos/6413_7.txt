Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook and all the other actors and actresses of the Honor of the People have teamed up to make this film beautiful. Mark Isham wrote the film, so you know the music is also really good. <br /> <br /> But: from the very beginning I noticed many trivia, loopholes and too dramatic heart forceps. I had to take an oath to ignore them and sit back to enjoy the film. If you can do it, it is _really_is_ good. <br /> <br /> The story of Karl Brashir, a true hero, is inspiring enough to last a lifetime. Look for it on the Internet ... The whole story is more amazing than the film, as the director admitted in his comments. In World War II, there were only three African-American divers of the US Navy. However, no one has achieved the status of the US Navy. Karl Brashear was the first African American master fleet of the United States. And he was the first amputee diver who was ever certified or re-certified as a US Navy diver. (Loud applause). <br /> <br /> On the negative side of the movie book. Should I tell you just about one of the many "loopholes"? Yes, I will mark this comment as containing “spoilers” and I will do so ... Early, the key scene, when the helicopter crashes into the radio mast and lowers into the sea: they never had time to put on a full mark V diver, even if was the legendary Commander-in-Chief Billy Sunday, “just a couple of minutes late” in time to save the pilot. <br /> <br /> So, for loopholes, stupidities, and because of excessive dramatization, I lowered the number of “Honest People” from 10 ideal to 7. <br /> <br /> Will Hollywood EVER understand is pure truth much better than their excessive dramatic approach to storytelling? I doubt. Very bad!
