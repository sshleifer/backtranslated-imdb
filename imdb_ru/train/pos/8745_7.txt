After graduation, best friends Alice and Darlene decide to go on a trip to Thailand. While they are there, they meet a charming Australian guy named Nick. After spending some time with Nick, he asks them if they want to go with him to Hong Kong for the weekend. They agree. They are arrested at the airport for drug smuggling, and then sentenced to 33 years in a Thai prison for what they said they did not do. Not knowing what to do, they stop contacting American lawyer Yanki Hank, who lives in Thailand with his wife. According to rumors, if you have money, he can help you. Things start off well, but they still can't get out. <br /> <br /> The film is really good because it doesn’t make it clear what will happen and it is interesting all the time I could not believe the ending, though. It was one of those endings when you don’t know 100% of the truth, but you still know what really happened to Nick and the drug smuggling because of “obsession”, etc. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both give good results here. Beckinsales performance was a bit weak though. And the friendship with the Danes, and with Beckinsales, the friendship is good, but it may seem stronger Paul Walker even has a small uncredited role. ;) Anyway, I think that Brokedown Palace is a good movie, and I give it 7/10.
