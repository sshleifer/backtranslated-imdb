Ok, sorry, but I liked this movie. I just like the movie genre of the 80s of this genre, because many people don't like it anymore! I want to ask all of you, people who say that this film is just plagiarism or stupid imitation, what does it imitate? I have never seen a film like this, well, in any case, it's not terrible. <br /> <br /> This is mainly a popular school group that likes to make a living for everyone, so they decided to choose this film. nerdy boy named marti. It becomes fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little jokes. <br /> <br /> So, 10 years have passed, and a group of friends who have hurt Marty are starting to receive letters about high school reunion. But ... they are the only ones who get them! Therefore, they are returning to the old school, and one by one they are confused ....... Yes, you probably know what is happening! <br /> <br /> The only part that disappointed me is the end. It could stop or come up with better. <br /> <br /> I think you should try and not criticize! <br /> <br /> ~ * ~ CupidGrl ~ * ~
