Not many people love the Bertrand Blier films simply because they don’t understand them. Just because they are different people. <br /> <br /> If you have not lived in deep despair, intertwined with great personal hope, it can be difficult to enjoy the humor shown here. <br /> <br /> And also the film “Blir” cannot be easily classified as “black comedy” or “cult”, etc., for example, films about fiction, etc. Because of this delicacy, which North American viewers often cannot appreciate. <br /> <br /> When I looked at these two “hooligans” who dined with Jean Moreau in a seaside restaurant, I felt that they were more noble than any gentleman could be. <br /> <br /> The desire to make love is as wild as this is a normal reaction that we feel under the unbearable pressure of a meaningless creature symbolized by kamions that suddenly appear in Carrefour. <br /> <br /> SO, les valseuses are much better than the name of the place to go. To dance a waltz, you need to be elegant, and go somewhere wrong.
