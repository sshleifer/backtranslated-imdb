I really liked this film, seen this evening on the big screen of the cinema! The audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things, and the fast paced was the most pleasant. <br /> <br /> I, as a singer and music director, ask the question of one part of Roby Keeler’s vocal in the film “At the Falls”. "The key was modulated, and she suddenly started singing in a much quieter, very soft voice that had no resemblance to some kind of tin, higher twitter voice that she used in all her other vocals. <br /> <br /> Someone Does this have been rewritten by another singer? It sounds to me. I would like to know. <br /> <br /> Thanks a lot.
