This is one of those films / pilots that, if you knew BattleStar Galactica, it helps, but not necessarily. What makes this story even more believable than BSG is that it is not so far in the future. It is so deep that it is amazing that it was not released theatrically. In such an experienced and talented enough actors could not be better to choose the main role. Eric Stoltz is great as a father who will do everything to reunite with his daughter, no matter how real she is, and he will do it, regardless of cost. Paula Malcomson from Deadwood is also famous for his wife. You are not quite sure of his motives, be it love, money, or both, but this is what makes this pilot even more intriguing. I see a star in the creation of Zoe, played by the unknown Alessandra Torresani and her performance. Esay Morales is amazingly eager to see his beloved again and just how wrong it is to even think about what he wants more than his moral objections. I did not think it would be a good idea to announce this, but only from one pilot I’m excited to see how we got to the BSG scene. It is great to see Adam as a child, already influenced by various types of robots, which are beginning to penetrate life at this stage. I just hope that they can continue the story so that we can even more find out how they got humanoid robots. This is almost the perfect pilot, and I hope they can continue the fantastic storytelling. Even visual effects are better than most of the garbage that you see on the big screen. If you don’t get into BSG, @ at least try it, and I’m willing to bet that you will become a fan and want to know how the BSG story came about.
