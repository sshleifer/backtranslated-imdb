The Tornado Man (1976) is in many ways a better film than its predecessor. The director knew what he had to work with, and he took into account the limitations of Rudy Ray Moore as an actor. This is a fun movie, more technically sound and played. Performers do not take themselves too seriously, and it seems that this time everyone is joking and swimming with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore looks more relaxed in front of the camera and not as cool as in Dolemit. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie, and I highly recommend it. Like his first film, he is targeted at a specific audience (I very much doubt that Mr. Moore was trying to expand his audience at this stage of his career). Check this! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
