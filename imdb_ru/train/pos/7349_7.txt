Of course, if you're reading my review, you've already seen this movie. Raja Babu is one of my favorite characters. I just love the concept of a spoiled guy with a 24 * 7 servant on his motorcycle. Watch movies, imitate characters, etc. I like the scene when, during a meal, a stone cracks in the mouth of cadre khans. Also, where Shakti Kapur tells a banal story about the affairs of Raji Baba at the dinner table, and Govinda in the form of "Dharam-fan" makes sentimental remarks. This is my favorite movie scene. The scene “Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon” is just the chemistry between two great Indian actors who make a comic scene without dialogue. It's great. This is a movie about a cat mouse. Just watch how these actors help each other and still take the stage from each other. His total entertainment. If you like the chemistry of Govinda and Kader-Khan, then this is a must. I think RB takes the 6th place on my list of David Dhavan. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein', 'Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie no 1 'precede this jewel of the film. 7/10.
