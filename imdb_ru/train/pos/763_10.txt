This film changed everything for me ... I heard about break dance and hip-hop, but I never saw it professionally done (hey, I was an 11-year-old kid from Holland!) When I saw this film, everything has changed. I actively participated in the hip-hop movement in our city, started to break dance and write poetry. <br /> <br /> To this day, I still consider this film to be my favorite. Of course, filming and “cinematic” significance may not be as significant. But who cares whether a wide-format shot was taken or you could see a microphone hanging over someone? This is what it does to you personally, what matters ...
