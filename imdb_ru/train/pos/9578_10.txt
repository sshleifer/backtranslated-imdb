As others have mentioned, all the women who are naked in this film are basically absolutely gorgeous. The plot very skillfully shows the hypocrisy of female libido. When men are near, they want to be chased, but when there are no “men” around, they become the pursuers of a 14-year-old boy. And the boy very quickly becomes a man (we should all be so lucky at this age!). Then he takes courage to pursue his true love.
