Kurt Russell is strong and (mostly) silent in this futuristic action movie from Paul Anderson (“Event Horizon”, “Resident Evil”). He is on a trash planet, the Soldier plays like a cross between Rambo and Shane, and Russell barely speaks the title character, an "obsolete" genetic soldier left for death. Supports the cast of the colonists, including Connie Nielsen, Shaun Pertvey and the amazingly hot Michael Chiklis. Most of the movie they fear Russell, and the rest of the movie is for their lives. Russell's presentation here is one of the best he has ever given. Almost without words to convey, he conveys emotions, feelings and meaning with looks and looks. This is almost a pantomime. When action sequences are turned on, he kicks ass - and does it in a strong, silent, factual way. There are drawbacks. Jason Scott Lee is an "excellent" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs makes a big impression on Frank Burns from M * A * S * H ​​as a weasel commander, and Gary Busey breaks his gut (and nearly breaks his belt) as Todd's mentor. It is an unappreciated and excellent science fiction film, and is recommended for anyone who wants to visit the Blade Runner universe for the second time - David Webb People has written both scripts.
