Episode two in the first season is a delightful festive tale of love, betrayal ... and killed by a madman, dressed as Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> A woman (Mary Ellen-Traynor) just killed her husband on Christmas Eve for his life insurance. What begins as a crime begins a struggle for survival, because a psychopath dressed as Santa Claus and dressed as Santa Claus (Larry Drake, immaculate top) threatens her life ... and also her precious young daughters. <br /> <br /> This episode is warmly remembered even by those who are accidentally familiar with the program. By the way, it is this reviewer who watches it every Christmas as usual. Most notable is the escalation of indecision and narrative twists, and All Through The Houst is one of the best stories from The Crypt.
