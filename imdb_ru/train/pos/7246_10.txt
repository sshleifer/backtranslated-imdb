This film is absolutely funny. Not only is the plot terrible, but also acting horror. Special effects asininovye, and the whole film takes place in the post-apocalyptic desert. However, this is by far the funniest film ever to receive production permission. This is 101 minutes of laughter due to the fact that we all know that in the 3000th year or in El Kamino there will be no fuel. There are other aspects that I will not spoil, just because they make films such wonderful idiots. I highly recommend this film, simply because of its complete idiocy. I have no idea who will be watching this, expecting that this will be a quality function, but if you need laughter, see “Fighter Year 3000”
