I would say that this is one of the best cartoons I have ever seen. I liked it the first time, but I really appreciated it in the second viewing, just a few weeks ago. I can understand why the sequel does such big things at the box office. Apparently, many people liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous color palette (dude, it looks good) and a lot of good adult (but clean) humor make it a big winner. The first 3-4 minute scene with “Skat” is great, as are the subsequent breaks with it. The "sid" of a sloth (voiced by John Leguizano), however, provides the main humor in the film. He usually has something funny to say during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the voice of a mammoth, literally the main character of the film, and Denis Leary is a fierce bad guy who has become a good saber-toothed tiger <br /> <br /> This is not just humor and beautiful colors, but pleasant A sentimental story of how a small child softens a couple of tough characters. This is not interrupted by many songs: only one short, and there is nothing offensive in terms of language. <br /> <br /> If more animated films were so good, I would get more.
