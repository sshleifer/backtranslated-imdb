The guys work outside the recording studio when they hear the "voice of the angel." It would be Miss Van Doren, auditioned and held under the name of Miss Andrews, because her father does not approve of her role as a radio singer. However, she hopes that some big wig, Mrs. Bixby, her father's girlfriend, will hire her, and then he will have to give her approval. <br /> <br /> She leaves, but after a few minutes the boys run. I was in the studio, causing chaos and forcing other musicians to kill them after they spoiled the recording. Finally, everything will calm down. “So, we slipped away from them,” says Mo. “Yes, we left too,” replies Curly. <br /> <br /> The boys are fooling around in the studio, they put Miss Van Doren on the record, and Curley puts on women's clothes and pretends to sing. Mrs. Bixby enters, is impressed and hires "Seniorita Cucacha" on the spot! For an extra $ 500, she was asked to come and sing at their social party that night. The rest, as they say, is history, as Curley pretends to be an opera singer with funny results. Oh, by the way, he accompanied the "Elder Mucho" and "Elder Gasto." <br /> <br /> At a party, what happens is that truth wins, but not before several pranks happen. Overall, a pretty good episode. I enjoyed it, but would not rate it as something special.
