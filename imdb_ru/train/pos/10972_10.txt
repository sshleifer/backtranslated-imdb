I only saw this recently, but I knew about it for a number of years and was always intrigued by its name. Now it belongs to me as one of my favorite films. It is difficult to describe the incredible theme discovered by Mazles, but everything in it works great. There are so many memorable images and moments when you feel that you are invading a very private world. I fell in love with this movie and characters. The filmmakers seemed to have fascinated the audience and dragged us into the strange world of eccentric Bilov, a real aristocratic family. A tangible atmosphere reigns in it, and I felt that I wanted to be away from all this, preparing corn on the cob by the nightstand. There is a sadness in it that pervades everywhere. Fall from greatness for this once-respected family. The money was gone, but their beauty and grace remained just like their beauty. It attracted me from the first frame, and soon after the end of the film I found myself wondering about their fate. Interestingly, if I walk along East Hampton's beach, I can still hear the voice of Old Edie at night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging liana. Unforgettable.
