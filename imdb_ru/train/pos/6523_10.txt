Of course, the story in this film was “Hollywood”, but this is not the only part of the story that was rewritten for the masses. Lafitte sided with the Americans because he considered himself a Frenchman and therefore hated the British, and not because of a sense of patriotism towards the nation that had seized New Orleans quite recently; he violated his agreement and returned to smuggling, which led him to sail to Galveston; he was more like a petty criminal and a bastard than a hero * or * crook. But who cares? This is one film that is real entertainment - and, frankly, we all wanted Jin to go after the angry girl, not the brave daughter of the governor. Brynner rises above the mediocre letter to give a spectacular presentation.
