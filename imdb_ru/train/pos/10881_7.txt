“Cut” is a complete deception of the slasher genre, and basically it achieves what it intends to do. Most standard slash clichés are there; an old creepy house, a forest, an anonymous indestructible serial killer, buckets of blood and, of course, a couple interrupted by the killer during sex (this is hardly a spoiler). <br /> <br /> Recruitment is simplicity itself: film school nerds are going to complete an unfinished slasher with a “masterpiece” unfinished due to the killing of a couple of actors. It's also neat - good, dirty - eliminates Kylie Minogue on the first drum. They are joined by one of the survivors of the original film, played by Molly Ringwald, who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines. The rest of the cast is great for their roles, especially sweet Jessica Napier, who plays her straight until chaos and blood break out around her. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of red herrings and fake anxious moments with very little time to try to figure out who the killer is, because the film is moving at such a fast pace. It also has a corresponding low-budget view, including awkward editing, which is probably intentional. Good soundtrack too. If difficulties arise with this film, he decides whether it will be a slogan or a tribute to the slasher genre. Probably a bit of both.
