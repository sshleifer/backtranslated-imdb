My family and I have watched this film often for many years. It is pure, wholesome, heartbreaking and warming. Showing us compassion between two families of two countries at a distance of thousands of miles from each other and by the strangest coincidences, it is almost as if the hand of God intervened. <br /> <br /> 5 years old Jodel Micah Ferland, who plays Desi, a heart-struck little girl, does an excellent job of fulfilling her role, and for me she was Priam's choice for the main role. <br /> <br /> In general, 10 out of 10. No Disadvantages of this sweet human story. Children of all ages will have tears in their eyes and then look at it with joy, and this will bring the family together with smiles and kind feelings.
