My first acquaintance with "Whale Music" was the self-titled album Rheostatics, which I bought around 1993. I read the liner notes, and the group said that the album, which remains in a prominent place in my collection, was inspired by Canadians. book author Paul Quarrington. <br /> <br /> I took the book a few months later and ate it! Amazing reading! Since then, I have re-read the book many times, each time finding some new element for Desmond and his desire to finish whale music. <br /> <br /> I found the movie in 1996 on video. I didn't have a lot of good experience with a Canadian film, but this one worked for me. The role of Claire could have been played differently, but overall, I think that Paul Quarringtonâ€™s vision was well transferred from the book to the screen. <br /> <br /> Mori Chaykin gives a spectacular performance as an isolated genius. The film is about family relationships, love, and finding someone who understands. I would strongly recommend "Whale Music" not only to music lovers, but also to everyone who has ever lost something or someone tried to find their way back to the world.
