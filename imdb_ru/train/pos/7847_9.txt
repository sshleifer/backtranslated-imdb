Believe it or not, after 12 minutes this film (for 1912) is a full-length film. Very, very few films were longer than this then, but this is definitely NOT what distinguishes this strange little film from the rest! No, the difference is that all the actors (with the exception of one frog) are beetles ... yes, beetles! This simple little home comedy might look very much like Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder, but instead, Russian production uses errors (or, I think, models that look the same as errors). Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy have not yet been discovered, and I assume that Linder was busy, so maybe that's why they used bugs! Using Stop-Motion, the bugs moved, danced, and fought surprisingly well — and damn more realistic than King Kong 21 years later! <br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that Mr. Beetle slipped away for a while. He goes to an obscene club, and his wife is supposedly waiting at home. But unfortunately for Mr. Zhuk, he is filmed by a local movie buff. Plus, he doesn’t know it, but Mrs. Zhuk also continues with the bohemian grasshopper artist. Of course, this home comedy is much more than this, but the plot is very old and very interesting for both adults and children. <br /> <br /> Strange, but also very surprising and watchable.
