Emily Watson, known as Breaking the Waves, starred in this film. This film is about the obsession of one person at a resort where a chess tournament is held. The chess master comes and soon after that falls madly in love (at first glance) with the woman played by Emily Watson. She falls in love with this strange man who is obsessed with chess. All this is worrying her mother, who is much more interested in seeing her with another young gentleman; real gentleman. Her mother feels that this is just a passing fantasy for a young woman, as she tends to take strange animals and the like. Basically it is a journey through the human psyche. He tells the story of how his past is closely related to his present. Emily Watson is amazing in this, as is the actor who plays the main character. It is definitely slow, but worth seeing. The ending was even satisfactory. :)
