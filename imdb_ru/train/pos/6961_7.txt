The name caught my attention, and then I wondered what would come out in the plot, because over the years we have seen a lot of films about “super people” ... and in fact, I really liked it, because there were a lot of funny scenes which I did not expect. Uma Thurman acted as the average G-Girl. Surprisingly, I was again able to watch her fingers on the big screen (as in the beginning of "Kill Bill"). Luke Wilson, however, played very well an idiotic ordinary guy who meets a big woman, and I really could get into his situation. If you want a light touch of fun, you should definitely watch out for the adventures of G-Girl and Mid-Matt, especially to cheer up your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
