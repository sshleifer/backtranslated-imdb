Pinjar by Mr Dwivedi is a terrific movie. This is definitely the best and best of 2003. It has very good performances. Dwivedi knows that he can extract Urmil from the mast. she, as you have never seen before. one really great presentation. together with her is a wonderful actor Manoj Baipai, who showed Bollywood that he and Bhika Mathra. The film tells about a girl (Urmile) living in Pakistan before the section she is from a Punjab family living in a small town. she was abducted by a Muslim as part of a perennial fight with the Punjabi family. and then a series of turns follows, since the marriage of Urmila should take place in a few days. This film is really a very good film. storyline with a terrific script. all performances, such as lillete duby, isha koppikar (you don't believe, but it can act just like jus dancin on Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many other these sets with preliminary section Pakistan, costumes, cinematography, sound, background evaluation add to positive points. from beginning to end, you are stuck in your place asking what's next? This film is not worth watching, but it deserves to be part of your movie collection. The final scene is the end of the movie. I would advise all these No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-gum-and-No-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai crowds to watch this amazing movie. My rating: 10/10.
