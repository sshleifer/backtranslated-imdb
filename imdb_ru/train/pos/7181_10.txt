Eyeliner was worn almost 6000 years ago in Egypt. In fact, not so much for this to be in the 12th century. I also did not understand that the series failed. Now is the second season, isn't it? I am surprised when those who are ill-informed or do not watch the show comment. This is a waste of space on the boards and the time of others. The first show of the series was perhaps a bit painful, as the cast began to fall into place, but this is to be expected from any show. The rest of the first season is great. I can't wait to start the second season in the United States.
