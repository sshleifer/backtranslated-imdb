There are several things in this movie. This is the story "I feel good." Characters and actors are cute, realistic and represent beautiful performances. The most important thing, I suppose, is that Dennis Quaid knows how to grab and throw a baseball. Robert Redford looked good, throwing and swinging the bat in “Natural”, and Kevin Costner in “For the love of the game” and “Bull Durham.” In the Major League, Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen looked like they knew what they were doing, but many others did not, and this picture was sheer nonsense — and not very funny. <br /> <br /> Many earlier baseball films, even where stories may be interesting, represented such a lack of baseball ability on the part of the leaders, they were ridiculous in this regard. In Stratton Story and Strategic Air Command, Jimmy Stewart looked as believable as a professional baseball player, just like your extra weight, not athletic, elderly uncle in a game of family reunion softball. Other brave and physically strong stars (for example, Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig; Robald Reagan as Alexander Grover Cleveland; and Dan Daley as Dizzy Dean) also showed a certain baseball ability that they were in the last rounds, while Sunday picnic games (even if you study together, and even if your uncle was involved). <br /> <br /> The scenes of the Quaid high school team that he coached, those where he participates in testing with the rays of the devil, and those with whom he plays in the two top leagues and in the American league ring true. The participants are believable and capable. In addition, he is an attractive actor who always gives a talented and suitable characterization (with the exception, to some extent, of some of his “excessive” scenes and his forced accent in his depiction of Jerry Lee Lewis). But he is definitely on target, and this film is “9”, as good or better as any other in this genre, except “The Natural”.
