Dr. Mordrid, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs did it again! <br /> <br /> Anton Mordrid has been on Earth for 100 years, awaiting the arrival of the Kabbalah, the evil sorcerer, so that he can kill him. Mordrid and Kabal trained together in childhood, so Mordrid knows all the tricks of Kabbalah. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, the film is a bit confusing, but soon you will feel like a part of this action. I will not play the ending, so go and see Dr. Mordried! <br /> <br /> I found the film very enjoyable because there is no violence or sex scenes in it. The film focuses on the plot and that's what I like! I believe that the best films are those where time flies by. This is because you are so passionate about the movie. Dr. Mordrid is a fantastic movie! I give it 20 out of 10. Worth seeing! <br /> <br />
