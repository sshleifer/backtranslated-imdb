I recently saw this movie and I really liked it. This gives an idea of ​​the creation of indie films and how much work is really required when you have a small budget, but it takes the name of an actor / actress to attract people, all the people who would come to see and show the film. Bobby Myers, played by Modin and his partner Saul - Paul Linder, makes an excellent combination by finding the eccentric Mayakel Bates, Actor NAME, played by Alan Bates, who was the perfect solution for the actors in the film and for the film. My favorite cast was Sandy Ryan, who was played by the magnificent and underrated Debra Kara Unger with her own special performance in the film as part of the film. If you like to think when you watch a comedy, then this is for you. A low budget corresponds to a low budget with a high content of laughter.
