No one would argue that this military film of 1945 was a masterpiece. (How can any war movie of 1945 be a masterpiece?) Still, this is an extremely effective story of Al Schmidt’s believable story, blinded on Guadalcanal, as John Garfield, who wore eye patch all day to catch the nuances. about the actions of a blind person. Robert Lecky in "Helmet for my pillow" refutes the popularity of Schmidt in favor of his partner, who was killed by writing that "the country must be living heroes." <br /> <br /> Well, I suppose the country did. And they had one here. The film has a single battle scene tied to a studio party that lasts only ten minutes or so, and takes place less than halfway through the film instead of being kept for a climax, but this is the scariest and most realistic portrayal of people. under fire, which I remember, I saw on the screen, including in "Saving Private Ryan." People scream with fear, scream at each other and at the enemy, bleed and die without the help of color, stereo sound, squibs or blood. <br /> <br /> Just from a technological point of view, an outstanding film. We will not just find out how complex the 30-gauge water-cooled Browning machine-gun mechanism is, or that it needs to be launched in bursts of just a few shots, or that it is not waving as fire hose, as in many other war films. Technical precision adds an exciting scene quality. The need to stick with short bursts is terrifying when dozens of screaming enemies pour over a stream fifty feet away for the sole purpose of destroying you and your two isolated comrades chained to a small shooting range. <br /> <br /> The performances are solid, if not bravura, including the widespread support of the 1940s, John Ridgeley and the radiant young Eleanor Parker. The love story in the frame is a spare one, but it works and, in the end, is quite touching. Striking dream sequence is included. This is not Bunuel, but for the usual 1945 film, it stands out as original and effective. <br /> <br /> Albert Maltz may have rewritten the script or someone else changed it. He could have used such pruning, which could introduce a much needed ambiguity. However, there are strange verbal punctuation marks that surprisingly affect the viewer: “Why didn't God strike me dead?” And “In the Eyes, Lee. Get them in the Eyes!” Depths of longing in a few banal words. And an amazing amount of bitterness expressed by wounded veterans in a 1945 war movie. <br /> <br /> Notes that may seem false to the modern viewer, but perhaps should not be: an obsolete language that is hard to believe for many of today's children, ever really spoken - “private chatter”, “ dope ”,“ drip ”,“ Gee ”,“ you are a stupid coot, ”“ lady ”,“ tough guy ”and“ pity yourself. ”Let's look at the historical context and be kind in our judgments. At that time, some of this blunt jargon was at the forefront. <br /> <br /> Real weaknesses? Wounded veterans get together and argue with each other about Oh, how many collective futures they have, and the dispute is too simply resolved with the conclusion: "If you have a silver plate in your head, this does not mean that people will think you are a bad person." Sometimes there are offscreen and silent prayers that are unnecessary. and completely unimaginable. "Please, God, let him come back to me," and the like. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers worked in the conditions of their time. Maybe that's why the final disappearance takes place in the Hall of Independence, and the inspirational sounds of “Beautiful America” swell up from behind. <br /> <br /> None of this can undo the merits of a film that are significant, especially the influence of this horrific battle scene. This is not on television that often. If you have a chance, be sure to use it.
