Henry the Fool is the best movie. But this is the perfect way to continue a movie like “Henry the Fool.” Take Henry very seriously, his "lies" and his mysterious aura. Even the first shot of “Henry the Fool”, when Simon puts his ear to the ground, when Henry walks over the hill, is more fully manifested through “Fay Grim”. Supernatural jokes that are more or less meta-jokes (about writing the film and the jokes themselves) are good, but the opening of the film is a bit saturated in them. In addition, Hartley’s use of the Dutch corners in the entire film is annoying, yes, this intention, but it seems forced and overly used, it goes beyond a sharp irritation, which I would like to call irritating. This is an erroneous film, but it must be seen by any Hartley or Henry the Fool fan. <br /> <br /> And don’t listen to stupid reviews, don’t watch it if you haven’t seen the first movie. The intrigue, satire and wit of this film are completely lost if you have not yet seen Henry the Fool. This is a sequel. This is just stupid.
