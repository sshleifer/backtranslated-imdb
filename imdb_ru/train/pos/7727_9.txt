PROHIBITED PLANET is the best SF film of the golden age of SF cinema, and what makes it great is the feeling of surprise. As soon as the spacecraft lands, the spectators - through the crew of the ship - travel through an intellectual and sometimes terrifying adventure. We meet the unforgettable Robbie, the mysterious doctor Morbuis, his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair and learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - Krell, who died out overnight. Or are they? <br /> <br /> You can quibble and say that the planet is clearly filmed in a film studio with painted backgrounds, but this reinforces the feeling of the threat of claustrophobia that I feel, and the electronic music of Bebe and Louis Barron adds even more atmosphere <br /> <br /> I'm shocked, this film is not among the top 250 IMDB films.
