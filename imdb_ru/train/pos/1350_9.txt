In Anne of the Green Gables (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (OP Heggi), middle-aged brothers and sisters, who live together on a farm in green gables in Avonla, on Prince Edward Island, decided take the boy from a distant orphanage to help on their farm. But an orphan sent by him is a premature 14-year-old girl named Anne Shirley (Don Evelyn Paris is a veteran of the Disney Alice series of shorts who will later accept the name of her character). <br /> <br /> Ann was only 11 years old in the novel source Lucy Maud Montgomery, but the same actress could not reliably go from 11 to student age throughout the story. The film suffers somewhat from this concession, as many of Anna’s reactions and much of what she says are more interesting from an eleven-year-old. As in the book, Ann is bright and fast, she wants to please, but is unhappy with her name, physique, freckles and long red hair. However, being a child of imagination, Ann gets a lot of joy from life and quickly adapts to her new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> In fact, Ann is the original “Queen of Drama”. The film's screenwriter decided to focus on this aspect of her character. What turned the main genre from a slightly funny family drama into a comedy. A change that delighted the audience and continues to disappoint purist readers. <br /> <br /> Since the comedy largely corresponds to the spirit of the history of Montgomery, I see no reason to argue with the changes, but let it serve as a fair warning for those who expect absolutely correct adaptation. The element of comedy is the strength of the film, as it is one of the earliest self-reflective parodies of the Hollywood Accords. Actress Ann Shirley was one of the beauties of Hollywood, and the film was shot in black and white. So much fun to see the endless complaints of the main character about his appearance and hair color, which contradict what appears on the screen. Ann regularly talks about her nonsense-rural companions with such melodramatic lines as: "If you refuse, it will be a sadness for life." Perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the blackboard. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown does an excellent job with Anna’s love interests, Gilbert Blythe and Sarah Hayden steal all the scenes in which she acts as Cuthbert's pompous neighbor. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
