Given that this was done with a small budget, THE DAY TIME ENDED manages to make the most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects. <br /> <br /> This story tells about a family that is about to move into its sunny world. They believe that the house is in an isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California, only to find it overwhelmed - motorcycle vandals. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) began to see mysterious things - the green pyramid, strange figures of humanoids, etc. And only recently, the light from the triple explosion of a star caused unusual auroras in the desert sky. Thus, the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, finds itself face to face with strange alien forces that place them in space-time deformation. <br /> <br /> Mixing elements of 2001: ODYSSEY space and CLOSING PARTICIPANTS of the THIRD TIME, COMPLETED TIME, despite obvious shortcomings and uneven action, remains interesting due to the excellent work with special effects of David Allen. The desert setting is very suitable for close encounters of this film; and although the film cannot really be compared either with Kubrickâ€™s films or with Spielberg, the END OF TIME is much better than many other fakes 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS. I pay tribute to director John 'Bud' Cardos, whose thriller "The Kingdom of Spiders" in 1977 made for an interesting predecessor of ARACNOPHOBIA, at least for a try - and on this basis I give DAY TIME 7 out of 10.
