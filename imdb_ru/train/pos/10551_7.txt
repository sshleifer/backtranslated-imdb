Sit, typing ?? Nothing is the last "what if?" the feast proposed by Vincencio Natali, with the participation of David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller in the role of two losers. One of them is problems in a relationship, he was fired from his job (because of problems in a relationship), and the police are looking for him (because of his work and problems in a relationship). Another guy is an agoraphob who refuses to leave the house, he is met by an annoying girl-guide who urges her mother to say that she was molested when he did not buy cookies from him. Oh, yes, the police are behind him too, after the mother of the girl scouts summoned them to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Dude, what a day. <br /> <br /> What if you could make it all disappear? That's the whole premise of "Nothing." Two fools understand, police, scouts, cars, lawn, road, anything? disappear. There is nothing but empty space! This is an interesting concept, I thought. I also looked at the time, 30 minutes passed in the film, and I still had an hour in the film. Can 2 actors do this work and entertain us for 60 minutes? Although the actors are trying, 60 minutes is a long time, and in places of this film is clearly dead air. But the two actors who are friends with each other and the director throughout life have such an excellent repertoire with each other that it was fun to watch the dialogue and improve the foolishness around. There are many supernatural elements, but their reaction to these elements ultimately makes this film worth seeing.
