It’s hard to classify a movie - maybe it's an avant-garde spy thriller? “Mother's Night” is a very good novel by Vonnegut, and, of course, one of his easiest novels to adapt in the full-length film. The adaptation of the film is very true to the original book. Indie's approach to making a film is probably more effective than financing it from a large Hollywood studio. Today I doubt that such a clever novel like Mother's Night will ever get the green light from big Hollywood houses. And usually this is very bad, but not in this case. Mother Night has a hard line and solid composition. Nick Nolte, who seems to get better when he gets older, still has that “individual” personality that allows him to play a variety of characters. Cheryl Lee is beautiful and gorgeous as always. I always thought she deserved better than she left the entertainment industry. I think debuting as a dead girl (Twin Peaks) with a small amount of airtime is not the best role, even if the TV show becomes an insignificant phenomenon. In any case, this film is very pleasant, and you do not need to read a book to understand the film. In fact, given today's geopolitical realities, the premise of the novel may seem outdated, and some young viewers who are not familiar with the story will be extremely confused by the events taking place (I speak with you, fellow citizens who are students and get the lowest marks in the Industrial world in geography, stories, and the master knows what other items!).
