Of all the films that I have seen, and this is most of them, this is by far the best film made mostly about US naval ships (airships) during the Second World War era. Yes, there are other good LTA-related movies, but most use special effects more than any real-time snapshots. This personâ€™s Navy has much more real-time footage of airships, etc. True, there are many banal dialogues, but this is what makes Hollywood films more interesting, even today. Postscript I spent 10 years (out of 20) and spent more than 5000 hours on naval airships of all types, from 1949 to 1959. A proud member of the Association of Naval Airships, etc.
