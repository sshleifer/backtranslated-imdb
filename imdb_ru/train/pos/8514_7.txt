When the manager of the orphanage goes on vacation, his father takes over all the details of the center and takes the children for hire. When wealthy, he made a couple with a good apartment and a beautiful life to get an idea that this idea was made especially for them. Why do they want to spoil their elegant existence of a trio of hair rugs? People who like these two do not need children for life to be beautiful. From this film it seems that the real world works in this way, but I am a picture of doubtfulness.
