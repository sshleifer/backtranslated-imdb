This film took me by surprise. I watched it 2 or 3 times. I really liked this movie. There was a lot of truth in this movie. I love all the characters in this movie. This film makes a lot of sense, because as society “becomes more progressive,” what does culture lose? Do not sound preaching. I really can relate to this film from my childhood and lose a part of my life that will never return or will never be the same. This movie is in my top 5 movies I've ever watched. There is only such a rough truth that I feel when I watch a movie, and this is not the truth that you must dig right in front of your face. The creators of this film did a great job, and I really liked this film. This film may not be for everyone, but if you have an open mind, I think you will like it.
