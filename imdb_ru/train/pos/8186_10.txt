I love Satan's Pit !!! David Tennant is such a wonderful actor, like Billie Piper !!! Who else loves Will Thorpe to pieces ??? He's so cute, right? I hated bits, where he was possessed by the devil and where he was told to "go to hell," as Rose said bluntly. Keep in mind, he was pretty funny when he said, “Rose, do us a favor, shut up!” Mr. Jefferson was so brave, right? Dying to save others. I felt very sorry for Toby (Will Thorpe) when he came out of possession a second time because he was so scared. I was like, "Oh God, if I were Rose, I would be so afraid for him." And when she hugged him, I said: “Grrrrrr, he is mine! Hands off! ”But I thought it was really cute. And the doctor .... well, I thought he would tell Ida "tell Rose that I love her," but he did not. Well.
