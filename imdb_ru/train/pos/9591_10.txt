Excellent documentation. I personally remember growing up in New York in the early 80s. This film is for those who were not there at that time. It shows the one thing that the African-American gay class felt exclusively theirs, and the love and spirit that you see are real. People are real, and, unfortunately, few are still alive as it is written. The balls are still held, but not to the extent that they were in the eighties. This time has passed forever. This is a good preview of The Bandit. When queens were really proud of extroverts. Goodbye Storyville, this is another era gone, but the whole hail film is very documented!
