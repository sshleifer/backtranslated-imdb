This one-minute film is perhaps the first film ever made. Other inventors have previously filmed an action - for example, Edison's movie with sneezing - but the Lumiere brothers developed equipment that significantly improved the environment. At that time, of course, their “cinema” must have confused their peers, including their subjects. In this first case, the brothers record employees leaving their factory, some of which, for obvious reasons, try to hide their awareness of the camera. Lumiere is trying to make the film more interesting by introducing animals and a bicycle, but “La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere” does not quite match the ingenuity of their later films. The most interesting aspect of this short film is that the brothers choose a familiar working ritual as a subject. Their choice is the initial proof of their curiosity towards all the people in the world, a quality that makes watching their experiments extremely useful and exciting today. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
