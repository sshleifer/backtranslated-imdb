How can you not rate this movie with 10/10? I admit that this film is not very interesting, but the goal is not to tell a story, but a story! This is the first "real" film history film ("Le Prince de Galles" was the first, but he was not technically perfect enough ??), and he, of course, has great international significance. These people, whom you see, ending their working day in the film, had the opportunity to take part in the historical moment, becoming the first to be able to see themselves moving! And above all a shot is a beautiful shot! And it is very touching when you think of the first people who saw it! Which moment! Historical for science first (because the Lumiere brothers first invented cinema for scientific reasons), and later for art. A film to read!
