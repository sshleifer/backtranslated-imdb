Directed by duo Yudai Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto "Meatball Machine", apparently, is a remake of the 1999 film Yamamoto with the same name. I doubt that someday I will have the opportunity to see the original, so I will just comment on this. First of all, what is a "meatball"? A simple, currently pretentious, low-budget industrial spray film filled with gorgeous make-up and blood effects. This is not what you will end up writing books about, but nevertheless, you will be wondering if you will dig this type of cinema. <br /> <br /> “Meatball” follows a well-known plot. The boy loves the girl, but is too afraid to invite her on a date. The boy finally meets a girl. The girl is infected with a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a murderous cyborg. The boy, in turn, also turns into what has been said and sets off in search of the salvation of his love. Will he succeed? To whom to spit, while there is a slaughter and death, I am pleased. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, relatively cliché, but it does its job quite well, translating the course of the film directly into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters. There is a story about how a parasite that infected a girl entered their lives. And yes, fortunately, this indicates more violence. I'm happy. Acting is what you expect from a movie without a budget. This is not entirely painful to the ears, but also not very good. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of the film, in addition to violence and bloodshed (as I have not mentioned enough), is a cyborg. Made by Keita Amemiya, who works on creating strange creatures and costumes for movies and video games. Necroborg, as they are called in "Meatball", look amazing detail. Without the use of designs, CGI Amemiya is a terrific combination of flesh and metal, painfully amazing in appearance. Able to turn various parts of the body into cold weapons, such as saws, rocket launchers, guns firing blood and so on and so forth. Although you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film, the necroborgs belong to class "A". <br /> <br /> “Meatball Machine” is “Tetsuo The Iron Man”, mixed with “Alien”, all done in a low budget and extra ketchup mode. This is a very exciting film that ignores modern special effects and proves that the genre squirting is still alive and well.
