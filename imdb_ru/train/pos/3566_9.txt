In 1954, Marlon Brando was a hot actor after his performances on the Desire and On the Quay trams. Frank Sinatra has not yet invented himself on the silver screen. But the image of Sinatra as the former Nathan of Detroit helped restore Sinatra with his fans. <br /> <br /> This is a great on-screen version of a great game, and the choice of potential customers and players of support is simply amazing. Imagine a film where Brando sings? It was his only singing role when he portrayed Sky Masterson. In addition, the main characters - Gene Simmons and Vivian Blaine (who played her scenic role as the long-suffering friend of Nathan Adelad) - made excellent efforts. Special mention should be made of the great Stubby Kaye (as Nicely Nicely), and with all due respect to Eric Clapton, none of the versions of Rockin 'The Boat even come close to Stubby's. Sheldon Leonard, who became famous as a television producer of such shows as The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show, does the miracles of Harry Harry, BSPulley is excellent as rude and rude talking Big Julie and even Regis Tumi offers his excellence as "Brother Arvid." <br /> <br /> This is one of the funny musicals, a good comedy, and you get Sinatra and Brando. Taaaaaaaaaaaaaaae "today you are lucky, Lady" and brother ... "this is your dice game"
