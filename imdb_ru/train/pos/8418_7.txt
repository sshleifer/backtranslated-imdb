The Russian émigré director in Hollywood in 1928 (William Powell) shoots his epos about the Russian revolution and hires an old ex-general from the tsarist regime (Emil Jennings) to play the general in the film, and both are experiencing drama and the memory of the woman they shared (Evelyn Brent), 11 years before. <br /> <br /> No matter how hard I try, it is hard for me to warm the “Last Team” with all its merits. The Docks of New York was undoubtedly a great movie, and Underworld is a movie I always wanted to see, but The Last Team is pretty hard. The premise is amazing, but the processing really makes the script come to life, with the exception of the sequence established in Hollywood, depicting a set of many additional features and the machinations of large-scale film production using the most modern technologies. <br /> Emil Jennings, as expected, is a marvelous Russian general who perfectly distinguishes between an injured and decrepit old former general enchanted in his sufferings and an energetic, heartfelt officer of the past. <br /> <br /> The ending is excellent and worth the wait, but to get there, you need to be prepared so that sometimes it is a little boring.
