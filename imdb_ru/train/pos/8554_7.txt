Wow, that was another good break from the original American pie, not as good as in camp, but definitely much better than the naked mile. Dwight and Eric Stifler direct this comedy, but in fact I preferred the dialogue in this film to naked mile. The script was written much better, and the comedy flowed more smoothly, but most of the comedy came from sex, but this is normal, because that's why we watch these films, right? <br /> <br /> The dwarf Rock also had a really good cameo, given that he made great efforts on the bare mile, his choking effect was amazing and made me laugh at my ass when I saw it. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the film has become a definite improvement over the naked mile. If you liked any previous films about American Pie, you should love Beta House, if only you donâ€™t see how all American cakes drop too much Money.
