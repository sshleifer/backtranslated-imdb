2054. Paris - Escher's drawing with people and vehicles rushing at different levels in the apparent worship of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Paris is both ultramodern and collapsing. And in the blink of an eye between observations, a rather young medical researcher was abducted right after he left his sister in a dirty nightclub. Hard police captain investigates. Shown in black and white, with gloomy corridors, shadow alleys and lighting from one source, characteristic of the most noir boiled film, a comparison with the city of sins is inevitable. But the story owes more to Masamune Shirou and William Gibson than to Frank Miller, since high-tech surveillance, almost invisible stealth suits and ruthless super-corporations are as much an integral part of the landscape as weapons and cars. The film never generates the gloomy atmosphere of Gibsonâ€™s cyberpunk vision, with its technically heavy marginal characters clashing with industrial types from corporations that seem to have their own fear ministry, but the viewer definitely understands that the future of Paris is no utopia and future science is no less friendly . And as the story line of the police process unfolds, we plunge into the dark niches of personal ambitions under the brilliant veneer of the cultivated image of the Avalon PR corporation. The motion capture process used here makes an impression somewhere between the black-and-white comics and the next generation rotoscope, and depending on your tastes, it can be exciting or intrusive. Nevertheless, a great visual sensation is demonstrated here, and the future Paris is filled with the smallest details, giving the picture a unique look, which in turn is Spartan and Baroque. Worth seeing.
