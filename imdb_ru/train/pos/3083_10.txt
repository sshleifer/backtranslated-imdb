It deserves 12 out of 10. An absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories. This show should be back, I saw every episode, and this is a real quality. <br /> <br /> The show is centered around a pair of New Yorkers who play up to the concepts of six degrees of separation and cleverly intertwine their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are awesome, as is the charming Caseman. The scenery is amazing and the cabinets are exquisite. <br /> <br /> We need more of these shows to make the audience feel like smart people rather than helpless drones. <br /> <br /> If he never returns, six degrees will really be missed.
