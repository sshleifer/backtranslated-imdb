I liked Joyce's complex novel so much that I was ready to give up on the script of Joseph Strick and Fred Haynes, given the incredible complexity of the original text. Nevertheless, the film turned out to be a very well made and excellent translation of the tone, naturalism and frivolity of the book. <br /> <br /> It certainly helps to read the original text before watching a movie. I believe that the latter will seem scattered, with very strange episodes, obviously stitched together, without first reading the text, to help understand the plot. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see how “dirty” the film is, given that it was filmed in Dublin in 1967. Irish film starters only finally removed it from the ban to be viewed by a wide audience in Ireland back in 2000 (this was shown to limited viewers in a private film club, the Irish cinema of the late 1970s). Joyce's eroticism is not just naturalistic and untidy, it offers many wildly "vicious" episodes. Never mind that many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were still completely taboo when the film was shot in 1967. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly and joyfully watching the cream Irish acting profession of the 1960s, respected players, dare with such pleasure to pronounce and reproduce Joyce's highly transgressive text. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
