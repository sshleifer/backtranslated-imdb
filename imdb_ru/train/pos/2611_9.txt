In Australia, it is widely regarded as one of the best police dramas ever created here ... and for my money, anywhere. He is rough, gritty, the characters are real, situations are believable, and he does not shy away from the dark side of life that cops and criminals, victims, lawyers and other people in their various orbits face every day. <Br /> <br /> This show lasted for 2 seasons and was discontinued because the show wasnâ€™t sold abroad. We all regret his loss: however, like Fawlty Towers, we can read it as a series of limited length with equally high quality.
