With a minimum budget of eight minutes and plenty of imagination, Nacho Vigalondo achieved one of the most touching shorts I've ever seen. The subtlety of the script is truly remarkable, since it does not give an end to the very last moment. <br /> <br /> Don't let anyone tell you what the point is, since you will be able to enjoy it a lot more. Nacho Vigalondo is the opening of the year for his personal show: directing, writing and performing in this stunning short film is the most remarkable effort I have seen in recent years. Also pay attention to Martha Belenger's performance, her reaction rolls are incredible. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 8/10
