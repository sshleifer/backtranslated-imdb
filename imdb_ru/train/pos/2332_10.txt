“Imagine if you could bring things back to life with a single touch.” As soon as I heard it for the first time, my attention was focused on the Trailer, and after the first episode I found myself in love with this show. A modern fairy tale that cheers me up and keeps my attention throughout the entire show. I think that acting and casting are just perfect, each character brings something unique to the show that adds perfection to it. Even once, when the Villains manage to overflow With a unique feeling, From the Beekeeper to the Guy who can swallow kittens, they never let me down. And deaths, which usually lead to a depressing moment, are often purely comical (for example, the book "Exploding scratch and sniffing"). <br /> <br /> Even with a lot of crime shows, we have days, Daisy. This is one of the few that really stands out among the rest: Being not just a Mystery, but a love story, Comedy and Tale with a touch of drama baked Wonderful cake ... erroneous show. <br /> <br /> What really shocked me was that it was on ABC. For years, I never had any reason to turn to ABC, but this returned me every week with a smile on my face. It was as if “The Return of the Daisy” brought me back to life. But just so, after two seasons, several awards, a large number of fans and positive reviews from critics, the show was discontinued. It seems Ned touched ABC again and killed him forever for me. I will always be a fan of this show, and I recommend it to anyone who loves to talk a lot and a lot of the love from the shows that they watch.
