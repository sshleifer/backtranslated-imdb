I just finished listening to the director's comments on this film, and I think the one big thing I got from this, which I agree with, is that this film, like Mann's Insider, is completely subjective. This is from Howard's POV. So, any review or attempt to think about a number of comments about this, as Ebert did, is in fact about the nature of Nolte. If you feel, like him, that the film “does not work”, then you, I think, say that Howard does not work. And frankly, you may be right. Howard's reasoning and personality do not really withstand professional mental treatment and analysis. <br /> <br /> But hey, that's the nature of people. <br /> <br /> Andrew.
