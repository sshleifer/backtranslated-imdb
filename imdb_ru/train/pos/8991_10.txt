DIG THE GROUND! it is fun, fun, fun, interesting, stylish and very well done. Knowing that this was done with such a tight budget for 7 years, it is surprising that such a story can be told, especially with such style and content. If you are a fan of music or documentaries, this is a must-see. <br /> <br /> Focusing on Brian Jonestown Masssacre and The Dandy Warhols for many years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band that meets with moderate success thanks to perseverance and the ability to compromise and a brilliant megalo maniac vocalist, supported by various characters who sabotage their own success with the help of drugs, alcohol and madness. If I didnâ€™t know that they were real people, I would swear that it was an incredibly well-written and original script. The story is irresistible, brief and simply amazing.
