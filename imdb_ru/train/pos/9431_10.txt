and this is a very disturbing film. I may be mistaken, but this is the last film where I considered Bert Reynolds a real actor who changed the role and delivered the message. <br /> <br /> John Voight and Ned Beattie are also excellent. They are humble and do not know; businessmen who want to enjoy the country. Not only did they know what would happen next. <br /> <br /> Photography and scenery are realistic and natural. That was until the days of Wes Craven. <br /> <br /> This movie is most worried about the fact that such places still exist. In America, villagers still hate city dwellers; Almost a century and a half has passed since the civil war. <br /> <br /> You will love this movie. It was filmed in the rural areas of South Georgia that still exist. Just do not drive past this to Mobile, Alabama; This area has not yet been repaired after Hurricane Katrina. 10/10
