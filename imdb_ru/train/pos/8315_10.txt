The standard growth of fame, which has several high points. Number one, Lonette McKee in the role of Sister, which gives an amazing, star game. The fact that she never became a huge sensation after that, I can not do. Unfortunately, she is a minor character, and we have to focus on the soft character of Irena Carter, Sparkle, whose ascent to fame is easy, boring and unconvincing. However, whenever girls go on stage and perform, the film returns to life. The original music of Kuris Mayfield deserves praise. The copy I saw was a very old VHS tape. Image quality was rather low, as well as estimated production performance. In general, it is worth it.
