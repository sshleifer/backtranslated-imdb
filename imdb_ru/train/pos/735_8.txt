The amazing cult film of 1979, in which high school students of Vince Lombardi face a new dictatorial director named Miss Togar (Mary of the Ravens). Togar is a hater of music and blames the students' musical tastes for his crimes. It is led against it by jolly Riff Randall (PJ Soles), a Ramones # 1 fan who most wants a rock band to record her songs. <br /> <br /> Now * it * is impossible to resist the film. First of all, the soundtrack is incredible, with songs by artists such as Alice Cooper and Velvet Underground, in addition to an infectious, non-stop assortment of Ramones songs. “Teenage Lobotomy”, “Sheena - punk rocker” and “Blitzkrieg Bop” are just some of them. Then, the cast really gives them everything, with Soles the perfect choice for the role of Riff; she is a real delight. Vincent Van Patten and Day Young are serious in the role of Tom and Kate, Ravens are well-tuned against the playful and contemptuous Togar, Clint Howard has one of the best in his history as an entrepreneur in the toilet, Eaglebauer, and regular customers of New World, such as Dick Miller Paul Barthel (especially the cheerful music teacher Mr. McGree) and The Real Don Steele are funny as ever. And, of course, it's nice to see how “Ramones” play themselves. <br /> <br /> There is real spirit in the film. The energy level is high, the author and director of the joint story Allan Arkush brings great interest to the process. There is also a great sense of humor. A paper plane gag is an excellent example of this. This extends to the style of "erase" transitions between scenes. There are even funny giant mice created by future makeup effects known by Rob Bottin at one of his earliest concerts. <br /> <br /> Approximately as good as a film that challenges the authority, protects the right to a party. receive. Rock and Roll High School is a great cult movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
