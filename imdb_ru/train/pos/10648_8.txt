What can I say that was not said about the "Ghost"? It has everything that would make an excellent picture. Beautiful sets, capricious music and sound design, for which you could die, were in place. The scenario, however, sometimes strikes the imagination in such a strange, surreal way. The whole team must have forgotten to read it, perhaps because they were too busy creating cg effects and creating gothic scenery to notice how weak the plot was. Each cast member gives decent work, albeit with a small amount of persuasion to the material at hand. Lily Taylor has the most to do, and the rest mostly respond to her. But that's all. All I can say is that it was a pleasant two hours, but you definitely want more. A lot more.
