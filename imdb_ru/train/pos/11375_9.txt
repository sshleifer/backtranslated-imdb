This film tells an amazing story with history and compassion. From a detailed description of the crime scene to the mental health of the lead investigator, you will be fascinated. It is absolutely necessary for anyone interested in criminology. Interpol relationships and the way agencies work together is also great. Not too done too. I recommend to anyone who is interested in Russian history. How the police work with a political party, how it was ... Itâ€™s really exciting and frustrating. The settings are beautiful. I have not seen this movie for a long time. This does not diminish its influence. Not too dramatic or graphical, it is enough for imagination, well, you will see.
