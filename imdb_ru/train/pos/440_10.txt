My favorite movie. Oscar caliber is the work of all participants, both in front of and behind the camera. The script is perfect and builds the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs quite satisfactory, unlike the novel. The care with which other leading characters were drawn is a tribute to screenwriter Peter Barnes, and intense visual beauty should have won an Oscar for director Mike Newell and cinematographer Rex Maidment. Today, this is Josie Lawrenceâ€™s best work, which has changed my mind about Joan Pleight. Having seen this film at least 50 times, I see no guilt in it. The music of the famous composer Richard Rodney Bennett is a miracle.
