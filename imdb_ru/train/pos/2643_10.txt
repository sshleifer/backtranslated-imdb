I really can't say too much about the plot of the film, which has not yet been said. I have not seen a movie for about 25 years, and the memory of it never left me. I searched for it everywhere. In the past, I searched the network, but it didn't work out. Last night I thought about the film again and tried to remember who it was, but I was only 10 or 12 when I last saw it, and I wasnâ€™t even sure that I had the correct name of the film, so I decided one more search and I finally found this sight. I was right. If anyone knows where I can get a copy of this wonderful film to share with my family, could you please give me now at tawnyteel@yahoo.com I would be very grateful. And the one who has not seen this movie and has a chance is worth it.
