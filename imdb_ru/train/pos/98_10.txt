For me, this Christmas is special, which I remember very gently. In 1989 I took 2 soundtrack CDs, giving one to my sister and leaving the other for myself. Now this is part of my family's Christmas tradition, and I wish I could see this show again, and not just remember it while listening. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere it was noted that John Denver made a number of appearances on the Muppets, and they made more than one special together. A good understanding between Denver and his fuzzy companions can be clearly seen here in a charming and fun show that is suitable for all ages.
