What a jewel of a film, so good that they made a sequel. <br /> <br /> The film starts very well with a disgusting monster that eats a few people, and parties where the two main characters see each other for the first time. <br /> <br /> Bendan Hughes plays an eccentric Vlad, who suspects a little who this character is, who moved to the city and uses the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a home. <br /> <br /> Hell, we all saw movies about vampires, we know the format. <br /> <br /> The film can be watched, but the actors' performances are very wooden, and they seem as they are. I do not want to star in this film, but perhaps this is just part of the decadent atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I did not like the final, but there is a sequel, it is necessary to find it. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I thought that Brendan Hughes really didn’t fit. Later I could not stop thinking about him, he seemed to exude a terrible sensuality, so maybe he was right from that side. <br /> <br /> BRANDAN HUYZ Last seen in “Hitler - the rise of evil.” as lieutenant gaffman. <br /> <br /> Where is he now?
