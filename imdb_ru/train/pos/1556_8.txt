Like other people who commented on “Fräulein Doktor”, I accidentally stumbled upon this little gem on the nightly TV channels without hearing about it before. A strange mixture of a fantastic story about a sexual but unscrupulous anti-heroine, on the one hand, and a realistic and well-developed image of the war in the trenches, on the other hand, from the very beginning I was hooked. /> For me, this is one of the five best films about the First World War (the rest are "Everything is quiet on the Western Front", "Path of Glory", "Gallipoli" and the post-war "La vie et rien d'autre")). And the poison gas scene is really scary; horses and men look like horsemen of the apocalypse with their gas masks. <br /> <br /> I would just like me to record the film on tape.
