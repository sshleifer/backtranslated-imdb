Several summer space tourists were actually randomly sent into space by a robot. And there was not enough oxygen in the ship. They had to send someone to the space station for gas tanks, etc. And so on. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot of this film is impossible in real life. But it gives a warm feeling that everything is possible if you put your heart in. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see those young actors who still look about the same after so many years. (I first saw this film in 2000, it was filmed in 1986). There are a lot of people in this movie who still work in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> outer space It does not look unreal. It lasts about 2 hours and runs so fast that you donâ€™t even notice. You know that this is not real, but you are simply immersed in it until the end. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good family movie. <br /> <br />
