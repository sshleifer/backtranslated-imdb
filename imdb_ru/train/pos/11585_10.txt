This movie is full of horror movie goodies: chained crazy, premeditated murder, insane (dimly lesbian) woman scientist with an even more insane father who wears a mask because of his terrible disfigurement, poisoning, eerie castles, werewolves (man and woman ), adultery, murdered lovers, Tibetan mystics, half man / half plant, victim of some unnamed experiment, grave robbery, mind control, walled up bodies, car crash on a desert road, defeat electric shock, knights in armor - all this culminated in an incredibly awful account and one of the worst jobs Foley in history. <br /> <br /> The script is incomprehensible (even because of the poorly named standards of the Spanish horror film), and some editing work is just weird. In one scene, where the leading evil female scientist goes to visit our heroine in her bedroom for one of the terribly dubbed: “This is fantastic. I do not understand. Explain to me again how it is ... "scenes of exposure that litter it. In the film, they suddenly cut off the hands of the girl's hips when she gets out of bed for no apparent reason, except to hide the bad scientist's incision:" Mwahaha ! All your werewolves belong to mine! ”Speech. Although, why they went to the trouble, I don’t know, because there are a lot of other sharp jumps everywhere - even with the brutal turn and scan of the print I’ve seen. <br /> <br /> Director According to one interview with the star, he was drunk for most of the filming, and the film looks like this. This is an incoherent mess. Has it become even more incoherent due to the inclusion of the werewolf rampage from another Wolfman movie (shot 4 years ago, with the same actor, but with more aggressiveness, another shirt and makeup) in Spanish the word Continuity? ) and a few more words about another actor in the game of the wolf cub, hanging about in a long shot. <br /> <br /> Music is incredibly bad and almost randomly varies from full orchestral creepy house music, for bosannova, for the longest piano duet and gong ever recorded. (Thinking about it, it might not have been a duet. It could have been a solo. The piano part was so simple that you could choose it with one hand when the player hit the gong with the other.) <br /> For me, this is one of the most puzzled films of the year in a trance state. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> Favorite line: “Ilona! This is madness and perversion will turn against you! ”How true that is. <br /> <br /> Favorite snapshot: lover, having discovered that his girlfriend was killed, dropped a candle in a cartoon demonstration of surprise. The title of amateur directing there.
