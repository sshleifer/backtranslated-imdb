I just saw Behind the Bedroom Doors, and it was the first softcorn film with a compelling story I have seen lately. <br /> <br /> We start with two neighbor pairs - Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Cruis and Eric Carrington), as well as Lilian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian seems to be a housewife, James is a lawyer working for the district attorney, Lilian is working in real estate, and Gabe is a successful plastic surgeon. Got it all? Now let's go to her. <br /> <br /> Enter Abby, played beautifully by the porn star Chelsea Blue. She rents a house across the street from Fenways and lives herself. At the beginning of the film, James looks out the window and sees Abby engaged in recess with his girlfriend, Gigi (played by the prolific pornstress Monique Alexander) and secretly begins to wonder what it would be like to be with her. The next day, Abby meets all four of them, and it seems that she is a pretty woman who, as it turned out, leads an alternative lifestyle. She makes a pass to Vivian, who seems frightened and tells her: "Oh ... I ... not like this." Everything seems to be in order ... until the plan is put into action. <br /> <br /> First, Abby appears naked in Gabe's office, asking Gabe if she should get a job. This is where we get our quote from the movie: <br /> <br /> “Tell me about Gabe.” "What do you want to know?" "Is Gabe happily married?" "IM married." "There is a problem ... let me guess. Your wife stays at home and does everything you ask. But she is a good girl." "Yes." "Is she not a bad girl?" “No.” “Does this door have a lock?” <br /> <br /> You know what will happen next ... Abby connects this with Gabe, right in the examination room. After that, she arranges a small show in her window for James, who is suitable and does not lose time to have sex with her. What James doesn’t know is that a teddy bear on a piano with a blinking red eye is really a camera that takes all the holidays off (in any case, it's so obvious). Later, Abby has sex with Gabe again, and this time Gigi joins to make him tripartite. Now that Abby has something for both men, she asks for $ 100,000 each to buy her silence. Not only could she spoil the candidacy of James for the position, but also destroy the practice of Gabe. <br /> <br /> While Gabe and James struggle with their guilt, Abby finds time to seduce Lillian, who “experimented” with women in college. It was a long time ago, but you would not know that you saw her in a fight with Abby - she looked like an old professional. <br /> <br /> While Gigi agrees with the plan, she seems jealous of the sex of her friend. “It's only business,” says Abby. A confession and an apology will surely follow, like some striking information about Abby's true identity — she seems to have done the same with different men in many different places. Gabe and James use this information to fight Abby's blackmail. <br /> <br /> Now about sex. Sex scenes were pretty good, and considering all the women involved in this film, with the exception of Julia Kruis has a long porn background, I would not expect anything less. Nicole Sheridan's four scenes were the best in the film, with a three-sided approximation in the next second. Monica Alexandra undressed only once, but she was a relatively minor character. Julia Kruis was the main character and undressed as many times. I guess since she was surrounded by experienced hardcore professionals, she didn't need so many sex scenes. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, “Behind the Bedroom Doors” had a great storyline, which increased the overall rating. the movie. I think this is worthy of attention. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Nicole Sheridan was good at this film - better than her later offerings in Fred Deer Ray’s comedies. At least she can play a little in the drama. Chelsea Blue was the Theft of the scene - she was not so bad as an antagonist. I would give her an A grade myself. Julia Cruis was her usual personality. I wish Monica Alexander had more time to show in this film.) <br / > <br /> Sex: B (Solid, very solid sex scenes. Nicole Sheridan’s speeches were almost hardcore. Chelsea Blue also looked good in her own Enah. The offerings of the two girls and girls were not scorching, but they warmed the screen.) Plot: B + (I liked the dialogue and storyline. Chelsea Blue’s performance was good for the genre and I was impressed Nicole Sheridan’s turn in the drama.) In general: <br /> <br /> Overall: B (It was a good softcore film. I’m glad I could watch this film because I was pleasantly surprised. If Chelsea Blue ever wants to do more, she would gladly have fallen. This also applies to Nicole Sheridan, although she is probably better able to act in a comedy. I am not against hardcore girls who can be shot in erotic films.)
