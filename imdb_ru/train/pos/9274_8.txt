Another fantastic film from a country where, due to decades of oppression by fundamentalist regimes, there are no problems in creating passionate stories. This time, Panahi takes a different approach, combining ironic comedy and charming, unprofessional cast. Despite the fact that he still faces the message that, in his opinion, is inherently wrong with his country, he does this without the need for a complex storyline. This is a positive view of the country, in particular its population, which the Iranian population badly needs. It is a pity that he will not be released domestically. In a closed, paranoid Iranian government, they say that this great director is only successful abroad because he is part of a global conspiracy to confuse them. Growing up under the conditions of the revolution and observing how academics, artists and the educated “disappear” during the last 25 years, he shows great courage by continuing to exhibit his works there. The realism achieved in shooting the actual qualifying match of the World Cup really takes you to the competition. The fact that he shot it at 35 mm is amazing, as most will try to use this project only in digital format. It looks fantastic. His insistence on using only non-professional actors also really works in this film. Great performances around. After watching many films showing the problems of Iran, as well as the media covering facts, we may tend to demonize people and the government. This film does the opposite. This shows us that they still love the same things and that, laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of Sharia law, that perhaps a change for the better is not that far away. Some people call Panahi a feminist director, but I think that he is simply fighting for the most oppressed demography in Iran. Young, independent women.
