For me, there is something so attractive and nostalgic about low-cost science fiction. In childhood in the 50s everything was. In 1957, I watched "The First Man in Space" at the cinema with my father. Starring Marshall Thompson and another poor fellow who won the lead role. It is also about the space mission, in which the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer. Scared good and abundance right out of me. The memory of these hibi-jibi still lives in me. The Incredible Melting Man is almost anew, only in full gorgeous color ... this is where the scenes would be well lit. I just have to love it for what it is ... a little more than an hour of dark scenes, disgusting noises and that creepy music. Bravo!
