This is a documentary that I accidentally stumbled upon on the British TV channel More4, and I must say that it seemed to me extremely interesting and challenging. I will also be looking for a book that was the source material for this documentary. In essence, this is Professor Jared Diamond’s theory about why some parts of earthly societies flourished and others did not. The argument he presents was new to me and argued that the good luck of the right crops and the right animals that could be domesticated was certainly convincing. As for the documentary itself, it is well-filmed and well-narrated, but not converted into many scenes that spoil many modern documentaries. A diamond also helps, without being indulgent, which is a mistake of many intellectuals when they are trying to convey a message to people. People claim that his theory is Marxist, but I don’t buy it and I don’t see geologists anymore. It was also nice to hear a theory about the evolution of society, not based on religion. Watching is highly recommended.
