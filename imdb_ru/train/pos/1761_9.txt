Only occasionally do we get a comedy with an R rating, which attracts everyone’s time and attention. This is even more rare when critics will like it. I just returned from a 40-year-old Virgin and, frankly, it was one of the biggest laughs in my life. I went to the 10:35 show, and every row was full. Not only that, everyone laughed all the time. It's two hours of nonstop laughter. I dare you to watch this movie and not laugh. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. A man is forty years old and he is a virgin. Nevertheless, behind this simple five-second joke we are given a deep, complex story, which is not only one of the most fun, which you have ever seen, but there are genuine lessons behind it. Steve Carell stars as Andy Stitzer, a 40-year-old Maiden We knew Steve Carell as, in my opinion, one of the best scene thieves of all time. Having stolen the gay scenes from Bruce Almighty and especially the Lead, Steve Carell has come a long way, and finally, proudly got his moment to shine like a star. No one will forget his name as soon as they witness this ubiquitously amusing, all-consuming, hilarious comedy, in the roles in the aisle. <br /> <br /> The film’s charm is not that it’s 100% stupid. The brilliant essay of Judd Apatov and Steve Carell really has a purpose, and this is not just a hell of a story. Behind the rude and vulgar, non-stop trip of the film, an important lesson should be learned. Although the film is presented not in the best way, it gives us more than just a pleasant pastime. His exhausting mood will make you laugh all the time, while we simultaneously see the real struggle of people like Andy and his colleagues. The end could not be better. He not only gives what was promised to us, but also gives one of the most memorable final numbers that comedy has ever seen. It would be great if Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson were there, but you can't win them all, now you can. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think, as Roger Ebert said, Katherine Keener performs an inexplicable perfect performance in the role of Trish, the only woman for whom Andy sincerely wishes. She not only laughs at us, but it’s also crazy to see how brightly she feeds the story. Her role was honed to perfection, and she and Karella are amazing, not to mention the cheerful chemistry on the screen. <br /> <br /> Canadian ratings, again, Ontario slips away from 14A, and British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba hit the 40-year-old Maid 18A. The same thing happened with Four Brothers, in my opinion, the second best film of the year, and I can honestly say that I love Ontario more and more for that. To all of you teenagers in the States: good luck sneaking! <br /> <br /> In general, Steve Carell gives one of the funniest performances I've ever seen, and almost everyone in the cast gives out nonstop laughter. This summer, everyone will enjoy the 40-year-old Mother of God, and I urge everyone to see her as soon as possible. This is the best comedy of the year, hands down. It hits all over the Longest Yard, The Wedding Crashers and, of course, the last memorable comedy Apatow and Carella, the presenter. <br /> <br /> This is a comic masterpiece deserving the praise of critics, I love it. Each of my favorite critics liked it, and it immediately deserves a place in the IMDb Top 250. Steve Carell is a huge star. See one of the brightest summer days right now. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Objectively ?? 9/10 <br /> <br /> Subjectively ?? 10/10 <br /> <br /> Alison A.
