David Webb People meets with Paul Anderson ... if this sounds strange to you already, then you are right, because it is. <br /> <br /> People are known for their scenarios with the moral consequences of what is right and wrong, the value of life, etc. He covered these problems in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and almost all of his scenarios have something similar. <br /> <br /> Paul Anderson's first successful film was a brutal thriller. It is not surprising that all of his other films! And here is the cruel thriller with moral consequences! <br /> <br /> Folk script is quite obvious in the first half of the film. Soldiers trained from birth, taught to kill, and never had a normal life. They are replaced by the best, genetically engineered soldiers, and Todd, one of the original soldiers, remains on the planet and dies. There, he must deal with a group of refugees, some want him to stay, others hate him, and there is an interesting drama here. But then ... <br /> <br /> ... Bullets begin to fly when new soldiers go to the planet for military exercises and try to kill all the people. Big, brutal, loud actions will follow, and the Peoples script turns into Anderson action. It is hard to believe that the script was originally written this way, but the final product is better than I expected. Entertaining, somewhat, although not really, thought-provoking and exciting, as soon as the action begins. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: a lot of violence
