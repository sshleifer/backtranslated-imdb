I saw it last night on TV, and was very pleased. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of film that makes you feel good and warm from your heart and believe that there is still something good in the world (all the neighbors pretended not to see what grace did , help her and protect her - my favorite old cop), although you know that this story is not entirely realistic. <br /> <br /> I liked to play (they all seemed to be ordinary ordinary people living in the small picturesque English seaside town), but the biggest thing in the film is wit and humor! Just remember the scene in the store with two elderly ladies after they drank "tea" !! <br /> <br /> The final may have been a bit confusing, but that didnâ€™t stop me from enjoying the whole story!
