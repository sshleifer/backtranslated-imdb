There are many films related to the Second World War, but Mother Night is quite distinctive among them: in this film, we meet Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American living in Berlin and married to German Helge Knot (Lee), who decides to accept the role of a spy : More specifically, CIA agent Major Virtanen (Goodman) recruits Campbell, who becomes a Nazi propagandist, to enter the highest echelons of the Hitler regime. However, the fact is that the US government never recognizes the role of Campbell in a war for reasons of national security, and therefore Campbell becomes a hated figure in the United States. After the war, he tries to hide his identity, but the past returns and pursues him. His only "friend" is Virtanen, but even he can’t do much for the avalanche of events that hit poor Campbell ... <br /> <br /> The story is deeply touching as we watch the tragedy of Campbell, who, although a great patriot, he is treated with contempt by everyone around him. Not only that, but he also gradually realizes that even those people who are closest to him have many secrets of their own. Vonnegut creates a touching atmosphere in which Campbell’s despair accumulates and almost stifles the viewer. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Nolte plays the role of his life; he is even better than in “Sorcery”, although in both roles he plays tragic figures destined to self-destruct. Cheryl Lee is also superb, and the same can be said about the cast as a whole. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book, so I can not appreciate how the film compares with it. In any case, it does not matter here: my criticism of the film itself, and the film sincerely deserves 9/10.
