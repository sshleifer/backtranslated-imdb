I saw this film this morning, and I was amazed at how accurate the dialogue was for the main characters. It was not like a movie - it was more like a documentary (the part that I liked the most). The leading girls in this film seemed to me as real as all the fifteen-year-old girls I know. <br /> <br /> In general, a very nice movie for those who love independent films.
