This is my favorite film about Jackie Chan, and in one of the interviews, Jackie said that this is his favorite film. It contains some incredible stunts and combat sequences, as well as some very funny scenes. This film was Brandon Lee's favorite movie, which used roles in “Rapid Fire,” and was also shot in Tango and Cash, which used some of the first scenes. <br /> <br /> Jackie is a cop in Hong Kong. The story immediately turns into a fantastic slumber chase and continues when Jackie slides down the hill and jumps onto a moving bus to catch the evil Ku (who is one of the greatest villains in any Jackie Chan movie). You can expect some very funny scenes when Jackie tries to balance his cop debt with his girlfriend, played by Maggie Cheung. His job is to protect Secretary Ku, who has enough information to kill him, but even this creates many problems. Jackie is at his best here. The last fight scene in the mall is my favorite fight scene by all - the period. It was the most intense battle I've ever seen when Jackie did, and the climax of sliding down the pole amid exploding lights. In general, one of his greatest tricks he ever did left him with skin torn from his hands. He was lucky that he was not electrocuted, as the person responsible for the trick used high voltage instead of lower voltage. <br /> <br /> In general, another Chan classic and definitely one of his greatest films. By the end of this film, you can say that he held absolutely nothing back, as did his stuntmen. So many of his stuntmen were injured during this film that no one could insure them - Jackie had to take responsibility. There are no tricks, wires or replacements - all this is a real action that is a pleasure to watch. It was this type of action that made it such a thing as this, and this film will amaze people in 100 years. If you have not seen this movie and are a fan of Jackie Chan or the action movie in general, treat yourself and watch this movie. This is really sensational.
