And I gave it a high praise 7 ..... <br /> <br /> Why? Because it damn well swayed. At a time when there were so many OTHER shows related to toys / games, this show was unique in the sense that it had overlapping stories. As already said here, it was ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that is why the show was doomed. They released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes of the series. I hope more will come out. <br /> <br /> How to compare it, watching it now, 20 years after it was released ... I don’t know, I still like it, despite the sometimes clumsy animation, and this is IMHO, it’s just a drawback . The letter was almost top notch and far ahead of the competition ........ <br /> <br /> I really hope for more DVDs or even a set of all the episodes in the proper order ... DVDs are good, but I don’t I think that the stories in the right order, but despite this, the show was swaying.
