Once again proving his amazing versatility, John Turturro plays an introspective Russian ingenious chess player who is preparing for a return tournament and forging unlikely relationships with the same resident (Emily Watson) in an Italian hotel of the 1920s. They fall in love, to the dismay of her social mountaineering mother (Geraldine James). A beautiful love story, whose brilliance of chess can make it seem cerebral. But, despite its origin in the history of Nabakov, it is certainly not. Romantic elements and a sense of time and place conquer psychological analysis. John Turturro, appearing in Barton Fink, “Oh Brother, where are you?” “The Big Lebowski” proves that he does not depend on Cohen films to assert his status.
