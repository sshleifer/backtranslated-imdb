The second feature concerns a young woman in London who desperately needs a job, who gladly agreed to live in the secretarial office of an elderly woman and her son. Thrillers about keeping people in the house against their will always make me feel a little awkward - I also feel like a prisoner - but this rather stylish B-film is neither scary nor claustrophobic. It is far-fetched and unlikely, but uninteresting, and our heroine (Nina Foch) quickly gets to her feet. Rephrasing this in 1986 (like "Dead Of Winter") was not wise, because the plot elements are not modern. “Julia Ross” is extremely compact (too short for 65 minutes!), But she keeps well on courses until a too hasty culmination point, which seems a bit sloppy. *** from ****
