The young Mr. Lincoln is a poetic, beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most revered figures in American history. Henry Fonda was not easy to portray a mythical figure, and at the same time make him human enough for people to take care of him. This is perhaps the best representation of the actor. See how he single-handedly stops the crowd of vigilantes. Alice Brady is great as a simple farm woman. Most of the last part of the film is played out in the courtroom, and there lies the only negative thing I can say about this film. Most of the characters, from the judge to the audience, are given so many popular comic lines that distract from the serious legal process that is to come. But I'm pretty used to this, because humor is the Ford trademark. Auxiliary parties of Ward Bond and Donald Mick are very good.
