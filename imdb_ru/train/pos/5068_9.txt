This film is a wonderful film based on the life of a man named Gray Owl in the 1930s, Canada. I found him as exciting and sincere as Rudy and Awakening. It pops up late in the life of the Gray Owl and follows it through its most turbulent and influential period. <br /> <br /> A film about a Canadian Indian catcher who discovers that he is promoting the plight of a beaver trapped. He also predicts a decrease in natural land and excessive use of earth resources. This is an outrageous concept of the 1930s, and it is surprisingly well received. He becomes a famous speaker, and the masses are ready to listen to him. <br /> <br /> Casting Pierce Brosnan seems rather strange, but not offensive. Anyone who wants to argue with this must first see the film in order to understand. Brosnan delivers great performances, as does Annie Galipo. Galipo is a strong actress whose place next to Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced mating in recent Bond films. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful landscapes or environmental reasons. This film is also for families, but for children under 10 years (depending on maturity) it will be difficult to follow the plot.
