As a longtime fan of Peter O'Donnell’s greatest creation, I watched this movie on DVD without much hope of pleasure; in fact, I expected to reach the control panel in disgust in fifteen minutes. But instead, I really liked this performance, and I especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and the director were able to tell the story of Blezi's modesty. They managed to avoid the trap of creating a (bad) version of the film from the books with which we are all so well acquainted, instead they decided to concentrate on the period of Modesti’s life, which only novels refer to. <br /> <br /> As for production values ​​(and I do not study in cinema!): Yes, the film was shot with a limited financial and time budget, and perhaps it shows ... but does it spoil the viewer's pleasure? In this case, I think not. Instead, we get to know one of the greatest literary heroes of the world and get acquainted with its abilities. <br /> <br /> As for the casting: because we are in unfamiliar territory, the only people who really matter are modesty and (possibly) Professor Lob. For me they were completely trustworthy. Alexandra Staden, described by some as wooden and too thin to be the heroine of the militants, displayed Modesty’s composure and composure; her technique (when martial arts were required), but the most important personified integrity, which underlies the canon of Modesty of Blaise. <br /> <br /> Well, we all know that this film was created in order to put Miramax's claim to the character's modesty of Blaise, it was done quickly and cheaply, BUT ... I, for one, cannot wait when we see the next series in this series from these producers - as long as they adhere to the core values ​​and characteristics of the original stories!
