Now it looks more like this! In the first film, there was some kind of unreliable dialogue and a slightly weaker game, but it seems that the team behind it collected their belongings to continue and released a solid, very pleasant, fun and creative comedy that would keep everyone on the edge all the way to the end. <br /> <br /> Seriously, it's just full of great things filled with creativity, and it is less faking 80s films at the same time. The scenes in hell are gorgeous, just like in heaven. There really is no lack of the adventurous hectic of a crazy hat that this one promises and you will never see another movie like this one. Even Hammy's final act of the film is not as bad as the first, being, as a rule, heartbreaking and pleasant in its extremely clich√© repertoire of family fun cinema of bliss. And even Keanu Reeves, despite the fact that he is about 30, is not so bad. <br /> <br /> To me, it sounds like a good deal.
