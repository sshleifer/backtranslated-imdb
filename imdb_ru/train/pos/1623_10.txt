This is a cartoon that was supposed to win instead of a cousin. Visually well done and much more interesting and memorable. Just look at the music alone! Although there are elements that will undoubtedly damage the sensitivity of some of these days, the cartoon should be considered a bit. He is over sixty years old, and this, after all, is just a cartoon. I am disabled, and if I were as hypersensitive as people who look at things like this cartoon and are offended, I would have long been curled up in the fetal position and would disappear. Sometimes you need to lighten up, throw your head back and swim! Cartoons of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering. Bing Crosby reportedly hated him when he was used more than once. *SIGH*
