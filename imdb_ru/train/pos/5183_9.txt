<br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites. I saw it in the early 90s when I was in college, and although I could not identify with something in this film, I felt that the story, the characters and the film were generally at the highest level. For people who have been negative about Indian summer, do not hesitate to stick to your bloated films like Armageddon and leave films with a great, useful story for those who can appreciate them.
