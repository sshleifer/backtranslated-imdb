I know Anime. I was in it long before it became a national phenomenon; I loved Ranma even before most people knew what Dragonball Z is. And so that you know that I don’t brag about my own, let me say this: Of all the anime I’ve seen, Sky Castle is definitely one of the best. Obviously, people say that Spirited Away is the best, but I really disagree. Most people know this movie only because it won an Acedmy award. this is not an exaggeration - I showed Princess Mononoke and the Castle in the Sky to people who have ever seen only "Gone with Ghosts", and they agree that the last two are superior to three. Personally, I never thought that something could compare with Princess Mononoke, until I finally saw the Castle in the sky. I still think the previous one is the best of the two, but the Castle in the Sky is easily on par with it; In many ways, Castle has some basic elements that Mononoke lacked. In any case, if you only watched "Spirited Away" and think that this is the best movie of Miyazaki, be prepared to shake your land.
