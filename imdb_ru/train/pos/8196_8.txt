I don't know why people think this is such a bad movie. He has a pretty good plot, some good actions, and changing places for Harry won't hurt either. Of course, some of his offensive and gratuitous, but this is not the only film like this. Eastwood is in good shape, like Dirty Harry, and I liked Pat Hingle in this film as a policeman from a small town. If you liked DIRTY HARRY, then you should see it, much better than THE DEAD POOL. 4/5
