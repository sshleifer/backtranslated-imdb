This film starts briskly, has some slow moments in the middle, but generally moves well, has some very good moments, and then ends at the end of Act 3. I managed to see it in the Los Angeles premiere 2 times (with 2 different endings). Jason Lee is a star, but he is not the leader of tomorrow. He has a sense of humor and holds himself, but he is better served as a supporting actor. Julia Stiles does “good” in a new comedy role, but she does not “steal” this film, as a star of her level should have done. For an actress who has so much potential (10 things, save the last dance, O), it’s hard to watch her continue to play the “middle” roles, and then not make her take on the role and run off the film (like Daniel Day- Lewis did in "Gangs"). Selma Blair is also a good young actress, and she works well. I did not expect an Academy Award from her, but she did not receive it, but her performance was adequate. Chris Koch produces another film that is "above average." Perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else. I like this movie! But this is not a film where you leave and say: “It was great!” ... This “story” has already been made many times, and there was nothing new here. The rehearsal dinner scene was probably the best in the film, and Larry Miller plays an incredible supporting role (he may be the best surprise of the film). If you want to watch a movie that makes you laugh several times and spend a pleasant evening, I can still recommend this movie, but if they have not changed the ending ... again ... leave during the church scene, or you will probably be disappointed .
