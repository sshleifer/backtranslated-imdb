I always liked to watch it on TV in prime time every year in the 60s. This is a typical Hollywood epic story, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracies, so what, this is a fascinating film and a beautiful film. Cecil B. DeMille is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film at the end of his life. His son-in-law actor Anthony Quinn, who had the supporting role of Belush in the film for 38 years, is a director in his directorial debut and swan song, since he never made the film before and never will. DeMille has assembled a team that recently worked on his 10 commandments to help Quinn deal with this, including longtime assistant producer and actor Henry Wilcoxon, who oversaw the project. Also from the 10 commandments, screenwriter Jesse Lasky, filmmaker Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, director of the 2nd branch Arthur Rosson, art director Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, director Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Leicester, who, as a costume design team, was nominated for an Oscar for Bukkaner. An excellent cast for the DeMill team, led by Yul Brynner as pirate Jean Lafitte and Charlton Heston as the future president of General Andrew Jackson. Also in the cast are Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Green, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. A little more than two hours, he pulls in some places, but compensates for this with several excellent battle scenes. I would give 7.5 out of 10.
