Amazingly good early effort from Alfred Hitchcock. This film, one of the few original scripts written by Hitchcock itself, demonstrates the amazing structure of the story. It begins with an inspiring boxing match in which the carnival champion "One Round" Jack loses to his opponent from the audience, who, as it turned out, is a professional medalist. Then the film slows down to develop characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack, his girlfriend and professional boxer. The rest of the film is a dramatic build-up for a rematch between two men, this time for a heavy crown. Even in this early film, Hitchcock demonstrates his talent for meaningful cinema and advertising. The bandage bought for the girl by the boxer continues to appear throughout the film as a symbol of her infidelity. The only major foe for this film is that the art of filming a boxing match was not yet improved in 1927. As a result, the final match turns out to be somewhat anti-climatic. The story, however, is what promotes this film.
