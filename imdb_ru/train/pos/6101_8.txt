So I will not destroy it for you, I will be very brief. There are some great acting and fun lines from an attractive cast. A young graduate of Harvard Medical School (Brian White) learns that he does not know as much as he thinks about people. He goes to a small Florida hospital for an internship because a girl (Mia) left him to work as a television producer. His senior resident (Wood Harris), who was wonderfully helped by his “creative employee” (Zoya Saldana), brought him up to date. They help protect his career and show him more opportunities, which gives a compassionate doctor, and not a player who just wants to make money (as it seems to be true for many of my friends before meditation).
