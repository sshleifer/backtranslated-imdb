This movie is good. This is not the best Kung Fu movie, but it's pretty good. First of all, the story is really good. The whole idea that gods vs. fallen gods deal with superpowers is pretty cool. My problem is that there are too many characters here! It became very confusing when they swapped places! The special effects were INCREDIBLE! The fighting scenes were very fast and complex. This film is almost all computer. The game is great, as always expected from such outstanding players. Ekin Cheng is a great hero, a lonely character. Zhang Ziyi did nothing for me in this film. I thought she would play a big role, but she made one battle scene and yelled a lot. A bad guy, a whole army of skulls and a whole cloud of blood is very scary. The music is great too. For me, this story deserves at least a mini-series, and not just ONE film. Too much history to squeeze in 2 hours. Maybe if there was a book or something else, I could keep up with all the characters and details. This film sacrifices the integrity of the story for the sake of action. I recommend Storm Riders on this occasion any day.
