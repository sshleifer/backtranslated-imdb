Forget about the depth of meaning, leave your logic behind the door and have a great time with this manic funny, completely absurd, trendy "live" cartoon. MYSTERY MEN is a story about every superhero movie you've ever seen, but its unlikely super-imitators are so interesting, varied and well chosen that they are unforgettable characters in their own right. Dark humor, outright stupidity, conscientious action, and even a touching moment or two - all this makes this comic fantasy of attractive losers a real winner. The comedic talents of the actors playing "Mysterious People", including one "Mysterious Woman", are the perfect background for Wes Studi, because what can only be described as "Yoda" in the basement, and Jeffrey Rush - as one of the most wall ( and strangely charming) villains who ever leave the pages of the Dark Horse comics on the big screen. Get ready to laugh, cheer and say "eh?" more than once .... enjoy!
