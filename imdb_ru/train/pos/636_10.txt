Why the preview is so blah for a movie that is so cool !! Everyone should know what a great movie it is. It is attractive and fun from the first moment, original and well played. I wish the film showed itself as well as it deserves! <br /> <br /> For everyone who loved the Princess Bride, the Labyrinth, and other truly fun and original fantasy adventures, this is one of the best. Robert De Niro is hysterical. The relative newcomer Charlie Cox is an incredible lead man. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfifer quite upset their recent returns to the screen. There are also a lot of great moments from minor characters ... even to facial expressions.
