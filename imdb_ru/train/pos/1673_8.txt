Martino's beautiful way out is an energetic and enjoyable jallo with beautiful performances from a good looking cast and mainly two main characters, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. <br /> <br /> For me, the mystery of the plot is so confusing and confusing, you just sit and enjoy, rather than trying to foresee. As soon as everything seems resolved, we again begin a series of turns, pleasant turns, it must be said. <br /> <br /> A sexy movie with lots of bloodshed kills this well-developed film with London, Athens and Greek coastal locations. The super final, set on the Aegean cliffs, wraps things up, and everyone had fun.
