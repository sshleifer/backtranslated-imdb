Well, I'm going to go against the grain in this film, so it seems. Being a recognized fan of horror, I sat down on it, not knowing what to expect. After 2 or 3 minutes I was really scared (quite rarely). The film, obviously, has a small budget and turns around the station charing-cross, but the lack of money in the films does not distract from the story. Yes, the story is a bit contrived and does not explain itself very well, but THE CREEP is a group act that continues to dissect and dismember everything that comes its way. MESSAGE FOR WOMEN !!! THESE PART OF THE FILM THAT YOU MUST CLOSE WITH YOUR EYES OR AS WHY WHY THE KNIVES !! you will understand when you see him. <br /> <br /> In general, a good movie, and it makes a change to see a good movie slasher, which actually scares
