Probably the most capricious part of the first season, Shore Holidays has its ups and downs; some pieces stretch too long, while others involuntarily break in, but one cannot deny that they threw everything except the kitchen sink to make it an entertaining episode. It seems that Kirk and his team have found the perfect planet for shore leave after a long life has forced everyone on board to need rest, relaxation, and so on. Apparently, it is a desert land with beautiful landscapes and an ideal climate. The first sign that things can go wrong is when McCoy, who heads the front-line team, notices Alice (from Wonderland) after the big white rabbit in the vest. Kirk falls and finds others reporting equally strange events and meetings. The only thing they all have in common is that each crew member thought about the person / place / object that they discovered right before they discovered it. It is not immediately with Kirk or anyone else. There are even more oddities, including the discovery of don Juan, a Siberian tiger, a fighter of the Second World War, and so on. Kirk meets up with Ruth, the gorgeous old girl (of course) and the bully of his academic days, Finnegan. The pursuit / fight scene with Finnegan goes on for too long, but at the same time, McCoy makes his way with a spear on a horse and is apparently killed. Finally, an elderly man appears and explains what is happening. The planet is a futuristic "amusement park", where visitors can only imagine that they will appear. Nothing is eternal; McCoy is not really dead. As soon as this is understandable, Kirk decides to still order to go ashore. Despite the fact that “it was all a dream,” “Shore Leave” remains another first-class episode of the first Star Trek season.
