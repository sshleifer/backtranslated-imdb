I'm going to go out on a limb and actually defend “Grayscale” as a good episode of a clip-show that went deeper into the struggle of life and death, Commander William Thomas Riker, who fought a deadly disease. <Br /> <br /> Scenes from episodes of memories were realized quite well with the mood that Riker was in, for example, when he experienced his romantic episodes, such as “11001001”, “Angel One” and “Up the Long Staircase” . Tragic moments were noted, such as Tasha's death in “The Skin of Evil”, as well as elements of pulsating danger in “Heart of Glory”, “Conspiracy” and the aforementioned “Skin of Evil”. Riker also showed courage under fire by telling several humorous jokes, such as: "One of my ancestors was bitten by a rattlesnake once ... after 3 days of severe pain, the snake died." This episode highlighted Will Riker's psychological test under extreme coercion. And, YES, in my opinion, I tend to proclaim “Grayscale” as a serious episode, because during its initial airing my face was sweat, wondering if Riker would come out alive and alive to see other great galactic, space adventures beyond the last frontier ... <br /> <br /> Of course, in the following years I had a special opinion about this particular episode ... but if the Reward should go for "the best episode of the video show in television history ", then I believe that this episode is after blows highly valued in this regard.
