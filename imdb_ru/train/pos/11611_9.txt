Japan, 1918 The story of the 16-year-old Ryu begins with the death of her father. As will be shown later, both her parents died of tuberculosis. In this desperate situation, Aunt Ryus arranged a marriage with the Japanese in Hawaii, whom they only know from his photograph. Upon arriving in Hawaii, Ryu discovers that her new husband is much older than the photograph, and that he lives in very modest conditions near the sugar cane plantation where he works. Ryu was not accustomed to hard labor on the plantation and in desperation because of the situation in her new home, she was thinking of running away. Soon she discovers that she has nowhere to go. Friendship with Kana, her employee, gives her new hope and strength. This picture is based on real events between 1907 and the 1920s, when thousands of Asian women were married to men in America whom they knew only from their photographs. This not very famous picture is well written and acted. The place is breathtaking. This film also features Mifune Toshiro in his last appearance on the screen in the role of Benshe (the narrator of silent films). This film gives some insight into Japanese culture here and across the ocean. Must see!
