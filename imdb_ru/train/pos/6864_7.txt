Saw this movie for the first time when drunk at a motel in Canada. While scrolling through the channels, I came across a part of the Easy Lube. My friend kept flipping, but I told him to return. Something in the easy lube name just sounds wrong. Looked at the rest of the movie, it was damn funny. Recorded a couple of names from the credits and returned home to watch. Turned out the first Chevy Chase movie. I do not remember him in this. I didnâ€™t remember much about it, so I rented it and gave it a second look. It's pretty funny and pretty visual. This is similar to Kentucky Fried, but not so funny. I love fingers, light lubrication, and I fucking presidential party. The dealer dealers are also pretty cool. I give him 6.5 or 7 out of ten
