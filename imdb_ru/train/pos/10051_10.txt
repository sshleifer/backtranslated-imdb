Family problems abound in real life, and this is what this film is about. Love can keep the participants during trials and trials, and this is what this film is about. One man, dad, has the maturity and fortitude to support his family in the face of disaster. Children grow up, and all this is difficult to understand that no matter how old they are or one of the parents, the parent still loves his children and is ready to provide them with a pillow after falling. ALL the actors portraying their heroes played a prominent role. Yes, I shed a tear along the way, knowing that I had similar experiences in my youth, and later, as a parent. It is a fact of life that it is good to see every young adult and parent, although some do not realize this until they become parents. Be sure to look for those who care about their families.
