In fact, the film can be one of the most fascinating titles made by one of two Scott (Ridley and Tony). Let's face it, the film deserved its hype as one of the most stylish action / thriller films ever created. <br /> <br /> When it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts really make the perfect duet. Both this film and Deja Vu are the best thrillers you can expect. Washington really felt very comfortable in shaky cameras and in all the scenes in the film. It is easy to be associated with the emotions of your character, so you enjoyed all the kills on the road. It is a success that they created the super-dark city of Mexico City with a lot of crap. This can be easily ascertained by the degree of corruption depicted in The Man on Fire. I don’t know what Mexicans think when they look at it ...... <br /> <br /> Well, let's face it. This is one of the best genres of Death Wish, but it also suffered from a lot of violence. It is a bit annoying that they justify the actions of the action movie, making the film very realistic and allowing Denzel Washington to play the role of a tragic hero like “the lost sheep”. In the end, they even shot the kidnapper in his own pool, like a documentary. I checked IMDb if the film was based on real events for this ...... So for your consideration, if you also find out that the theme of the film is a bit fake. <br /> <br /> In the end I hope no one would really take this film. <br /> <br /> 8/10 for artistic direction / editing / cinema / Denzel Washington.
