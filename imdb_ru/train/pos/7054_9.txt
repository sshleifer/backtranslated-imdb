I thought that this film was much better than most film critics give him his due. Although he has his intricate parts of the plot, he doesnâ€™t hinder your understanding of the film. At the same time, if you are not open to more liberal political ideas, then this is probably not a movie for you. I thought all the actors in the film were outstanding. Each character has his own funny moments, and the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival laughed at it all. I thought the satire was a bit higher in one particular area, but it was intentional. John Cusack is right that although this happens in the future, it really makes you see the present.
