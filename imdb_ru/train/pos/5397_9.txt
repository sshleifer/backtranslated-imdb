Tenchu ​​aka. Hitokiri - directed by Hideo Gosh - starring Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya Nakadei (along with Goyokin, Hara Kiri and Rising) from the best existing films about Chambaras. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Shintaro Katsu (who plays Okada Iso) working for Nakadey, who wants to become a daimio. Okada, being a “cleaner” for Nakadey, is treated like a dog - and after a while he realizes that he is really for Nakadei. <br /> <br /> But there are so many things in this film - every fan of Japanese cinema had to see it !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> (Tenchu ​​means “Punishing the Heavens”)
