A man adapts to life alone after 45 years of marriage. He also has to solve the problem of the Tulip family cash cow, who refuses to allow himself to be milked. Until he imagines his wife, who used to be Tulip's milk. <br /> <br /> Tulip is based on a true story told in the family of Griffith about the generation of her grandparents. The film is a nostalgic look at the endangered lifestyle, when people still felt some sense of responsibility for each other, against the backdrop of the lush greenery of the Victorian (Australian state, rather than the era) countryside. <br /> <br /> Writer and director Griffiths obviously has further ambitions in both areas, and this multiple award-winning 15-minute short film is a great start to her reel.
