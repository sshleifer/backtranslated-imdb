She is such an extraordinary singer who takes care of everything else !!!! This final scene is one of the best moments in the whole show business - no exceptions !! I am glad that she held the camera on herself for ten minutes - she deserves this landmark status - such is the power of voice. <br /> <br /> I first saw this film when I was five years old, and it had a huge impact on me. I see it today, and yes, I see some flaws (for example, when Esther wants to leave the Grammy right when her reward is announced). <br /> <br /> But some other user comments are just a lie - I mean, where causeless nudity - maybe we saw different films ??? <br /> <br /> Streisand's singing is monumental, and if she has a big ego, that's great! <br /> <br /> She deserved it.
