I first saw this film in the 1980s, and now, in 2006, this film is still one of the best films I've ever seen! I would recommend everyone to watch this movie. You will not regret. It is well played out, so real and never boring. The acting is great, and because of the location of the film it seems that you are here. From the very beginning to the end, this film makes you lose attention. The actress copes with the image of the girl who survived the terrible plane crash on Amazon, and shows how she managed to survive on Amazon alone. It is incredible that someone could survive in such conditions. That is why this film is so attractive. The fact that this is a true story makes the film even more interesting, and the thought that a young girl can survive this ordeal is staggering. I find this film one that I can watch again and again, and one that I will never get tired of. This is really a compliment, because I have hundreds of films! I would say that this is probably my favorite movie and the best I've ever seen!
