** possible spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I like this movie and I can’t sleep without any problems. It reminds me of me at 20, except that it’s even better. As Veronica says, two chicks at the same time. This reveals in me excitement, casual conversation, these two real chicks, and not prostitutes, teasing us at every turn. I also get involved in conversations. Even if they are completely b. sometimes what? Every nestling I ever talked about, and who appreciates himself, is usually full of the same baseless, meaningless, impartial, selfish bs. philosophy. It's just nonsense, and about as reasonable as other bs. Philosophical chicks are often addicted to: astrological charts. The only deal with this film is a guy almost as feminine as women, he is at the same age. and capriciousness Brunette is really the most courageous in the world. <br /> <br /> I think it's pretty funny that Veronica is so exciting a brunette. She would love to pull the little blonde away from Alexander, but Veronica plays with her all the time. She is gorgeous. She makes a brunette think that something is wrong between them, and then she steals a boy-child / man, which is only appropriate because they seem to belong to the same age group. The brunette knows that she was at the end when she lowered her face in the palm of her hand, while Marlene Deitrich sings in the background, which, paraphrasing, is a million couples in Paris today, but I only have this refrain. /> <br /> But in the end they will marry, Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine ultra-smooth relationships ending in rupture before marriage. They are too selfish to be anything other than springboards. <br /> <br /> Although I like the movie. It entertained me, looked attractive and sexy.
