Like "On the City", this musical about sailors on vacation on the beach lags behind the later classics in terms of tempo and quality of the songs, but it has its charms. Kelly has three incredible dances: one with Jerry, a cartoon mouse of glory "Tom and Jerry", one with a little girl, and a fantasy episode where he is a Spanish lover who decided to reach his lady on a high balcony. Sinatra, playing shy, inexperienced boyfriend Kelly, and Grayson, a woman who serves as a love interest for both men, do most of the singing. Iturbi provides some great piano playing. Almost two and a half hours, this is too much for an easy musical, but he does not pull.
