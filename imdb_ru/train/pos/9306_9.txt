The world is a terrible place. But this movie is a farce and it's fun. And if you do not like ... you do not understand ... and if you do not understand ... it does not matter. It is up to you if you want to play along. Every actor in this had fun. This is just a joke. And that's enough for me. Gabriel Byrne is priceless. Byrne and Paul Anka make MY WAY, as Vic says, "... the best version ever." Okay ... this is not a masterpiece, but this is not bad. I was warned not to see it, but I'm sure glad that I did ...
