The concept that this time, Laurel and Hardy will play the role of chimney sweeps, is surprisingly fun. This guarantees some funny situations and silly antics, especially from Stan Laurel, of course, as usual. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a plot with a psycho who is working on a rejuvenation formula. In fact, this does not resemble a logical combination of plot and disjointed plot, but both plot lines fit perfectly into a memorable finale. It's still a little weird, but fun nonetheless, so it works for a movie. <br /> <br /> The cast of the film is amazingly good. Sam Adams is brilliant as a stereotypical butler, and Lucien Littlefield is excellent as a mad professor. <br /> <br /> The film is full of excellent, timed and fun constructed episodes, which are all quite predictable, but it nonetheless becomes fun to watch how they are all executed. All this helps to make the "dirty work" one of the best shorts Laurel & Hardy. <br /> <br /> 8/10
