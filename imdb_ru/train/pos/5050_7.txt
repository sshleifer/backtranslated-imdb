We really liked The Gray Owl: a simple fairy tale, well told in the classic Attenborough fashion: a bit overly romanticized, with archetypes, humor and a sense of dignity and values. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed and told in a pleasant setting. So, this is a true story about Archie, an Englishman who became Native American and went to live and fall into the trap in Canada. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the solid performances of all viewers, this film is easily viewed. <br /> <br /> Two stars of the film are, without a doubt, the sweetest of all that we have ever seen - and this is a good message with its environmental considerations. It must have been great to meet or read The Gray Owl in the 1930s, a unique character, and this is a worthy tribute to the film.
