This is a great movie, if you look in the right context - it was supposed to be a parody of films about the worship of teenagers, horror devils (and the 80s saw a lot of them)! I saw this movie when it just came out, and I immediately liked it. Being a big KISS fan, it was great to see Gina in the movie. And nothing with Ozzy as a preacher who hates metal cannot be so bad! In addition, Fastway was already my favorite, so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The original VHS cover (this was before the DVD) for Trick Or Treat showed an illustration of how Sammy gets on his knees playing the guitar in a ring of fire and the "demon" is watching. It was a special order, and the price of a copy of VHS at that time (around 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted a movie, but not for the ridiculous price. The 'OZZY-Gene' cover was created only for $ 5 reissues. The company that released it probably decided that Gene and Ozzie were the only recognizable people in the film, so it’s better for them to put them on the cover! Same with the original “Little Horror Shop” - Jack Nicholson was in it all five minutes, but now they keep it on the cover, as if he were the main star. <br /> <br /> I have the "Trick Or Treat" Site, and it's amazing how many people consider Sammi Curr to be a real person! Fastway helped perpetuate this myth by dedicating its Sammi Curr soundtrack album. <br /> <br /> In general, it was just a good time, a rock and roll movie. Definitely should not take it too seriously, but just enjoy!
