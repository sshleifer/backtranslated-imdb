Nadoev ordinary, mediocre film to watch this Halloween, which I saw again and again, I took a chance on “The Guard”, hoping that this could make my horror juices flow again. Mind you, I just came back from watching a remake of the Dark Castle "Haunted Hill House" - complete and complete nonsense. Fortunately, the “Guardian” HAS HOLDED ME! In a fascinating story about a model that moves to a horrendous building in Brooklyn Heights, the film offers everything I hope to find in a good movie - (1) Campi and fantastically juicy characters, exchanges and dialogues, including Christopher Walken's jolly turns, Jeff Goldblum and especially Martin Balm as a dispersed professor - (2) Terrifying Horror! Not to put off the frame, but in this film there are scenes that made me freeze in the pancreas - (3) Fantastic blood, stunning makeup and stupid (albeit very uneven) direction from Michael Winner, which blends quite nicely with this unreal treat. If you liked “Evil Dead 2”, “Dead Alive” and “Deep Rising” - this will be your queen of favorites. Just to highlight my love for this film - after I watched it for the first time, with a sagging jaw, I rewound it and looked again. Now it is one of the favorites of all time. Do yourself a favor and check it out!
