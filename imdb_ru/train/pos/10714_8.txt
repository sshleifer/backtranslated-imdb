The Scots succeed in telling stories. Traditional variety. Many years after this event, I can still see in my mind an elderly woman, the mother of my friend, talking about the Battle of Culloden. She makes the characters come alive. Her passion is an eyewitness. One of them - the events that occurred on the peninsula in the wasteland, about a mile from the place where she lives. <br /> <br /> Of course, this happened many years before her birth, but you won’t guess how she says it. The same story is told in bars about the length and width of Scotland. One evening, when I was discussing this with a friend in Mallaig, a local resident spoke about his version. The discussion continued until the very end. <br /> <br /> Stories inherited become a part of our being. Who does not remember the stories that our parents told us when we were children? They become our invisible world. And as we get older, they may still be an inspiration or emotional reservoir. Fact and fiction are combined with aspiration, role models. Warning stories. Archetypes Magic and mystery. <br /> <br /> "My name is Aonhas, like my grandfather and his grandfather before him." Our main character presents himself to us. It also introduces a story that goes back to generations ago. It creates stories in the story. Stories that cause the incomprehensible miracle of Scotland, its stormy mountains, shrouded in mists. Legend material. Yet Seach'd is rooted in reality. This is what gives it a special charm. He has a rough beauty and authenticity, hardened by one of the best Gaelic singing you have ever heard. <br /> <br /> Aongas (Angus) visits his grandfather in the hospital shortly before his death. It burns with frustration. Part of him is eager to be in the twenty-first century to hang out in Glasgow. But he grew up on the west coast among the Gaelic-speaking community. <br /> <br /> However, a deeper conflict exists within it. He is eager to learn the truth. The truth behind the ancient stories of his grandfather. Where does fantasy end? And he wants to know the truth about the death of his parents. <br /> <br /> His desire to make the last fateful journey to the top of one of the most inaccessible mountains of Scotland. Can you tell the truth? Or is it all in the stories? <br /> <br /> In this story of the stories, we recall the bloody battles, the poisoned lovers, the folklore of the ancients, and sometimes more insidious folklore of common truth. In addition, each of us is associated with Angus, because he lives the story of his own life. <br /> <br /> Seachd: The Inaccessible Peak is probably the most honest, unassuming, and truly beautiful Scotland film ever made. Like Angus, I was slightly irritated by the excuse to hang stories on several stories. But, like Angus, I forgave this when I saw the “big picture.” Forget the box office Braveheart and the like. You might even give up the fairly well-known drama of the Wicker Man. To see the film, true to Scotland, this film is probably unique. If you may be meditating on this deeply enough, you can even overestimate the power of storytelling and the perennial question of whether there are any truths that cannot be told, but only experienced.
