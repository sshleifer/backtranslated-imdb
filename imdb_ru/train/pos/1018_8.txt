The film was secondary, but this television pilot represents an excellent springboard into the program, which has become ideal for science fiction fans. The actors deliver, and the special effects (for the television series) are impressive. Having an intelligent interesting scenario also does not hurt. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite programs.
