In one of the best films of John Ford "Informer" there is not a single grandiose landscape of the American West. Instead, the intense drama Ford was known for playing on the equally rough terrain of the face of the British character actor Victor McLaglan. The former winner, who once met Joe Louis in the ring, demonstrates the Academy's award-winning portrait of the disgraced IRA soldier Hypo Nolan on the worst night of his life. <br /> <br /> The plot is elegantly simple: in 1922 Dublin, a hungry and humiliated man who was ousted from the IRA for his inability to kill an informant in cold blood, himself becomes an informant. For £ 20, he betrays a friend in Tanz, and the rest of the night drinks and distributes his blood money in fast-changing spasms of guilt, denial, self-pity, and a desperate desire to avoid the consequences of his action. <br /> <br /> The film’s most impressive merit is the amazing complexity of the seemingly simple Gypo character. In most films, the heavy cad of the Gypo type will look like a heavy one, he will have at best two or three lines and can be quickly disposed of so that the hero and the villain have their own fight. In The Informant, Hypo himself is both a hero and a villain, while the autopsy is in his inner turmoil, each of which is clearly told by the audience. <br /> <br /> Because Liam O'Flaherty's novel was previously filmed in 1929, the RKO gave Ford a very modest budget. The director and his partners, in particular the cinematographer Joseph H. Augustus, used this to their advantage, creating a claustrophobia masterpiece about a person fighting with himself. In addition to Oscar McLaglen, Informer also beat John Ford in first place, along with victories for better screenplay and better results.
