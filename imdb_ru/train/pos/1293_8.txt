This is a great little movie about loneliness of a lonely person. Philippe Harel in the role of Notre Heros is a bit like the amalgam of Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver, Inspector Clouzot (in his stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner in Be There (also Peter Sellers). He is not married, but he has no idea how to attract the opposite sex - in fact, he doesn’t make any effort at all! <br /> <br /> He has stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of reaching a couple - his friend José García in the role of Tisseran is in the same position, but at least he makes bold efforts to transcend his stretched virginity (he is 28 years old, and he admits that he never had sex). <br /> <br /> Very good pictures of Paris in the open air and Rouen where two programmers travel on business. They try different nightclubs and places, but all to no avail. My theory is that they try the wrong places - they go to more or less “youth” nightclubs; They should try the type in which there are older people, more than their own age. <br /> <br /> Harel is increasingly isolated and makes little effort for De Niro, as in The Taxi Driver, prompting his friend / colleague to go and strike. the guy who pulled a pretty girl in a nightclub. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
