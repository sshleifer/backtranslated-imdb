The CB4 was terrible, but perhaps it gave Cundieff an idea better. More like Spinal Tap than anything else, the movie is smart from the start. Surprises everyone who saw it in the mid-nineties. The performances are played out for laughter, but not so much that they are cartoon characters, more like Marx brothers. These guys are real and a little different. They respond to situations like any of us. Well, we cannot make a tantrum when our hats with performances are late for a concert, or pull out a weapon and bring down the recording company performer, but you get the picture. N (n *** as) W (s) H (hats) takes himself seriously enough to lead you, then you are hooked. hire or get it at any cost, even if you donâ€™t like rap, it will still make you loudly angry. Comparing this with CB4 is like comparing George Lucas 'Star Wars' with Gil Geraards 'Buck Rogers'. I think you understand my point of view.
