This is one of the greatest films about children and pets ever created. I cry every time I see Shadow shouting: “Wait, wait for me, Peter!” As the family car drives off. This is a must see if you like animals! The best movie! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. For example, when Sassy says Chance; "Feline rule and dog drool!" I could have done without such lines, but when I was six years old, I bet, I liked this line. The plot may seem crazy, but I like it. Shadow, like the older dog that prepares the Chance to take over for him when he left, really moves when you think about it. It reminded me of my baby dog. I think everyone can find a part of themselves in the Homeward Bound.
