It is difficult for me to assign the “fair” number of stars in this film, but I stopped at 8 because of its high production value and the fact that in 1968 there was an innovative approach to the military film. Remember also that I have not seen him since 1969. But he made a strong impression. <br /> <br /> “Dying for a long day” should be one of the most exciting anti-war films ever made. He accomplishes this simply by portraying, in an extremely realistic way, the actions of several soldiers in North-Western Europe from 1944-1945. No film had previously shown war at the level of infantry units with so many cruel details, and it was all so cold and impartial that the actions could speak for themselves. There is no sermon, no sentimentality, no comic relief, no complicated scenarios. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no subtlety. Partly because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters look like flat, familiar cliches. As "entertainment", the film is not removed, although it is clearly not intended for "entertainment." It was intended to hit you on the head with the sufferings and horror of the Second World War and modern war in general. It was twenty years before the platoon and thirty years before rescuing Private Ryan, both of which are much more watchable films. Here, the flat and generally unpleasant characters, the lack of a real plot and really unpleasant images (including what may be the first screen vomit in the history of the theater) make the film difficult to watch, although it is only 95 minutes. <br /> <br /> So, 10 stars for reasonableness and realism, 4 stars for the feeling that you will experience when you finish, a bonus star for the fact that her heart is in the right place. Average: 8. <br /> <br /> Like the Undervalued by Karl Forman film “Winners”, the same depressing, but more interesting and thought-provoking film, “The Dying Long Day” does not seem to be on DVD. Why not? Both films were on cable several times.
