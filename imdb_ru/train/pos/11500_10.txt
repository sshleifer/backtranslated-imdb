If Mulder was looking for his real father here, he is Darren McGavin, the first X-Files, it’s a pity that it was only one season, and the producers of this show did not know that they had classical works in their hands, and in 1993 Chris Carter with what I call the continuation of the Night Stalker, "The X-Files". Both will fall, as the classic is, in my opinion, two shows raising the audience to the level of experience that only appears from time to time and which should appear in The X-Files after years of Darren McGevin, when Agent Arthur Dales our two favorite heroes. Solve the case. Paying tribute to the person, I think it’s good, Chris Carter, who returned the forgotten TV show in the form of David Duchovny as Darren McGevin, if it were not for the X files and that particular show that I would never have known Stalker.
