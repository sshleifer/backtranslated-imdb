Walter Mattau and George Burns were the famous comedian of Vaudeville, Lewis and Clark, who had not spoken for more than 10 years. Burns retired, and Mattau took it personally and has since harbored a grudge. Such is the premise of this fun play by Neal Simon, turned into a movie. Of course, what makes it so good is Mattau and Burns in their prime, and the material is the funniest thing you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines like a nephew and agent Mattau. There are even old clips of real stars of the golden era, so that you fall into the ditch of the film, and character actor Fritz Feld begins with pop. Rosetta Lanuar, who started in the 30s at the theater with Orson Wells, and later was the grandmother of Family Affairs, is great in a small role. <br /> <br /> The only problem I encountered (and maybe I am I am too picky and / or serious) is how Mattau treats burns when they first occur. Of course, over all these years he has become angry a lot, but some of the things he does will be considered rude or simply bad manners taken out of context. In addition, I'm used to seeing how Mattau behaves in the same way in other films, but not for George Burns. And the roar of Mattau tends to get a little old. <br /> <br /> In general, if you need a constantly funny movie to help and forget about your troubles, add “The Sunshine Boys”. They will cheer you up and make you think about a simpler time and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: "We need to move it." <br /> <br /> Mattau: “Wait, wait. I think you should move it. ”
