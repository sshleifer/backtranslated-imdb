A warm, touching film with fantastic quality. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn is gorgeous as always. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis gave a lot of great performances, but there is only something about this that will haunt your memory. <br /> <br /> First of all, you should see this amazing 5 year old. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so fascinated by her presence that I had to buy a film so that I could watch it again and again. She is the miracle of God's creation. <br /> <br /> Judging by the high IMDB rating, Iâ€™m not the only one who has been hypnotized by this young actress.
