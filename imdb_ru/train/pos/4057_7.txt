Like many Americans, I first became acquainted with the works of Hayao Miyazaki when I saw Spirited Away. I fell in love with the film and saw it many times. Now I am searching to see every Miyazaki movie. One of his early works is Sky Castle. Although it’s still nice, it’s not as good as Spirited Away (although it’s probably unfair to compare this or any other film with its 2002 masterpiece). <br /> <br /> A boy named Pazu (James Van der Beek) One night he was working in a mine when he saw a girl fall slowly from the sky. When she wakes up the next morning, she presents herself as Shita (Anna Paquin). But Shita has a secret, and before he recognizes him, Pazu is drawn into an adventure that will lead him to danger with pirates, the army and the lost floating city. <br /> <br /> Hayao Miyazaki’s entry into the film means that you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and fear, like Miyazaki. Watching a Miyazaki film is like experiencing a fantastic dream from childhood. <br /> <br /> Since the film is animated, the duplication of the film does not pose a big problem, since it is impossible to determine whether the movements of the lips correspond to the words. It also helps that the translated dialogue is well written and voiced by talented actors. The voice acting is varied. James van der Beek rates are the best. He brings insurmountable enthusiasm and excitement to the role of Paz, which is ideal for the character. Anna Paken is almost as good as Shita. She is frightened by the events around her, but she knows what she needs to do. Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as evil Muscat. He is dangerous and wants something from Shita, and will do anything to get it. Other voices are bad. Cloris Lichman is terrible, like Dola. Leechman may have won an Oscar for the “Last Image,” but she is annoying as a pirate leader. Leachman gives the character a disgusting cry, which is almost always the same. It's so bad it almost ruins the movie! Jim Cummings is an effective voice-over actor, but he is mistaken as a general. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend watching “Castle in the Sky”. I will probably end up buying it myself. But even if it’s not as good as Spirited Away, it’s still pretty good.
