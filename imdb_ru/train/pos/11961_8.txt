I thought it was a great way to spend time on too hot a summer weekend, sitting in an air-conditioned theater and watching a lighthearted comedy. The plot is simplified, but the dialogue is witty, and the characters are cute (even the suspected serial killer is good bread). While some may be disappointed when they realize that this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought that this is proof that Woody Allen still fully controls the style that many of us have loved. It was the biggest thing that I laughed at one of Woody’s comedies over the years (dare I say a decade?). Although I was never impressed by Scarlett Johanson, in this she managed to soften her “sexy” image and jump straight into the middle, but energetic young woman. <br /> <br /> It may not be the crown jewel in his career, but it was witty than Devil Wears Prada, and more interesting than Superman, a great comedy to go see with friends.
