I found this film suggestive, and its ambiguity refreshes in the world of fast-fixing films, where we are forced to love the "good guy" and hate the "bad guy." Scott Cohen, a very handsome television actor, perfectly draws a family black sheep / lost child who seeks to win the love and respect of his father, as well as his widowed daughter-in-law, with whom he obviously has a story. Judd Hirsch plays against his usual image of a good guy like a father who triangulated his sons and now stays with the one he always rejected. <br /> <br /> When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was fascinated by the wonderful way the sawdust was used to portray the family tradition, as the director explained. <br /> <br /> This is the suitable heiress of the classic "Ordinary People". I just realized Judd Hirsch was in it too!
