Bette Midler is again divine! With sadness of humor. In love with burlesque. Able to bring you down to tears or with old jokes with new dresses, or simply with old songs with more force and impact than ever. All in All Singing new ballads, powerful singing of the good old / eternal, such as "The Rose"; “Stay with me” and even “The wind is under my wings.” The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M has always been free - since this is the next best thing for him, I highly recommended everyone with a mixture of adult charm and appreciation with wide eyes and a mischievous child’s desire to push all the boundaries!
