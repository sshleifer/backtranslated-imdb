Tragically beautiful film ... brings us to Japan, which is no longer there. Despite the technical expertise of Hollywood, I have not yet watched a (Hollywood) film that could match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town by the river by the sea ... Tom Cruise's “Last Samurai” looked like the last part of The Lord Of The Lord. Rings in an attempt to capture rural old Japan. <br /> <br /> If you like calm but intense plot lines, this film is a must see. It will be a respite from the empty bright films, similar to the last 1000 blockbusters that you have seen. I think this is one of the best stories of Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> Even if it is a film about geishas and brothels and the complex rules governing life in such conditions, it has not turned into a film. Characters are full of depth and act with great intensity.
