In general, I fully agree with the Ebert review. In a sense, I feel that I should not even comment, since this is a vet film, and I am not a vet (I was resisting) The disadvantage is that Martha is poorly developed and does not act consistently. I assume that Stephen Metcalf himself is a veterinarian and too little time is devoted to planning his character.
