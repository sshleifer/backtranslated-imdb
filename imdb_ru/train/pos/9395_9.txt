If you like plot twists, this is your movie. At any moment it is impossible to predict what will happen next. Nothing is as it seems or ends as you think. Characters are all sandy and attractive. Cage at its best. Dennis Hopper shows his delightfully sinister side again. J. T. Walsh is perfect in his last talk. Laura Boyle hisses. Dwight Yoakum makes a great film debut. I classify this film as a film “I have a really very bad day.” Not a slow minute in this movie. The real sleeper. This film is underestimated and, unfortunately, missed.
