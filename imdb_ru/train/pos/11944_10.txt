I was going to give him 8, but since you people scored 6.5 of the best votes, I had to increase my input. The River Styx was pure genius. Undoubtedly, Woody was his permanent material, but at least his role was relevant. The first half hour was really fun, and then the rest of the film was easy to watch. The dialogue was smart enough, and Woody's card tricks at parties, as well as the reaction of the upper crust, were interesting to watch. It was much better than criticized newspapers. And plus, the little student of the sorcerer, to go along with it. And, of course, did you notice that Johansen is getting a little awkward? Charles Dance is always interesting, as is Hugh Jackman.
