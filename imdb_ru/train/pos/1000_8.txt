I liked the movie. Some scenes were very interesting, intense and well executed. I especially liked the opening scene in which there was a semi-trailer. A very tense action scene that seemed well done. <br /> <br /> Some of the transition scenes were shot in interesting ways, such as slow-motion shots, unusual colors, or interesting angles. Also, the film is funny consists of several parts. I also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too. I would give the film 8 out of 10.
