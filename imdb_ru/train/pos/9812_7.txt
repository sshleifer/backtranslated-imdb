The Big Farewell introduces us to the first adventure in the chill, in this case Captain Picard, posing as a private detective Dixon Hill. This episode creates a standard pattern that repeats several times on TNG, as well as on DS 9 and Voyager. After entering the well, something goes wrong, and the characters have to deal with the program under other circumstances besides playing the game (which is reflected in the failure of the holodeck security program). <br /> <br /> This concept is used to empower Star Trek and create a kind of genre mix. Picard's stories about Dixon Hill are examples of criminal fiction of the 1940s, and their presentation on the screen is referred to as the “Film Noir”, often with an anti-hero stereotype (see, for example, the stories of Chandler Marlowe or the classic Chinatown Polansky) Star Trek never focuses on the plot (mostly a simple “how to find us” scenario), but allows actors to take a different approach to their characters. These Hollywoodk games are usually used for recreation and reflect the personal interests of crew members. Therefore, the technical aspect is always neglected, and from this point of view history is never justified (but did Star Trek ever have a technical, scientific point of view, I mean besides some utopian concepts?). <br /> <br /> “Big Goodbye” shows a relaxed Patrick Stewart, McFadden, who hardly ever looked better in the Star Trek episode (at least in the early stages), and in Data too there are some wonderful scenes (although it’s hard for me to believe that the tension of the lamp, the cork from the wall would really surprise him for conducting a study of this period and his customs). Wesley continues to turn the peaceful trekkists into potential killers (why didn't they take him to Golodok and not let the gangsters finish him off?), But on the whole, it's funny ...
