I look at romantic comedies with some hesitation, because in romantic comedies there are old clich√©s that make the film uninteresting. As a rule, in a romantic comedy there is a girl and a boy, both fall in love, then problems arise, and then troubles win to get married or something else. But this film is a different story, it really is very different from the romantic comedies that I've seen lately. <br /> <br /> There is a widowed guy (Dan), there is a girl (Marie). Dan meets Marie at the bookstore and talks for a while, and after a while Marie has to leave. Dan develops something for her, and when it starts to make sense, we get a turn. Marie is his brother's girlfriend. Ignoring the circumstances, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her, and even Marie loves him, but their love would not have been possible. How this became possible forms the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell plays well, Juliette Binoche is as good as Marie. And everything else is done well. This is a good movie, watch it.
