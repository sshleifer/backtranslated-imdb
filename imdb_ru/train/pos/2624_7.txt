In this film, we have an incredible opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumba in the film, when they were not shown - and this is a lot! This film even goes back to Simba and (presumably) immediately after Kiara’s birth. <br /> <br /> The true first film "The Lion King 1/2" (or "The Lion King 3" in other places) is a funny, interesting, exciting and amazing film (or a sequel, if you want to call it that) . You will find many surprises and fun! <br /> <br /> While Timon and Pumba are watching a movie in the cinema (with a remote control), Timon and Pumba are arguing about the meaning of “The Lion King” “They will start to watch Timon want to go to the part where he and Pumba come, and Pumba wants to go back to the beginning. They have a very fair compromise in watching a film of their own history, and this is what awaits ... It starts with Timon's first house ... <br /> <br /> For anyone with a good sense of humor who liked the first films About any age, enjoy "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
