The question of whether anyone likes this version of the film “Ghost Train” always depends on one thing: on your reaction to the performance of Arthur Asuka. <br /> <br /> He is inclined to steal almost every scene he is in, and not always in a good way. Sometimes you want him to calm down a bit or back off to allow many of the plot characters to show and develop (which they do to some degree). But for some reason, everything continues to point to the character Asuka Tommi Gander. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like the movie, and even to the extent that Asuka. I always seem to immerse him in a VCR in those strange hours of the early morning when I can't sleep and really can't find the energy to watch something else. There is something about watching old b / w movies in quiet darkness at dawn, which seems attractive to me ....
