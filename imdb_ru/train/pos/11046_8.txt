Maléfique is a very interesting film. This is an unholy fusion of triumphs and failures. The central concept is great: the fourth is joined to the three prisoners with bizarre personalities (with which the audience identifies themselves), and they try to escape from their cell using the magic book they find in the walls of the cell. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is well woven, it reminds me that I read about Edmond Dantes' prison stay at Chateau d'If (before becoming Count Monte Cristo) The director creates the feeling that the characters are tied to the camera, especially to the character with whom we have to identify ourselves (Carrer is a white-collar criminal, whose crime is not indicated, but indirectly it is assumed that this may be a fraud). In one instance, Carrer hesitates, leaving the exercise room, and closes the cell door; we never leave the camera, the claustrophobia is not broken. In addition, not a single shot is visible from the outside of the cell, and the view through the lattice is a long sunset over the common prison wall. Therefore, despite the fact that the film looks very modern, it has the feeling of an old world imprisoned. <br /> <br /> Characters are intriguing. We have Marcus, a brutal transsexual before the operation, who plays the abusive mother for Packetti (in French “Daisy”) - a very backward young man. Puckett likes to eat everything that he thinks is beautiful, and, unfortunately, this includes his little sister, hence his current difficulty (I like this comment about internalization, very primitive). LaSalle - a closed, obsessed elderly man who brutally killed his wife. <br /> <br /> The main idea of ​​the film is that your desires will destroy you, and there is a ritual in it. I think this is what worries me the most, seeing how people destroy themselves ritually. It has a real life ring. A rather simple soundtrack confirms this well; each step deeper into quicksand is accompanied by a deaf ringing of a gong. I actually hear the gong now every time I do something suicidal. <br /> <br /> I think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters don't really reinforce the message consistently, especially with Carrère, also the concept of the book seems to change throughout the entire movie, not from the point view of consistent revelation either. I also think that some of the images we see are a bit dilettante, more in design than in design, such as the famous “eye of the vagina” and Lasalle sodomy, for me, completely empty images. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, it seems that the director is in a hurry to end this, and some things seem illogical, for example, we are clumsily made to believe in different things about the child Carrera. This does not change the fact that we have this rare bird, a “pure” horror film. There is no comedy dross or genre transition, such as Cube (1997 / Natalie), an obvious film for comparison, this is a complete diving experience when you feel that you are in a camera with characters. This last comment, which I say is a “clean” experience, I think this is something that others have mentioned, so this is a rather unanimous comment. <br /> <br /> In a personal note, my favorite part of the film is when Lazalle talks about his past as a librarian. He very vividly describes the scene when one day he goes to work and sits down in his usual place in the center of the room, where all the books are located around him. Books seem to sing to him that he will never contain their knowledge. This makes LaSalle go crazy. This is really a problem of obsession with understanding and knowledge. This is what I myself felt. <br /> <br /> One last comment: two of the rather well-received comments on the board confused the names of the characters. To convince yourself that Lasalle is an old librarian, just click on Philip Loudenbach’s page and you’ll see that he was born in 1936.
