Green eyes is a great movie. In today's context of support for our troops, it is interesting that this film showed a lack of respect for the soldiers gained from performing their duties during this period. From a historical point of view, the end of the Vietnam War left us all something to remember and learn. Gene was very proud of this film, and he deserved the merit he received from writing Green Eyes. I agree, I do not understand why this film is not shown more often or in general. This film is the kind of film that needs to be shown on TV every year, just like The Wizard of Oz. The devotion of one person to his lost son is completely moving. I was a friend of Gene Loganza, and I was proud of his acquaintance. rocky
