"The day is over" - an incredible picture. in a sense, it is better than “close encounters of the third kind”. (I prefer raw independent films to a big budget spectacle.) The special effects are Cheesy, but this is a big part of the fun. Jim Davis does an excellent job in this film. this is probably one of the best roles he has ever played in the film. music score is very good. the story does not make sense. BUT IT WILL ONLY MAKE THIS EVERYTHING TO MORE Like many of the best works of art, “the day is over” is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. “The end of the day” may be a low-budget indie film, but it's not too difficult to compare it with the “existential” European films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were low-budget independent production.)
