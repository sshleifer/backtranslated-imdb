Xiao Chen Ji Chun is a great film not only in the year in which it was shot, but now. This is a feature film that is not outdated, even in the 21st century. The director retained a good narrative skill and thus made the story so smooth! <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of the new French film “New Wave”: “Femme d'a cote” by François Truffaut on a similar theme. ,
