I do not know, comedy or not, but I agree that this is one of the greatest television shows in history. It's great that this show is still on the air. And I love Michelle. It's cute in the episodes when she was a child, and she spoke, and she sometimes said something funny. Aw. <br /> <br /> This show may concern children, teenagers and ... well, families that are going through difficult times and trying to work it out in the family. I do not know who would refuse to see this show with someone. <br /> <br /> I like this episode when I think her name is DD. The older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt, and she learned a lesson about theft. It was a great episode. An example that this TV show shows how a family works as a family. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to everyone.
