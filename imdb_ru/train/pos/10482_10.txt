I love this film. This is one of those whom I can look again and again. He is well performed by a good cast who is not trying too hard to be covered with stars. <br /> <br /> The suggestion that the recently widowed housewife, who turns to the pot seller to make ends meet, could be turned into an Americanized poop from a movie or an action movie. Any one of them would completely kill the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is played out as an “Fascinating Comedy” with an amazing sense of well-being. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing only the stage with two old women and a box of cornflakes ... (no, this is not a spoiler!)
