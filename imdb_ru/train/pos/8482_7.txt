This is insanely colossal, vulgar, stupid, all-star enchanting revue from all the early radio stations that Warner Bros could afford. ... and, like most other rare films that were actually made in the late 20s, this is an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the abundance and youth of these roaring twenties, lent to song and dance. SHOW SHOW is pretty gigantic. Vaudeville acts after a monologue after a tap dance after an acrobat after a comedian after a fan dance after insanity ukulele after Rin Tin Ting, who introduces the "eastern number" ... (!) ... and further and further lumber on it, grinning and creaking in fabulous gramophone, high-quality sound of the Vitafon. It's too long, but among his insane delights is the amazing Singin in the Bathtub room, created on a scale that QE2 architects will be proud of ... Beatrice Lilly lounged around the piano with a few happiness boys, funny singing wit child, Nick Lukas, and an endless grand final in a two-tone color ... which is all set for the song LADY LUCK. The piercing line of chorus and jumping teenagers enthrall us so much that they almost beat themselves in the face with joy and effort. Row after row, the characters "Dolls" jump over, and some even leave the floor. I donâ€™t joke, there are even girls tied to crystal chandeliers, mummified with shiny gauze and chained with pearl ropes, unable to move (for many days, I suppose, during production), while this katzenjammer toy box of athleticism twitches and a spasm below to ukulele. Of course, I liked it, and I had to watch this final of the colors again and again, and then several weeks in a row to invite friends and family to the screen, just to horrify and scare them each separately and ride through the hall, screaming with delight at each and every exclaiming their astounding reactions. And you should ... and rejoice in the fact that there was an era when it was created just for fun and thrill. It's all so crazy.
