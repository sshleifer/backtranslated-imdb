Oh, come on, learn some fun. When I was a kid, oh, this film was an Oscar to me. I thought it was absolutely hysterical. One of the best films I've seen. <br /> <br /> It's a little silly, but come on. If you enjoyed “Great Adventure,” you should probably have some fun with Fake Journey. It was a movie in front of "Dude, where's my car?" Only this one is really funny. As I said, this is just a good time. This should not be taken seriously, and if you liked the first one, you should like Bogus Journey. This is just a fun movie with a few memorable characters. Just for your pleasure, watch it, let go and remember that this is a silly comedy. That's all. <br /> <br /> 7/10
