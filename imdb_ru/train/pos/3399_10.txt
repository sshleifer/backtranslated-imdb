It was Eddie Robinson’s 101st film and his last, and he died of cancer nine days after filming finished. All this makes his key scene in the film even sharper. <br /> <br /> Although some styles of hair and clothes are a little outdated (also pay attention to the video game shown in the film), but the subject of the film is largely timeless. Heston said he wanted to make a film for a while because he really believed in the danger of overcrowding. <br /> <br /> Some things make this movie classic. The story is solid. <br /> <br /> High-level acting, especially the interaction between Heston and Robinson, with good performances also Cotten and Peters. <br /> <br /> The music is absolutely flawless, the mixture of Beethoven, Grieg and Tchaikovsky in combination with pastoral visual elements create truly touching scenes. It was the icing on the cake for the movie. <br /> <br /> And the theme (or “point”) of the film is essential. Yes, this is a film about overpopulation, but, more importantly, this is a cautionary tale about what could go wrong with man’s control on Earth. In the subtext you will find the real message of the film. Pay attention to what Sol says about the "old days" of the past (which is our present), and note that Thorn is not able to understand what Saul is saying. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my best science fiction movies of all time.
