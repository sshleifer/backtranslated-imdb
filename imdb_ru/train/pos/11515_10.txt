Many years have passed since I saw this, but I feel obliged to protect this gem from those who condemn it. <br /> <br /> It is interesting and unusual to observe a variety of opinions here. This is what humor I suppose. This is subjective. It either charges through your fun bone at 60,000 volts, or makes you wonder why you gave it time. <br /> <br /> In this series, some of the best British comic actors met in a stupid disrespect and the result is hilarious. The dialogue and the visual comedy are perfectly delivered, and the two leads (Cleese and Lowe) are excellent together. It was made for them. <br /> <br /> I canâ€™t say anything more than begging you to find it and see. You will not be disappointed, and in a world devoid of noble humor, this is a classic pointless and harmless piece of comedic brilliance.
