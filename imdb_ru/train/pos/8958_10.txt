After you see “Dizziness,” look at Bell, “The Book and the Candle,” shot in a few months. <br /> <br /> My second favorite movie “Kim Novak” with Picnic will be the third. <br /> <br /> All three performances are great, “Dizziness” is the best of all. <br /> <br /> They came to my nowhere unknown Kansas Prairie, in Salina, Kansas, in the 50s, to the film “Picnic”. <br /> <br /> The musical accompaniment of Bella, Beech and Candle, in my opinion, belongs to Alex North. Perfect for this comedy. <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stuart and Nowak made this comedy, as it is fun to note the dramatic contrast. <br /> <br /> Worth the time if you like Kim Novak. Greta Garbo of my youth.
