The French production, in which leading filmmakers from 11 countries were asked to create 11-minute short films about the events of September 11. <br /> <br /> Segments of the film vary greatly in content and quality. Two allude to US complicity in terrorist acts (in Chile against Allende, who died on September 11, 1973, in the picture of British director Ken Loach, and in Palestine, US-backed Israelis shown in the picture from Egyptian director Yusef Chein). Two more are reminiscent of other destructive acts (suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, shot by Israeli director Amos Gitan; the Japanese "holy war" against the West in World War II Shohei Imamura). <br /> <br /> Irony is abundant in several stories. The shadows that darken the grieving old man’s apartment in New York suddenly disappear when the telescope of the World Trade towers fell to the ground in a play by Sean Penn, bringing instant joy to a man. But in this bright light, he finally sees that his wife is really gone. In Mira Nair’s movie based on a real incident, the missing young man, also in New York, the son of a Pakistani family, is initially considered a fugitive from justice, but later he turns out to be a hero who sacrificed himself trying to save others in the towers. <br /> <br /> There are sharp moments around them. Loach asked his exiled Chilean to quote St. Augustine that hope is built from anger and courage: anger in the way things are, the courage to change them. Imamura tells us that there is no holy war. Samira Makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her very young Afghan schoolchildren, exiled to Iran, who are trying to tell them about the events that have just happened in New York. But for obvious reasons, they are more impressive at a major event in their refugee camp, where two people fell into a deep well, one of which was killed and the other got a broken leg. This is an acceptable tragedy on a grand scale for 6-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Idriss Ouedraogo of Burkina Faso creates a drama in which the son of a sick woman sees Osama bin Laden in their village and gathers his friends to help catch the fugitive terrorist to get $ 25. million US dollars. He tells his friends not to tell any adult about his plans, as older people will simply spend money on cars and cigarettes, while he plans to help his mother and others who are sick and destitute. <br /> <br /> This is the Mexican director Alejandro González Inarritu (producer of "Amores Perros"), which currently provides the most powerful and frightening segment, which, for the most part, shows only a darkened screen with audio cassettes, singing loops and voices and occasional deaf sounds. Short visual flashes gradually allow us to see bodies falling from the high floors of the towers, and it comes to us that the thuds are those bodies that fall to the ground. The sequence ends with elegiac orchestral music and the frame on which the phrase is written, first shown only in Arabic, and then the added translation: “Does the light of God guide us or blind us?” +).
