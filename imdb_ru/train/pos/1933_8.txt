This indie film tells the story of a group of people attending adult swimming classes in Connecticut. The plot is quite thin. What drives the movie are heroes, superbly played by mostly unknown actors. Among the main roles are: Brewster as a high school teacher with family problems, and Weisler as a casino dealer who works as a stripper. Two actresses give natural performances and work well together. This is an impressive feature film debut for writer Schechter and director Setton. The latter holds the narration in a quick clip. The title and poster of the film suggest something obscene, but this is an amazing little comedy drama.
