I watched a movie today, and it just amazed me. This is a true masterpiece of art, and I do not understand why most people think that it is rubbish. The main idea of ​​the film is to remove your ego and then you will have real power! It was the main battle at the end of the film, and Guy Ritchie brilliantly showed it. “The greatest enemy will be hiding in the last place you will ever watch” - do you remember this from the movie? Because our true enemy in us is our ego ... This voice, which always tells us that we are important, gives us our pride, tells us not to give, but only to take, it creates our aggression that wants to be controlled that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts. GR expressed this idea in an amazing way and showed that the only way to get true control is when you lose control and just let go of your personal importance. A great movie!
