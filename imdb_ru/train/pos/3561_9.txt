At least something good came out of Damon Runyon's mistaken attempt to sentimentalize the mafia. “Guys and Dolls”, a seemingly indestructible stage musical, was filmed in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz (“All About Eve”) in a colorful, fascinating film with the participation of all the stars, including Vivian Blaine (from the original). Broadway show), Jean Simmons (whose character bears a strange resemblance to Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday") and two of the greatest heroes of all time, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, both of whom recently won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor ( “From here to eternity”) and the best actor (“On the Embankment”) were at the top of their game. One listens to Brando singing “Good luck, be a lady tonight,” says a lot about where early Dylan got his voice. Stubby Kaye shoots the show as Nicely Nicely Johnson, who rents a house with "Sit down, you rock the boat." Omnipresent Sheldon Leonard adds another page to the gallery of his gangster screen gangsters. The film has a bright, cartoon look, anticipating pop art of the early 1960s. Characters speak in a stylized style, obviously based on Yiddish idioms. Despite the fact that the social attitudes of the film and gender roles are outdated, this is all very fun, and even the soft jokes of the Salvation Army are harmless and do not reflect a real hostility towards organized religion. It is enough just to watch Sinatra and Brando in one movie, but within 149 minutes he has many other attractions.
