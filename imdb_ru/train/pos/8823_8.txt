A good film Tells a boyish fantasy story, telling us how we are trapped in social situations and what extreme measures we need to take in order to behave differently. Or at least the feeling: that you must break every rule if you want to break one. If you wanted to express love for someone you don't know, how would you do it without creating an acute social situation? In addition, we are talking about the fascism of making decisions about the cultural life of other people, about what kind of culture that is stuck in our throats. What gives Disney, FOX, or a suicide bomber the right to decide which option to choose. Is it possible to drink morning coffee alone. Should we listen to NRJ shouts, see the stupid tabloid headlines and advertisements on the streets before we have our morning coffee?
