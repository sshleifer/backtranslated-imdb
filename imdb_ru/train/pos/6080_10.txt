Othello, the classic Shakespearean story of love, betrayal, lies and tragedy. I remember studying this story in high school, I actually discovered that Othello is probably my favorite story of Shakespeare, because it was so fascinating that Shakespeare perfectly captured the feeling of friendship, love and racism. I mean, when you really study this story, you can find a lot of philosophies about why Othello went crazy with jealousy in the blink of an eye. But later for my report I also looked at this version of Othello, and I must say that it was just gorgeous. Laverans and Kenneth just tell the story so well and realize that it is dark. <br /> <br /> Othello is an outstanding soldier in his city, everyone loves him, including the king. But when the king finds out that Othello sneaked up with his daughter Desdemona, the king went berserk, but ruled out. Othello is welcomed in the city and makes him his best friend, Cassio, his assistant instead of Iago, who supported Othello. Because of his mad jealousy, he longs for revenge. Still pretending to be Othello's best friend, he only hints at Othello that Desdemona is cheating on him from Cassio, never says that this is so, just makes Othello think that this is happening. Othello is deranged and has no pleasant plans for Desdemona or Cassio, and Iago is more than happy to help him. <br /> <br /> Othello is an incredible story, I highly recommend you read it. This is an incredible story that makes you think after reading. Othello, the film is also great, and once again I recommend it, it perfectly captures the story and has a big type of teariness, or you can just be completely shocked by what happens between Othello and Desdemona, how quickly he thinks that his love is true will betray him. This is a terrific movie, great acting, good productions and good leadership, that is what Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
