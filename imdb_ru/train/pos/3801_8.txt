This is an animated CGI movie based on a French 2D animated series. The series was briefly shown on the Cartoon Network, but its show was so short that its inclusion as one of the potential Oscar nominees for this year’s best animated film left most people I knew in the role of “A?” This is the story of Lian-Chu, a kind heart muscle, and Guizdo, the brains of the operation, which, together with Hector, looks more like a dog with his fiery frightening dragon. Travel the world by offering your services as dragon hunters, but never pay. Zoya, the fabulous loving niece of the king, who is blind, enters their lives. It seems that the world is swallowed up by a huge monster, and all the knights that the king sent out never returned, or if they really come back, they return as ashes. In desperation, the king hires dragon hunters to stop the world devourer. Zoe, of course, is watching ... <br /> <br /> What can I say besides why this film is hiding under a rock? This is a really good little movie that is completely hidden from the radar, with the exception of the unlikely opponent Oscar. This beautifully designed, fantastic looking film (the world in which it develops has floating lands and crazy creatures), which constantly made me say “Wow”. The English voice, played with Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard), and Rob Paulson as Guizdo (I think Steve Bucemi), is first-rate. No less remarkable is the script, which does not communicate with its audience, using some real expressions that usually do not sound in animated films (neither in Disney nor in Pixar). Everything is really well done. <br /> <br /> Is it perfect? No, some bits go on too long, but at the same time it's pretty darn interesting. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, take a look at it. This is one of the best animated films of 2008, and it came to my pleasant surprise for 2009.
