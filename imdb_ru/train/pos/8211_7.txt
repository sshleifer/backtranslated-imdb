Having never seen the original “Dirty Harry”, I appreciated this film from scratch. And I have to say, I really enjoyed it. Of course, some of Sondre Locke’s actions made me a little nervous - but hey, it was the 80s. But even if you can't get past her (and I almost could not) or her killings for revenge (which seemed a bit ... excessive; P), it's worth it, only for Dirty Harry. Or, at least, the bull dog, which he affectionately calls “MeatHead”: P <br /> 7/10.
