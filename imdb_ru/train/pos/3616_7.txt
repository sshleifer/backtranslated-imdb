The direction of the unknown Michelle Rodriguez in the role of Diana was a brilliant blow. She is beautiful. Her acting inexperience actually works in her favor. We have never seen her before, so it really looks like her story. It also brings genuine strength. It works against her, though, because we never doubt her. You will never have to cheer her up so that she won, because she never goes against any fighter who we think she cannot win. So, like a boxing film, it fails. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is not really a boxing film. How do you make a film about a girl who wants to become a boxer, and not about boxing? You are not. But Karin Kusama is still there. Like many indie films, “Girlfight” defies classification or genre and stands on its own as folklore that can happen in real life. <br /> <br /> Diana is bad at school. She beats people she doesn’t like (for example, all the other girls in her school). She doesn't fit. Her father makes her younger brother Tini learn how to box so that he can protect himself when things get difficult. He gives Tiny money for her boxing sessions and gives Diana nothing, as if she needs neither protection nor anything worth living out of her life. The little one wants to go to art school (cliché, muck), so he gives his boxing allowance to Diana, who actually wants to box. Everything gets complicated when Diana falls in love with another boxer, Adriana (Santiago Douglas), who wants to become a professional. From there, the story unfolds towards the inevitable ... they meet in an amateur title fight. <br /> <br /> What struck me was that I had never found anything so interesting. This is all too believable. Children with a hard life growing up in harsh urban areas are returning to sports. Many professional boxers have risen from these circumstances. The mental and physical endurance required for this education is suitable for a game like boxing, where anger is your friend. So this time it's a girlfriend. Big deal. <br /> <br /> Or there is another position: finally, a film about boxing about a girl. Women's boxing has been around for a long time. The brutality that we usually see in boxing films is replaced here by a discussion of their lives and feelings. The whole combat thing is used as a platform to paint the big picture. Respect. Overcoming adversity. Self-disclosure. <br /> <br /> I recommend “Girlfight” because she has a good spirit and is an example of the great work of the new director. The dialogue never rises above the quality of the soap opera, but the story itself actually changed my view of some things. Yes, the world now seems to be the best place. The film did it. <br /> <br /> Rating: B-
