Eddie Izzard is a genius with his nonstop humor. I could listen all day. His unique approach to life is quite logical. His understanding of discovery (such as the Heimlich maneuver) is creative. Eddie Izzard captures the essence of what we think. I don’t know when I laughed at someone’s unusual mind.
