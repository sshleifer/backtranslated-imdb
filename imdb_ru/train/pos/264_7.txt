Doc Hickory was a good Poirot mystery. I admit, I did not read the book, despite the fact that I was an avid fan of Agatha Christie. Adaptation was not without problems, there were times when humor, and there were bold attempts to do it right, were a bit exaggerated, and the events leading up to the final decision were rather hasty. I also thought that there were some slow moments, so some of the riddles felt soft. However, I liked how Hickory Dickory Doc was filmed, he had a very similar visual style to the brilliant ABC Murders, and he really set the atmosphere, as with the dark camera work and the dark lighting. The dark moments were somewhat creepy, some of the most intrusive scores in Poirot's adaptation helped, perhaps not as disturbing as in One Two Buckle My Shoe, because of which I had nightmares. The plot is complex, with all the necessary ingredients, although not as tangled as Buckle My Shoe, and in a sense it is good. The game was very good, David Suchet is flawless (I know I can't use this word forever, but I can't think of a better word to describe his performance in the series) as Poirot, and Philip Jackson and Pauline Moran give their integral characters brilliantly. And the students had excellent personalities and, on the whole, they developed well, especially Damian Lewis as Leonard. In general, a solid mystery, but it is not among the best. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
