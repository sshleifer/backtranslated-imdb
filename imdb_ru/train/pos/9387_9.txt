As others commented, I checked it after Siskel and Ebert called it one of the top 10 films of the year. What a gift. Then I went out to buy it, just so I could borrow it. <br /> <br /> Best quote? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone (Cage) is on his cab. When Cage looks down, he apologizes. "Sorry if I scared you." Yoakum shoves his gun in Cage's face: “Does this look like I'm scared?” Great humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape. <br /> <br /> It really was fun. Constant observation of the “Welcome to Red Rock” sign causes a moan and smile. Music has created a hunt, an eerie quality for a film reminiscent of Twin Peaks. However, unlike Twin Peaks, he doesn’t spoil things by going too far in wonder, demanding "himself." <br /> <br /> I allow viewing loans 15-20 times. You see, they had “A Thousand Miles Out of Nowhere” of Yoakum (perfectly matched), playing the role of a freight train that bent to the desert floor. , with snowy mountains in the distance. It was an incredible, smooth creation. In addition, I have never seen a better combination of vision and sound on film. In addition, it is fully consistent with the story.
