Finally, an indie film that actually delivers some great fears! I see most horror films that go out ... Theatrical, Straight-to-DVD, cable TV, etc. ... and most of them sucks ... some of them are watchable ... even less are really good ... Dark Remains is one of the good ones. I caught the screening of this film at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the audience liked it ... and my wife, and I liked it! Not having named actors, I assume that the budget for this film was rather low, but you wouldn't know about it ... the film looks fantastic ... the acting game fully works for the film ... the story is good ... and the panic is excellent ! While most filmmakers focus solely on panic, they often forget about the development of the plot and character, two things that help deliver panic more effectively. Brian Avenet-Bradley should know that character and history are important. He develops that you take care of the heroes, you know them, and therefore you fear them more when they are in danger. <br /> <br /> Watching horror movies costing from 80 to 5000 dollars. I believe that "Dark Remains" - one of the pearls. Check out this movie!
