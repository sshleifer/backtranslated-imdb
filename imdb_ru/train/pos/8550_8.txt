Now I love American Pie 1 and 2, while 3 was great only for Shonn William Scott to perform as Stifler, but after that the quality fell. Band Camp kept the standard at a high enough level with the characters you really cared about, but the Naked Mile was the same joke and the storylines were reworked (Eric Stifler’s sex problem is like Jim’s). He had funny moments, such as playing football against dwarfs and Kuzeman’s “punishment”, but on the whole he lacked originality, and the “Mile” was just silly and moronic. Not to mention the annoying girl who does not want to have sex. <br /> <br /> Anyway, about the Naked Mile. I looked at Beta House with apprehension, because I thought it might take the series to a new level, but I was pleasantly surprised. Honestly, there is no real story, but it is full of hot girls (Ashley is incredible) and full of jokes in abundance. Yes, it is formal, and the jokes are old, but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with copious performance. The Greek Olympiad is especially interesting with its penultimate and final events, while Christopher MacDonald's cameo is very funny. There are weak spots, though. Kuzeman is annoying just as he was in the first one; I am still puzzled by how he ever got the part. <br /> <br /> While Kuzman is bad, Eric Stifler is worse off. John White made the Naked Mile painful to watch, but in Beta House he raised his game to a whole new level. First of all, he lacks the charisma, the obligatory premise of Stifler. You really can't take care of him. The only reason I was concerned about his relationship was that Ashley could be on the screen! She shines above him, like the rest of the cast. Seriously, John White is an absolute actor of bad behavior and has the same charisma as a dead fish. <br /> <br /> To say that the film is really entertaining, and Kuzeman’s fear that his girlfriend is not really a girl is incredibly funny. <br /> <br /> By and large, this film is worth renting, inviting a few of your friends and laughing at the event of the gag festival and expressing your anger at Eric "loser" Stifler.
