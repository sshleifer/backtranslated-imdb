Based on the previews that I saw, I went to “Souls” in anticipation of a cute comedy; what I found was the deeply moving drama of family life, narrated in some of the most magnificent photographic images I have ever had the privilege of seeing. In addition, later reflections forced me to appreciate the abrupt transitions to scenes from the past (in the arid countryside of northern China and on the high plain of Tibet): does not memory often work? At some point I am here, at another - in the past, just like that .... <br /> <br /> I would not only strongly recommend this film, I would put it among the two or three best films that I seen in my 60 years. <br /> <br /> By the way, a couple of years ago another Asian comedy was released in the United States called “Will we dance?”. (Japanese). As in The Soul, the preview did not give the slightest indication of the depth of this film, which turned out to be a subtle psychological study (albeit chock full of funny moments). Are there any concerns from distributors that films seem too “important” or “deep” to attract US viewers?
