When I first heard that Hal Hartley was shooting a continuation of Henry the Fool, I was thrilled (it was a personal favorite for many years), and then I became alert when I learned that it was somehow related to terrorism. However, only when I saw him, I was surprised to find that it worked, although it was still a completely different film than Henry the Fool. Writing and directing were dead, and the acting was excellent ... special praise goes to Hartley for assembling almost the entire cast, right up to his son Henry, who was only four years old. As I said, this film is very different from the first one, but it works: I accepted the change in tone and the fact that 10 years had passed, and the characters would have been in completely different situations since the first film ended. In this case, an unexpected adventure comes ... and that's all I give ... not to mention the fact that I need to see it again to really understand what is happening, and who twice crosses to whom. Although it was certainly one of the best films I've ever seen, he tolerates, like many sequels, with its ending, as it seems that Hartley plans the third, and the film leaves you alone. I will definitely buy tickets for part 3 (“Henry Grimm”?) In 2017.
