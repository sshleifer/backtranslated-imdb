"SÃ¥ som i himmelen" ... both above and below ... this is a special moment where Deity and Man meet. I adore this movie! Precious stone YES, amazing grace! <br /> <br /> I was so deeply touched by its HUMAN quality. I laughed and cried through the whole register, really a few octaves of emotions. <br /> <br /> Michael Nicquis BRILLIANT, like Daniel, is a first-class passionate performance, charismatic and powerful. His inner light and exceptional talent shine through in every scene, in every interaction, in every meeting. I was completely hypnotized, fascinated and caught the story, which is our collective history, the story of life itself. <br /> <br /> The film had many archetypes, the Messiah, the wounded child, the magical child, the Artist, the teacher, the priest, the offender, the offended, the victim, the bully, the divine fool - ALL characters, such real and true lives, it awakened great love and compassion in me. <br /> <br /> This is a real joy - to see such a thought, provoking, but at the same time very pleasant, fascinating film. Oh .. do not forget the heavenly choir of angels and stunningly beautiful sound. <br /> <br /> THANKS TO ALL - this Swedish film will surely charm people all over the world. DIAMOND!
