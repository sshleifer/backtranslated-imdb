When the Good Times premiered in 1974, it was one of the first black family sitcoms. He focused on the poor Chicago Evans family and their struggle to make ends meet. Most of the early episodes were devoted to parents, James and Florida Evans, and their struggle for the family. John Amos and Esther Roll were the best part of the show. They were terrific actors and had great chemistry, like James and Florida Evans. They had three children: JJ, Thelma and Michael. JJ was a haunting skirt, but a well-meaning teenage son who made up for his lack with subtle artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive, bright girl who constantly exchanged insults with JJ. Michael was a child prodigy, well educated in social issues, and he was destined to become a lawyer. <br /> <br /> In 1976, the producers made a huge mistake by firing John Amos, literally killing his character. It really changed focus, and not for the better, I might add. The shows began to focus more on J.J. and his jester-like behavior, which angered black viewers, as well as the star of the show Esther Roll, who quit after the next season. Instead of a show dedicated to the key African-American problems that existed in society at the time, viewers got shows that were overwhelmed by the pursuit of skirts and fat jokes. <br /> <br /> As Esther Roll left, the quality of the show worried even more. Although it was still watchable, it was no longer the grand innovative show it once was. <br /> <br /> Although Esther Roll returned in the 1978 season, it became apparent that the show was on its last legs, All loose ends were tied during this season, and the show imperceptibly disappeared. <br /> <br /> First three seasons: A. Last three seasons: C +.
