JAMES STEWART plays an FBI agent who began working with the agency before it was named by the FBI, and the story includes intercourse with the Ku Klux Klan, gangsters of the prohibition era, German and Japanese World War II spies, etc. Continuously interesting picture, covering 40 years of history; far surpasses any films produced these days. <br /> <br /> Of particular interest to older viewers familiar with Washington. In a scene about 20 minutes after the film - where James Stewart learns from Vera Miles that she is expecting their first child - the scene was filmed at Herzog's Seafood Restaurant on the former Washington Quay, the only film in which this historic film location appears. Shortly after taking office, President Kennedy decided that Southwestern Washington, a 99% black district, was an eyesore and should be demolished. By decree befitting his position as the undisputed royal, the entire area, including the popular restaurant on the waterfront of the district, but with the exception of 3 historic churches; was turned into rubble. Blacks are evicted from their homes, relocated as best they can and without federal assistance; Similarly, enterprises simply ceased to exist, only a few have moved. Restaurant Row was turned into a sidewalk, and in Washington for about 10 years there was no waterfront (restaurants, seafood stalls, boats, etc.). Being a permanent resident, the scene of the Herzog restaurant was our # 1 reason to see this beautiful film again.
