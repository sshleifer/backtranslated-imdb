EUROPE (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come from the birth of the narrative film almost a century ago. This film is really unique and ingenious. The operation and editing are gorgeous, and when combined with the narrative paths of alienation used in the film, they create an eerie and unforgettable cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Participation in the shooting of the film by Barbara Suvkova and Eddie Konstantin Guilty pleasures that you should see and enjoy. Max Von Sydow provides his magnificent voice as a narrator. <br /> <br /> One of a kind movie! Four stars (top rating).
