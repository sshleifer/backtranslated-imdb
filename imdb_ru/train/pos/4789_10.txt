David Lynchâ€™s (1999) film about the story of John Roach / Mary Sweeney takes place in Iowa and Wisconsin long before its final release. <br /> <br /> We enter the life of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) late in life. His state of health is poor, his life is mostly over, and he knows it. <br /> <br /> This makes what he decides to do, even more wonderful and sweet. He decides (and in every point of the film his own name is reflected in his actions) to correct some things. <br /> <br /> By this time in his life, Alvin is a man of great experience, but modest means. His daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) is struggling with speech disorders that make communication a great effort on behalf of the audience. But it's worth it, because the story of Rose can not escape from the film. <br /> <br /> This film is a travel story. But, like all travel, it is a journey in a geographical and human sense. At the beginning of the film, we begin to realize that this is an ambitious journey that no elderly gentleman of the age of Alvin should reasonably take. <br /> <br /> But as we go along, we gradually learn how Alvin has so many qualifications that equip him to achieve his unlikely goal. His goal is very simple and clear. His brother is sick and may die, and he wants to visit him. He had quarrels with him many years ago, and they have not spoken for a very long time. <br /> <br /> Alvin meets many people along the way. Its essence is in how he behaves towards them, and about the benefits they get from meeting him. We learn who Alvin Straight is from what Alvin Straight does. And at the end of the film, we know who we are .. better.
