Loved this little movie. This is a touching film about the struggle, sacrifices and especially friendly ties between different nations (especially the children's actor who plays Miki is good). There are so many large-scale impersonal films around World War II that this convincingly told little story is a true deviation from the norm and at the same time original. I will also add that this film is far from boring, very far away !! Of course, the Horses are beautiful, and the scenery is breathtaking. For anyone who truly treats their animal as part of a family (I think), you will find this film especially useful. Recommended for movie lovers who are looking for something a little different.
