It is strange to feel alone in a theater occupied by parents and their noisy children. I felt that instead of a movie ticket I needed to get a NAMBLA membership. <br /> <br /> On the basis of the respected Thomas Rokvella Books "How to eat fried worms" begins, like any children's story: moving to a new city. A new child, fifth grader Billy Forrester, was once popular, but must start anew. Friendship is always difficult, especially when the only prospect is Poindexter Adam. Or Eric, who is 4 1/2 feet tall, is a giant. <br /> <br /> Jo-bully complicates even more. His freckled face and sleeveless shirts are frightening. He opposes children with the Ring of Death: the ring Crackerjack, which is rumored to kill you if you hit him. But not at once. No, the deadly ring releases poison that kills you in eight classes. <br /> <br /> Joe and his axis of evil greet Billy, bringing a handful of mucous worms to a thermos. Once discovered, Billy plays cool, swears he constantly eats worms. Then he throws them in Joe's face. Ewww! To defeat them, Billy reluctantly makes a bet that he can eat 10 worms. Fried, boiled, marinated in a spicy sauce, crushed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich. Each dish received an exotic name, such as “Radioactive enjoyment of mucus,” in which children finally realized their dream of how to cook a living organism in the microwave. <br /> <br /> If you have ever met me, you will find out that I have uncontrollably hearty laughter. I felt like the baby whines creep that he has a "stupid penis." But Fried Worms are amazingly disgusting. Like the Farrelli Brothers film, which received a G rating, it is both gag and adorable. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Bob Dolman is also an experienced storyteller. To raise the stakes, worms must be consumed by 7 pm. In addition, Billy has a dark secret: he has a hypersensitive stomach. <br /> <br /> Dolman also has a keen sense of perspective. With such precision, he relies on the insecurity of children and the tendency to exaggerate worldly dilemmas. <br /> <br /> If you had to exaggerate this film like children do, you will understand that this is a war. Freedom fighters and liberty haters use pubescent boys as pawns in proxy wars only to learn a valuable lesson in unity. International leaders can learn one or two things about global peacemaking from Fried Worms. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, I was pleased when the two mothers who accompanied me looked at each other in bewilderment and agreed, "It was a great movie." Great, now I don’t need to register with any legitimate databases.
