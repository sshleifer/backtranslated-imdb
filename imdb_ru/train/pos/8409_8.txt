A good movie that I watch several times. Rich (the previous commentator) is right: much more is happening here than is clear from the title pages, and I have to wonder how many have suffered in translation. Was it still in the original? Or was it expected that the audience in their native language would read lips? Or - since the script was written by the author of the novel on which it was based, - was this currently popular story with which the public was already well acquainted? In short, it is very worth seeing, but probably requires more work from modern viewers than the original audience in 1913. <br /> <br /> Alpha-video releases a new organ, but the music does not correspond to the course of history. Sure, it starts promisingly, but degenerates into repetitive monotony, like Philip Glass, which does not reflect anything on the screen. After listening for a while, I turned off the sound and just watched: much better!
