In the winter of 1931, the supposedly 12-year-old Tyler Hechlin (as Michael Sullivan Jr.) wondered what his gangster father Tom Hanks (Michael "Mike" Sullivan) earned his living. Young Hechlin follows Mr. Hanks to "work" one evening, and sees how he destroys several competing gangsters. This leads - VERY deviously - to Paul Newman's “godfather” (like John Rooney), who hired independent assassin Jude Law (like Harlen Maguire) to hunt down Hohlin and Hanks, who are going to cool their heels in Chicago, Hanks thinks they will be safe with a relative, which is puzzling when you consider the direction of the characters. <br /> <br /> Looks like Paul Peterson ("The Donna Reed Show"), Hoechlin does an amazing job for director Sam Mendes; and getting a job with this actor makes him the 2002 happiest young actor. But the most striking thing in “The Road to Death” is the amazing cinematography by Conrad L. Hall, who deservedly won an Oscar-winning career for the late photographer. Mr. Hall's work is really excellent. This helps to compensate for the overall impression of the weighted, far-fetched entertainment of both narration and visual effects. The end of the deviation sharply improves mood (an unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned entertainment). <br /> <br /> ******** The Road to Perdition (7/12/02) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks, Tyler Hoechlin, Paul Newman, Jude Law
