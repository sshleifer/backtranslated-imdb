A very interesting documentary about the Scottish painter Andy Goldsworthy, whose works mainly consist of ephemeral sculptures created from elements of nature. His works are made of stones, leaves, grass, ice, etc., which are blown away when the tide comes to the beach or the wind blows on the field. Thus, most of the Goldsworthy works really do not last long, except for photographs or films of what they were. Now it can be argued that the works of Goldsworthy are a reflection of mortality or words on this subject, but is not it easier to say that what he does is simply beautiful art. And while the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unbalanced people who live in a decrepit urban setting, Goldsworth seems the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family-oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in Scotland (of course, I am sure that these are the very same reasons why some people in the art world, who consider his works fluffy or superficial), avoid him.
