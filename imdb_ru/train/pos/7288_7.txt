This film is an absolute classic for the camp. That is why it was the Elvira and MST3000 classic. Everyone knows the story. The scientist keeps his girlfriend's head in a saucepan with lasagna in the basement while he travels around the city and tries to find her body by checking local chickens. Finally, he finds a real body in an hourglass with a chicken head in the scar at the top. The severed head made friends with the failed experiment in the cabinet, and the conical head comes out of the cabinet and tears off the remaining "good" hand of the assistant (his other is not right from the scientist's earlier failure), and the whole place burns down. <br /> <br /> The film so frightened us, like children, that my friend did not visit the basement for a year after watching it. As children, we rated the scariest films of all time, and this one was the fourth. Only one of these scary films was really something good (the original of "The Ghost"). <br /> <br /> I had to give this film seven ratings for the huge amount of entertainment value it offers. His eerie effect due to trashy production and a strange sexual angle when a scientist looks at the body (complete with porn audio track) shy away from innocent children, while the ridiculous aspects make him the main material for watching chatted and laughed. I could watch this movie tonight and enjoy it while I would rather go to the dentist than watch Chicago again. <br /> <br /> Seven - this is the best that I can give him, because its entertainment value - just good luck. A movie like a movie is a disaster.
