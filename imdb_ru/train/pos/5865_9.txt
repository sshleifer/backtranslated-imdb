I saw it by cable in the early 90s and I really liked it. Never saw it again until it appeared on the cable recently. I still find it a great movie about Vietnam. Not sure why its not higher rating. I found everything about this film persuasive. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam), I can relate to situations caused by both Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine that this film is more acute now with our situation in Iraq. I would like this to be offered by cable more often for people to see. The casualties of our soldiers do not remain on the battlefield. He was brought home for the rest of his life. And this film is one of many that brings him home very hard. A great movie.
