The best part of “American in Paris” is the long ballet sequence at the end, where Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the living embodiment of several major artists. Previously, Kelly was recognized by the artist on the sidewalk in Paris, so this sequence is the logical conclusion of a musical abounding in life and energy, Gershwin melodies and such actors as Georges Guberial and Oscar Levant. Here Kelly was at her best - she was a little different from Singing in the Rain, and the effect of the entire film as one of the ballets gives him a certain wow factor. Not surprisingly, the sequence ended “This is fun” after all the other MGM musical moments have passed!
