I can not understand why many IMDb users do not like this movie. Why do they think that it is sooooo bad, etc. It’s not worse than anything else out there. Personally, I think “Soldier” is a great movie, much better than most other films of the same genre. <br /> <br /> Reasons I liked The Soldier: Kurt Russell, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, script (David Webb Peoples), great visuals and direction (Paul Anderson). <br /> <br /> I even think that this is the best work I have seen from director Paul Anderson, who previously directed the entertaining Mortal Kombat and the not very spectacular Event Horizon.
