Now here's a movie straight from my childhood, my family used to tape; but it seems to be turned upside down and lost over the years. Now I was lucky to watch the whole movie on youtube.com; I really liked this wonderful movie when I watched it as a child, and after watching it again (online) I still watch it today My favorite song from the movie "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (I'll always remember this sweet song). <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits (about who revived whom) that some of the animators date back to the 1930s (WOW! it's like 47 years old).
