There has never been anything like this for sure. This episodic, seemingly unnecessary trilogy really only makes sense as a whole, and, as such, this is not a film about Groovin 'Gary, Utah, dressing up in a sensation. This is a very shy movie about how the director REACT on Groovin 'Gary. For Harris, the whole project is clearly an extended and impressive twist of guilt and repentance. He is trying to atone for his sins - yes, Gary tried to commit suicide after the initial document went on air - correcting, commenting and agreeing, returning such Hollywood narrative heroes as the best friend and causing a happy ending (two different impressive adjustments in Gloverâ€™s version) in their personal needs. Thus, although thematically it remains a film about sex and differences, the structure ensures that it is also a film about FILMS, but at a virtually unprecedented level of complexity. So much is happening; telling and telling this story, Harris is in the right place three times in a row at the right time, and he does not miss the opportunity to make something of this. Immensely touching and as deep as possible in the camp.
