I could not agree with the quote “this is one of the best films ever made”. If you think that Vanilla Sky is just a “remake”, you can’t go wrong. This film has tremendous depth: visually, musically and emotionally. <br /> <br /> Visually, because the film is soft and gentle sometimes (early scenes with Sophia), and sometimes powerful and intense (Times Square), post-climate scenes. <br /> <br /> The music and sounds fit so well in this movie. Without music, the story is only half told. Nancy Wilson created an emotional but eclectic score for the film, which could not have been more suitable for such a fabulous theme (although it was never released, I was able to get my hands on an original score for about $ 60. If you look closely you can find copy yourself). Crow's other musical works, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, Monkees, etc., are also perfect for the movie (Crow has a rumor for great music) . <br /> <br /> More importantly, the emotional themes in this film (for example, love, sadness, regret) are very strong and are ten times intensified by visual and musical experience, as well as brilliant dialogue; I admit that the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes again and again. <br /> <br /> However, the best part of this film (as if it could be better) is that it’s so thought out that everyone When you watch a movie, you’ll understand something new - so watch carefully and get ready to think! Of course, the topic becomes obvious after the first or second hours, but there is always more in history than you think. <br /> <br /> This is easily the best work of Cameron Crowe, and overall work is brilliance. Most of my filmmaking and musical inspiration comes only from this work. It honestly touched my life, since real art tends to do. I am constantly surprised that there are many people who cannot appreciate this film for what it is (I think that real art is art itself). <br /> <br /> Outcome: Vanilla Sky is in the league of its own.
