To watch this film from beginning to end, without bursting out laughing, at some point it takes almost an act of faith, because you have to constantly repeat to yourself: “he is old,” “it's a classic,” “be kind,” and not because so bad, but because at best it is so good. This is one of the outdated films. It is also a classic, albeit stained. In principle, I am not inclined to laugh at people, and this annoys me more than ever. In my opinion, to laugh at Informer is the same as giggling at an idiotic scientist when he is dripping orange juice all over the tablecloth. Yes, someone tells himself that he is an idiot, and yet, when he is at the top of his game, he is also a real scientist. The same applies to Informer, which is sometimes very terrible, but at the same time it boasts a magnificent photo, a beautiful game, a wonderful score and a good, decent simple story. In the end, what I don’t give up, politics, religion and psychology unite in the church in such a way that the scene seems banal and excessive, but sometimes it happens in life. Uneducated people with simple faith do not behave like we (apparently, brilliantly), modern people, and the scene is not so unbelievable (I buy it, but I know the Irish) than it bothers. And yet people behave like this, they say such things. Not all hips, and this may be undesirable for everyone. Are people today far superior to people seventy or eighty years old? And how? I do not think so. We are just different. Now go watch the movie.
