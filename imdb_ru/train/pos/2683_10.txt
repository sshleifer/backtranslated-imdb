Franco once again proves that he is the prince of surrealistic and erotic cinema. True, most of his work can be seen as an entertaining scumbag, but with Succubus (Necronomicon) he shows what he is really capable of when he gives free rein to his distorted work and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and mysterious retaining nonsense eroticism peculiar to his work. Jerry Van Royen's magnificent score pulses when the viewer is thrown from one strange scenario to another, when we follow the striptease artist (Rayno), who may be schizophrenic or really (as one mysterious character claims) to be the devil, in which she lives. The beautiful and mysterious part of the cinema is highly recommended to anyone interested in alternative cinema.
