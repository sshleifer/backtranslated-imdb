It was a really cool movie. It just proves that you donâ€™t need stupid little things to make a movie, such as continuity and scenarios. He crosses the continents in a matter of seconds, people are shot, and nothing happens to them, swords are set on fire, the struggle of samouri on sinking galleons, David Essex is the embodiment of meanness of mucus, and John Rhys Davies is just a guy. I liked this movie, but I like S ** T movies, this is a perfect example of a very bad movie that is just KICKS ASS. If you like Battlefield Earth, you will like this movie, its crazy, fast, stupid, samuraitastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It also looks like it was made in 1972
