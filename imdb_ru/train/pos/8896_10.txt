Can anyone help find out the name and artist of the song played at least halfway through the movie. I can't remember which scene was played. The words in the song have a ballad. Some texts are: “This is a natural way of telling you something is wrong.” This is the natural way to express it in a song. "" This is the natural way to forgive you. Please help me with this question. Thank you very much! I searched the Internet for several days, I can not get this song out of my mind. So now it will cause me to find someone who could help me in this matter. I would like to draw attention to the scene when she played.
