This is a great movie with a star cast and great acting. I never get tired of looking at it. I especially like the scene in which Danny Glover's character and Kevin Klein's character, namely Simon and Mack, conduct a brunch together. Kevin Kline is so natural, and it seems that his manners are easy, and you often come across him. So this is a very “real” movie. <br /> <br /> One of the strongest scenes in the film, however, occurs at the beginning of the film, when Simon arrives on the scene where Makka's car broke down. The film also has a strong message and is different from a stereotypical film that tells about a person where one person preaches his inner audience. Instead, the emotions and situations of the actors convey a spectacular message that is best suited without the use of words. And finally, Mary McDonell is gorgeous, as always.
