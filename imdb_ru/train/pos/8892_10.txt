Great, great, great! That's all I can say about this movie, but IMDB wants at least four lines of text, so Iâ€™ll clarify. The cast was great (Jerry O'Connell is very cute!), The music was great (the sixties gave the best music ever, imho), the historical material was interesting, as the actors of the 90s seemed to be in the 60s. And most of all - the history of the main characters caused tears in his eyes, and this is the greatness of any drama. BUT IN ONE WORD: GREAT!
