A few years have passed since I saw it, but remember this and would like to see it again. This is a kind of “therapy” for me with my personal experience. <br /> <br /> A thirty-five-year-old man mourns a game in high school, in which he “missed the ball” and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, “if I just hit the ball” and how his life would be better because of it. Then he gets the opportunity to learn .... and gets a little more than he expected. <br /> <br /> This reminds me so much when I was in high school, I tried a training / dance team for our team twice and didn't do it. This team was the closest to the woman in my school. If you were on it, you were "all that." I have not tried HS until the last two years, and after the second time, I took it very hard. I hit my leg hard and hurt my leg shortly before the test and put on my pantyhose to cover the bruise, and this made me not to do it. That was in 1987. <br /> <br /> For years, even now, sometimes I think: “If I hadn’t hit my leg, I would never have worn these silly tights.” Now I don’t sit and think that my life would be better or even different if I did it, but when I saw this film, I realized that we would never know how different the changes could be by changing one little thing the past, Who knows, this could change the course of events to such an extent that I would not have met the father of my son. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who has this moment in the past that they want to change. Be careful with desires !!!
