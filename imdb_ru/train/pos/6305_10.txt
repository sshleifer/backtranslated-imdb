Welcome to Collinwood - one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. Excellent cast, tough editing and great direction. Film-capers, which is not stuck in the standard tricks. <br /> <br /> You can say so little about this movie without spoiling it. The syllable says everything - 5 guys. 1 safe. No brains. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Sam Rockwell lead a terrific cast. George Clooney should be congratulated on receiving this gem. <br /> <br />
