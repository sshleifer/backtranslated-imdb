So what is a true independent movie? Nowadays, when the latest hobby of mainstream Hollywood should seem stormy and cutting-edge, I am sorry to say that what the general public is inclined to perceive as an independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing trick. <Br /> <br /> That is why we should be glad that such films as “Hate the Minute” exist. In all aspects, this film contradicts its own template (indie horror film). Love it or hate it, “Hate” is not afraid to be what it is, and when you watch this movie you get the real feeling that Kallio (the director) didn’t just make this movie to splash fake blood around the world. place, he is in it to tell stories. Good ones. You can find this movie in the horror movie section of your video store, but don't be fooled, this story is also about love, about the kind people who are pushed over the edge, and what about the distant light at the end of the Tunnel. <br /> <br /> If you are expecting a crappy or fiery death, stay away from this movie. But if you understand the subtleties of horror / suspense genres, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell really produced this film, and I am sure that he will proudly tell everyone that this is not The Evil Dead. Bruce never tried to rely on his “ashen” image, and it is obvious that he did not associate with “Hate”, so this could also be. <br /> <br /> However, my advice to all the Dead, recklessly devouring anything released by Mr. Campbell, is to check this film anyway and see what else Mr. Kallio and Mr. Campbell are trying to show you. <br /> <br /> The game is well done, although nothing in this film is Oscar caliber (perhaps intentionally), it is nice to see compassionate performances in a horror film. So often the actors in such films do not even seem to try, with “Hate”, it seems that all the actors take their characters very seriously, never resorting to the typical horror style. <br /> <br /> Technically, “Hate” is about as competent as an indie film. Editing is fast, cinematography is good, given the budget, and “Hate” is moving at a fast pace, without any problems or bad anti-climaxes. <br /> <br /> In general, Hatred may not be. I have a gloomy look at all these multi-million dollar fake indies, but personally I don’t see any problem with that. This is a film of people who really care about the environment. People who climbed into them, broke their pockets in the ass, pulled out their nicknames and dimes, threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
