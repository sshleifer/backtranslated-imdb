I can only repeat the praise of other reviews here. This is a delightful film with a feeling of good mood, which he reaches without stepping over the line of sentimentality. Naturally sweet - no added sugar. <br /> <br /> One small moment: it seems to me that the small objections expressed that the character Ustinov Pendelton can enter and defeat the security system ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius / scientist in such things. Yes, the film was quite computer illiterate, but he showed that Pendelton was “studying computers” in his apartment, and I suppose that it was understood that his gifts allowed him to simply cover the entire subject overnight. <br /> <br /> In some scenes there were some strange moments when Gnatpol tried to test Pendelton’s knowledge and call him a bluff. I’m not sure whether we should believe that Pendelton had slyly dodged a way out of these situations, or whether he was knowledgeable enough to pass the tests — it was a bit unclear. <br /> <br /> Of course, he had to know enough to set up bogus accounts. Presumably, Wallach and Ustinov relied on their own rather vague idea of ​​how computers worked in those days, and in order to understand in detail what they are striving for, it is necessary to know what their concept was. They knew that there was something important in the “procedures”; they thought that “smart light” could actually control security, and not just indicate its condition; they thought that the functions of the (blunt) user terminal would greatly affect what could be done on the mainframe itself - although other than such things as graphics functions, I don’t see it myself. <br /> <br /> Basically, I think they tried to avoid the subject of real computer operations as much as possible, and they did it quite well. By giving them a small artistic license, I do not think that their efforts had any shortcomings worthy of attention. <br /> <br /> CD
