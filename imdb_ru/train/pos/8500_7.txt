Surprised to see a rather low score for this movie. Just watched this movie for the first time in 10 years, and I was reminded why I like it. <br /> <br /> Come back with me, children, at a time when Michael Keaton was a comedian, and you can find some joy in this film. This is a tender comedy - the one Ron Howard specializes in - but if it's your thing, you should check it out. Kiton's modest charm is just right for this project. <br /> <br /> “Goong Ho” is somewhat outdated because it takes place at the last stage of the pre-global economic world, when it is still important that the Country in which the business was based. Nevertheless, it brings laughter, as well as a lesson about how people can learn from each other, with benefit. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and enjoy it without remembering any of them. You especially liked the scene, but this is because the whole movie gives a slow but steady stream of laughter. It's like an IV drip. And I mean it in a good way.
