This movie is incredible. With great characters, especially with an old swordsman who can fly in the shape of a fireball and jump on trees, this film tells the classic story of the battle between the good and the forces of evil. The final bout is especially breathtaking. The music is very cool. <br /> <br /> Very, highly recommended. Not for the youngest children. This one deserves 10.
