I remember that the Legend of Zu trailer was pretty impressive, and being a fan of A Man Called Hero (my all-time favorite) Storm Riders, I decided that I should watch this movie. I know that there is a lot of criticism regarding the acting skills of Ekin Chen, but he is my favorite Hong Kong movie star (nevertheless, much better than Nicholas Tse), and he is one of the factors that I liked about this film. Without a doubt, this film is a work of art from beginning to end. I even thought that only the actors were real, and everything else was computer-generated by the end of this movie. They must have invested a lot of work in this one, and they deserve good merit for it. The storyline of the film was a fairy tale between good and evil with an added love story (I think Ekin Cheng easily pulls girls). The story is not very intellectual and deep, but this is not what you expect when watching an action movie. I wanted more martial arts with fists and fists instead of battles with magic abilities, but this is life, and it never goes the way you want it. And why did they sound like supersonic airplanes in a battle through the sky at the end? This is too funny. The legend of Tsu cannot be a hero, who is called a person, in my eyes, but he flows like a video game, and this is not bad at all. If the company decides to publish games on this film, I would not be surprised, as it contains all the elements of video games. Good job. Please make more fantastic films like this
