This is one of those films that made me feel the need to make films in general. Generally speaking, I am a fan of films based on worthy real-life stories. And this BIG! In addition to the work of Meryl, which received great recognition and praise, the biggest advantage of the film is the story on which it is based. The fascinating story of a couple who is subjected to social and legal torture after suffering enormous emotional pain as a result of the unexpected and cruel death of their young child is indeed a frank fable that exposes the inhuman side of the brethren and reveals a very sophisticated and legitimate society barbarity. It is interesting to see how people who consider themselves good and intelligent people (for example, the emotional jury ladies in a film) are in fact nothing more than selfish deceivers who, due to their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices, shut their brains for any thoughts and contemplation even in the light of all the facts, very clearly indicating their opinion. Another face of the so-called "civilized" society that shows the film is apathy to the pain of other people (needless to say, this is very general in nature, even if this particular story unfolds in Australia), which goes as far as becoming real cruelty. We need to see if you are ready to accept something serious and, perhaps, thought-provoking.
