Without any conditions, Carlos Mencia makes him stand, which makes us both laugh and think. He not only makes fun of racial problems (as many haters claim), but also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country ... what women mean when they say they want to be treated the same ... why Americans are crazy than the Arab terrorists ... why no one needs to pray for the Pope - and what he hopes he does in heaven ... a theory about how the traditions of Easter originated (or "The Great Ascent to the Day of Jesus") ... view the film “The Passion of the Christ” and its subsequent argument with a woman about Will Jesus be affected by Jesus ... how society should treat people with disabilities ... and even if you have the right to tell a joke or not. <br /> <br /> In addition, he never ceases to remind us that each of us has a voice. Therefore, we must use this to tell the truth, say what we think, and not be afraid if others are offended. <br /> <br /> Carlos is a bomb.
