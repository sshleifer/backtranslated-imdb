Spoiler This film is about this concept. Williams will go to any minimum to play a football game that haunts his life. Russell plays a former athlete who peaked in high school. Finally, a shot is made under the dog, and Williams can save the face, instead of being a clown. Great reverse tragedy. 7/10
