I really liked this movie. All aspects of the film were top notch, including the most important for me, in any case, the script and actions. This is definitely one of Richard Widmarkâ€™s strongest roles. He is absolutely convincing in his performance. Just out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum could cope with this role. This is my first acquaintance with the works of Jean Peter, which I remember. She made such a strong impression on me that I would definitely look for her other job. Thelma Ritter, in an unofficial role, earned an Oscar nomination for the role of informer. This film works at every level. Black and white photography is perfect, and the plot fascinates the viewer from the very beginning. Widmark and Peters have excellent chemistry in their complicated romance. Highly recommended, 9/10.
