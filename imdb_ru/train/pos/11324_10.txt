I have to agree with everyone else who posted. <br /> <br /> I watched it for a long time, but I will tell you, whenever I hear certain music from this anime, I am reminded of the story, the wonderful animation, the characters and the feeling that I experience when watching, and this makes me cry (such a happy but sad feeling). However, I find that the love story in her looked a bit hastily, and they did not explain things properly, but this did not destroy any part of the viewing experience. <br /> <br /> I was so fascinated by this anime that after graduation I just needed to do some research (and see the final several more times), and I found all my answers and much more. I like the way they set up historical legends to fit into this anime, it was amazing and just made me want to explore a lot more (I was always very interested in some of the historical figures associated with this anime) <br /> <I really think that it should have been a longer series, but if this was all they had to work with, they did a great job. I would recommend this to anyone who loves emotional anime with a great story, well-built characters (some mysterious ones) and some fantastic actions. <br /> <br /> Also, despite the fact that it was based on the H-game, there is nothing of the kind in it, and I really prefer it this way (I have no problems with mature anime, in most cases I prefer this)
