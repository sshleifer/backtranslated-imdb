Piala shoots people in extreme emotional situations, usually with a few cruel scenes. In La Gueule ouverte, he deals with devastating consequences for a womanâ€™s husband and son when she dies of cancer. Overnight, the teenage girl's sexual experiments lead to violent clashes with her family. Here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to have sex with a former prisoner. Her motivation is a bit muddy, since Lulu is not able to read or discuss anything more complicated than television shows; on the other hand, he has an incredible body (I wonder why Depardieu never made a sports film to boast of this physique - he would be great as a rugby player). <br /> <br /> Casting is impressive, Isabel Huppert has no right to show a sluggish, inexpressive performance (she gave a lot); Depardieu plays in Lulu with all the dynamism and charm that you can imagine - look at the scene at the bar, where he is hit in the gut, he runs away and looks for a cure, and then starts again with Nelli. The guy Marchand, with these coal-black eyes and an upset look, plays Nellie's husband beautifully; This is a good repetition of the connection in Coup de Foudre.
