What would happen when a depressed cop works on probation? Maybe a lot of fun ... This film has become a benchmark in the genre of action / comedy of Argentine cinema. Delightful characters, probable history and pace, which between laughter has some thrills. I recommended this for a pleasant stay. Peretti and Luka unite their efforts to fight the cold and defiant adversary at a time when it is difficult to trust someone. This film will surprise you, the other side of the "Analyze me" medal, but does not look like it, I do not envy anything. And if you like to know Bs.AS where there are several scenes of the city and the city center.
