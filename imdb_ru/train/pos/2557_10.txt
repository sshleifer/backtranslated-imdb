I myself am a child at heart, that is, I like to watch cartoons, I still love! I remember watching Bugs Bunny when I was a kid, he was my favorite so far. I thought, dude, it was a great “new” show on TV, and than my dad said, "Bugs Bunny, I remember watching him when I was younger," and I like "Dad, there were no bugs when you were younger. " So I think he is definitely pleased with more than one generation, maybe 3. I like the show, it’s great for kids and adults, well, everything. This is very funny, me and my husband, both at the age of 20, love to watch the show, and we are not against repeated shows. This show brings back a lot of memories, happy. I also love the New Year special with Tweety like Tiny Tim, that's cute. I can't choose my favorite character from Looney Toons, because he has changed over the years. When I was little, they were, of course, Bugs and Porky Pig. Pepe is cool, I always loved him. In fact, I must say that all my favorites. I give this show 10 out of 10, because this is a great show for all ages, very funny, the voice is incredible, the only drawback is that, unfortunately, it ended 2 decades ago, but repetitions are wonderful!
