Like most people, I saw Jason Priestley on TV, and I think he's great. But I did not know that he has a sister! Justin Priestley is simply "ma" velveteen, like a despised other woman. Good music, intrigue and death scene, in which Amanda has revenged on an abusive doctor who will stay with you for several weeks. I'll leave it at that. Kudos.
