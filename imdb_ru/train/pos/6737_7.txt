The director and two stars LAURA (1944) were renamed for this tough cop: Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a policeman to break all ties with the past, but cannot control his inherited violent actions, interrogating suspects and, one night, he comes too long away; Gene Tierney is the alienated wife of his victim, adorned with a war hero who became associated with the city’s leading racketeer and Andrews No. 1 sworn enemy, Gary Merrill (who himself was Andrews Jr.’s protégé)! As usual with Preminger, this is a well thought out film with a noticeable sequence of opening credits and animated by a good cast that also includes Carl Malden (as Andrews acting boss), Tom Tully (as taxi driver Tierney) Neville Brand Merrill’s main thug, with considerable support from Craig Stevens (as the mucous victim of beating his wife), Bert Fried (as Andrews’s sympathetic partner) and Robert F. Nolan (as Andrews’s stern coming) After the latter was already warned the last one to correct his actions, Andrews panics and impersonates Stevens within a few hours of his murder, in order to force the police (in this case) to erroneously track Merrill; however, after Talley becomes the main suspect (by then Andrews and Tierney enter into a romantic relationship), the policeman himself goes to Merrill's lair, fully intending to be exposed and to "expose" the racketeer for his own murder! Obviously, the main character is a complex character, and Andrews accepts the challenge with a first-class characterization, which is usually complemented by the internal style of Fox noir.
