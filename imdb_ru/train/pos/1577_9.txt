SHOWERS INSIDE. <br /> <br /> Von Trott seemed a lot easier with the balance of personal history and the history of events than in her earlier film Versprechen, Das (1995). /> <br /> The direction seemed to be carefully controlled, and visually I felt that it was very attractive - especially when it came to visual narration (a combination of a sequence of headings and the lighting of a new candle in the modern era, marking the death of various characters). in the past). <br /> <br /> To clarify two points that many people were confused about: <br /> <br /> First, Lena did not sleep with Goebbels. Although this might have seemed implied, it was not intention. Von Trotta herself told me about it! (And, by the way, she is a very nice lady!) Secondly, the timing of the events was actually historically accurate (actual dates are shown on a close-up of the memorial) and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in film. There is evidence that Goebbels was annoyed at what he did, and he planned to eventually return those he freed. <br /> <br /> In general, what impressed me most was that it was an original story from an era of overwork. It seems a shame that this film has spent so much time (for various reasons) on our screens. <br /> <br /> For more, please, Margaret!
