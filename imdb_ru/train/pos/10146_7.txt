As we all know, romantic comedy is a genre with an already famous ending. Two wires should always come together. At the end of the third act, I tried to understand how it would all end and how they would end up together. A hint was given from the very beginning, but you will never understand it to the end. It's a simple hook, but it works. It was supposed to be that you cover most of the ordinary land, but, when possible, make a new turn. I liked all the New York characters, and I liked the locations. This is a postcard from New York. It was also a pleasure to watch the movie and not find anything offensive in it. So, if you like a good old romantic fashion film ... then this is for you.
