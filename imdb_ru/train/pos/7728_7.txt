JIST: look something else. <br /> <br /> Gene Siskel highly appreciated this film, but after watching it, I canâ€™t understand why. The film is definitely original and different. From time to time there is even an interesting dialogue, some cool moments, and an eerie feeling of "noir." But it's just not interesting. It also does not make much sense in the plot, but especially in the motivation of the characters. I don't know anyone who behaves like these characters. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult film, and I suggest you not accept the challenge.
