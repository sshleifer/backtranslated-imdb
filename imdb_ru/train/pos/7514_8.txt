She is not Michael Jordan. <br /> <br /> Think about all the great players in the NBA, whose career growth was not extinguished for no other valid reason than the time of their birth. Their names can get off the public as easily as Russell, Kuzi, Bird, Magic, McHale, Oscar, Wilt, the list goes on; but the volume has gone down a bit, for Stockton and Malone, Charles, Patrick and all the other great players who have always lost headlines for Michael. <br /> <br /> I saw how it was written that Gretchen Maul’s career broke out after an article in a 1998 issue of Vanity Fair magazine that predicted the inevitable superstar for Miss Maul. It was later said that she was too bloated. I disagree. <br /> <br /> I still remember that some time after I saw Devil's Advocate in 97 or 98, I could not understand which actress Mary Ann Lomax played. Like or Teron? Oh yeah! Charlize Theron was one of “2 Days in the Valley” and “Mighty Joe Young,” and Gretchen Mol was in Donnie Brasco, Celebrities and Riders. <br /> <br /> By the time I saw Thirteenth Floor (Mol) and Sweet November (Teron), I pretty much straightened them, but I still put them in the same box for thoughts. Both were very talented, they had cute faces, similar body types, short blonde hair, etc. <br /> <br /> However, Teron was offered more work. I loved her as Sarah Deever and Adele Invergordon, her beauty was absolutely frightening. <br /> <br /> In 2003, Monster came out, and since the Oscar itself was presented, the whole cinema knew who it was. ” The award "Best Actress" was going to. And deservedly so! Theron was Eileen Warnos. The only way to get a more accurate picture of what made the real Eileen Warnos out ticking is to somehow play the digital video locked in Selby's head. And for a major talent, make yourself physically unattractive! Unheard of! <br /> <br /> Then, in 2005, the “Notorious Betty Page” was released. They say the performance was extraordinary. Maybe she was standing in the shadow of Miss Theron. It was like a ballroom to celebrate the victory of the loser presidential candidate, no one came and did not care. It was regarded as a continuation of the old tale, once a promising actress with a falling career played the role of a naked actress in the movie "B". Ho hum! No no no! Wrong! Whatever you think of the movie (and I like movies about the fifties), if you miss this movie, you will miss one of the best performances of that year. Miss Mall was the same Betty, like Miss Theron Eileen. Unfortunately, Eileen to the public is a more responsive character. For some reason, the amoral, sociopathic murderer is less embarrassed by us than the naive, inexperienced, relaxed, religious girl, whose most serious crime was living his life, fully trusting and completely exposing. Betty Page was one of the icons of the fifties. Her photos and movies are never sexy, never pornographic, but she is presented as almost a caricature of all things kinky. There was no sense of realism, only a parody. Miss Mall caught the very essence of the character. She gained 20 pounds to add a little zaftig to her usually slim figure, and when she was shot for different photographers in the film, her body was Betty. Her complete frontal lack of any restrictions exactly fits everything that was published about Betty. Movie nude usually depicts eroticism or sexuality. This movie is all about innocence. Watching nude Gretchen / Betty did not make me want to jump on her, but inspired a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can cause each other. If you miss this film, you will miss one of the best performances of recent years. By the way, the shame of the MPAA is to give this rating to R.
