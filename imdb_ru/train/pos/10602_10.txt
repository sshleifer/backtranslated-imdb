I have to say that I really liked the movie. These were funny moments, some touching parts, just everything is good around. I personally liked the movie very much, because this is something that I can finally relate to my childhood. This film, in my opinion, is more focused on young gays. This shows how a young gay boy would be treated as he grew up. All mockery, calling names and ignorance is what I, like most other young female boys, will always remember, and now, finally, a film that shows how difficult it really is for gays to grow. Therefore, I would definitely recommend watching this movie. You probably shouldn't watch this until the person is old enough and mature enough to understand it.
