I watched this movie in the first morning when I should have slept. In itself, this was evidence that the Liberation was an exciting movie. I think Burman did a great job directing this movie. How adept was the early scene with hilly people and dueling banjo. He showed very well at an early stage how restrained and simple the people of this area were. A case in point is that towards the end of the “duel” the boy playing the banjo was smiling (he loved his banjo), but when Drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the “duel”, the child was too restrained to respond. A trip along the river will never leave you bored, for sure. The rape scene was brutal, but it was necessary to show what the group faced in this remote area of ​​Georgia. I think that Beatty's traumatic shock was subsequently well made. Some said that he was not hurt by this test. I do not agree - if you really noticed, he did not respond to all subsequent actions, during which Reynolds sent an arrow to the attacker, and they drove off the toothless guy. It was confusing when Ed killed the other guy later, on the top of a cliff. Looks like the arrow was released when Ed curled up and waited for death, but then you realize that the arrow that he released earlier finally took effect. <br /> <br /> In any case, an excellent film, and I hesitated between 8 and 9 in my vote, but after reading the message of a disgruntled voter who gave him a “1”, I gave him a “10”. This man’s reasoning seemed to be based on personal bias, not on an objective point of view, and his voice was clearly an uncorrelated attempt to lower the rating.
