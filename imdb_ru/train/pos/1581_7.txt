Goebbels' motivation in the retreat was not investigated. After Stalingrad, the Reich decided to go to an "all-out war." This is mentioned in the film. This was partly in the use of women in military operations, which Germany had not previously done to a great extent. The slaughter of women in the SS would have threatened Goebbels with an enormous mass of public disaster. He preferred the problem to disappear as quietly as possible, assuming that Jewish men can always be collected later. I understand that most survived the war. <br /> <br /> Another of his problems was that the "red" Berlin was never enthusiastically removed from the Nazi struggle, and he had to be handled with care. Again, the massacres of women could have cost the Nazis what mediocre level of support they had in their capital. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, most SS uniforms had patches indicating that the men were not of German nationality, but were of German origin in other countries, such as Lithuania or Latvia
