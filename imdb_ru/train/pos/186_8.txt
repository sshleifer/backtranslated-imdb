There are some great things about this movie. Marion Davis could act, given the ownership; she is wonderful in comedic roles. William Haynes could act, and you can understand why he was one of the most popular leading people on the screen. (While a potential scandal has not forced him to leave the business). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit banal, but it is processed so beautifully that you will not notice. The direction of King Widor is one of the main reasons for this. Manufacturer? The genius of a boy, Irving Talberg. <br /> <br /> This is about making films, and you will see the process, as was done in 1928, cameras, scenery, directors and actors playing in public. You can see (briefly) some of the main stars of the day; even Charlie Chaplin makes a turn, as he does, in search of an autograph. You also catch a glimpse of Eleanor Boardman, Eleanor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Widor and many others that are otherwise just names and old photos. <br /> <br /> Please, even if you are not a fan of silence Take the time to catch this movie whenever you can. This is really an amazing journey into the past.
