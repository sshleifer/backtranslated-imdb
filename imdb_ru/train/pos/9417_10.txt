The modest, thin and meager film “The Man in the White Suit” is another breath of fresh air in cinematic format from the studio Ealing. Although I suspect that some modern viewers may initially find this unclear, I doubt that many will not be able to enchant with an expert way the plot, themes and characters sluggishly broadcast during the course of the film. <br /> <br /> Truly the great Alec Guinness gives yet another excellent feature in the film, perhaps not as explicitly as a virtuoso as the 1949 year-inspired Good Hearts and Corones. This time he plays only one character, not eight, but if not a secular inventor and scientist Sidney Stratton, he finds the right tone and expression. Along with the fine, expressive work of Guinness, the rest of the actors are effective. Of the main players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Teziger stand out. Teziger is absolutely absurd as a crippled, but powerful business grandeur, while Parker is credible as an ineffective but key owner and father of the mill. The father, that is, Joan Greenwood, is a deftly delectable comic actress who is on her irresistible top in this film. Gorgeous and seductive in aspect and diction, she is rather sublime in this film, in perfect contrast with the same unusual, but more unsightly Guinness. The scene in which she seemingly tries to seduce him is played by the pair so skillfully that she is both shrill and funny ... <br /> <br /> Themes are handled very efficiently, without any easy morality. The complexities of the relationship between science, business and labor are studied with insight and pleasure. This film, artfully crafted by Alexander Mackendrick, is adept in all fields; evocative photography, suitable sound effects and music and a thoughtful script, all quietly impressive. Fully hearty movie with great Guinness and Greenwood. <br /> <br /> Rating: - **** 1/2 / *****
