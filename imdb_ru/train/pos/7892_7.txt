In this sixth edition of the Nightmare series, Freddie went from terrible to ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 2 years have passed, and in fact 11 years since this film was shot in 2001. The street, with the exception of one, John Doe (Jacobb from Part 5, even the dow film gives a hint of who he is), which he uses to bring more children to come to Elm Street. his daughter returns to Elm Street. When she finds out what is happening, she and other children decide to kill FREDDY once and for all. We will also see some scary FREDDY roots. <br /> <br /> Rachel Talalay, who has long been seen in nightmare movies. Many people hate this film, but I liked it. He tried to show what FREDDY does with his wise jokes ... COMDY and makes the show more fun than scary. . So this movie really hurts for comedy. This is not the worst thing in the series, part 2 still holds it. <br /> <br />
