This game is very addictive, I continued to play it for hours until late at night, but this was facilitated by the fact that you cannot save the game while in space, sometimes I just needed to play in order not to lose all the game data. <br /> <br /> Yes, the "freelancer" is addictive, but also with disabilities. Also, for example, I was very worried that you could not miss any of the cut scenes, as a result of which from time to time you had to watch the same small cut scene again and again. For me, this is a great opportunity to check my email or chat with friends and things like that, while I had to wait for the end of the set. <br /> <br /> The story begins promisingly, but the further you get, the funnier it becomes. In addition, the game also ends rather abruptly, at least for me. It is clear that they are hinting at the upcoming sequel. I don’t know if the sequel is being prepared at the moment, but I’m sure that I’m likely to pick it up as soon as it comes out. <br /> <br /> The gameplay is very simple! Even for those who are not familiar with flight games. Simply put, every fool can play this game. Yes, some levels are quite complex and require a lot of effort. It took me about 1-2 weeks to finish this game, which may be too short. But thank God for the multiplayer version! It allows you to continue playing short missions, just like in a single player, as soon as you complete it. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that many missions are the same, just staying in the Middle circle is sometimes a massive aerial battle. <br /> <br /> The graphics are good, but not revolutionary or something like that. <br /> <br /> An addictive game, but beware of its flaws. <br /> <br /> 7/10
