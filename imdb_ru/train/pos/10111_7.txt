The Haunted House by Edward D. Wood Jr. is not a particularly good documentary. Aesthetically, he looks dull and cheap, the people in him go crazy, which makes him very unfocused and cohesive, but it adds charm to him. I say this because it is a documentary about an eccentric who filmed eccentric pictures and surrounded himself with alien monsters, and as such, there is no other way to document the life and career of a man and his team of losers. There are some glimpses of the understanding of both the genius and the ineptitude of Wood, and the depiction of both qualities is a merit of the authenticity of the documentary. In general, you should look at Wood fans and film fans in general, but here you shouldnâ€™t expect brilliance. Expect a documentary made after Wood's own heart.
