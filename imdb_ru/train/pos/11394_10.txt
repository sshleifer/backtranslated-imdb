While the story is sweet, and dancing and singing in the main part of the film is the joy, the uniqueness of the film (and what makes it a masterpiece) is the dream sequence. It combines the highest form of genuinely American music (Gershwin), the attractive beauty of French impressionist art, the exciting choreography of Kelly (including his delightful pas de deux d'amour, a truly separate genre) with the most magnificent genre. The color palette ever created for the set. The juxtaposition of turbulent music and a visual explosion with these dances was a real work of creative genius and a great artist.
