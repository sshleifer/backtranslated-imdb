Among the standard “one-liner” action movies, where acting and logic are checked on the threshold, this film takes first place in the class. If the casting person put the "good" actors in this film, it would be worse (except Richard Dawson, who really acted well, if you can call the game yourself "actor"). I love this film! A running man is, in all likelihood, a gift from God to man (well, maybe, only to men). Of course, this is the most quoted movie of our time, so I’ll share with you my favorite line: "It's all part of a rich lifestyle, Brenda, and you better damn well used to it." Ah, more people call Brenda for quoting this movie than I can imagine.
