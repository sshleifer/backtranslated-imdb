Paul Reiser did an amazing job writing this movie. Peter Falk gives an idea of ​​his life. It is worthy of the Academy Award. It was one of the sharpest and funniest films of the year. Raiser’s wit is fantastic, and he is as good as possible, and as he was in his long-term television comedy “Lots of mind from you.” Peter Falk masterfully worked as his father, and Peter, who is now 78 years old, made us laugh and cry at the same time. The supporting cast was equal to the task, especially the magnificent gorgeous Elizabeth Perkins. This is a film that you definitely need to watch in 2005. We bet that all people of all ages and religions will love this film and somehow relate to it. We have mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters like these in the film. We all had good and bad times together, and we would like everything to be the same, but in different ways.
