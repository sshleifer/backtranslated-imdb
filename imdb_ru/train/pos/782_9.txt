This is a very touching picture of three forty-something best friends in a small town in England. Everyone finds passionate love and a new beginning with a junior piano teacher, When the beats of tragedy and heart change forever. Definitely a movie to bring along a box of napkins! Powerful piece of work. This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! CAUTION SPOILERS !! SPOILER !! * <br /> <br /> The main character is occupied by her young, beautiful piano instructor and passionate romantic flourishing. Her two jealous "friends" play an immature joke that quickly leads to tragedy. She loses her love and her friends in one fell swoop. In the end, an unexpected surprise brings them together (in my opinion, her forgiveness is not justified)
