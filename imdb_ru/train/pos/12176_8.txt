Paul (Jason Lee) is a minor who is simply engaged to a type A princess named Karen (Selma Blair). She chooses his clothes and his daily routine. At his bachelor party, Paul gets a little too drunk and somehow ends up taking a beautiful dancer named Becky (Julia Stiles) back to her seats. “Nothing happened,” as they say, but the duet wakes up in the same bed. Suddenly Karen is ringing. She is on her way to Paul's apartment. It is clear that Paul is beckoning Becky, although her underwear has been left behind. But there is more fun ahead. At a family dinner at the parents' house, Karen Paul comes across Becky again, finding out that she is Karen's cousin. Talk about some explanations to make! But instead, Paul decides to simulate stomach problems and hides in the bathroom. Does Karen ever know that Becky spent the night with Paul? And what will be the consequences? I apologize for the critics who prepare such films. They should definitely glow, because this film is fresh and fun. Of course, it doesn't hurt that Lee is the perfect funny person, Stiles is a charming beauty, or that Blair is natural, like a beautiful but anal bride. The rest of the cast, including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty, is also pretty sweet. Beautiful is the look of the film, the costumes and Californian scenery. Best of all, the script is creative and inspired, causing a lot of laughter to the audience. In short, if you want to tickle funny bones, then get this movie tonight. Perhaps this is not Oscar stuff, but absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a damn good one.
