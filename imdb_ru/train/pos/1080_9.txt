Comedy films at the present time are, as a rule, 100 minutes of toilet humor, obscene language and groin. Modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator, undemanding and slow brain. Of course, sometimes there will be a good comedy, but they are becoming less and less. <br /> <br /> “Mr. Blundings is building his dream house” shows what Hollywood was from in the 1940s, and it’s just awesome, Jim and Muriel Blindings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decided to build a house in the suburbs Connecticut The film tells about their history, starting with hunting trips, vigorous house building, right up to the finished house - with his “water softener zuzz-zuzz”. <br /> <br /> Grant and Loy are perfect for their role, of course (Grant is especially funny because he observes how the value of the house goes out of control). However, the film is stolen by the wise Blandings attorney, played perfectly by Melvin Douglas. Douglas manages to steal every scene in which he finds himself wisely watching as Blandings jumps from crisis to crisis. Reginald Denny, like the agitated architect of Blandings, and Harry Shannon, like the old, tumultuous driller, are also wonderful. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie many times and it always makes me laugh. I think this is a good movie to watch when you need a lift, whether you are building a house or not.
