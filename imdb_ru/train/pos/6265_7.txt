Nick and Kelly are ready to get married, but Travis (Kelly's dog) leads Nick to a strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon for Kelly. Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and make up a good pair. Nick loves to drink, smoke and play pool with guys for fun, but Nick unexpectedly refrains from this type of fun. Sex is the only thing he loves because he wants a child. We find that the alien race is dying and needs to be crossed with women from Earth to save its population. It becomes a battle for survival between humans and aliens, in which the dog population is involved. Great movie.
