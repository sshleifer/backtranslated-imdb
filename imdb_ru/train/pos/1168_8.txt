Tony Arzenta, a Sicilian assassin or professional killer, decides to leave the business, and his former employers disagree. In terms of content, this extremely pleasant action movie doesn’t have that; from the point of view of pure entertainment, it is fun - it is very melodramatic, cruel, rather cruel, car chases are noticeable. “Arzenta” is an unpretentious, but very likeable film, much better than the current Hollywood trash, which receives the same label. This is due to Delon's brief flirtation with an Italian 70s B-cinema. It carefully uses the image of the tough guy Delon, belonging to the gallery of bad thugs, which he made in his youth. <br /> <br /> I really liked the fact that Delon made this film, that he played a good role in the film Eurocriminal. <br /> <br /> The rating is very good, with a good introductory song. I felt the delight that Italians experienced for the film as a synthetic work, where musical art plays an important role. <br /> <br /> With Tony Arzenta / Big Guns / No Way Out, very attractive Erica Blanc (31 years old in '73) appears as an unnamed prostitute. Meanwhile, the friend of Arzenta Sandru is played by Carla Gravina (an asterisk, which practically left the cinema after 75 years). <br /> <br /> “Arzenta” Interestingly, an ambitious visual concept, some expressionistic features. The director of the film is the prolific Duccio Tessari, who also directed Zorro (Delon's comedy). Not to mention that these two films, Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro, are very different. The first is a bloody melodramatic act of violence. Action - the second - frivolous comedy, more like a parody, but surprisingly consistent and skillfully shot. Duccio Tessari made films such as Kiss, Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Sons of Satan, Bloody Butterfly, Viva La Muerte ... Tua! , Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976) and others.
