After you can get past the title of the film, Pecker is a great movie, perhaps one of the best in the film by John Waters. The wonderful cast, led by the strong performances of Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, make the story very funny and very real. There are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for small children, but they are for a specific purpose. Unfortunately, this film was not filmed en masse, and the majority of the public will be denied the opportunity to watch it. If the opportunity knocks out, then go watch this movie.
