Bad script, bad leadership, excessive performance, overloaded dialogue. What more can you ask for? To laugh, it's just no better than that. Excessive action Zadory in conjunction with the clich√© scenarios in which it turns out, makes for a fun parody of the "Hollywood" car. Almost as funny as "Spinal Tap", although it is clearly not intended for this. Do not miss the line of Ray Liotta's debut movie "Looks Like a Penis."
