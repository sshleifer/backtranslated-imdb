This is an extremely powerful plot film based on real events that can infuriate to watch. I say this because the brutal persecution of the press can be for people, in this case an innocent Australian couple is accused of killing their child. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep received great acclaim for her performance when this film was released, but I thought Sam Neill was just as good. Let's just say they were both great, but the role of the Strip was a bit more difficult because she had to learn the Australian accent. (She understood this so well that it was difficult for me to understand her in parts.) <br /> <br /> Without giving anything away, all I can say is that this film exhausts you emotionally.
