The United States still struggled with World War II (the film was released between VE Day and VJ Day). Any studio that would have cost salt made live-action films where fearless American soldiers beat the enemy, or the Americans sang and danced altogether. Technicolor Musicals were what America thrived on on depressing days when everything was normal. Most of the musicals of the day were simply a set of musical numbers, combined with the best of the available scenes to fill the time until the next musical number! Now I have the feeling that the people who watch this film were born after 1970. It depresses how quickly we forget. <br /> <br /> This film could be called “The Search for Jose Iturbi,” but now everyone wonders why, Let me explain. Since 1929 - his arrival in America - until his death in 1980, Iturbi was one of the best pianists who decorated the concert stage. He agreed to make several films in 1942, but at the time Hollywood pursued him for almost ten years. Not only an excellent pianist, but also a successful conductor, Iturbi has been a household word for over 40 years. <br /> <br /> The scene when Iturbi and 17 other pianists were playing one of Liszt's rhapsodies was planned at an early stage - and no one noticed that all the other pianists were children? Joe Pasternak, who produced this film and many other MGM musicals, attributed Iturbi interesting American youth in classical music. Grayson's desire to audition with Iturbi in the film was not much different from the real life of the time. Everyone wanted Iturbi then. The joke among the soldiers was that “GI” meant “Get Iturbi” (he spoke a lot at military bases). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was a great dancer, and Frank Sinatra was a great singer, but at the time this movie was made, Sinatra was barely 30 years old, and she worked under a contract with Columbia Records for only four years . Kelly was already known as a dancer, but Iturbi was by that time a worldwide sensation for more than 20 years. <br /> <br /> As for the lack of a plot, the Americans do not need a plot. They were tired of the war, they were sick of fear for their loved ones, and they were worried about the future. They needed happiness, hope and confidence that in the end everything will be fine. They needed music, smiles, joy and romance. This film and others like it delivered exactly what was needed. <br /> <br /> Enough lectures. Mice dance aside, the best scene in the film takes place between Sinatra and Iturbi, each of which “ignorantly” complements the music of the other. <br /> <br /> If you have an interest in José Iturbi, a Spaniard who conquered more America than De Soto, Cortez and De Leon combined, please visit my website, www.joseiturbi.com, where you You can find a summary of the plot, excerpts from the reviews of the films of the "day" and photos from this and some other MGM musicals of the 1940s, as well as the biography and discography of Iturbi. <br /> <br /> Trout
