What with all the negative comments? After I first watched this movie tonight, I can only say that it is a good holiday comedy that will surely brighten up the day of any single person. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck) could spend the holidays alone, I wanted to cry. You will need to watch a movie if you want to know why. Also, although I liked Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) after a while, if you ask me, they were real snobs. However, this film made me smile and feel good inside. Before I finish, I would like to say that Mike Mitchell has achieved a clean holiday hit. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this good holiday comedy, which will surely brighten up the day of any single person to any Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate who has not seen him.
