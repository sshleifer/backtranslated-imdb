The man who shot “The Third Man” also shot the episode “Who Will Buy” in the film “Oliver!”. Now this is talent. <br /> <br /> I lift my hat to Carol Reed. <br /> <br /> I know that “second squads” are involved here, but still ... <br /> <br /> And he had to deal with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed ... <br / > <br /> I believe the quality will come out. <br /> <br /> (This can be seen in the final scene with Nancy [avoiding the spoiler - everyone should see Oliver for the first time ever!].) How many lines I need to type. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended to encourage people to type too much. <br /> <I hope this is considered the “10th line”.
