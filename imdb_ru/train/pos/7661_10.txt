Scanners II: The new order is as good as David Cronenberg's classic scanners. Scanners were created in 1980, and Scanners II in 1991, so the gap between the two films is eleven years old. The film reflects the style of scanners, and this is good, because there would be no scanners without a head bang, so Scanners II has a head bang scene that is just as terrible as the first one. Scanners II: The New Order has other imaginative bloody scenes that are well done. The plot for “Scanners II: New Order” is a new look at the series, because it has Scanners that are used as a vigilant force for the police chief and a group of scientists until a young Scanner named David Kellum finds that he is being used and decides revenge <br /> <br /> Scanners II: The New Order is a great continuation of David Cronenberg's classic scanners and is worth seeing. Check this. 10/10
