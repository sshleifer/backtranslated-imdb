I really liked this debut of director Ring Hideo Nakat. If you have seen The Ring in advance, you will be familiar with the style and idea of ​​this film. It has a subtle ghost that works better than regular (and predictable) stingers that permeate most popular films of this genre. If you like movies that cause chills, then you will surely enjoy this movie. Hideo Nakat's good, creepy debut. 8/10
