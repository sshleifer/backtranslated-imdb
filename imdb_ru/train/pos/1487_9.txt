“Kazomay” is a workshop story telling the story of a young couple sneaking through the muddy waters of marriage. This story is very plausible when it tells of strange views between oblivion and the constant intervention of others, which is quite typical for Italy (although one may wonder if such cases differ in other places). Pavignano and D'Alatri wrote very well, and this is one of the strengths of the film. The performance of Stephanie Rocchi and Fabio Volo is sober and exciting. And the figure of a sympathetic priest is ridiculous and round. In general, a truly worthy film, perhaps one of the best Italian films of the year.
