What can you say when you see a good French film, in which it tries to draw a tense story in accordance with the social background of the characters? The main thing is that we believe in these characters, and as soon as they meet, we want them to stay together. It is simple and really effective. Background history is less important. Why does the script go to the side of a half-developed thriller? It helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations that most French jerks like to make. Not too many ambitions, that's right: Sur mes l√®vres is only an interesting French film with a good performance. <br /> <br /> For all the smart moments of noir in the script, the end is too simple. It goes as easily as in the back window (an obvious link and definitely not a film noir), but with a less convincing context. I am amazed when I see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased. He brings very little to the story; when he appears alone, we wonder if we missed the part before. Jacques Audiar is not new. Strange and strange.
