I saw this film in 1959, when I was 11 years old in a cinema where I was traveling with my family. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it was very funny. , although I was too young to understand 90% of what makes this wonderful film such a delight! I saw it again this morning at Turner South. When I watched it, I was completely overwhelmed with laughter! “Mating game” is a unique classic of a long past age. If you are too young to survive the fascinating period of the story in which this film was created, I am very sorry for you. You will not be able to watch these films and understand how they (even today) can deliver such a delightful piece of paradise to “old timers” like me. <br /> <br /> Having said that, all I can do is respectfully ask young people to refrain from commenting on films such as The Mating Game. <br /> <br /> These films were created for the generation that preceded the current group of your people. And as such, these films speak a completely different language than any of you can understand. <br /> <br /> In other words ?? If you do not understand what the film is about, please do not be embarrassed by offering comments that ?? Frankly ?? does not make sense.
