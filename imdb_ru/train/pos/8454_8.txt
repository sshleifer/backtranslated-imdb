In the second alternative tale of the Gundam universe (G-Gundam is the first), “Wing Gundam” is another different look at Gundam's verse. Familiar items found, but Gundam Wing is actually different from its counterparts. The biggest of these is that gundams are nothing more than terrorists fighting a single organization. Truth be told, the show doesn't actually become a show about the war until the 7th episode, but in fact the real conflict, Eve Wars, does not occur until later episodes. <br /> <br /> Her characters are the biggest plus of this series. All the main characters are worked through throughout the cycle of 49 episodes, and you can really sympathize with each role they played. Another big plus is a fantastic character and fur-design series. The projects put some of his other Gundam colleagues to shame. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest criticisms in this series is how many dying UC fans claim they have broken the original UC saga. Why Gundam Wing gets this rap when the more obvious UC clone Gundam Seed is outside of me. True, many moments are canceled, but they are told in a new way, and there are differences. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the usual comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. Throughout the entire series, Zechs is most rejected in the Alliance, and in some cases in the OZ, while the Red Comet was a bright symbol of Zeon. Another big difference is that Zehs loses a lot of soldiers under his command, hence another nickname he gave in his earlier episodes: "The killer of his people." Charu not assigned this label. <br /> <br /> The problems of this series are not a philosophy, but two problems. The first is the re-used frames of the Gundam attack animation. Of course, it is interesting to see how Heavy Hands are attacking tanks, MS and airplanes for the first time. But in the fourth reuse, such scenes age. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the whole cycle should take place throughout the year. If you really think about all the events taking place in the series, a lot happens in just one year. <br /> <br /> But I think you can easily ignore this fact, ignoring the first lines of the entry. As it values, it is probably the best of the Gundam stories of the alternate universe and a great introduction to the Gundam world. In the end, it was the first Gundam anime that aired on American television.
