I have been a Hindi movie lover since 4 years old, but never in my life have I watched such a touching and impressive film, especially a Hindi movie. In the past few years, I stopped watching modern films in Hindi and returned to watching classics (Tisri Kasam, Mere Khuzur, Madhomati, Mother India, Sholai, etc.). But this film has changed everything. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I discovered that she is not only moving, but also very informative for a man who is an Indian woman of the first generation who grew up in America. It helped me understand my own family history, which has always been something very abstract to me. But to “see” it, to feel it and to understand that it helped me to sympathize with those generations that were before me, and with the struggle that the Indian people outlived. The film helped me understand a lot, especially considering current world events. I never thought that a movie could change the way I think it used to be ... it was. The plot is fantastic, acting is great, and the direction is impeccable. Two thumbs up!
