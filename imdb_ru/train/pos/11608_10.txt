This is a great movie. After reading the other reviews, I see that I am not the only one who cried. Tamilina Tomita acted with such skill and conviction that she made the final soulful and memorable. In the hands of a lesser actress, her last scene seemed banal and banal. No one would have thought that this film was shot with a limited budget. The cinematography is great and there are many famous actors. The script is so wonderful, I understand why they all wanted to be in it. If you look at a long, long list of credits at the end, you will see that half of Hawaii has set its sights on making this film, and for good reason. The soundtrack (available on CD) is very beautiful and sets the mood throughout the film. My only "complaint" is that I almost did not want the film to end.
