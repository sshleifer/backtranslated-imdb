I can not agree with any of the comments. I first watched a film on a British television channel, it was presented as an indie film, and if you take the film from that angle, I think that is a completely different matter. I could not believe what I saw, and immediately sat down. The plot may be as bad as the JS show (i.e. There is no plot), but the acting is evil, funny, and overall this is an incredible trash movie. <br /> <br /> He speaks about America as much as “Bully” or “Ken Park” without a dramatic perspective, but gives an idea of ​​American society and, more precisely, which day viewers in America (and I believe a lot of them!) Interested. After all, we are talking about neighbors, is not it? <br /> <br /> 100% fun!
