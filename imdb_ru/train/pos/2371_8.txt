I offered to rent this film to my friend, and he agreed, since he had already seen the film, and he said that everything was in order. I thought the name was a little polite, since the version in our store was called Fear: Halloween Night. I expected this movie to be a bit of a hooligan on Halloween with a wooden guyâ€™s killer. But it started with a good scene, and the killer immediately killed two victims and rushed forward twenty years later, when his son, who witnessed how he killed two people (including his mother), and he even witnessed his suicide. Fathers goes to a secluded forest cabin with his friends and his girlfriend, where he tries to confront his fears, until the wooden statue comes alive with the spirit of his father. Pretty good to continue, and I have not even seen the first one.
