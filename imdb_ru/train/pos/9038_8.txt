I loved the October sky. Most of all I liked the music. It worked in two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time frame. This is done by playing songs from the late fifties. In the second hour, the instrumental score takes over. Music is now perfectly suited to the mood of the film. <br /> <br /> I not only enjoyed the music, but also the actors. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hikam was especially unexpected for me. He performed a first-class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). <br /> <br /> I have already seen this film about how to escape from the life already laid out for you, and both times I fully enjoyed it.
