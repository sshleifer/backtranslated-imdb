California is a film about lost ideals. Travel the darkest road in the world. The road of no return. The story of a couple who intended to find a better life in California. The man (David Duchovny in his best role so far) wants to write a book about famous crimes that occurred in America, and his girlfriend, the photographer, is going to take pictures. Thus, they set out on the trail of the famous murders, not knowing what awaits them on the way. To share the cost of travel, they decided to find another pair and placed an ad. But the couple that answers is not just ANY couple. This is one of the strangest couples ever. The girl is a naive, fragile creature who dreams a lot and loves cacti. The person is exactly the opposite. Brutal ruthless killer. We learn about this at the beginning of the film and follow him on the way to California (not with C, as usual, but with K, presumably symbolizing the word killer), along the path of betrayal, murder, and finally defeat. All presenters, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes give really good performances, and you have to take into account that when this movie was shot, none of them was a star. The photo is amazing, the darkness covers most of the film, and the music suits the dark character of the film. In general, this is a really good movie. Do not miss it. You will think again before taking a stranger in your car to share gas with him!
