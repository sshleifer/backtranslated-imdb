If I had been familiar with the stage play "Guys and Dolls" before I watched the film, I would not be as fond of it as I was. Although, to be honest, I probably would still like to see the production of the film better because of my general adoration of both Brando (for his acting skills) and Sinatra (for his voice, although he is also quite an actor, see The Manchurian Candidate or from here to eternity.) <br /> <br /> Regarding other reviewers' statements about the songs, I have a Broadway soundtrack, and although Isabel Bingley’s voice eclipses Gene Simmons’s voice, he is no more pleasant. I think this is a pretty sharp quality. Gene Simmons's voice is much more realistic, although, though, this is not always a matter of serious concern in musicals. It was also the only time I particularly noticed that Marlon Brando’s particularly weak vocal register was during his performance "Luck Be A Lady" and only there, because I was previously familiar with the version of Sinatra. I also think that Vivian Blaine's voice is much nicer in the film than on Broadway. And only the voice of Sinatra can atone for the shortcomings of all others, if they really need redemption. (They weren't) It's infinitely better than Sam Leven, especially in my favorite song, "Sue Me." <br /> <br /> In addition, the complaint that a lot of songs were missed in the film because of bad songs, let me disagree. “Bushel and a Peck” is not a gem, and the song that replaced it, “Pet Me Poppa” and the accompanying performance are more material for the Hot Box. I personally don't give a damn about Marry the Man Today, and I'm glad it wasn't included in the movie. I adore “I have never been in love before,” and although it was not sung in the film, the instrumental version can be heard when Nathan is in the Adelaide dressing room. The song “Woman” in “Love” expresses the same feeling equally well and, probably, in the range that both stars could achieve more skillfully. And the film would not be the same without the song "Adelaide", not included on Broadway. In fact, if the movie soundtrack were available for sale, I would recommend to buy it instead of Broadway. <br /> <br /> Although I did not see the original production, I can’t imagine that the game will be better than in the film. Actors <br /> <br /> An important fact is that the story is as charming as before, and acting, and the son of gs does not make it less so.
