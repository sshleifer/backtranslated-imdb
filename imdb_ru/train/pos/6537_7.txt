The children I took in this film fell in love with him (four children between the ages of 9 and 12; they would give him 10 stars). Emma Roberts was charming in the title role. (Expect to see more of this next generation Robert.) After I was over-exposed by people like Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, it was nice to see a girl who didnâ€™t look as if she was working the streets. I also liked to watch the supporting cast, which included Tate Donovan, Rachel Lee Cook, Barry Bostwick and Monica Parker (with Bruce Willis' cameo). Final conclusion: Nice movie. <br /> <br /> (Note: I did not read a series of books, so my comments are based only on the merits of the film.)
