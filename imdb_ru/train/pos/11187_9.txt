Pet Semetary (1989) 9/10 The Creed family has just moved to the small town of Ludlow. The family consists of father Louis, mother Rachel, brother Gage and daughter Ellen. Judd Crandall greets them with kindness. Jude is 89 years old and he can tell you about the whole story of Ludlow. <br /> <br /> Behind the new home of Cred there is a path leading to the pet cemetery (recorded home cemetery for animals). When Ellen wants to climb to see this, Jude deliberately sends her family on a journey. This is the beginning of hell for the Creed family. <br /> <br /> When Rachel and the kids are gone, Ellen's cat church dies. Jude feels that Ellen is not ready for her cat's death, so he suggests that Louis follow him further along the path, past the pet graveyard. <br /> <br /> Jude tells Louis about this burial ground, once used by the Indians. Micmac Louis buried the church without the help of Jude. A couple of days later, Church returns, alive, but from hell. <br /> <br /> This film was one of two horror films that could scare me, except Exorcist. The greatest insight would be Zelda, Rachel's sister with spinal meningitis, or Victor Pascoe, a ghost who tries to help Credo make a mistake by returning things from the dead. <br /> <br /> The music in this film plays an extravagant role. It is both sad and mysterious. It goes well with the film. <br /> <br /> 9/10
