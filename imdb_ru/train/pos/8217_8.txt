This film is the only film “Dirty Harry” in which Clint Eastwood is not only filmed, but also produced, and directed, you know, this should be good. Although some say that the Enforcer is the best of the series, I completely disagree. In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only ones worthy of being in the series. Although the Enforcer is a good movie with a couple of good action films, it doesn’t get the dirty and rude impact that the other three films make. This film captures all the excitement that makes Clint Eastwood's film good, and he has quotes that make Harry Dirty film good. In "Diry Harry" this is "... ok, punk?"; in Magnum Force “A man must know his limitations”; and in this “Come on. Make my day. ” Also in this film, it's nice to see a change in scenery, since you are tired of seeing the same old streets of San Francisco in other films of the series. With the great game of Clint Eastwood and colleagues Sandra Locke, and good director Clint, in my opinion, this is the best continuation of Dirty Harry.
