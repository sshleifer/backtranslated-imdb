The idea of ​​making a film about the Beatles sounds like a doomed idea, since no production can grasp the idea of ​​real historical Beatles. Then, perhaps, it is better not to try to recreate the past, but to create an illustration that works best with other Beatles material available. This is exactly what the Birth of the Beatles offers us, a simple story known to us without extravaganza. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS are here at *** <br /> <br /> Be warned that not everything is as accurate as some Beatles graduates might have expected. The Beatles perform songs that were hardly written by that time. The Beatles perform "Ask me why", "P.S. I love you "and even" Do not bother me. " The Beatles graduates must understand that if the Beatles in the film perform only those songs that they actually did in Hamburg, young viewers may no longer recognize the Beatles, which they learned to know. Of this original Hamburg repertoire, only “Johnny B. Goode” and “Love me tender” by Stu Sutcliffe survived. <br /> <br /> The guys who play the Beatles in this performance are not very similar to the originals, but the rest of the film is still well viewed, the rest of the film is quite accurate. The guy who plays Lennon does it well, and the rest of the band are pretty good too. Brian Epstein is great, and the moment he dismisses Pete Best from the group is probably the most memorable scene in the whole movie. Also as a bonus, you can see the original Cavern movie in the movie.
