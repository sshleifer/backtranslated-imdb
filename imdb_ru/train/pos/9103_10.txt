In life, we first organize the stones (Piedras in Spanish), such as career, family, friendship and love. In this way, we will find a space between them to fit smaller stones, our small needs. If you act in the opposite way, you will not have enough space for larger stones. The five main characters in this film are women who could not organize the big "stones" in their lives. Ramon Salazar, a Spanish film director, defines his first function as “The Stones” in this way. The film tells about the parallel, contradictory trajectory of five women: Anita (Monica Servera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-) and Maricarmen ( Vicky Pena, 1954 -). Everyone is trying to remove the stones that persistently appear in their path or, even worse, are in their place. These are five Cinderella, in search of Prince Charm and a new chance in life. The best story of these five Cinderers is the story of Anita (Monica Servers), who also starred in the films “20 centimeters”, “Busko”, “Crimen Ferpecto”, “Entre Vivir y Sonar”, “Hongos” and “Octavia”.
