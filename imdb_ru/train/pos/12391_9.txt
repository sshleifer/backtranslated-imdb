Minor Spoilers <br /> <br /> Alison Parker (Christina Raines) is a successful top model, living with lawyer Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) in her apartment. In the past, she tried to commit suicide twice: the first time when she was a teenager and she saw her father cheating on her mother and two women in her house, and then when Michael's wife died. Since then, she has left Christ and the Catholic Church behind. Alison wants to live alone in her own apartment, and with the help of real estate agent Miss Logan (Ava Gardner) she finds a wonderful furnished old apartment in Brooklyn Heights for a reasonable rent. She sees a strange man in the window on the top floor of the building, and Miss Logan reports that he is the father of Francis Matthew Halloran (John Carradine), a blind priest who lives alone with the support of the Catholic Church. Alison moves to her new location, and when she’s there, she receives a visitor: her neighbor Charles Chazen (Burgess Meredith) greets her and introduces her new neighbors. He then invites Alison to celebrate the birthday of his cat Jezebel at night. The next day, strange things happen to Alison in her apartment and with her health. Alison is looking for Miss Logan and finds out that she lives alone with a priest in the building. Further investigation reveals that all the people she knew in the party were dead criminals. Frightened by the situation, Alison embraces Christ again, and Michael investigates terrible events. Alison realizes that she lives at the gate to hell. <br /> <br /> Untold "in the IMDb user rating, The Sentinel is one of the best horror films. I have seen this film at least six times, for the first time in the 70s, in a movie theater. In September 07, 2002, I bought an imported DVD and saw it again. Yesterday I saw this movie again. Even after so many years, this film is still amazing. A terrible and dark story scares even in our days. The cast is a constellation of stars and asterisks. You can see many actors and actresses who became famous at the beginning of their careers. Horror film fans definitely worship the Guardian, and I'm one of them. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “A Sentinela dos Malditos” (“Guardian of the Damned”) <br /> <br /> Review: On September 2, 2007, I saw this movie again.
