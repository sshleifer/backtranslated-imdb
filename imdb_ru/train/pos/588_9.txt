I saw all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his love for the American people and the land. In the river that flows through it, Redford shows the lyrical romanticism and visual magnificence of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana, as if he were a 19th-century landscape painter in the spirit of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love to the visual and verbal text of the author Norman Maclean, as well as the stunning camera work of Philip Rousselot (“Kiss the Serpent, Rainey Margot”). <br /> <br /> Redford cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt - Rev. Macklin, a man whose teaching methods include fly fishing, as well as the Bible, Brenda Blyten, the mother and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt, create a family whose interaction reflects the same problems that all grow up with sons, and later difficult young people. Both Schaffer and Pitt are absolutely believable as brothers whose love for fly fishing and for each other will bind them forever. It is the relationship between men, father and sons, brothers and their women in the outside world that the river flows along it in the course of story-telling, which is missing in many Hollywood films made in recent years. <br /> <br /> What makes this relationship special is that Redford pays attention to the language spoken in the dialogue. This is a literate script, pleasant to the ear and unforgettable in combination with stunning rivers and mountains of Montana. Words and staging are equal to the actions of the cast, which rises to their material. Although the idea of ​​fly fishing may seem like a strange tool for centering the story, it is not so implausible in the directing hands of Redford. Given the material, Redford's Ode is in a simpler time and life is worth visiting again and again.
