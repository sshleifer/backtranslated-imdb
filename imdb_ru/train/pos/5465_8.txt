This is a hard-boiled Warner Brothers film featuring the very young Barbara Stenwick. An unsurpassed master of the Machiavellian class, a technique she refined eleven years later in Billy Wilder's "Double Compensation", Stanwick plays Lily Powers, the worn-out daughter of a cruel spiksi owner in a stifling steel city. She became cynical and numb due to the fact that she was offered as a sexual service to her father’s clients. When her father dies as a result of an explosion at a distillery, she jumps on a freight train to New York and literally sleeps up the bank’s corporate stairs. <br /> <br /> It would seem absurd if it were not for the flaming Stanvik to work here. With her dead eyes and immoral seduction, it is easy to understand why men become addicted to her aggressive violence. One of the young men she seduces along the way is a new-faced John Wayne, an accountant named Jimmy McCoy. Melodrama becomes tough for the last third of the film with murder-suicide, secret work in Paris to keep Lily alone, and the new president of the bank so dependent on Lily that he wastes the company's funds to keep her in luxury. The ending ending is somewhat disappointing, but not before Stanwick sees the screen. The film has some curious touches, such as Lily's friendly friendship with an African-American woman named Chico and a German immigrant who teaches Lily about Nietzsche's philosophy regarding the importance of avoiding sentimentality.
