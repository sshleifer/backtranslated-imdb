I watched it when my wife called to find out from my other room about my choice of fare. My comment? “I am following my life!” <br /> <br /> Although I’m younger, but only 5 years older than Rocket Boys, I remember the absolute urgency with which our education administrators met Sputnik and the whole science fair gained momentum and took me and others into a competitive whirlwind. My own tornado brought me to the science fair of my state in 62, although our group was less successful in receiving support, for example, from firefighters, to whom we turned for guidance and advice, until after the tragic event our city became so strong that Let us tour the Nike missile facility on the shores of Lake Chicago. <br /> <br /> This film gave me all this back, and I bet that he gave it all back for many of us, "UberNerds" from the late 50s - early 60s. <br /> <br /> Now we have a similar period of “brain drain” in science, and we really need this film as a country. See it!
