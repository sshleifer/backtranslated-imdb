I have long watched this film and series, but now I refresh my memory! It was a very funny movie based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott had fun together. Bo and Luke Herzog help Uncle Jessie control the Moonshine in General Lee. When Boss Hogg drives the dukes out of their farm, Bo and Luke sneak around the local Hogg construction site and find samples of coal. They soon realize that Boss Hogg is going to strip Hazzard County mines, unless the dukes can stop him with the help of their beautiful cousin Daisy. My two problems with the film were that Burt Reynolds was inappropriate for Boss Hogg, and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was too serious. In addition, I highly recommend the Dukes of DANGER !!!
