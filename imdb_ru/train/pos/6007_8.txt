If you have not heard of this film from Walt Disney Pictures, do not worry about it. This will apply to other Disney films that are intended for educational purposes, such as Family Planning. <br /> <br /> This was a joint project with Kotex, to possibly teach girls to adolescent menstruation. He teaches only at the surface level, so he does not go into the details of the animation sequence "Head of a Ram" / "Reproductive System". <br /> <br /> The film demonstrates such elements of Disney's Wonderful World as flipping pages and using animation to tell a story. <br /> <br /> This movie cannot be found, so if you can find a movie, good luck and enjoy watching.
