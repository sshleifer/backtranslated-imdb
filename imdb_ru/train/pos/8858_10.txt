I have to admit that this is a type of film that I usually avoid, but I shot it mainly because of the stars. I certainly did not regret. In fact, as you can see, I rated it at five stars. This film is the perfect combination of a sharp director and superb acting. <br /> <br /> Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who have decided to commit an awkward crime involving the robbery of their parents' jewelry store. The crime goes horribly wrong, and thus begins the interrogation of three men in the Hanson family. Through a series of memories, we met Charles Henson and came to understand the tensions between father and sons. <br /> <br /> The younger brother, Hank, is essentially a scoundrel. He always had problems with work, and he pretty much goes in the direction of the wind. Hank is unsure, cowardly and under the influence of his older brother. Ethan Hawke has the character of Hank, “nailed to T,” and is probably his best performance so far. He shows us a man who is mostly kindhearted, but so influenced by external forces that he cannot fulfill any important task. <br /> <br /> At first glance, Andy is a successful businessman, but we soon discover that he became addicted to drugs and squandered his company to pay for his habit. It is Andy who comes up with a plan to rob the store of his parents, and he will force Hank to take an action limply. Philip Seymour Hoffman - undoubtedly one of the best actors of our time - plays Andy. Hoffman is an actor who has the opportunity to portray a person who, at first glance, is a charming businessman who is loved by his acquaintances, but a real ball of slime under him. He is absolutely perfect for the role of Andy, or one can say that thanks to his excellent acting skills, he made Andy the perfect role. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays the father, in common with his generation. Charles Hanson is not a bad or insensitive person, but he has a lousy relationship with his sons, because he never understood what was necessary to foster a positive relationship between his sons and himself. He was always too fast to criticize and warn. He always made it clear that he preferred his youngest son to the older one, which causes a wide emotional gap between him and Andy. When we meet Charles and Andy, the idea that Andy is making a plan to rob his father becomes less and less incredible. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that Charles Hanson reminded me of his own. father, and how much Andy and Hank reminded me of my own brother and of myself. Perhaps this may be one of the reasons that I liked the film so much, like this story of a distant, critical father, a more successful older brother and a less successful younger brother, so close to home. Fortunately, my brother and I did not go so far as to commit a crime against my parents - I think we were made of more severe and more moral things. <br /> <br /> This set of personalities and actions was skillfully assembled by director Sidney Lumet. At eighty-three, he still has the opportunity to give viewers exciting characters and a hypnotizing effect. "12 angry people" was his first film, shot fifty years before "Before the devil knows you're dead," but he did not lose the slightest magic, showing us characters who will be remembered for a long time. <br /> <br /> The events and characters of the movie “Before the Devil Knows You're Dead” are harsh and unappealing, and this is definitely a bad movie. However, these are two hours of entertainment, which I fully recommend.
