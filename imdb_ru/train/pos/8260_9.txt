Those French and those Germans undoubtedly have a long history of not loving each other. It is interesting to note that Kamerdaschaft or the Partnership in translation occurs in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would besiege Germany and begin his plans to seize the world, France would become a victim of his ambitions. But these are times of calm compared to the future. A group of miners at the border is trying to move to France to get a job. They are rejected back and later at a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then there is a disaster at the French mines and a well-designed and written scene, a troupe of German miners decides to come to the rescue. Simple story right? Pabst was a silent film poet, and I'm not sure if this is his first sound film or not, but his poetry must be revealed. He is not fussy, but brings severe realism to the test. It is even a memory of the events of the Second World War, which attracts the meaning of this story. Supposedly based on a real event, the film makes events proudly with spontaneity and brevity. From time to time this is what the film should be.
