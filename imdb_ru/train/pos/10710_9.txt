I really have to disagree with the courtyard guy who (if he had watched the whole film) would have seen absolutely stunning Scottish landscapes (some of the best ones ever shot in Skye) and found the film with a difficult start. really sharp whole. <br /> <br /> This is not a great budget movie. Rather, it is a movie that evokes a strong community feeling. <br /> <br /> I can’t say how many “standard” films I’ve got tired of - pushing the same polished things over and over again. Seachd doesn't seem to be about that at all. It seems that he is really trying to offer something more real and, of course, more Gaelic than any recent Scottish film. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the game is not blockbuster. This is because the actors seem to be real people. I really thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing - and sometimes extraordinarily beautiful. <br /> <br /> Seachd is really being re-watched, as there are many topics that are becoming clearer the second time - which really fit into the final. <br /> <br /> In general, the combination of music and (at times) stunning visual effects, as well as a collective approach to acting and abnormal structure turned Seachd into a very special and memorable film. More of this, please!
