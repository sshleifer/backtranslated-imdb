From the top shelf of the great Classic Books comes this masterful story written by Pearl Buck. The book, similar to the film, is called “The Good Earth”. This is related to the story of Van Lung (Paul Muni), a simple Chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the “Great House”, where he took the slave O-lan (Louise Rainer) and made her his wife. Almost from the very beginning, she begins to adapt to his kindness, keeping a small peach seed and planting it near her new home. In the following years, O-Lan proves his worth by enduringly sharing her husband’s work, trouble, and state change. Over the past years, they have been raising a family and watching their simple home weather, holiday and hunger. Indeed, it is at the lowest point of their lives that everyone discovers the value of communication, loyalty and Love. With changing times, their growing family is helped and threatened by friends and relatives, such as their uncle (Walter Connolly), who is a scoundrel and a charlatan, but patiently tolerant. Van has his own “Old Father” (Charlie Grapevine), who advises and reminds him of a fragile and unstable life. Two famous actors who appear impressively in this film are Kay Luke, who plays Wan's Eldest Son, and Philippe Ahn, who plays a nationalist soldier. The film is in black and white and wonderfully adapted from the novel. Highly recommended for all audiences. ****
