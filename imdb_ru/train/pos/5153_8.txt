In the film Christian DÃ¼ge, "Hitler: Rise of Evil", the first years of his life and the policies of Hitler are shown successfully with some minor historical mistakes and some exaggeration. For a Hollywood film, it is natural to contain such things, since the main goal of the production is the income that they will receive from the film. Despite the fact that such mistakes may disappoint some viewers who believe that everything should be done with the help of the book, I believe that most of them fit well with the rest of the film, which makes it more interesting. We must not forget that this film is not a documentary. Who cares how his dog died? <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Hitler is portrayed as a psychologically unstable figure who is very angry and very passionate about his ideals. But he was not portrayed as a supervillain, but as an ambitious politician. I think this is a good perspective, since the film is not polluted by tons of negative emotions, and this made the film somewhat objective. Yes, he was a little crazy, and his methods were rude, but he was still a man, and not an absolutely insane figure depicted in Inglorious Bastards. I believe this made the film more realistic, even with some inaccuracies in historical facts. <br /> <br /> The flow of history reflects well on the audience. Despite the fact that the film was focused on Hitler, we also had the opportunity to see what is happening in the country as a result of these actions through newspapers, discussions of people and songs in Jewish cabaret. The public reaction also affected the films, but was very limited. The fight of journalist Fritz Gerlich and the ironic plays in the cabaret were fun and interesting, but that was all. We basically saw his followers rampage on the streets and cheering him on. <br /> <br /> Another thing that was missing from the film is the information about the origin of his hatred of the Jews. At the beginning of the film, some ideas were given on this subject, but they were rather superficial. Suddenly, he became a politician, who made speeches about the need to destroy the Jews. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Hitler: The Rise of Evil cannot be considered an excellent film that everyone will like, but this is not at all unsatisfactory. If you can stand directors who change the story for money, this is an interesting film, which successfully reflects the personality of Hitler.
