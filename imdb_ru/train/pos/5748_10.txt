This film was excellent - the emotional power of the speeches of Tom Hals and Ray Liotta brought me tears and joy in my heart - this film shows us that there is still hope in the world. If this film were released at the end of 1988, instead of Rain of a Man, Hulse would certainly have been at least nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor. Definitely a must see!
