A very nice movie involving characters who commit bad deeds and that allow emotions, such as anger and a thirst for revenge, to flare up. The cast is very good, there is a lot of action, and Stewart gets the girl and his revenge (with a twist) at the end. I have seen this film several times, and I always watch when it is on AMC or cable. Highly recommended ...
