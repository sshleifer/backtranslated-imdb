This film shows life in northern Cameroon from the perspective of a young French woman, Frans Dalens, whose father is an official of the colonial (French) government and whose family is one of the few white families in the district. This gives an idea of ​​how life was for both the colonists and the natives with whom they communicated. This feeling is consistent with another film that I saw about Africa over a similar period of time (Nirgendwo in Afrika (2001)), but I do not know how realistic or typical it is. This is not just an impression - things happen in the film - but the plot is understated. The viewer is left to draw his own conclusions, and not to force the directors to impose on him, although the design of the story as a reminder of the visit of a woman to southwestern Cameroon at a mature age gives some perspective.
