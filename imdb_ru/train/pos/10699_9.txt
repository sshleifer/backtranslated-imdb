When I saw The Birthday Girl, I liked her so much that I decided to watch all the Nicole Kidman films that I could, only to find disappointment for them compared to him. I assume that, although the presence of a certain star usually guarantees a certain level of quality due to their artistic control, with Nicole Kidman, the influence she has is detrimental to the pleasure of the film - IMHO. For example, Dogville, even depriving the viewer of something visual, distracting from the existential insight that she beats off at home, or other films that promote gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone’s attention, or Kidman’s other domestic causes. <br /> <br /> Here she is a natural woman, and she does an excellent job with her work. I do not know how or who was able to contain her, but apparently it worked. The way the film portrays her openness, despite her resistance, comes to the bottom of what makes a woman a woman. And, therefore, that which makes a person’s most desperate hopes insignificantly attainable. <br /> <br /> Of course, the fact that the main character turns from a milking clerk to macho in one movie sounds like a fantasy about expanding a man's ego, but his transformation is quite plausible. This is not clever, as in the film, created to support the male ego. Instead, it accurately captures the required growth arising from the unique circumstances of the films. <br /> <br /> It is also very charming how criminals are portrayed as completely human, in addition to their criminal mission. Her gang has rude and disorderly communication, alien to American culture. And although they are his opponents, they have never been his enemies. In fact, they teach him to be competitive. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised at Kidman’s ability to physically appear Russian. I wondered if her ancestry was Russian, but none of the pictures of her that I studied showed any hint of it. Maybe it was just makeup, but it was amazing. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that they will soon hit her on the head again so that she can make another great movie. Despite my useless digging with Ms. Kidman, I realized that this is an excellent film in all respects and probably the role of a lifetime.
