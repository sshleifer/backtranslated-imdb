Lars Von Triers Europa is a very good movie. Like this? Von Trier has a very stylized way to tell a story, at least he did it with Europe. For me, the whole movie was like an experience, even if I saw it on a small television screen. Even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this film is the most complete, REAL and exciting film than most movies from the list of the top 250. I also think that this is perhaps the most terrible, most gothic and complete film. Well, there are other good ones, but this one is my favorite. The final scene is one of the most heartbreaking.
