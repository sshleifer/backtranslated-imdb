This documentary tells the story of Big and Little Edie Beal, a mother and daughter, who lived from the mid-50s to the end of the 70s as hermits in a family mansion in East Hampton, New York. By the time filmmakers find them, the mansion is falling apart, and women, 78 and 56, are living in a squalid room. The elder Eddie Beale is Aunt Jackie Kennedy Onassis, and the youngest is her cousin. Initially, women were going to be evicted from the house because of his decrepit state, but Jackie sent them money for repairs so that they could live there. <br /> <br /> Sometimes this film may seem exploitative, since none of the women seems to be in better mental health, but in other cases, the film is difficult to look away. “Little,” Edie blames her mother for her current state, and her mother replies that Edie will never succeed, which she thought was about. “Little” Edie often seems locked in the past, focused on the choices she made decades ago, and likes to show pictures from her youth, where she was clearly a great debutante. Her mother seems more humble about her fate to live the rest of her life in terrible conditions. There are certain hints of a glamorous life that both women once led, from paintings depicting a happy family to a gorgeous portrait of the older Edie near her bed. From what we see in the house, most of the rooms in it are empty, the walls are cracking and crumbling, and “Little” Edie leaves food in the attic so that the raccoons can eat. And, of course, numerous cats run around. <br /> <br /> In essence, this documentary is incredibly sad. Although no woman looks particularly depressed by her fate in life, the poverty in which they live is absolutely terrible. It is not entirely clear whether there is even a water supply system in the house, and you have the impression that they were essentially abandoned by their family. <br /> <br /> However, as a documentary, a film is a miracle that can be seen and strongly recommended.
