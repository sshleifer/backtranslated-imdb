As a lover of bad movies, I definitely got to this list. The plot is actually not so bad, but there are a few cases where you really need to ask yourself "what the hell is going on here?" <br /> <br /> There are a lot of things that make this the funniest bad movie ever First of all, Rudy Ray Moore became so fat and slow when this film was shot that the special effects are to speed up the fighting scenes twice. There are also scenes where there is slow-motion instant replay jumping onto a ten-foot-high wall (playing, falling from it back), naked men coming out of huge letters, and sex, which literally brings down the roof . <br /> <br /> Of course, no Rudy Ray Moore film would be complete without a completely unreasonable and random scene of the comedy club, where Rudi makes fun of all the customers interacting with people performing strange dances. There are so many bad things in this movie, but they are bad entertainment, and if you digress from the movie, you can skip another mistake. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10 for the actual value, 10/10 for the cheese factor, 10/10 for selecting errors and folly, averages 7/10.
