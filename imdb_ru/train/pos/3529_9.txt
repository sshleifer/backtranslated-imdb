Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is unjustly accused of killing his unfaithful wife. That night, when she was killed, he was absent with a mysterious woman who refused to give him her name. After being charged with murder, the police visit all the places where he was with her, but people only remember how he was alone. He is sentenced to death, and his secretary (Ella Raines) intends to find the murderer herself, because she loves him. <br /> <br /> This was done as Universal's B film (look at the cast - all the characters are actors) and one star, Franchot Ton, at sunset). The budget was small, and the actors were mostly unknown, but one of the best movie stars of the 1940s came out. He is a great director Kurt Siodmak and has a fantastic script taken from the excellent book by William Irish (pen name Cornell Woolrich). He moves fast and looks fantastic. And there is the infamous jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr., who just comes out of the screen with incredible sexual energy (I'm surprised that the censors didn't cut it). <br /> <br /> There are only a few flaws that prevent it from being perfect. Tone gives terrible performance. He looks awful and he is just awful. Also Curtis is tough and soft, like Henderson. You really wonder why Raines loves him - he is so impassive. But Raines is pretty good in the lead. She is beautiful and full of life. Also, the last scene, when the killer pursues her, never rings true. It is unlikely that he is a physical threat, and her reactions seem to be overpriced. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I put 9 points. Great movie - flaws aside.
