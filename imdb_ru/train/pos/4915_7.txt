And a rather unexpected storyline is for that era: there is a plague in the city of New Orleans, and only Richard Widmark can stop it! Objects of the brand Elia Kazan: embankments, workers, crowds, fugitives, people in blue collars, violence on the alley - all this is demonstrated here. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance is very effective as an ice bandit for the Big Score, Zero Mostel in the role of Dom Delouise is somewhat erroneous, but, of course, watchable as his lover. I liked Barbara Bel Geddes as a strong, tough wife â€” I thought she and Widmark were a believable couple. <br /> <br /> He himself always reminds me of Sinatra - in the face and quietly - and this is meant as a compliment, if anything. I have never heard of this movie, and yes, you should admire Widmark's play. I also enjoyed Paul Douglas - he seemed to play this role many times, they make up an unlikely but effective team. <br /> <br /> The plague itself - McGaffin - and you should know that this is not quite the way it would have been. I was in real life - rather small, at least not? - but I discovered that he is leading the story perfectly. <br /> <br /> Check it out. Good. *** get out ****
