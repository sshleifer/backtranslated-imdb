I liked this great movie. Farrah Fawcett has played a phenomenal role with a kind heart. She plays a woman who is forced to take extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after being attacked by a stranger. After the police have been rejected, she realizes that she is alone. <br /> <br /> Once, when she is alone at home, a stranger breaks into her house and attacks her again. Not going to call the police or pull him out, she has to splash him in the eyes and put him in jail in her fireplace. <br /> <br /> I think you need to wake up on the laws of the earth. They are too easy for these criminals. The time has come for harsher punishments.
