This film is undervalued. I like it. It was really sweet and soulful. A family that struggles, but is not turned into a dysfunctional family, which is so typical of films today. The film did not have a problem with the fact that they have little money or they are Republican Dominicans, like Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Instead, the problem is that Victor is immature and must grow up. He does, slowly, towards the end of the film. He has ways, but it was a sincere attempt to move forward. His grandmother is very cute, and the scene in which a little boy throws her made me laugh the longest. Truly indie soul
