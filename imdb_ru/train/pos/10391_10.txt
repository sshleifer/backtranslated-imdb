The film very rarely appeals to viewers of all ages - to children for a wonderful narration and a beautiful, colorful performance, and for adults to a literate script, beautiful staging qualities, good casting of roles / acting skills and everything else. along with Ross's beautiful account. Two roughly modern films achieve this - “The Thief of Baghdad” (1940) and “The Adventures of Robin Hood” (1938). Some of the history of this production is exciting. This production, which began in England in the summer of 1939, moved to Hollywood and turned out to be a cover for British intelligence! Producer Alexander Korda was subsequently knighted in 1942. Here is a unique intersection of art, commerce and politics! By all means, provide a good disc of this film for your library!
