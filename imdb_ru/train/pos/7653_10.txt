A shot in the heart is beautiful. This brilliantly illustrates the plight of Gary Gimor, convicted of murder, which required death. The “Shot in the Heart” reveals the ordeal through which the Gilmore family passed, torn by hatred. This film is an incredible psychological study, and it is surprisingly depressing and uplifting. 10/10
