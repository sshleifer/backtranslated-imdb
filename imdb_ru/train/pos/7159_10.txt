The irresistible children's classic Louis Sachar is the same Disney as Freddy Krueger. It has killings, racism, disfigurement of the face and killer lizards. <br /> <br /> A carefully thought-out plot is a multi-layered, interconnected story that spans the story in order to uncover Stanley's own legacy and the secret behind the holes. He rushes from the lush greenery of Latvia to the camped Green Lake (hint: there is no lake and no greenery). <br /> <br /> Disney's first success so convincingly recreates the atmosphere of the novel - the design of the scenery is excellent and without gloss. Another plus in casting. Rising star Shea LaBuff (“Charlie's Angels 2”, “Greenlight Project”) may not be the fat boy of the book, but his attitude is correct and he is far from the usual pure hero. The rest of the cast is equally well filled: from Patricia Arquette as the robber of the Frontier schools bordering the bank to Henry Winkler as the father of Stanley. The downside is the pop soundtrack - the net marketing department - and in the end the mood goes to full volume.
