I originally reviewed this film on Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago, and blew it up. I suppose I called it "poor" and "turkey." Well, by most standards it's still a turkey. He has almost no production values, the fact that there is a small story, almost does not make sense, and the action is at the level of the game of the third class. Nonetheless, it has really grown on me over the years as a sort of classic of the camp. In fact, all the films directed by Todd Sheets had such an effect. In this regard, they are almost like Ed Wood: watch them again and again and identify broken lines, continuity errors (the same zombie, two different locations!) And other shortcomings. <br /> <br /> I will say so: Sheets is a very good guy, and although this is one of his first works is not so great, he became better. And I have to add that the only truly worthy actress / actress in the film is Casey Russia, although I may be biased because I went to school with her.
