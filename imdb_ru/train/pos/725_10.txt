Fascist Chef Miss Togar (Mary Voronova, which objective photographer Dean Candy lenses, as if she was ten feet tall) intends to make her high square completely square. Complications that challenge this goal in Riff Randell's amazing rock and roll (PJ Soles, who lights up the screen - she has a hot body too), who is an obsessive fan of the punk band THE RAMONES. Pal Kate Rambeau (Day Young, whose big spectacled glasses and boring role can't hide her amazing beauty) joins forces with Riff to put an end to the predicted crisis of rock and roll killing forever, which is Togar's desired mission. /> <br /> Vincent Van Patten plays the funny role of Tom Roberts, who succeeded in everything but found guilty. Kate is crazy about Tom ... if only she can pull her head out of the sand and see it. Clint Howard steals the film almost (honestly, who can steal this film from Soles?) Like Eaglebauer, the “supplier” who can get almost everyone. His office is in the boy's restroom! Paul Barthel is also cheerful as a music teacher who becomes an ally of Riff when he likes the RAMONES concert. <br /> <br /> A loud romp in high school that challenges all normal norms ... and I liked it. It’s as if someone just says: "Let's make life more fun for an hour and a half." The film is really anarchy ... chaotic chaos, lovingly adoring RAMONES with all my heart (even if they are terrible actors, they have the opportunity to get a new audience with this film). <br /> <br /> The ending largely sums up the film as a whole .. Riff and her classmates capture high school, and one mass party begins. Honestly, I didn't want the party to end! In any case, not a common thing, this film simply breaks up the madness. Accompanied by a magnificent rock soundtrack with some of THE RAMONES best songs, this film allows the viewer to take time in life when war did not dominate the headlines and people just had a good time. These were the days.
