Josef von Sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about silent Hollywood and the former imperial general to the tsar of Russia who appeared there. Emil Jennings received the honored Oscar, in particular, for his role as a general, who, ironically, plays a significant role in the silent picture of a Russian general. The film recalls his days in Russia, which led to the fall of the country on revolutionaries. William Powell debuts on the big screen as a Hollywood film director who played Jennings in his film. The film serves as an interesting look at the fall of Russia and the imitation of backstage Tinseltown in the early days. Von Sternberg offers another classic filled with great elements of romance, intrigue and tragedy.
