The film is very full of what it is, constantly being interested in memories of childhood and growing up with such a strange father, and interspersing it with the tails of a serial murder, you can’t just make a mistake. The plot itself, the story itself and the essence of the film are interesting. This is the story with which the director (Bill Paxton) could do a lot, and in this case he really did a lot with it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, you continue to expect more and more about what is happening and where the film is going, and the creative potential behind this story is first-rate. I felt as though this film was delicately made from beginning to end, and one of those rare gems that seemed to have no boring sleep - the action flows neatly, quickly and closely from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> This shows how far people can go: to do such terrible things with their loved ones and do such atrocities in the name of “God” when they are disappointed, as in this case. Sometimes it is also interesting for its "bends and views" on the concept of morality in general. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a film that is easy to miss, but I would recommend you not to do the same. and check out this movie - it is very worth your time.
