However, Crazy is being compared with Spinal Tap, since both are comedies about R & R groups. In fact, the similarities end here, because Still Crazy is much better written and played out, while the Spinal Tap script turns into a trifle because of the slightly funny first 10 minutes, which makes Beavis and Butthead sophisticated in comparison. Still Mad is a formula, but the sympathy of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some of the musical numbers for me have managed to compensate for the a priori predictability of the film. People who expect an assassination attempt similar to Spinal Tap would have been disappointed with the film's carefree nature, but I would undertake the successful self-ironic Still Crazy joke for a pompous but unsuccessful satire shot called Spinal Tap.
