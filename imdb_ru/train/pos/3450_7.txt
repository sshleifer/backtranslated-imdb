Having never heard of this movie until I saw a rolling DVD, I was a bit skeptical, in the past there were a lot of films with good ensemble roles that can do nothing, shooting a bad script, and in some cases, it seems no concern. <br /> <br /> Well, just by looking at it, there was no reason not to show this film in cinemas, that's good. A story similar to the majority in this genre can sometimes seem a bit intrusive, but even here, there seems to be a lot of realism that allows you to maintain momentum. I was pleasantly surprised at how well Justin Timberlake copes here with such an important role, well, he is not yet Oscar material, but he will learn with every role, and he shows a LOT of promises for the future here. Dylan McDermott was surprisingly good in his unexpectedly unpleasant role and is definitely the perfect figure in this film. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, just try. you will not be disappointed, you will not be bored, in fact, I think you will be more than satisfied with the end result.
