Red Rock West is one of those hard noir thrillers that we rarely see. This is a good pace, good actions and does not leave us with weak ends or unanswered questions that are typical for this genre. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage plays a major role, as Michael, an unemployed Texan unemployed, desperate enough to work to lead up to Wyoming for potential employment. He is honest through his fault, but always on the dark side of fate. <br /> <br /> Having failed to get paid work, Michael stumbles at the Red Rock Bar, where owner Wayne (J.T. Walsh) takes him for a contract killer he called from Dallas, hired to work in his beautiful but deadly wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). <br /> <br /> Wayne gives Michael the necessary details and the advance payment for hitting the adulterous Suzy. Without intent to trace, Michael takes the money and then is going to warn Susanna about her impending demise. He also sends a letter to the local sheriff exposing the conspiracy and splits. <br /> <br /> As fate dictates, Michael is not going to get rid of the situation so easily. Leaving in a heavy downpour, he escapes on Susanna's lover. Of course, Michael, being Michael, takes him to a local hospital, where it turns out that he was also shot. <br /> <br /> The sheriff is called, and, with luck, Wayne is also a local law. Michael manages to escape when he is taken on the last trip, and subsequently picked up by the real “Lyle of Dallas”, played with a deadly glee by the bizarre Dennis Hopper. Upon learning that they are fellow marines, Lyle insists that Michael join him for a drink at the Red Rock Bar. There, Wayne realizes his mistake, and soon he and Lyle pursue Michael, who willingly falls into Susanna’s arms while waiting. <br /> <br /> As the pace accelerates, we learn that Wayne and Suzanne are indeed wanted by armed robbers. escape for theft of several million dollars. Receiving money is now becoming the center of attention of films with a series of betrayals, double crosses and murders. <br /> <br /> The film was very well played. Nicolas Cage, as a rule, was restrained, Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Boli performed their roles with more than sufficient abilities. The best performance was by the end of J.T. Walsh, who was threatening, not being. Walsh was a great actor who left us too early. <br /> <br /> A lot of unique perspectives were used in the photos of Mark Reshoskis, which added to the tension and development of the plot. The film was further enhanced by the strict directorial style of John Dahl and the quick editing of the fire of Morris Chestnut.
