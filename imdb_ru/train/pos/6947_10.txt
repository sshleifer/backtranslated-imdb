24 best TV show !!!!! This is an incredible series with incredible tension, great stories and unforgettable characters. And the first episode of all is my best proof. Because this is only the first episode, only the intro, and you got hooked on the plot, constant turns. <br /> <br /> Jack Bower is a federal agent who has been appointed to protect Senator David Palmer. He cannot trust anyone because people from the GTU can be involved. And when these events happened, his daughter: Kimberly runs away from the house to a party. But ... <br /> <br /> At the end of the episode, you want to watch more, more and more. <br /> <br /> This is only the first lot, and this is great.
