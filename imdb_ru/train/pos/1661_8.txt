(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> while historical accuracy may be questionable ... (and with the mass appeal of inaccurate LOTR ... such things are now easier to excuse) I liked his skill Although in reality it is not an art house film. This from time to time gives some emotionally charged scenes. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints. 1. It is too short. and 2. the voice that you hear from time to time is not explained. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Playable: 5/10
