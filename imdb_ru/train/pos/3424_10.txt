The information contained in this film is familiar to many who have recently paid attention to the news. The scandals with Walter Reed show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job caring for our wounded heroes when they return. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film shows further is true, common to all wars. The psychological trauma suffered by soldiers during the war, and the difficulties they face, returning to peaceful life. They are not just changed or affected, they are different people, and most of them do not know how to deal with it, because they themselves do not know. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film shows what the military does to our womenâ€™s young people in preparing them for war and the policies and practices that they must follow in pursuing the war, which leads to all trauma. <br /> <br /> We have over 3,000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion; but we have many tens of thousands of people who will suffer from physical and psychological trauma throughout their lives because of this war. No matter which side you are on, you need to know the cost of war to decide whether we should be in this business. This film beautifully illustrates the costs for men and women.
