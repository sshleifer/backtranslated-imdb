I have seen this movie more than once. It was on a par with many creepy things that were then shown in television films. The only problem I encountered was with the name for obvious reasons ... I immediately recall Drake's famous snack cake! Leaving the first part, "Hell Dogs" would be enough. <br /> <br /> Richard Krenne always manages to bring a sense of seriousness into everything he does, in any case - is it good or bad. But it was a nice Halloween fare offered by the CBS network. I liked the part where Krenna flies to some unknown country to find a mystic who will help him defeat the evil beast. He asks the taxi driver how to find this guy. Excellent dialogue between a taxi driver and Krenna from the point of view of a taxi driver who rejects the ethnic beliefs of his people. “Oh, Mr. Barry, I left these things behind when I came down from the mountains ...” - referring to a mystic who rarely sees or advises people, and no one knows how to actually contact him. <br /> <br /> As regards supernatural fare, this film is still enjoyable.
