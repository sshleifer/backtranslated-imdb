I first saw this completely exciting documentary in its original release back in 2001, and it really had a deep impact on me, so much so that I picked up a few of my friends to see it with me at reruns. Bottom line: none of my friends left disappointed (never!). This star film tells about the Scottish conceptual artist Andy Goldsworthy, who creates absolutely beautiful works of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, stones, etc.) to create objects that ultimately return to their natural form ( statement in a temporary state of all?). We will see how Goldsworthy creates several works of temporary art, as well as some of his long-term installations in major galleries around the world, as well as several objects in the natural world. German director Thomas Riedelsheimer (Thomas Riedelsheimer) directs, photographs and edits this meditation about the creative process, which is a real pleasure for the eyes and ears (with the surrounding music, compiled and performed by Fred Frit, whose music is usually acute experimental / noise textured) guitar, as well as a talented musicians ensemble). Although this film has been available on DVD for several years, if you can find a cinema that underlines the revival of this beautiful film, definitely find it (this is an easy film that was written for a large screen, with an experienced sound system to truly experience this film). Not rated MPAA, but does not contain anything that could offend (if the live birth of a sheep on the screen is not intended to offend or disturb)
