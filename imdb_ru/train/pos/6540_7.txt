Honestly, I had to watch this film backwards, did not expect so much, but, hey, I was not deceived, I had a good time. <br /> <br /> I would say that this film is a fresh breeze, despite some facts that they tried to modernize Nancy Drew, but it made me recall these youth films of the 60-70s from Europe and Quebec, where they manage to communicate with adult children. In this case, a 16-year-old teenager is trying to pay homage, trying to unravel the mystery of the death of the actress, who died 25 years ago. In any case, since her father was doing business in Hollywood, why not rent a house with a puzzle behind the doors? Well, at least Emma Roberts does an excellent job here. Kind of like a plump kid who is initially naively forced to support his sister's pranks in front of Nancy, but in the end he finds Nancy cool enough to stay with her, even with her questions ... <br /> <br /> gorgeous, and was glad to see Rachel Lee Cook in a different role: this time a single mother (she did it in Family Rescue, but this time she plays a mature woman ...) In any case, don donâ€™t leave it, it's fun !
