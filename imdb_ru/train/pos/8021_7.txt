Muppet’s third film is perhaps the most relaxed and enjoyable: the gang brings its modest musical to college on the bright (but unstable) lights of Broadway, filled with typically naive optimism. Of course, their first attempt failed, and Kermit (the band leader and show author) exploded; therefore, all the others went their separate ways so that he would not have to feel responsible for them. Kermit himself befriended a young fashion designer who made ends meet by serving food at his father’s diner (the old man, thus, has a line in particularly meandering nonsexuals!). We get the usual cameo roles in the film from different stars: Art Carney (as a producer), James Coco (as an overly zealous dog owner), Dabney Coleman (as a deceiver of trust), Elliot Gould (who was also in MUPPET MOVIE [1979]), Gregory Hines, Lisa Minnelli (as herself, replacing his portrait in a stylish restaurant with Kermit's elegant sports mustache, as a supposedly renowned entrepreneur in a ruse to draw attention to the Muppets show), Brooke Shields, and even director John Landis (possibly in the most amusing the scene of the film as a Broadway producer, units which appears Kermit playing street, friendly and funny clothes and wig afro!). Other dolls more or less undergo their typical tempo, with (unfortunately) the smaller space allotted to Gonzo this time; while Miss Piggy has acquired something with me, scenes in which the latter is spying for what she considers Kermit to be with the waitress ?? and especially her violent reaction to it ?? indisputably ridiculous. What is disappointing, however, is in itself a climate show (after a rather redundant middle where Kermit gets amnesia and eventually gets an advertisement on Madison Avenue), which, unlike the expected dirty procedures, gives nothing more original, than Kermit's wedding ceremony and its eternal flame Miss Piggy!
