Guys and dolls should be one of my favorite music films ever. This is a very funny movie, and nothing more to watch. it embodies what people forgot about musicals - musicals were created to entertain, not to preach. We currently have Rent and Chicago, which are great musicals and good movies, but they don't bring us fun entertainment without any conditions. The only thing that bothered me about the film was Marlon Brando, the guy can't sing! It was very unpleasant to listen to how he sings and talks when I could not understand him. If it were not for Marlon, I would give these 10 stars. Guys and dolls provide old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days. Watch it have a good time!
