They did it. And boy, they made it fantastic or whatever! The BBC finally brought the Doctor back to our screens on Saturday night, where he is! And they did it with style! <br /> <br /> EPISODE ONE: “Rose” is one of the strengths of the new series - Russell T Davis as a writer and executive producer. He is a fan of the show and knows what other fans want, but he is also an experienced writer himself, so he knows what other people want. Another strong point, as beautifully shown here in this first episode, is Billie Piper and her character Rose Tyler. Finally, the Doctor’s companion gains a credible history and strong character. It is also nice to see the return of Autons - a good allusion to the Classic series. <br /> <br /> EPISODE SECOND: “The End of the World” - at the beginning of this double counting, to show the TARDIS strengths, we end up in a story where special effects are all! Now they have the technology to create real, believable environments and monsters - no more rubber suits! Also, hints at the end of this episode about the past of the new Doctor are very intriguing to kill all the Time Lords and make him the only one. <br /> <br /> EPISODE THIRD: “Restless Dead” - We We had a future, now let's have a past. The first episode, not written by Davis, is a bit flat in some places, but this is compensated by Charles Dickens Simon Callow and the unexpected plot twist, when it turns out that pathetic Gelf is not so pathetic at all ... <br />> Episode four: " Aliens from London ”- the consequences of the Doctor’s actions are fully disclosed in this series, not least with the consequences of Rose’s escape with him. In addition, we have our first cliffhanger; not the best of them admittedly. Slitheen is an interesting villain, although they may look too CGI for their own good. <br /> <br /> FIFTH EPISODE: “The Third World War”. The second part of this story about Slitheen suffers mainly from the same problems from the first. In addition, the clips from the next episode, coming out at the end of the current episode, annoy and spoil it to people. <br /> <br /> EPISODE SIX: “Far away” - Yes! We had a future, past and present, but now we got to the good - the return of the arch-enemy of the Doctor. Here I think that we can complement Christopher Ecclestone - he was great as a Doctor, and no more than that, in this episode where we see pain on his face when he remembers the War of Time and his alien nature, when he almost turns into Delek himself. <br /> <br /> EPISODE SEVENTH: “The Long Game” is really only a story that will become the prologue to the series finale. Saved by Simon Pegg as a smart editor and Tamsin Grieg in a funny cameo. The media controls us - it has never been done before, is it ... <br /> <br /> EPISODE Eighth: Father's Day is a great episode. Full of human emotions and heartache for Rose, and the true consequences of what happens when you really mess up the story. Billie Piper's full score is here. <br /> <br /> EPISODE Nine: “Empty Child” - I do not find this child very scary. Sorry, but I'm not. Although it is a good episode, the climber could still be better - those are the “Next time” bits that spoil them. John Barrowman is presented here as Captain Jack, a dashing swindler - he is a good actor who has been here for a while, but only now seemed to notice him. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TEN: "Doctor's dances" - part two of this History of the Second World War - very well done in a historical context. A good optimistic finale, although perhaps a bit confusing for young viewers, when is the “Mummy” revealed? <br /> <br /> EPISODE ELEVEN: "The City of Boom" is perhaps the weakest of the series, but this does not mean that it is bad. A good return to Slitin, as well as an interesting study of the characters of the Doctor and Rose. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWELVE: “Bad Wolf” - it starts off pretty silly, with good-natured humor and daring fun making on popular television shows above her in Blighty. However, things quickly become deadly serious, and the revelation at the end is the best cliffhanger in the series! <br /> <br /> EPITODE TRITIN: “Parting” - goodbye, Christopher Ecclestone. A fantastic Doctor in many ways, David Tennant must really work out his socks to be as good as he is. The regeneration scene at the end is beautifully played. Oh, and the Daleks are back - to extremes! God bless CGI, because they can never do it normally! <br /> <br /> Overall - great! 9/10
