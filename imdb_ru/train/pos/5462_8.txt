First of all, if you plan to watch this, be sure to look at the UNCUT version (although it is very interesting to go back and then watch scenes that were faked because of censorship), this has a HUGE difference. This film is about a young woman played by Barbara Stenvik, who, from the age of 14, was forced into prostitution from her own father. When her father suddenly passes away, she herself can go out into the world. After reading Nietzsche's philosophy about life, she uses her sexuality to manipulate men, giving her what she wants, and leaves them in ruins and desperately needs her love. Throughout the film, she becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative, and viewers are beginning to wonder if she has any sense of morality at all. In general, Baby Face is a very shocking film with blatant scenes of sexuality that most people don’t expect to see in a black and white movie. Although sexual acts are clearly not shown on the screen, it is clear what is happening behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this film, and I believe that the majority of modern viewers will get at least some pleasure, especially with the impact value of films. While watching, I really thought that in parts the rhythm seemed a bit slow, but I think that in most films the first time is to see them. In fact, I think that in almost all the films I saw that were shot in the early 30s, there were some problems with the rhythm or some parts just didn’t quite flow right. Was it probably just the filmmaking craft that was still not completely refined ?? it only takes a few years. Compare the film of 1939 and compare it with the film of the early 30s, and I think you will understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> Once again, I am very glad that I could watch the original film; it really makes a big difference. Also, all John Wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this film before he becomes famous in an uncharacteristic role.
