The trailer for this film did not do justice. And although the film did not know what he really wanted to convey, the first part of the film was a light, romantic comedy, and the second was a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than I thought. be. This film was more like a date movie, but the trailer turned it into an action movie that never worked. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course, I am biased, but this film turned out to be an easy, sensitive, albeit somewhat strange film that deserved better. Three out of four stars. 9/5/02.
