Together with Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was the iconic villain of Colombo. The very first "correct" episode of "Colombo", which followed the two autonomous pilots, "Murder by the book", is far from the classical status. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, one of the murder mystery partners. , His partner Jim is talented, while Ken has no other talent other than talent and ability to promote books. As soon as Jim decided that he no longer needed Ken's marketing skills, Ken plotted to kill Jim. Except that this is not a new storyline, this is actually a real-life implementation of the murder story originally intended for one of their books. <br /> <br /> Colombo did not take long to realize that Ken is a murderer, although, unfortunately, another murder must occur (Ken is removed in novels and then kills a key witness) before Colombo has enough evidence for conviction. <br /> <br /> There’s nothing wrong with Killing by the Book, but it’s not. pretty first class. I would just give Publish Or Perish an advantage over this: both episodes tell about Jack Cassidy and the world of publishing, but Publish Or Perish is a bit more intense and unpredictable. But this is still a great episode.
