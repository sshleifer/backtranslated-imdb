The Williams family lives on a ranch located in the middle of a remote desert. They end up in great danger when a place suddenly finds itself in a whirlpool of time, where past, present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable way. Directed by John "Bad" Cardos, the film begins with a mysterious, mysterious note and gradually allows things to become stranger, crazy and more exciting as the stupid story unfolds. In addition, Cardos fills the screen with a variety of gorgeous visual effects and does a good job of creating a genuine sense of fear and surprise. The delightfully sincere play of the cast qualifies as another major plus: Jim Davies as the heartfelt patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his merry wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as a caring Richard, Marcy Lafferty as his beloved wife Bet, Natasha Ryan as sweet baby girl Jenny and Scott K. Colden as the bold Steve. Cool special effects offer an inspirational combination of dark miniatures, neat animated monsters that stop moving (such creatures include a tiny, hairless guy, a big, puffy, fanged beast and a skinny lizard) and elegant matte pictures. Richard Bendâ€™s orchestral orchestral score is truly amazing. John Arthur Morrill's clear, sunny cinematography also does the job. Cheerful click.
