I remember watching Gong Ho when I was a child with my mother, and wondered why she always cried in the last few minutes. I, of course, found the whole movie cheerful, especially the manners of the characters. It was only when I got much older and watched him again, did I realize how much deeper this show really is. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton and Hedda Watanabe play the role of reluctant middlemen. Keaton ceases to amaze me with his real style of linear delivery, and Watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix. I also thought that Patti Yasutake (Umeki) was just great in his role as a comic. <br /> <br /> I think this film is one of the most underrated films of the 80s. We can all learn a lesson from the merger of American and Japanese workers in this film ... sometimes you really * can * have "the best of both worlds." And now I understand why my mother felt the same as in those final moments. I would also prefer one of these machines.
