Every child is experiencing a growing trauma, and the active imagination of each child has received the best of them, but for Jake (Anthony De Marco from Clint Eastwood's upcoming “CHANGE” - similar to Henry Thomas around 1982), the combination can be deadly. <br /> <br /> A lonely six-year-old boy, whose imagination is gaining momentum when he is depressed, to recognize his quarreling parents, Peter (Shawn Bridger, deceased from “DEADWOOD”) and Jules (Brooke Bloom, “CBS: Miami”) ) suddenly decided to divorce, leaving him alone and freeing the new tenant ?? zombies in his closet. <br /> <br /> Jake plants this seed while playing with his neighbor's friend Dillon (Matthew Josten), who gives him a printout of frequently asked questions about zombies from the Internet. Jake is so sure that someone wants to get it ?? and his family ?? he begins to develop a plan of action to protect them before it is too late. <br /> <br /> Independent rookie Shelly Ryan ?? who wrote and sent ?? mixes the home drama with the background of horror, but the first (clever) outweighs the second, with a decent story supported by a subtle game (De Marco is a rare breed of a child actor where he is a CHILD, not an actor) - all its nuances are very obvious that it is clumsy , a shy, reticent child, with whom many can also communicate (I, of course, I can.) Bridgers makes his deceptive husband empathetic in the understanding that he really loves his son, while Bloom has a more difficult job of building sympathy as somewhat inadequate oh mother who is quick in emotions because of rationality? it doesn't help when Dillon Ruth's mother (Monett Magrath, similar to Laura Dern) constantly transmits her hidden information, driving a wedge between Jake and his father. Magrath also has the difficult task of making her manipulative the character is relatively pleasant, but in the exponential scene she proves that I will not go into details, but she will show why she is what she is (and more importantly, how she also influenced her own child). <br /> <br/> The Fillmmaker subjective camera is also well used (many of the corners shown form Jake's POV at waist level or somewhat distorted; that is, an inverted shot of how Peter carried his son in the same pose while having fun in the backyard) and editing is relatively impeccable. <br /> <br /> Ryan based the scenario on the personal experience of growing up, as well as first-hand testimony of how a friend is going through the same situation and how the consequences of relationships with adults can be harmful if they cause their fears. , anger and stress their children. Here the film very well clarifies its theme. <br /> <br /> However, the basics of horror are a bit divided, if not more, but a tribute to the zombie films of George A. Romero with love shows Ryan (Jake's mom). he sleeps in front of the TV, as the NIGHT OF THE LIVE DEATH does not roll, causing his own belief that the undead are in their home). The metaphor of a monster acting as a surrogate for domestic violence may be a bit harsh, but again, the child’s fear of being under his bed is universal.
