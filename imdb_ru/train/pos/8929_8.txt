First of all, I really liked the central idea of ​​placing “intruders”, Others in a fragile “I”, at different levels - mostly subconscious, but sometimes more paradoxical. In fact, the attackers are omnipresent in the film: on the Swiss-French border, where the main character leads a solitary life; in his repetitive dreams and nightmares; in a diseased body after a heart transplant ... In the second half of the film, he himself becomes a violator, returning to an ancient French colony hoping to atone for the past. <br /> <br /> The general tone is rather bitter than miserable, full of regrets and guilt, the feeling of failure is more or less dominant. This is a rather gloomy picture of old age, supposedly independent, but hopelessly empty and lonely inside. The director arranges the images in order to convey the fleeting sensations of anxiety and desire, and not any obvious meanings. Some of them are fascinating, not without humor, although this is a kind of absurd game that only a somnambulist can present.
