I also experienced a very painful personal loss (twice), and this film very well depicts the painful reality of this experience: “Life is out of balance, nothing makes sense, good intentions are relatives, etc.” <br /> <br / > It was nice to see Ellie again. She is one of my favorite movie actors. <br /> <br /> I laughed and cried when the story unfolded. Great story and cast. Well done!
