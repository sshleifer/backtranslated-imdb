I enjoyed watching this movie on TCM and watching the very young William Powell (Philo Vance) playing the detective just like he played with Peaceful Loy in the "Thin Man Series". Back in the 1930s, William Powell played in the series “Philo Vance,” and in this film the famous veteran actress Mary Astor (Hilda Lake) becomes one of the suspects in the murder / suicide case when a man named Archer Coe (Robert Barro )) was found dead, and Archer was in a room that was locked from the inside. Ralph Morgan, (Raymond Wrede / Secretary of Archer) gave a big supporting role and was the brother of Frank Morgan, who appeared in "The Wizard of Oz" in 1939. Eugene Palitra, (Detective Sergeant Heath), appeared in quite a few of these Filonov Vance Films, and also gave an excellent presentation in Robin Hood with Errol Flynn. Always remember that the least likely actor may well be the killer. Enjoy great classics from the past.
