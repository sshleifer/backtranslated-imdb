This film is a true reflection of the Australian ingenuity that was required to make this country what it is for the last 200 years. Not pompous as the British, not Gong-Ho, like the Americans. If one of these countries tried to do what this crew did, it would fail. Either because of ignorance from the British side, or because of too much faith in the superior firepower from the American side. “True” Australians (that is, not importing) are the only ones who can succeed in modern military conflicts because they had to improvise most of their adult life. Just look at examples such as Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
