FLOATING MAN ... the tragic victim of the space race, he died. MELTING ... never realizing that the race was LONG PASSED ... a cooker. But instead of shouting something that a NORMAL person would shout, he shouts something like “AAAAATCH-KAH !!” This film that you hit ... is no ordinary movie. You have just taken your first step towards the Incredible Floating Man, the famous film about the blood of the late 70s, which shows the wonderful effects of Rick Baker's makeup. Baker was on the verge of becoming a superstar, and did it at the same time as his famous "alien cantines" in Star Wars. For some strange reason, Star Wars has become a household word, and INCREDIBLE SWOATING is not. <br /> <br /> This may have something to do with the fact that this film is just awfully awful. From the opening credits (“Starring Alex Arbar as an INCREDIBLE FLOATING MAN” ... this is really what he says!) This film provides many, many moments of sheer incomprehensibility. "Why are they ... but why is he ... why are they ...?" After a while, you stop wondering why you are watching what it is - a very interesting piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> Astronaut returns to Earth in a melting, radioactive state; he runs away, and his mind, like his body, disintegrates, begins to melt insanely and kill the fun. The authorities quickly decide that the melting person must be stopped, but (probably, not wanting to “cause panic”) they want to be caught as quietly as possible. Therefore, they send one guy with a Geiger counter behind him. Wow. <br /> <br /> Fabulous, surprisingly little happens during the film. A melting guy wanders around, killing people. The doctor is looking for him with a Geiger counter. Different characters are introduced, ask questions and leave. In the end, the doctor catches up with the melting man, but the guard shoots him for no reason, after he explains that he is “Dr. Ted Nelson.” The melting person moves away and finally dissolves in a large puddle of mucus. The end. <br /> <br /> This is so brainless that the result is a lot of fun, despite the rather sad ending. Presumably, it is planned to release a widescreen DVD. Very special movie.
