This film captures the essence of growing up in a small American town for a young girl. The realism and subtle nuances offered by the character of Ashley Judd, Ruby, the plot line, reflect what can only be described as a plausible environment in Florida’s daily life. From the slam of the screen door to the lack of work, the echoes of what life really looks like on the “Riviera with red necks” give the young girl a hard choice. Paradise was not easy. But she slowly overcomes obstacles and deception and learns to be her own woman whose power flows from within. Ashley Judd's charming smile and infectious gait exude warmth and inspire respect and admiration. The careful pace of character development is reminiscent of "Gold Uli" in 1997 with Peter Fonda in the lead role, as well as director Victor Nunes.
