If Doctor Caligari's Cabinet is the father of all horror films (and German expressionist films), this film before World War I is a grandfather. A title student hungry in an empty attic makes a deal with the devil - the devil gives him a bottomless bag of gold in exchange for "something in this room." The devil chooses the reflection of the student in his mirror. He leaves with the studentâ€™s double who commits the crimes of which the student is accused. <br /> <br /> The film is clouded by certain limitations arising from the technically primitive state of filmmaking in 1913; the plot appeals to the effects of Kiaroshchuro, but the film, of necessity, is almost entirely shot in a shadowless daylight. But the scene in which the reflection is reflected from the mirror still gives impetus. <br /> <br /> More interesting for the trends he preaches than on his own, the Student of Prague is still standing.
