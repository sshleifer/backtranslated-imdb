I felt obliged to watch the 1983 Jane Eyre adaptation of Timothy Dalton / Seela Clark because I just wrote an article on Jane Eyre for the 2006 BBC for TheScreamOnline. <br /> <br /> So, I I went to see how I was doing my homework. <br /> <br /> At first I was annoyed. The lighting in this version is bad. All / all are blurred by the bright white light of the clique, which in some scenes casts shadows on the wall behind the characters. <br /> <br /> And the sound is poorly recorded. It seemed to me that I was listening to a school play. <br /> <br /> And the pancake makeup is too heavy. <br /> <br /> And the scenery does not fully convey the gothic mood. the novel. They are too fussy too Martha Stewart. I just don’t see Rochester Bronte honoring Martha Stewart’s home arrangements. Rochester Orson Welles lived in a cave darkness, very much in keeping with the gothic mood of the novel. <br /> <br /> And yet ... with all these objections ... not only this is the best "Jane Eyre", I I saw that this could be the best adaptation of any novel I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> This “Jane Eyre”, despite its technical flaws, gave me a feeling of reading “Jane” Eyre ”for the first time. <br /> <br /> Critics of this play say that it is too close to the book For me, a person who appreciated the book and did not need it to be less “wordy”, less “Christian” or more sexual, loyalty to this version of Bronte’s novel is in fact its best advantage. <Br /> <br Bronte wrote a damn good book. There is a reason why it lasted more than 150 years, while others, more pleasant, with Sexual and light texts disappeared. <br /> <br /> As a longtime fan of Jane Eyre, I was prejudiced against Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Rochester is not known to be handsome; Jane and Rochester are famous ugly literature couple. And Timothy Dalton is nothing short of amazingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> But Dalton in the role of Rochester shows a fascinating performance. He just blew me away. I have never seen anything like his loyalty to the role, text, dialogue and love of Rochester for Jane. . Dalton brings Rochester to the quivering life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Rochester should be a bit scary. Dalton is scary. Wells also received a terrible streak, for example, when he cried "Stop it!" after Fontaine plays a short piano piece. But Dalton scares more than once here. You really can't tell if he is going to hurt Jane or himself, in his desperation. <br /> <br /> The power of Rochester, his humor, his rage, his vulnerability: Dalton conveys everything, sometimes seconds. This is amazing. <br /> <br /> And the main thing: an actor playing the role of Rochester, I must say that he spent more than ten years of his life in complete despair, lonely, living with an ugly, life-destroying secret. <br /> <br /> No other actor I’ve seen tried to convey in this part a black hole of despair, as Timothy Dalton does. The current favorite fan of Toby Stevens is not even trying. Dalton beats him out of the park. If I had seen Timothy Dalton play Rochester in a solitary bar, I would say: “This guy is a problem. Don't even look at him. ” He is so radioactive that agony torments him. <br /> <br /> Zella Clark is not only the best Jane I've ever seen, but also one of the few Jane the producers wanted to play when the book plays Jane. No, the guys who know “Jane Eyre” only according to the version of 2006, Bronte * did not * describe the stately, strong Jane with thinly arched eyebrows and plump lips. Rather, Jane Charlotte Bronte is, indeed, poor, simple, unclear, and small, and NOT likable. <br /> <br /> Zela has a small mouth, close-set eyes and a bit of a nose. She is really "small." She is not a fashion model. And she is the best Jane, the most faithful book. <br /> <br /> Some have described it as cold or dull. No, she is faithful to the book. Jane Bronte is not a red-hot mother, she is a protected, disadvantaged teenager, whose inner passions manifest themselves only at key moments, as Zela does. Jane from the book is the one who needs to be looked at slowly, carefully, patiently, carefully, if you really want to dive into its depths. You have to watch Zelia to find out who she really is. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more fire in Zela in one key scene, but this is one scene from five o'clock in otherwise it is very good. <br /> <br /> Despite its proximity to the text, this version, like any other version I’ve seen, shies away from a full explanation of frankly Christian themes in “Jane”. Eyre. " Christianity is not an accidental subtext in Jane Eyre, it is central. <br /> <br /> Helen Burns teaches Jane Christianity, thus giving her a disruptive, countercultural way of reading and living a seemingly doomed, pinched life. This is Christianity and the Christian God, who convinces the poor, simple, obscure Jane in her equal value, in her need to conform to her ideals and in her rejection of the key marriage proposal. This is not fully clarified. <br /> <br /> In any case, Charlotte Bronte wrote an excellent, complex, rich novel, and its adaptation, of all that I saw, mines and honors, a novel, the best of all adaptations that I have ever seen, and it says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other versions that do not fully comply with this book are hard work to view in many places. If you do not care what Charlotte Bronte says about child abuse, or the hypocrisy of a culture based on appearance and money, your adaptation of most of the book will be that people will quickly pass to get to the kissing scenes between Jane and Rochester. <br /> <br /> This version, like the Bronte novel, understands that everything Bronte wrote about Jane's experience in Loud and her relationship with St. John is part of what makes Jane and Rochester’s relationship the same explosive and unforgettable as it is.
