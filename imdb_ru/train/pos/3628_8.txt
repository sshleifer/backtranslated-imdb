The film had many fundamental values ​​of family and love. He expressed human emotions and was an inspirational story. The script was clear (it was very easy to understand what made it ideal for children), and sometimes it was pleasant and humorous. There were several charged characters to search. Cinematography was acceptable. There was no point in experimenting with what many filmmakers did today (which, frankly, warns a little). It was clearly filmed, but it had a pleasant soft quality. While editing could be better, I thought it was a good movie for the whole family. And the organization of the information was simply thrown at you, which I didn’t like either, but on the whole it was a good movie.
