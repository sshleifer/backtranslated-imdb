It was one of the best films I've ever seen. The film tells about real life and how drugs can play an important role. Although this film seems to be made from a small budget, I found it exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> Some may not like the plot and say that the script lacks direction. However, when a person plunges into drugs as deeply as these characters, there is no direction to life. I feel that this film is an exact idea of ​​what can happen to a person if he faces extreme temptations. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors are new to the industry. However, they did a great job. It seems that everyone copes well with his work and accordingly enters into character. <br /> <br /> I think this film can be a good tool for communicating with a person or a loved one who uses drugs and seems to be gaining momentum. out of control. This film may just scare them to change their ways.
