This is, without doubt, my favorite novel, Le Carre, and it turns into a silver screen with all the love and care that you can wish for. I read the review on this site, which seems to find the characters disgusting, but I think this is not true. All Le Carre stories are, in fact, love stories, and this is no exception. This is an exact reflection of the period in which it is installed. Betrayal is the key to the good of all. Pima’s upbringing is so close to mine that I find him frightening to watch. Peter Egan is in his best role, and the late Ray Macanally is incredibly good. Even the smallest roles played by Andy de la Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are quite noticeable. This cast is the “Dream of Impresario”. The story should not be spoiled by a poorly informed description, but suffice it to say that it concerns the slow but inexorable destruction of a young man and his descent into espionage and betrayal. All my sympathies are with Magnus Pym and his only (not sexual) love for Poppy (Rüdiger Weigang is as wonderful as ever. His only true friendship, but also by definition another one in a long line of betrayals. OUTSTANDING! Love it.
