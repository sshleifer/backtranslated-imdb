“Come Undone” seems to evoke many opinions among the participants of this forum. Of course, this is a film that promises to look at gay life, as most viewers expect, and somehow it leaves this promise in an introspective look at the soul of a young man. The film has a way to stay with us, even when it's over. This study of the nature of how a young man enters into a love relationship with someone so different from him that in the end leaves Mathieu confused, offended and depressed when things are not as he hoped in a relationship. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen the movie yet, perhaps you should stop reading. <br /> <br /> Sebastien Lifshits, the director of the film, told his story Mathieu's point of view. Most viewers seem to be disorientated because of the different times in the film, but there are hints that, as you can see, are not obvious in retrospect. The story is told in memories that can add to the fact that some people will watch a movie. This is a story about Mathieu's doomed love for Cedric and the final destruction of their life together. <br /> <br /> First of all, Cedric, a handsome young local resident, pursues Mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him that he loves him. Mathieu feels attracted to Cedric. We understand how different the two young men are when Cedric tells the Mathieu family that he feels that the school is not for him. On the other hand, Mathieu, who wants to be an architect, finds beauty in an abandoned place where Cedric took him. We observe how Mathieu, reading from the guidebook, wants Cedric's attention. <br /> <br /> When Mathieu goes to his mother, she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career. She also points out what future they both will have together, which is confirmed. Mathieu seems to have learned his lesson, the hard way. He continues his uncertain life with Cedric and is trying to commit suicide. We observe him talking to a psychiatrist at the hospital who was treating his wounded soul. <br /> <br /> The ending may be confusing for most viewers, but there is a moment in the film when Mathieu goes to work at the bar. where we see him washing his glasses and looking intently at Pierre, a young man who often goes to the bar. That is why when Mathieu goes in search of Pierre in his house, it seems difficult to imagine. However, we have seen how Mathieu is clearly interested in Pierre. The last scene on the beach, when Pierre and Mathieu are walking along the sand, has an encouraging sign that it will be better between them when they watch a little boy, obviously lost, but then realizing that the father is near. <Br /> <br /> Jeremy Elkaim makes Mathieu one of the most difficult characters in recent films. This is a young man who is difficult to understand at a simple level. Mathieu was badly hurt, first from separation from his parents, then from his depressed mother and from the loss of Cedric. Stefan Rideau, who was seen in other important French films, is equally as good as the petty Cedric. <br /> <br /> Although “Come Undone” shares opinions, the film deserves viewing because of the complexity and Sebastian Lifshits takes care of the story.
