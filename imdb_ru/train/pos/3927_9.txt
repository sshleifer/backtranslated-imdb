Ok, first fix the tag posted on the main page of this movie. Abe Lincoln did not go to the cinema with his sister and did not stop at the grave of his sister. The person in question is Ann Rutledge, who was his close friend to Lincoln in the days of his New Salem. Some say that Ann was actually Lincoln's girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support this. <br /> <br /> Now in this film there are inventions and inventions. Hollywood has always received a grand license with anything under the sun, and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. However, the courtroom case, which is in the film, is based on a real event: the murder charge against William "Duff" Armstrong, and although it is largely invented in this film with a lot of name changes, viewers will still have to chain the screen . This is the golden age of Hollywood, with drama in all its glory, and Henry Fonda gives perhaps the best Lincoln played by anyone.
