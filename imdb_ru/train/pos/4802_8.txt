I just saw this episode this evening at the recently added presentation of one of our local independent channels, which now presents two episodes every weekday. <br /> <br /> As Mr noted in another previous comment, I agree that this may not have been one of the best programs in the series, but I find it nonetheless interesting. <br /> <br /> My father was a friend of one of the directors (in my hometown, Cincinnati), for whom young Rod Serling worked there in the media - and I remember my father telling how talented and creative he was there was In general, the Twilight Zone is undoubtedly one of the true classics of television, and, given its production at the height of the Cold War period, provides not only an idea of ​​this era in the country, but also (today) a nostalgic picture of production. technicians, creative views and actors of this era several decades ago. <br /> <br /> * Slight spoiler. * <br /> <br /> This particular story shows, like the other presentations in this series and elsewhere, a story in which the locale is intended to provide an “unexpected” ending. Sometimes the characters are on the ground, from somewhere else, while the story first implies that at least one of them is earthling. Usually they contained a message (like here) about the situation caused by the fact that during this period of the Cold War, the superpowers finally pressed the buttons of the Doomsday. <br /> <br /> Today such stories give a nostalgic look. on this worldly point of view 4-5 decades ago and still provide food for thought. - like this episode. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the dialogue may not have drawn significant talents to potential customers, it still represents a simple, important message and worthy 20-minute entertainment and interest.
