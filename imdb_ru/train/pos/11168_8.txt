Created on the basis of the real feats of Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie in New York in the 1890s, “The Bowery” is distinguished by high energy and good nature. <br /> <br /> But be careful: random racial epithets flow down from the Wallace Beery and little Jackie Cooper languages. The very first shot can be astounding. This is true for the time when it was established, and the time when it was made. And it also speaks of the diversity of the population in this neck of the forest. This, of course, adds to the sandy flavor of the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Beer, as Connors is a roaring thunder in the middle of the action, a loud cabin keeper with his fire brigade. And he has a weakness for the evil orphan Cooper. Raft, like Brodie, is a deft Connors, a better-looking contender in almost all endeavors. Brodie could never refuse attention and loving attention, which led to a jump from the Brooklyn Bridge (it is still unclear whether he jumped or used a dummy). <br /> <br /> Beer is just as forceful as the invoice Irish-American accent. He is just a rough character who draws children, cats and girls in distress. Perhaps this is the noisiest character Raft has ever played, and he can even add a little dancing (as well as a foot show). And again he takes the lead woman (beautiful Fay Ray) for a prostitute. Cooper is as strong as any of them, although he has a chance to burst into tears. <br /> <br /> The highlight is not a jump from a bridge, but a merciless fistfight between Connors and Brodie; in large terms, it looks like a real fight between principals. I am sure that someone bruised more than ego.
