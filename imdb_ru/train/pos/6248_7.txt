Being an Austrian, it was a direct blow to my face. Fortunately, I do not live anywhere near the place where this film takes place, but, unfortunately, it depicts everything that the rest of Austria hates about Viennese people (or people close to this region). And it is very easy to understand that this is precisely the intention of the directors: to allow your head to sink into your hands and say: “My God, how IT is possible!”. No, not with me, then (in my opinion) the scene is not exaggerated uncensored by the swinger club, I don’t watch porn, of course, but in this context I was rather disgusted than put in the right context. <br /> <br /> This film tells the story of how misguided people who suffer from a lack of education or bad company are trying to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons. The girl with whom her super-jealous boyfriend treats (like a whore) (and still continues to return), a teacher who discovers her masochism, endangering the life of her super-cruel "lover", an old couple who are almost mathematical daily a cycle (she is the “official replacement” for his ex-wife), a couple who had just divorced, and an ex-husband suffering from the actions of his ex-wife, obviously having a relationship with her masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks her drivers questions and nerves, just super-annoying. <br /> <br /> After watching you feel almost nothing. You are not even shocked, not upset, not depressed and do not feel that you are doing something ... Maybe that's why I gave him 7 points, it made me react as never before. Good or bad - you decide!
