I started watching this film, not expecting anything, just another film, but from the first twenty minutes the mysterious character and the main character do not speak much, really attracted me to this film. <br /> I really liked this film, it was dark, beautifully played and very touching. This is a bit slow, but the dive was completed. The direction was awesome, letting us know a little about the story leading to the conviction of Joey and his life behind bars. The music was really great and fits very well with the scenes. The ending was unexpected, with an unexpected turn. This is not the film that we often see.
