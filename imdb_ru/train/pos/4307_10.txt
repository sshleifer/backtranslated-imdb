Well, maybe not right before the Rodney King riots, but even a few months before this was quite timely. My parents said they saw it, and the next thing you know, the police were acquitted, and Los Angeles burned to the ground. It simply shows the state of race relations in America. In the plot, the white Macs (Kevin Kline) and the African American Simon (Danny Glover) become friends after Simon saves the life of the Mac in a black ghetto. Meanwhile, the producer of the film Davis (Steve Martin in a serious role) believes that causeless violence is really cool ... until he is shot. There is also some existentialism in the film: Mack and his family begin to realize that they do not live the way they want. <br /> <br /> It seems that “Failure” somewhat renewed people's interest in race relations, but this one came out much earlier. Perhaps we can never have stable racial relations in this country. But in any case, Grand Canyon is a great movie. This confirms that Kevin Kline is my favorite actor. Also starring Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard.
