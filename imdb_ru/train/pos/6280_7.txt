If you like cars, you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> There are several excellent actors in the film, especially Vinnie Jones, with his typical, not stupid attitude and hardcover appearance. Others are also good .... <br /> <br /> There are only two minor flaws in this film. Firstly, a bad story, but people do not watch this film for the plot. Secondly, the glorification of the grand theft of a car (car crime). However, if people really believe that they can steal a Ferrari and get away with it, then take a closer look at them, I hope you have a good time in prison! <br /> <br /> When I first read that Nicolas Cage was supposed to play the main role, I first thought "... yum", but then I thought "... naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" but then, finally, after watching the movie, I realized: "... yes, it sucks!". Only joking, he plays this role very well. <br /> <br /> I will finish this unusual review by saying: â€œIf the premature death of the offender somehow enlightened the audience, which moves to the cinema, to the dismal end under the glossy surface of criminal life, and inspired them to change their path, then this death brings with it innate nobility and supreme glory. We all must be so lucky. You can say "Poor Criminal." I say: "Poor us." <br /> <br /> ps - Angelina Jolie Voight looks pretty cute!
