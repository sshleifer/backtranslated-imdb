I have to agree with mr. Caruso Jr. Lanza was the best voice that God could offer, if only he could find the courage to go into ruin, leave Hollywood and go to the opera, he could be an American Caruso, everyone says that could be, but In any case, it is a fantastic introduction to art without any bones, and if so, it will be so. After watching the film, you will understand why Mr. Lanza is still being discussed even in my house. Someone says “Pavarotti”, I say “Mario Lanza”. As for the film itself, when it is on DVD, it should be restored, and VHS is not good enough, but it should also be the only film of the Lanzians recorded on DVD, the rest look bad and boring
