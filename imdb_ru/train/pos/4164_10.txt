These childhood memories ... when things were new, and we were full of curiosity about the world around us; when we took these first steps in the long journey we call life. <br /> <br /> One of the first memories I’ve had since my childhood was the Galaxy Express 999 animation program about a little boy named Tetsuro, who sets off on a train through the galaxy hoping to get a mechanical body to get revenge. for the senseless death of his mother at the hands of cold-blooded trophy hunters for mechanics. Accompanying Tetsuro on his journey - Mathel, a woman of graceful golden beauty, who reminds him of his mother, whom he lost all these years ago ... <br /> <br /> Back in the early 80s, when he was a boy who visited children the garden and in the early years of elementary school in Seoul, South Korea, the Galaxy Express 999 was a phenomenally popular animation program imported from Japan that inspired young boys who were determined to dream of countless adventures in their often stormy and exciting journey through life, which waited for them. Memories of setting up this animated program on weekdays from 8 to 9 pm before bedtime ... <br /> <br /> These were wonderful memories that will never happen again ... <br /> <br /> When I moved to America and lived here for more than two decades, I sometimes wondered about that time and place, in a country located thousands of kilometers from America, shared by the vast ocean of this children's program with its hit theme. and about the boy named Tetsuro, his protective companion Matele, the mysterious train conductor, and the Galaxy Express 999 space train. <br /> <br /> Many, many years have passed ... <br /> <br /> Last summer When I was in Korea, I managed to find a copy of the original "Galaxy Express 999" (1979) on DVD, and it brought a lot of nostalgic, heartfelt memories. “Galaxy Express 999” remains as fascinating as it was the first time you opened it many years ago, revealing nostalgic memories of new discoveries, an important step for young boys who tuned in and began their life journey to manhood. /> <br /> Here are wonderful memories. "Goodbye, Matel. Goodbye, Galaxy Express 999 ... <br /> <br /> Farewell to childhood." <br /> <br /> 10/10
