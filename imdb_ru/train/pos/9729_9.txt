A weak beginning, a solid middle, a fantastic finish. In any case, this is my impression of this film. I liked Simon Pegg in two films in which I saw him - “Hot Down” and “Sean of the Dead”. His role here, however, took a completely different turn. Shows his range as an actor, but nevertheless I really did not like this character, as he was depicted at the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of humor, which I call the “comedy of disappointment”. His supposed "jokes" and wit are really nothing more than painful and awkward moments. Just like the character played by Bin Rowan Atkinmson. There are a number of other comedians who also portray similar characters. I don't want to beat them here, so I won't. <br /> <br /> But I warn you that if you are like me and you don’t like cunning and insanely awkward idiots, Pegg shows such characteristics for the first time a third of this film. However, things are getting better. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that this is based on real events. Hmmm May be. The story of the film has ceased to be annoying, and has become a kind of triumph for the “little guy” in the last third. I do not need all the films to be bright and bright - but, by coincidence, when this film got better, it also became an increasingly happy ending. <br /> <br /> It was also nice to see the old favorite, Jeff Bridges, play the role so masterfully. I liked Iron Man, but I was saddened that Bridges was a villain. Of course, purely personal taste, because his game was excellent. However, he was a miracle here, as a man of “more than life” view, publisher of Sharps. It was nice to see him in a role that I really liked. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked it! I would just like to be 40 minutes late and skip the beginning.
