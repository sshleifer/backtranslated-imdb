This film with stunning cinematography and a thread of Kafkaâ€™s absurdity brought me out of a simple but exciting opening scene. The film is like a dream, and I think that is precisely why people either hate it or love it. Characters are drawn superficially, and the story itself is insignificant and, perhaps, a little meaningless. But these are film flaws, but a conscious choice. The film does not work as a story, but rather as a deconstruction of war films of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> It would be hard for me to say that there was a lot of real substance in the film, but the film is such a cinematic miracle that completely swept me away. This is one of the most beautiful films in the entire history, and in his style there is a wild imagination. I can fully understand why people hate it, but I give it 9/10.
