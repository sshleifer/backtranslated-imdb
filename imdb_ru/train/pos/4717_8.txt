How can you love this movie? I think this is a hilarious deception of all the old gang movies; if you have never seen them, look it up. Michael Keaton has the ball in this role, anyway. One guy spoils English every time he speaks, and Griffin Dunn plays the ignorant DA, but my favorite role is Joe Piscopo. He has all the best features. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, Ray Walston in this star-studded film that the gangsters use much more fun than the Mafia for the criminal underground.
