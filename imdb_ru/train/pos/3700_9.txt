Cameron Grant - one of the best directors who make films for adults. His only rival is Andrew Blake. Celeste is dynamite in the whole film, but the DR office sequence with her and two other ladies is incredible. Almost the same good work at Asia Carrera with the builder. I highly recommend this film and gave it 9. It is almost as good as Cameron Grant's “ELEMENTS OF DESIRE”, which I gave 10.
