Honestly, I do not understand why this film was such a big failure in advertising. Sharon Stone, of course, has not lost a single of her charisma and “touch” since the time of the “Basic Instinct”. I voted for this film 10, and I tell you why: this time the game opens in London. London is the city where Katherine Tramell moved after the events to BI1. Again, she turns out to be the inspiration for the manipulations of her class - she challenges. She "twists your brain," like Catherine, with such skill that in the end you are not sure who the real villain is. <br /> <br /> With regard to the technical part of the film: only a real failure is a team of actors. Sheron Stone - the only truly big name in the cast compared to her, Michael Douglas, etc. In the first part. I also think that BI2 would be better if Sharon Stone were a bit younger, but she still looks amazing and only improves her charisma. Her “assistants” in the B-norm are not so bad either, although I would like to have larger names in the cast. <br /> <br /> I think there are some nice improvements in the main plot. I think this is a much better thriller than many of that stupid Hollywood shit that is so easy to distribute these days. The plot is great, technically it is easy to see, you do not snore halfway through the film, and most importantly - security is included.
