Richard Attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with the Oscar-winning "Gandhi" back in '83. I didn’t know about any other of his work until recently I came across Cry Freedom, released back in 1987. Although she may not have been as popular as his Gandhi, she is just as exciting, if not more, and was released when South Africa had not yet broken the shackles of apartheid. Although most social affairs films come out after the event, I think this film was released at that time. <br /> <br /> History is based on real characters and events. The book on which the film was based was written by Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), a journalist who worked in South Africa until the late seventies. It traces the origins of Woods's friendship with the charismatic black leader Steve Biko, whom Denzel Washington portrays wonderfully. I can't imagine a better choice for the role. Washington exudes the natural charm and screen presence that Biko’s character demanded. <br /> <br /> Although initially Woods was opposed to the fact that Biko was spreading black racism on himself, after meeting him he could not but be embroiled. in his struggles and ideas. The bond between them is growing stronger, and Woods and his family are becoming aware and becoming more sensitive to the plight of the people Biko represents. <br /> <br /> But finally, tragedy happens, and Woods now has to focus on escaping from South Africa, with his book, so that he can publish it and let the world know what is happening. The second half of the film is a fascinating tale of his escape from South Africa with his family, and he will keep you in a dead end. <br /> <br /> There are some amazingly funny dialogs. An example is the scene between Biko and a lawyer in a courtroom. <br /> <br /> Lawyer: Do you protect violence? Biko: I advocate confrontation. Lawyer: Well, isn't it violence, Mr. Biko? Biko: Not necessarily. We have a confrontation with you now, but I do not see any violence. <br /> <br /> However, there are moments that bring you back to the horrors that swept the country before the best feeling won out. The scene when the army opens fire on the protest action of schoolchildren is painful and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a must see. I would suggest that those who are not familiar with the work of Attenborough give this time. There are movies that make a lot of money. And there are films that make life. I would prefer the latter on any given day.
