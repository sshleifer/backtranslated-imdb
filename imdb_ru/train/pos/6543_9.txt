I read all of Nancy Drew in childhood and collect books as an adult. I liked the effect used at the end (and a little at the beginning) of the film, where drawing lines in the style of books turned into scenes from the film. It was a neat way to point out the connection between the situations in the film and the books. For example, the scenes with the Eastern dealer of antiques very much resembled many scenarios that I remember from books. I thought Ned was great, and Emma Roberts was a great interpretation of Nancy Drew in the 21st century. (Just like the image of Betty Crocker, she keeps up with the times!)
