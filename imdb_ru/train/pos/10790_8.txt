This incredibly formal film from The Walker, Texas Ranger Squad contains some of the most incredible scenes that have ever been seen in a television movie. In addition, you can largely predict the result from the beginning. However, this is a funny little movie that does its job: it entertains. This is all that needs to be done, and it is. Tricks and explosions are fun and exciting, and the plot is not so bad. The acting is also decent, which is not surprising, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Stephen Seagal. If you are a fan of the genre (and "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you will surely like it. If not, do not waste your time. 8/10
