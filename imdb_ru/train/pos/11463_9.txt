I saw this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was just shocked. The structure and execution of the film were fantastic ... I know that it is not, but it really deserves an Oscar nod. Cal and Andre were phenomenal, like two concerned classmates. Yes, the film is very controversial, and I see that many people have many problems with it, as it concerns school shooting and especially helps to identify with the killers. Nevertheless, despite the harsh and stupid topics, Zero Day is SO worth a look. I look forward to when he comes out on video so that I can buy it - this is very, very good. Very powerful and intense ... the final shooting sequence makes you speechless because it is almost too realistic. Their uncertainty, "records", shots and panic of students are completely indescribable. I really hope to get the attention that deserves. It is made in the same format as The Blair Witch Project's portable camera, created to look like a real documentary for home video - but, God, this is MUCH MORE Very impressive, I take off my hat to all participants. If you have a chance, you really should see it.
