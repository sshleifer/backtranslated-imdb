This is one of the best comedy / music films "B" I've ever seen (and since I'm in my forties, and I see it just now, I'm not an expert, but I saw all the famous films there)). When there is a ton of actors playing a role for several minutes, the comedy usually interferes with the music beats, and very often the music plays interrupt the comedy flow. Call me in a crazy mood, but when I saw it at TCM Europe, I laughed out loud with pleasure! So who was laughing for me? No doubt, Misha ower gave me a terrific instinctive laugh, he even steals the final, it was great! Speaking of which, I think why this film works, because although L & H is a selling point (and why I got hooked on this film (they and Hal Roach), I love them in their early Hal Roach materials), this keeps them at a minimum and stays right at the ADULT tariff (by the standards of the 1930s, and not too far from today's standards, if read between the lines). Jack Haley also looks great, I admit that I only know him from W O OZ, and I loved him there, and I also laughed loudly here at his waiterâ€™s beat in the show. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" woman in the films of the 30s who really excites me (something tells me that in real life she was a spittoon); and the musical numbers have a real professional quality of production (Busby Berkley'ish), which disrupted me from what I'm used to in this genre. I could go on and on, but be sure, I really liked this movie. 8 of 10 I saw him at TCM Europe and made an appointment to watch my wife at TCM USA again. A good thing!
