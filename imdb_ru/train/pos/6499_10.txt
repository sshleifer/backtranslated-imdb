After all these years, I still consider this series the best example of the documentary film of the Second World War. An interview with many participants from all countries distinguishes it from any other project. It would be great to see how a modern documentary (Ken Burns?) Took up this topic and tried to collect information from veterans before they leave. Thanks to modern technology to improve old archival materials and a large amount of information that has been discovered since 1974, when World in War was released, an updated version of this series will be welcomed. The History Channel has done some wonderful shows on many aspects of the Second World War, but expansive series such as “World at War” have not been successfully undertaken from the very beginning. If you are interested in this era, do not miss this series. Viewing is required.
