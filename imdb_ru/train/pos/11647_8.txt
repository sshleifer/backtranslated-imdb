I can give you four reasons to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Four best directors of contemporary Mexican cinema. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories connected in a large outline. <br /> <br /> 3. Amazingly good cast. <br /> <br /> 4. Bitter reflection on the biggest problem in this country (and many others). <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens this film with a good comedy mood story about authority, practicing extortion against ordinary people and still expecting his efforts to appreciate. <br /> <br /> Then Antonio Serrano becomes more dramatic in the second episode with the historical heir of Italian neo-realism with a joke similar to Peter and the Wolf. <br /> <br /> In the third story, Carlos Carrera, who seems to be more independent of this series even in context, tells us the story of a man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. But after the recent lynching in Tlahuac and the tradition in this terrible deed in the state of Mexico, this story cannot be more updated. <br /> <br /> And at the end Fernando Sarinhana returns to dark humor in a “grandiose finale,” in which he brings together most of the characters from past episodes in one of the best comedy works ever made. Reviewing the central scene from one of his previous films “Todo el poder”, Sariniana gives the last lesson of the theme. And by the way, give us a scene that steals a movie with Anna Chichetti, who makes a short striptease. <br /> <br /> As soon as the film ends, you have a bitter-sweet feeling that you watched a good movie (and you might have liked it) with a very painful subject. It is said that in Mexico people laugh at their shame, and this is the best example. This film is a testament to how Mexicans learned to live in the center of a criminal state (and, perhaps, accepted it) between two fires: criminals and the so-called authorities, full of corruption. Even this film is wishful thinking, because almost all good people are victims of crime, and they do not get it unscathed. If you had a scratch-free attack, then you're in luck. Meanwhile, do not miss the chance to watch this movie, it is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> And in Mexico, the beautiful life ...
