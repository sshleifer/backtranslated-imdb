In the days when musicals were not showcases for choreographers, we had such wonderful films as this one. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of Woodhouse and Fred Astaire, I was glad to finally see this movie. Not quite a mix of Woodhouse and Hollywood, but close enough. Some of the American humor of vaudeville, farce, and not witty banter, conflict with the British sense of humor at Wodehouse. But in general, the American-style banter makes American characters seem real, not cardboard cartoons. <br /> <br /> Some ingenious performances of dance numbers, including a magnificent fairground with rotating floors and mirrors for fun, do more than make Busby Berkeley away from the dance number. They seem much more realistic if you could imagine that people starting to sing and dance look realistic. <br /> <br /> The absence of Ginger Rogers and Eric Bloor will not interfere with the film, instead they allow for different character dynamics. go out. It is also a pleasure not to have a wise cracking, stubborn love interest. Instead, we have a gentle, stubborn love interest, much more appropriate to the young aristocratic women of Wodehouse.
