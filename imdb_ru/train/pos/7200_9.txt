Deathtrap gives you a turn at every turn, at every turn, in fact, his biggest problem is that there are so many turns in the film that you never really orient yourself, and this often makes no sense, although they usually they catch you are surprised The story is very good, except that there are so many turns in it. The script is very good, with excellent dialogue and characters, but you can not catch all the development because of the bends. The performances, especially Kane, are amazing. The direction is very good, Sidney Lumet can direct. The visual effects are fair, but again, most are actually in the game and are fake. There are a lot of turns, but it still works and is worth seeing.
