A good film about Down syndrome. The mother has twins, one is very sick, the other is good, but he has recessions. The mother does not think that she can raise him, so she gives it to some people who have 15 children, who have 11 falls! Mom doesnâ€™t like it, and she thinks that he should be with her family (I agree too), so they go to court and the family breaks up, and grandparents lose, never really say if mom and daughter makeup? I think this movie is good, but the plot is familiar, still good and has some unintended laughs!
