The fourth of five westerns that Anthony Mann made with James Stewart includes a bitten cattleman named Jeff Webster, who rides cattle from Wyoming to Alaska via Seattle. He contacts Seattle with his partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Ruby Morris (Jay Flippen), whom he sent in advance to prepare for a boat trip to the north. <br /> <br /> But first, he has to put up with the disobedient hands of the trail, deceived by the captains of riverboats and the spell of the modest manipulative castle of Rhonda (Ruth Roman), who believes that Jeff can become a valuable ally in the future. That is why she hides him on the boat, while the captain is looking for him for an earlier (and justified) murder of the trailing hand. <br /> <br /> Jeff was also unlucky to run into the scruffy judge Gannon (John McIntyre)) who runs the city of Skagway, Alaska. Gannon locks Jeff for disturbing his social life by driving cattle through the city. He will fine Jeff for owning his cattle, while Jeff needs to eat ravens for now. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Jeff agrees to deliver Ronda to Dawson to deliver supplies. But this is just a ploy, so Jeff, Ben and Rub can slip back into Skagway and steal his cattle. Of course, Judge Gannon finds out about this and is right behind him, but Jeff detains him with a rifle, while Ben drives the cattle beyond the Canadian border beyond the reach of Gannon. <br /> <br /> After avoiding the avalanche and another skirmish with some other people from Skagway, finally reach Dawson, where Jeff sells his cattle at the highest price, namely Rhonda, who then quickly installs a new gambling house in Dawson. Jeff takes his money, buys a lawsuit and starts collecting gold. <br /> <br /> But then Judge Gannon comes up to Dawson to start a golden share there, and tells Jeff that he is a little bored with Skagway, and he wants to try his luck in Klondike. To do this, you need to take a hired gunman with you and forcibly steal some of the claims of other miners. Jeff and Ben now feel it's time to break up, while things are going well, leaving Ruba to stand up for himself as the most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and his gang. <br /> <br /> They are looking for a way out of the situation only to be ambushed by the people of Gannon, because Ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth. Ben is killed, and Jeff is seriously injured, but this does not save Judge Gannon from his due. The ultimate shootout at night on Dawsonâ€™s filthy street pretty much takes care of that. First, Jeff kills two of the best militants Gannon (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). Then, when Rhonda comes out to warn Jeff that Gannon is trying to slip behind him, Gannon shoots her in the back, and she is right there dying in Jeff's arms. Then Jeff kills Gannon, hiding under a wooden sidewalk. Revenge started talking. <br /> <br /> This is another roaring western western that is right there with a bare spur and a man from Laramie. Why universal DVD uses wide format printing instead of wide format printing that TCM uses is not clear to me. You miss half the glorious cinematography of Alberta William Daniels. So if you like well-written westerns from the 50s, then this list keeper. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
