A A Bug's Life has a lot of detail. Everything is covered. The film looks great, and the animation is sometimes awesome. The film is not very original, it is basically a modern look at the Kurosawa Seven Samurai, only with errors. However, I liked the interaction of the characters, and the bad guys in this film really seemed bad. It seems that Disney usually makes its bad guys cut out a copy. Grasshoppers threaten, and Hopper, the leading bad guy, was a brilliant creature. Check this.
