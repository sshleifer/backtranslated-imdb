I have a two-year-old son who suffers from the same condition as Johnny Kennedy. I never had the opportunity to meet him, but I never heard anyone say bad words about him. I hope that he knows how much the creation of this program has helped his comrades in misfortune, raising awareness of this terrible condition. This man touched people as a million charity leaflets could not. I think it should be a must-see in schools. I also agree with other comments - what am I moaning about? He took all that life could throw at him, and yet managed to maintain a sense of humor. God blessed. I could not watch the part that showed that his bandages were changing. I have enough problems with my son.
