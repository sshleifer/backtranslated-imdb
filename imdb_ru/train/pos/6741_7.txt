The title sequence shows captions written on the rain-soaked sidewalk as people walked along it; music provided by someone whistling "Street Scene" by Alfred Newman. Then we meet with Det. Sergeant Mark Dickson (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be someone who was not his old man: the guy on the right side of the law. But he is pretty mean for a nice guy. After several complaints about his rough work, his head Insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon), lowers it. Foley tells him that he is a good man, but he needs to be honest and be more like Det. Lieutenant Thomas (Karl Malden), who has just been promoted. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Tommy Scalis (Gary Merrill, in a superb slimy performance) unfolds an illegal dice game and hopes to make a sucker. from rich Ted Morrison (Harry von Zell), who was brought by Ken Payne (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful wife Morgan (Gene Tierney). She realizes too late that her husband uses her as a bait, and Payne hits her when she refuses to play along. Knight's Morrison intervenes, but Payne knocks him off track. It seems worse, but later it turns out that the guy is dead; and Payne looks guilty. <br /> <br /> But this is not a Payne story. Soon Dixon fell in love with Morgan, but not before he lost his composure again and committed a terrible act that he tries to hide. Morgan’s father, a taxi driver who turns in a fairy tale (Tom Talley), can take responsibility for that. Dixon should try to blame Scalis. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger directs the script attributed to Ben Hecht and three others from William L. Stewart’s novel Night Cry. This is a solid film noir with excellent features and all the dark photos and dark morality that we expect from this genre. It holds up to a brightly lit ending, which looks like something the studio has shot to appease the censors. Of course, the classic noir directed by Preminger with Andrews and Tirney in the lead roles is “Laura”. You will like it, but you cannot miss it.
