I am not usually a fan of strictly romantic films, but I heard that it was good. I was stunned. Easily the most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. Stunning. Brilliant, sweet, cheerful and full of heart. Chemistry is impeccable, as is the script and direction. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphi are so natural and cute that you really think they are a couple. <br /> <br /> Cinema captures you immediately and does not let go. You can not look away and can not stop listening to them. Even little moments just melt your heart. <br /> <br /> This one jumped into the ranks of one of my favorites ever. Masterpiece.
