Here is one movie that is truly fun in every moment it covers. How should the creators of South Park and director David Zucker star in this film? When I first saw this film, I did not immediately realize that Coop and Doug were indeed Matt and Trey, but their talent for acting and writing turned out to be quite impressive. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was Matt and Trey later. Humor is sometimes rude, sometimes dirty, sometimes brilliant, sometimes thin, sometimes loud and sometimes stupid, but in general, this is one hell of a film that is undoubtedly undervalued. Well, actually, this is crazy. Absolutely insane.
