Dark Remains is a simple and clear move. The film is full of terrible visual effects and horror stories that will make the most experienced horror veteran jump out of his seat. In particular, on the landing these guys are good. Although they did not work with a huge budget, everything looks good and the actors arrive. Dark Remains has one of these interpretative endings, which may be negative for some, but I think it makes you think. Cherie Christian and Greg Thompson are a grieving couple trying to rebuild their lives there, ”but some of the side characters, such as“ Sheriff ”, did not convince me. They are not so important. I give Dark Remains a perfect rating of ten, because it's ten times worse than any recent ghost / Japanese remake studio story.
