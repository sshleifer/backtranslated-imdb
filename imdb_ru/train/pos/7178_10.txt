DELIVER CAMERA ON ME deceptively cute movie. This is actually a difficult look at the psychology of children and offers interesting views on the development of adults and the artist. At first glance, this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 1980s by a group of children from upper class neighbors. One of the film's directors, Darren Stein, had access to a video camera and quickly became the artistic director of all films. Of course, these are just funny kids. But it is also much more. This is a look at some moments in time when children face a number of confusing problems that we all face in life - fear, sexual arousal, unrequited love, loneliness and just an attempt to comprehend the world of adults that seems to explode around us. As we grow older, we tend to forget how great the realities of life were when we were small. <br /> <br /> What makes this film even more relevant is that young Darren Stein is turning into a little general director. It is clear that Darren is leading this show, and these small films are his vision, but they are all informed by his friends, their problems, interpersonal dynamics and general confusion regarding the horrors of adulthood. Many children make home movies, but I have never heard or seen children make “small” films about the Holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war and the inability to adapt and make friends. These children are faced with some heavy things! <br /> <br /> The strength of this film lies in the fact that Stein and Shell are so closely associated with different scenes, conducting interviews with children - all are now adults and still friends. This adds a new angle to the film. How many of us stayed in touch with our childhood friends? These guys are there. And many of the problems they dealt with are still between them two decades later. <br /> <br /> Among the conflicts: a declaration of love leads to the fact that the heart is still broken, a very normal sexual experience in childhood continues to be a “sticky” topic between two men, some who continue to resent the dynamics of relationships and there is still a member of this team who remains very responsible and in the center of attention! It makes sense if you watch these home movies evolve over a couple of years. Darren Stein is a director. There is no doubt about this. <br /> <br /> Stein and Shell take turns talking to each other from time to time, and it’s impossible to imagine how embarrassingly allows us to look into the young life of these people. This is especially true for Stein, who has achieved great success in the entertainment industry as a film producer, writer and director. From the first moment, when they put a camera on me, we see the appearance of a little gay boy trying to understand all this. We also see the sides of the artistic mind and personality that are not always “good” or “caring” - and this is a bold step for any artist to share with the audience. <br /> <br /> There are so many frank moments, but the most disturbing and difficult moments are connected with the film, in which we see how the victim of a Jewish concentration camp is tortured and murdered by the Nazis. From the interview and narration, we learn that the Nazi is played by a Jewish child, and the role of the victim is played by a pagan child. This is a painfully anxious moment that throws a glance at the dark side of fear and how children work through the horrors of the adult world, which are far less understanding than an adult than a child. <br /> <br /> This is much more than some home movies. This documentary reflects the pain, beauty, joy and sadness of growing up. Powerful things --- and worth a look! <br /> <br />:
