Diego Armando Maradona was sixteen years old in 1978, when Argentina won the world championship at home. He was already the biggest star and the greatest player in the country, obsessed with football. Everyone asked Cesar Louis Menotti to play a young genius, but the manager thought that he was not ready yet. <br /> <br /> Historical records indicate that Argentina won the 1978 World Cup convincingly enough - Maradona wasn’t really needed, the same wasn’t true in 1982. Spain was a disaster directory for Argentina. Menotti, who was still smoking, played Diego this time, but for such a temperamental boy this was too much of a reason. Maradona signed a contract with Barcelona on June 4, 1982 for about $ 7 million - nine days later he played his first game at Camp Nou, and Belgium beat Argentina one-zero. It was not a favorable debut, and although in the next match he scored twice against Hungary, Maradona will remember this match as his nadir's platform - a rough, irritable foul against Batista from Brazil in the second round, which suddenly ended his tournament and Argentina rules as world champions. <br /> <br /> But now it's all over. Maradona survived several crazy times in Barça and left in 1984 to join Naples. It's like he's finally home. Neapolitan Tifosi did everything to seduce Maradona for the poor, not successful Napoli. Gifts from older women and pocket money from young boys were awkwardly combined with Camorra’s millions as part of the transfer fee, and the city was determined to make him feel at home. So, at the moment, at least, Maradona was El Rey - he led his Argentine side to Mexico as one of the favorites, and with a new manager, Carlos Bilardo, who replaced Menotti. <br /> <br /> Maradona - the hero of this story, the car-winner of the World Cup. In 1982, hundreds of young people died in a meaningless battle for the Falkland Islands; Now the British press craved revenge (with the same result) in Mexico City. Maradona was still valued in England with great distinction, more remembered for the excellent performance in the UK during the tour in 1980 than in Spain. But he was still Arji: the enemy. <br /> <br /> England actually started well, and Lineker could score in twelve minutes. The key event occurred in 8 minutes. Fenwick, a large and limited English defender, received a warning - now he was afraid to create any problems in the penalty area. <br /> <br /> After a tense first 45 minutes, the second half began with a beat. Maradona danced forward after 50 minutes, but could not find a way out. Similarly, the attempt Valdano struck only white shirts. Then a moment of shame that serves as Diego's epitaph. Hodge fancifully hooked the ball back into his own penalty area, Shilton hurriedly jumped to claim - but Maradona was there, somehow rising above the English goalkeeper to shove the ball into the net. How did he do it? Simple: handball. <br /> <br /> The most famous foul in football history was almost in slow motion. Each spectator waited for Al-Sharif from Syria to strike at the foul (he did not). Shilton looked and turned to the line judge - he ran back to the center of the circle. If he does not kill the Pope or does not become the first man to set foot on Mars when a great man dies, this moment will be shown first - a long, slow, slow motion and the subsequent expression of joy on his face. The following image will be his next gift to the world - the best goal of the World Cup. <br /> <br /> Burruga struck Maradona, who was wandering on the right side of his half of the field. He turned and sped up from Beardsley and Reid. It was the real Diego — he broke through the Butcher and attacked Fenwick. Now Fenwick had the opportunity to stop the attack. Usually he would aim his shoe somewhere near the thigh of Maradona - of course, he would take a red card, but who cares? Then Fenwick had a brain wave - he hesitated and decided to run towards Maradona, waving his arms - maybe he was trying to push him away? Diego fired into the drawer when Fenwick fell. The butcher ran alongside the genius, as if he was offering support. Shilton flinched in panic, and Maradona turned around him and prepared to score. Now the Butcher remembered his role and tried to cripple the Argentinean - instead, he gave an extra push to the shot that hit the target. England was returning home. <br /> <br /> In this magical Mexican summer, the world found a successor for Pele. In fact, the greatest footballer was surpassed - Pele was great in 1958 and 1970, but there were great players around him. Maradona is not. 1986 was his world championship.
