I have seen this movie twice with my teenagers who love it. This should be a cult favorite! The best line is "Your dress is very cool!" says Prince Cinderella. Kathleen Turner shines like a stepmother. I also like cars and motorcycles of the 1950s. Melancholic prince - a great deviation from the typical crook. He tries to keep his cool, but he cannot hide his love for the future fairy-tale princess. Her slipper is not glass (or rather the original story), but Cinderella, nevertheless, loses, but returns it from the heir to the throne. My only complaint is that it is no longer showing and it seems almost impossible to get. Hopefully, Blockbuster or Amazon will start purchasing it soon.
