I was not born until 4 years after this wonderful show first went on the air, but, fortunately, I managed to catch repetitions of the mid-90s, and the rest is history ... I was hooked. The premise was pretty simple; The two hardened nemesis agents, Richard Barrett and Craig Sterling (William Gaunt and Stewart Damon), collaborate with an expert (if not young), doctor and biologist (Sharron Macridi) to go for a bamboo curtain to remove the dangerous biological agent from red porcelain While escaping, their plane is bombarded with machine guns, and they crash in the heart of the Himalayas, where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undetected civilization that heals and enhances the feelings of the trio, thereby creating a scene for many ahead of exciting adventures ... <br /> <br /> The series lasted 30 hours, and I think it was his relatively short, one season, which put him on cult status. <br /> <Monty Berman, the producer, was known for making things as cheap as possible, and sometimes the show suffered because of this with incredibly stinging sets - especially in such episodes as “Happening” (studio, filmed for the Australian outback ) and the Snow Sets "Operation Deep Freeze" and "The Beginning", but if you can get through it and focus on the characters and storylines, the show was really very exciting. It was a great combination of adventure and a lot of incredible humor (mostly from one amazing liner from William Gaunt). <br /> <br /> Chemistry from the three leashes was fantastic - you feel that they really had a lot of fun doing the show, and this is confirmed by the 2005 reunification documentary, in which three reunite after 35 years to recall the show ( and laugh at Anthony Nichols' terrible wig !!). They all had the same time on the screen, and each had their own moments to shine. I must say that I have always been a fan of Richard Barrett - I liked his sardonic humor along with this dangerous point - he, of course, was a man you did not see, and these eyes ........ blue eyes You will probably be seen on TV. Since then I have been following the career of Bill Gaunts with interest. However, Craig Stirling would certainly have a legion of female fans, and I am sure that Alexandra Basedo had a whole line of male fans who also fainted. <br /> <br /> There were also many guest stars on the show to seduce. starring Donald Sutherland, Jeremy Brett, Peter Wingard, Burt Cooke, Anton Rogers, Kate O'Mara, Jenny Linden, Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely. <br /> <br /> For me, there were remarkable episodes: “Auto Kill”, “Interrogation”, “Fanatics”, “Mission” and “Gilded Cell”, but I am sure that everyone has their own favorites. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this show for the first time, or to watch it many years later, do not forget to watch it in the context of the time it was made, and just relax and enjoy - the characters and Chemistry from three leashes - that’s what made this great show for me and I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of it. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
