I really didn't start watching the show until it came to FX. I was bored and I had nothing to watch, and I saw that the replays of the show were premiere, so I decided to watch it. I was so upset that I did not watch the show when it was first shown on television. I really enjoyed the show! Finally, a show for everyone. I remember “Full House” and “Family Affairs” and “Step by Step”, and they were good shows, but just not fun enough. They joked and laughed at things that were just stupid, but not at Show 70s. The 70s show was fun, smart and so real. I think it was the best show I’ve ever done, and I’m really sorry that it’s over. Although I love this show, I think it should have ended in the seventh season, when Eric and Kelso leave. Last season was just not right, Eric was the main character, and the show was supposed to end when his character was gone. I still love this show, and I hope that television is starting to do more shows like this one.
