It was a pretty decent movie. In this film, it's good to just sit down, watch and have fun. Just a typical Hollywood movie. This film will never win an Oscar or anything else and definitely does not deserve it, but I thought it was pretty good. It's like show 24, but in movie format. If you like everything that is necessary so that the terrorist does not kill the presidential film, then you will like this film. Personally, I think the storyline was TOO TOO, but The Sentinel adds a bit of perversity to the mole in the secret service. In general, this film will not leave your jaw on the floor and will not change your life, but who said that every film should be such that it is good?
