Fantastic Arabian adventure. The former king Ahmad and his best friend, the thief Abu (who plays Saba from Black Narcissus) are looking for Ahmad’s love interest, who was abducted by the new king Jaffar (Konrad Wade). There is hardly any moment of falling here. Always invent new adventures for heroes. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a bit boring (there is no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, ranked fourth in the list of titles). Conrad Wade, always a cheerful actor, makes a great villain, and Sabu is very funny, like a prince of thieves, who at some point finds a gin in a bottle. I also loved Miles Malleson very much as Sultan of Basra, father of the princess. He collects amazing toys from around the world. Jafar bribes his daughter's hand with a mechanical flying horse. This is probably considered one of the best children's films of all time, but special effects are terribly outdated in our day. Children will probably make fun of the superimposed images when Abu and the genie are together on the screen. And the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful. Although most of the younger generation probably think King Kong looks bad at the moment, Willis O'Brien’s stop motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that is not even remotely like a spider. 8/10.
