Wealthy psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse had just published her first novel and was upset about her profession, feeling that it was hopeless to help her patients. A young client addict asks her to help him pay off his debts if he really wants to help him get better. Here she contacts Joe Mantegna. Uncovering a story would spoil a damn funny movie, and The House of the Games could well become the best scam movie I've ever seen. David Mamet wrote and directed this gem, which is full of lively dialogue, wonderful one-liners and enough turns so that you donâ€™t guess until the end. Crouse is beautiful, like an annoying psychiatrist in need of change, and Mantegna surpasses her as a damn cunning fraudster. And except for the coincidence in the last quarter of the film, the film completely controls its audience; and we love con. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
