Last summer I saw Bourne Ultimatum with a friend, and, wow! I have already seen the first two films, and I liked them, but I really liked the ultimatum. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, an amnesia CIA agent, on the run, trying to figure out who he is. <br /> As I said, I loved this film from beginning to end, without plot holes, slow scenes, everything was in order and fit well with other films, but in all senses it was very much better. <br /> <br /> The best stunts, car chases, actors and effects that I saw in the action movie all summer (surprisingly because of Spider-Man 3, Pirates, etc.) But I wasn’t In the movie, Jason doesn't just kill and runs away. He has a soul, and the public feels it, therefore the drama is included. But it does not slow down. <br /> <br /> Of all the “three quotes” that came out last summer, this was the best result.
