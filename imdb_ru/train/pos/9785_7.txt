Let me be the first non-Australian to comment on this :) I got a movie for Hugo Weaving and watched it to the end. This is one of those films about the “drama of life”, as my mother called the film, which depicts the real story without any unusual events and is mostly descriptive. <br /> <br /> I liked the light and the girls, The rest was without much guilt, but without much merit. I longed for something like an "Interview," or at least some element of the villain's matrix here and there, but nothing unusual. This story teaches us how to face your own destiny and break out of the environment that others create for you, but this happens when a close-to-peach peach factory in this area comes to an end, so you don’t need much effort to change the situation. <br /> <br /> American Beauty's clever sound song in the background could be part of a larger soundtrack, but only the one that played over and over again became annoying after 100 minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think he did his job of presenting a part of Australian life, but it didn’t seem to me specifically Australian (it could be placed anywhere), and it didn’t look as attractive as history . <br /> <br /> I think the film should be in a certain mood.
