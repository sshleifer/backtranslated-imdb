I saw this film with a special showing of the work of Owen Alik Shahada. I wonder where this guy comes from? Now he is probably the world's key independent African director. And I'm not talking about black directors, I'm talking about directors who originate in culture. The idea, if anything, demonstrates the diversity and range of African themes, with his film 500 years later, is an African problem. But the idea does not fit this form. Showing artistic variety. The film is entirely African, but this topic is a human topic that most of us can relate to. I just love soft comedy in this. And Cora Tunde Dzhegede is just amazing, this is a real art house gem.
