Be sure to watch the movie for those who have ever gone to camp or wanted. This film reflects the absolute essence of the summer camp. It's funny, it's compassionate, it makes you want to look more about the characters when the credits start playing a role. If you have not seen this movie .. what are you doing? get off the butt and run the video store. Have a good summer :)
