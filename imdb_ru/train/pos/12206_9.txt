Of all the noir films of the 1940s and 1950s, this film is considered one of the strangest and most fun to watch. I say this because of the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> The first two names are familiar to everyone, but the last two have made this film so interesting for me, especially for Anders. His character, "George Grisbee," is one of the strangest people I've ever seen in a movie. His voice and some of the things that he said must be heard to be believed. Slaone is not far behind in the “strange” category. Hayworth is not so charming with short blond hair, but still he is Hayworth, which means a lot if you're a guy. Wells is as fascinating as ever. One tip: if you have a DVD, turn on the English subtitles. His character in this film is Irish, and you need subtitles to understand everything he says. <br /> <br /> Wells also shot the film, which means that you have great angles and great face shots. You also have a unique finale, visually, with an exchange of fire in the house of mirrors. Quality goods! No matter how strange this film was, I still thought that the carnival-like jester atmosphere at the court near the end was too strong and took away the seriousness of the scene. Other than that, no complaints. <br /> <br /> This is a great entertainment, so is the game.
