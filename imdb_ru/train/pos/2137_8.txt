This is much more than a charming story about a middle-aged man who discovers the pleasures of ballroom dancing (although this is also true). This is a story about how one person once again learned to love life, overcoming all the difficulties of work and money, in order to rediscover joy. The prize in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitude of modern Japan to everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact. There are scenes that make you laugh out loud ... some where you want to get up and dance ... and many others where you will be just fine. <br /> <br /> An excellent introduction to modern Japanese filmmaking for those who might get the impression that all Japanese films are “heavy” and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
