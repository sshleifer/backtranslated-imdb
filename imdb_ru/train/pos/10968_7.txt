The Gray Gardens were exciting and crazy, and you just could not look away. It was so strange, and funny, and sad, and painful, and ?????? .. in fact there are no words to describe. The course of the Gray Gardens beyond quirkiness. I found out about this film, which read my Great Big Reader Bath Uncle John, at the Bath Reader Institute, and it was completely worth renting and faced with the top of my line for watching a film. This film is about the craziest and most eccentric people ever filmed. We must look at their favorite outfits Edie, which, I am sure, include curtains. When I get old, I almost want to be like Big Edie, who has a nose that looks normal and society.
