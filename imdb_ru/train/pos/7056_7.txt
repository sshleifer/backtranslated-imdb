The continuation of the popular story about Cinderella reminded me of something that they did with one of the films “Beauty and the Beast”. Basically these are three short stories in one. <br /> <br /> Good, the mice are adorable (I love Gus! He is sooo cute!) and Lucifer is awesome (as usual). I also liked some of the new characters (Pom Pom was amazing, but I liked Prudence). However, the storyline was somewhat limited, but still very endearing. So, I vote 7/10.
