I think you should be from the USA to get a lot of jokes. But if you like the Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you will love this movie. Of course, you cannot compare the quality of filming with those that were, but the trip to the cameraman obviously was made on purpose. Killer tomatoes are a hundred times better than non-Pole dynamites. Just my opinion. I am sure that people from France will not appreciate the caricatures of the French. So this film is not for a global audience. And although I'm not a trained film critic, I know what I like. I could not stop laughing the whole movie. My sides and my jaws ached at the end of the film.
