This show has gone so far. At first everyone in the cast was from Eric to Fez, they were all new actors and actresses, fresh faces and just watched what they had achieved. They were stuck on the show, and it went well. This is one of the best shows that has ever been done, and, probably, the most funny sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see his end, but if they finish this show, I hope that God will complete the series finale with one of the biggest hits ever in the season finale. I don't care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode. Get down, get the final blow. The show deserves it, the fans deserve it, if they go, let everyone know that its end will end like in Friends, and let the final be huge. I say that Donna and Eric get married, I say that Hyde and Kelso fight and become friends again, I say that something interesting will happen between Fez and Jackie, because Fez tried for so long, but of course it will not work for him. JUST CLOSE THE BIG TIME GUY! <br /> <br /> This 70s show will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I would like you to be friends. You are the best! <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
