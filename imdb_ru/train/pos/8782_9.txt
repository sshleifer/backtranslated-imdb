Gentleman Jim, largely based on James The Crowd’s biography of James Corbett, presents a surprisingly fresh picture that perfectly reflects not only the appearance of the fist fighter that was Corbett, but also the wind of change regarding boxing. Around the 1890s. <br /> <br /> The story follows Corbett {played well by Errol Flynn} from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in San Francisco, right up to a random encounter with a former boxing champion who ultimately leads to him fighting the scary world heavyweight champion, John L. Sullivan {the adorable cake embodied delightfully by Ward Bond}. Not all battles take place in the ring, and all these vignettes in Corbett’s life make this a great entertaining picture. There are class problems that need to be overcome {played well when clubmates pay for knocking down a peg or two}, and Corbett must not only fight to earn the respect of his so-called peers, but also overcome his ego . as fast as his reputation. Along with the rather remarkable Corbett family and all their stoic comic support, Corbett's journey is as exciting as it is joyful, but as brash and courageous as he is, he is a very pleasant character, and it is a character that suits the labeled Gentleman Jim's nickname. <br /> <br /> The film never sags, and this testimony for director Raul Walsh that, although we are looking forward to the final fight, the outer ring keeps us firmly entertained, even the plot of love interest will not damage this picture { thank you Alexis Smith}. The sequences of fights are very well maintained, and they show perfectly how Corbett became the champion he was, his brand of dancing rings around the fighter-fighters is now firmly in boxing history. As the final videos roll, we will all descend to the ground, since the meeting of Sullivan and Corbett after the battle puts all the cruelty in context, and it is here that humility and humility become the absolute winner, and how far this viewer goes ... ... ....... it will be for me, to be sure, 9/10 for a really beautiful picture.
