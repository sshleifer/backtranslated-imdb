Just as Final Fantasy has taken CG to a whole new level, this is a rebirth for motion capture. Neither the film nor the cartoon, this film does not look like a tribute to the films Noir, Akira, Sin City, Blade Runner and the new generation of European cartoonists. You see Paris as it could be, the characters seem as real as you and me. They blink, stumble, tremble like real actors like never before. <br /> <br /> Do not look in the hope of finding a deceiver of the mind. Most likely, you will understand this before you are halfway from the movie. The script, of course, is too simplified compared to the famous thrillers, but this is definitely a bliss for the eyes.
