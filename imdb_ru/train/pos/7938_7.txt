Rob Estes, Josie Bisset, and a bunch of kids who aren't at all like any of them. <br /> <br /> In essence, Rob and Josie are having a wedding with a shotgun on a drunken night during a vacation in Vegas. Each of them comes home and discovers that their respective children already know about the marriage because of the tabloid type, and not because of the fodder. They, Rob and Josie, move them both and their eight children to the house of one or the other. I think Rob builds furniture that is close enough to Frank Lambert (Patrick Duffy )’s work on building is very similar to Step by Step to justify the eternal mockery. <br /> <br /> Josie is a kind of queen making cookies, although she doesn't seem to make any of them. Not close enough to Carol Foster (Suzanne Somers) hairdressing to justify mocking similarity, but funny enough to justify mocking atrocity. <br /> <br /> Unlike Step by Step, they were a couple before the holidays and actually knew one’s surnames of the others, or so, if they were serious enough about their relationship to go on a trip together . <br /> <br /> In any case, eight children; Moira, Sandy, Jeff, Lily, Daisy, Nathan, Andrew L. and Andrew B. I personally think that they should have just called younger Andrew "Andy." <br /> <br /> There are many product placement, especially for Soup at hand (which is disgusting) and Listerine Pocket Packs. There are also some silly, meaningless moments. It is also not a good movie to promote happy families. <br /> <br /> But hey! Rob Estes! This concludes my review “Step by Step ... on some really bad drugs”. Watch out for Rob Estes and his beautiful eyes! There are great shots!
