I saw this film at the Vancouver Film Festival and thought it was deadly intelligent, stylish and funny. <br /> <br /> Cast was ROCK SOLID. Magnificent work of Carrie Ann Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and others, Alexia Fast. <br /> <br /> Strange, I thought about the film for several days after seeing it. <Br /> <br /> Writers Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomyak and Andrew Kerry put a lot of political overtones, but they didnâ€™t impress you. <br /> <br /> The world they created had depth, and made sense. In this film, there is a frivolous carnivorous spirit. <br /> <br /> FIDO is guaranteed to heal disgust. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it !!!
