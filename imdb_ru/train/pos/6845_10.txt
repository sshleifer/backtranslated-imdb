"Dressed to Kill" is definitely one of the best horror / thriller films ever made. It is a tight, stylish and extremely tense mix of sex and violence. The game is good, Pinot Donaggio's orchestral score is unforgettable, and there are many surprises to intrigue thriller fans. Dressed in Murder is a murder mystery involving an upset housewife (Angie Dickinson), her teenage son (Keith Gordon), her psychoanalyst (Michael Kane) and a call girl (Nancy Allen)). The killer in the film is a transsexual named Bobby, who is also one of Kane's patients. The film is full of exciting moments: the infamous scene of the killing of elevators is very stylish and rather terrible.
