I just finished watching this movie and found it very enjoyable. This is a quiet, small film that does not overwhelm you with special effects or "big" performances. It will simply take you into the lives of people living in a small village in the depths of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas plays Raymond Toker, a young loner who finds an abandoned child in the woods. Toker’s search for a child’s parents leads him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life. David Srathearn plays Truman Lester, a slimy crook with a hidden motive. And David plays the bad guy to perfection. <br /> <br /> This film is much more than it seems at first glance. Filmed on location in North Carolina and with a wonderful soundtrack of traditional music, worth seeing.
