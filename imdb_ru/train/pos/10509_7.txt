I did not read the novel, although I understand that this is somewhat different from him; the fact that I liked it, combined with the fact that this is really not my genre, leads me to the decision not to continue reading the book. Without reading a word from Austin's writings, I really can't compare it to any of her works. What I can say is that almost every line in this dialogue is clever, witty and well-delivered, as well as the biggest source of comedy in this. It made me laugh a lot, with beautiful English and verbal material. Each actor's performance goes in one place, and Paltrow plays the role of matchmaking completely. Characters are well written, trustworthy and consistent. However, I found a couple of them extremely annoying, and although I think that at least some of them should have been funny, it tended to repeat excessively, and, frankly, it was not funny the first time they appeared. Editing and cinematography are amazing, and everything looks absolutely gorgeous. Story and walking are great, you never get bored. It ends * really * in an obvious way, but perhaps this is what viewers prefer. I can not say that it did not entertain me, it did from beginning to end, and I would look at it again. This is a brief wording. I recommend this to any lover of romantic stories. 7/10
