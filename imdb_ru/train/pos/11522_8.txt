I have long wanted to see this, James Merendino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite films, and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought that after this it would be a great continuation, but it starts to draw. The play and the direction were amazing. In fact, everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script. Sometimes the only thing that kept my attention was that the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This film was good, but I expected more. <br /> <br /> P.S. Look for great cameos by Chi McBride and Chris MacDonald.
