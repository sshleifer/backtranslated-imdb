Olivier, Cosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli and Almeraeda are all directors of Hamlet, but Brana is the only one who understood this correctly. <br /> <br /> This is the only Hamlet film that contains the full four hours of William Shakespeare's Masterpiece and gives a unique sense of the whole story. <br /> <br /> Not many directors could cope with it without bored with their audience, but Bran’s skillful use of the Bravora style and tricks allow people to understand the importance of scenes that are usually cut out. <br /> <br /> As an example, Gerard Depard as Ranialdo, whose goal in the film is to simply say “yes, my lord,” when Polonius asks him to spy on Lirth. It also included Billy Crystal as the grave-digger, Robin Williams as Osric, Jack Lemmon as Marcellus and Charlton Heston as an actor. <br /> <br /> Brana with a monologue "Scene 4 4 ​​act" (which, as a rule, is usually cut). out) is nothing more than a cinematic miracle, as the camera slowly moves back as the intensity increases. This is a scene that literally made me jump out of my chair and start applauding. <br /> <br /> Brana is the only director who understood the importance of each scene in this film and knew how to convey this meaning. for a wider audience. <br /> <br /> This is a must see for everyone who likes good story-telling, brilliant play and incredible guidance. All of these are the greatest triumphs of William Shakespeare.
