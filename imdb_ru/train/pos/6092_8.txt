Cult classics are almost impossible to predict. Who would have thought that Vision Quest, Fight Club and 2001: A Space Odyssey, films that were panned by critics and audiences after they were released, would be incredibly popular? Like many other IMDBers, I consider myself an expert in film. Unlike most of those who hated Envy (as evidenced by the gloomy rating in 4.4), I found Envy one of the funniest films in the past decade. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is funny. The dialogue is not clever, the scenes have little continuity, and the script seems to have been written by a fourth-grader. But that is why the film is so funny. You see, to appreciate the random genius of Envy, you must enjoy the film from an ironically-independent point of view. <br /> <br /> Why do I love Envy? Because the film is bad to the extent that it becomes good. This is a recipe for cult classics, and Envy definitely meets all the requirements.
