"The first war will be 100% outsourced." Dan Aroyd Line says it all. It is difficult to describe the film; comedy, satire, thriller, scrambler. It reminded me once or twice about Dr. Strenglow, especially in scenes with Ben Kingsley (who, I think, did a wonderful job). I didn’t have much to expect from this movie, although I’m a big John Cusack fan, so I just let the film cover me. And as a result, I was quite entertained. Political satire is painfully accurate and pretty damn for the US military business complex. The plots were somewhat predictable, but the final interweaving of storylines made them all worthwhile. I can understand why this film was not very popular in the USA, but for the rest of the world it is a timely story.
