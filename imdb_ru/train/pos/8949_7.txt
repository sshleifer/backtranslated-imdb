In the movie "Dizziness", Stuart (in his last turn as a romantic leader) and Nowak raise this, another film by Stuart "The Christmas Film", to an entertainment level above average. The chemistry between the two stars creates a rather exciting experience, and further revelation can be gleaned from the film if witchcraft is viewed as a metaphor for private pain that hinders the relationship of many people. In general, a good diversion with legendary stars, 7/10.
