I was lucky to see this film on the preview a few years ago, and outside the theater I was confronted with the crew of the local TV channel, who was looking for comments on the film. At that time, the only word that escaped my mouth was: “Excellent. Just awesome". I like to think that I can formulate myself a little better, but at the time I was not able to do it. <br /> <br /> This story is intriguing and makes you think, and acting is first among all principles. This film was the first to be shot by Terry Gilliam, to whom he had no hand in writing. Returning to the "Universal" after a long and difficult battle with them for "Brazil", Terry achieved what he wanted most of all; "final version". Terry is a master and his every shot is like a well-thought-out picture that has been carefully composed with determination and conviction. It is true that such a person should be free in his attempts to convey the concept. Unfortunately, restrictions still exist in such agreements. <br /> <br /> Universal Collector's Edition DVD is simply amazing, although most of the bonus features are not listed on the box. Among other things, it contains a sound commentary by the director / producer and a 90-minute informative and extremely interesting documentary about the making of the film called “The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys”. It talks about some of the creative traps in filmmaking, including serious challenges, when previews showed poor results, hitting the team with self-doubt and despair. Fortunately, for all of us they decided to change the film a little and released it with great success. <br /> <br />
