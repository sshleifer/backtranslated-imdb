I rated it ten only because I find it so impressive that one eighteen-year-old can do with a video camera. It's not epic, but a lot of interesting, and I have never been bored. If tens of millions of dollars can go to countless bad movies that are poured in droves, then give this director as much money and see what happens. I know I'll be in line at the local cinema for its first major release. Damn good job and worth the money. What a script! It may be a low-budget project, but itâ€™s a hell of a half of the main paintings I've seen lately. Nanawati knows how to tell a story, both in writing and on screen. Serious respect for her, can't wait to see more.
