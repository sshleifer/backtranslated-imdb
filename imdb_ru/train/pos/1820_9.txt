I remember this film since I was a small child, I loved it then and still love it. I managed to burn it to a DVD on my 18th birthday, and I was very happy because I used to find it so difficult to find and hire it only when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie, because he is learning to be a good dog. The film is filled with fun songs and music. The animation is great and the voices of the characters are perfect. This film has always been a tear for me, but I think that if I had not seen this film when I was small, I would not have found it as brilliant and fascinating as I, although I still believe that it is still like it because I am really in animated films.
