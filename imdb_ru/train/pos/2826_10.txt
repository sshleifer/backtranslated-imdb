I was given the opportunity to watch this 1926 film in the superbly restored theater, which was once part of an extensive network of first-class vaudeville houses. This Paramount has Wurlitzer's Mighty Body also superbly restored - it was used to accompany the silent films of the day. <br /> <br /> We are fortunate enough to have Dennis James, a key figure in the international renaissance of silent films in Mighty Wurlitzer, who played a relevant role. musical and thematic compositions suitable for the action of the film. The imprint was an almost perfect digital copy of a rapidly decomposing nitrate-negative, and all this experience was a unique chance to see a silent film the way it was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> This was the first American film by Greta Garbo. She was only 20 years old, but she already had 6 Swedish films in her repertoire. <br /> <br /> A bit ironic that this is a silent film about an opera star; In spite of the fact that “The Mighty Wurlitzer” added a lot to the stage scene, much needed to be left to the imagination. <br /> <br /> Modern viewers, for the most part, do not understand silent films ?? Acting then was different, with broad gestures and broad facial expressions. Therefore, the audience laugh at the wrong time ?? the action is seen as “hammy” and exaggerated but it was just the style of that period. <br /> <br /> Garbo, with all her subtlety, did much to usher in a new era of acting: she could say more with a half-closed eye, and the volumes could be read down by gaze or simply by shrugging their shoulders. It illustrates the truth that "a picture is worth a thousand words." <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it was Garbo’s first American film, it’s quite obvious that the studio knew what they had in their hands: it was MGM’s best shot. The sets and costumes were great. Special effects ?? which by today's standards are pretty weak ?? were still electrified and amazing. <br /> <br /> The Vicente Blasco Ibanesa script (from Entre Naranjos novel) seems to have been created especially for Garbo; it demonstrates her strengths, increases her assets, and there are no unpleasant language problems to deal with: a Swedish actress can play a Spanish seductress without suspending disbelief on our part. <br /> <br /> Her partner was MGM's answer to Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortes. He does a wonderful job and did what few romantic stars of the time would have done in the film: allowing yourself to look inactive, look silly and grow old is ungrateful. <br /> <br /> There are some pretty good parts of the character that have more than adequately acted ?? especially considering the power station, which was Garbo. Among them stand out Lucien Littlefield in the role of "Cupid" and Martha Mattox in the role of Doni Bernarda Brul. "<br /> <br /> This is when the outstanding cinematographer William H. Daniels met Garbo ?? they continued to make 20 films together. (He was a cinematographer in 157 films, and his career lasted five decades!) He was able to capture her ethereal beauty, and it was his picture that was mainly responsible for the nickname that made her famous: The Divine Garbo. Without his excellent abilities, she would not have achieved such success. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is too rare an opportunity: if you have such an opportunity, do not miss it.
