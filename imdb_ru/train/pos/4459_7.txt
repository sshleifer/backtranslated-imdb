For films like Anchors Aweigh, few have been awarded so many Oscars in the warm-up for happy hour. Either 1945 was a besieged year for a good film, or they were still shocked by Billy Wilder's "Lost Weekend" that they wrote something in the bulletin starting with the letter A to better picture the still musical loyal to the public. Since Gene Kelly was nominated for this performance, and not for the role in "Singin 'in the Rain", there must have been something wrong with the backstage tampering systems in MGM. Of course, the studio behaves best during this lauded tour of the great studios and Hollywood itself, which is convenient for those who are stuck on the other side of the world. <br /> <br /> Still, the musical with a sailor suit, the brilliant talents of Gene and Frank Sinatra, is certainly a pleasant farce, despite the fact that more people are yawning on the previews of the musical, so that today's audience is not deprived of unnecessary lead times. Before and since then there have been many longer works, but in this case all the charming scenes of Katherine Grayson could be eliminated. Before watching Kiss Me, Kate, it may have been necessary for non-operatic enthusiasts to watch any of her films with a remote control in their hands. <br /> <br /> If it became necessary to practice picking women for the On the Town in 1949, then perhaps the sailors who went ashore did not have to promise to audition with Jose Iturbi and take up the piano for a sincere performance of "Suzy." Few were lucky to pass the screen test in the MGM gold studios. Then a little lucky that they are treated. There are no regrets about the successful tests on the screen of Susan Abbott or Kathryn Grayson, but this gives constant hope to the non-operative enthusiast that in the end the pink piece will be given to both. <br /> <br /> But with all that stellar talent is in good shape, and the score is above average, it adds up to a small but amusing splendid history of the navy, intertwined with young ambitious navy boys, suitable for late morale blasts, makes `Anchors at least not question the choice of the wrong MGM movie. The direction is preserved, as the cast has a story in beautiful color cinema. Whenever someone bursts into music or a song, the film becomes a joyous event. <br /> <br /> The film’s natural highlight is Gina Kelly’s cartoons in a dreamland, culminating in a brilliant dance with Jerry Mouse. This is a well-deserved masterpiece in Kelly's career, and it's nice to know that he thought about this before Fred Aster began to dance on the walls and ceilings. <br /> <br /> This is not exactly what you need for triple color sprinkle with rainbow, chocolate-wafer, cream-cherry and banana sausages, but it is a piece of a solid piece of sugar that somehow melts in your mouth and, despite on feeling guilty, remains a pleasant feeling. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
