There were a lot of films shot by Hollywood during the war years, which were designed to enlist the support of our troops from the public. Today, they can dismiss them or simply perceive them as propaganda, which is technically, but positive, and intended to unite the nation. This film is a rather effective and interesting example of a genre - with a rather realistic scenario and good production value. Pat O'Brien plays basically the same character he played in MANY other films (you know, tough, hard, but "tough guy"). Randolph Scott, as always, is competent and interesting, and the rest of the extras are excellent (look for young Robert Ryan as one of the top scorers in training). Although the story resembles several other films about our pilots and crews, the film is well thought out enough to make it interesting and not too contrived. That it is possible, except for the very end - where the film is a bit excessive, but also VERY satisfactory. The only serious drawback, and mainly for cavil, is that some shots are somewhat casually integrated into the film, and “crazy”, as I, as history teachers and aircraft lovers, will surely notice, all probably won't notice
