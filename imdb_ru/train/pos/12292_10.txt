I like this film, Jouve, Arletti, Blière, Carne ... almost everything is already said about the film, but there is one detail to which I would like to shed light: there are no real frames still standing, Hôtel du Nord (still? I heard it had to be demolished ...) was used for the film - the whole scene was restored on the set, the main reason is that they could not stop the movement on St. Martin for a few weeks.
