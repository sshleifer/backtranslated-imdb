This is singing. This is a drama. This is a comedy. He has a story. This is one of the greatest films ever made ... period. If you cannot enjoy this film, it means that you either sleep or suffer from a mental disorder. In Yankee Doodle Dandy, James Cagney sings and dances his way to the Oscars; but in this film it is BETTER! This is James Cagney at his best. BEST! He is quick with one-liners! He is fast with his legs! This is a non-stop action. And songs and dances are classics, especially "Shanghai Lil". And the cast is great; and the whole movie is optimistic, moving fast and exuding confidence. And although this film was made over 70 years ago, it is still available for viewing, even today. And, of course, in this film, Miss Ruby Keeler (who was married to Al Jolson). She is the perfect partner for James Cagney ... and Dick Powell too! If you like fun, fast-paced movies with lots of singing and dancing, then this movie is worth watching.
