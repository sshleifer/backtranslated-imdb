Both my friend and I thought this film was well made. We expected a frivolous comedy, but received a full-length action movie with comics. We both thought that this film might not have been successful at the box office, since the preview makes us believe that it is a comedy. I was impressed with the support actors, and of course Dave Morse always does an amazing acting job. Most of the support staff are veterans, not newcomers, and they were solid. We both felt that the writing and the direction were first-class, and made comments to each other about the purchase of this film. If you are not buying, rent it for a good time.
