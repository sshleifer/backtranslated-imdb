Is German private television not well known for copying the Dutch and of course ?? American formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, xeroxism just got to the basics: Screwball. <br /> <br /> You can not tolerate a comic comedy? Don't look at Edel and Stark. Seriously. If you are expecting another law drama, similar to Law and order or something like that, well, go somewhere else. (Or look at “Law and Order” because he is great in his actions, but I digress.) <br /> <br /> To be honest, I’m very worried that the writers didn’t get the best offers after the series finale. And my cynical nature must be restructured in relation to private German television production. Residents of Germany will understand what I'm talking about. In short: look. I have no idea what English sync is like, but hey, learn German to see their four seasons. A pseudo-happy ending is included.
