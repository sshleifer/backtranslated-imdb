I have seen the Blob several times, and this is one of the best low-budget films about alien invasions of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> A strange meteor lands not far from a small town, and an elderly man sets out to investigate. A strange substance, similar to jelly, is then attached to one of his hands, and a young couple, who saw that the meteorite earth arrived on time and took it to a local doctor, where the old man is completely absorbed by the mass. The doctor and his nurse are the next victims, and the mass is growing. When these incidents are reported to the police, they do not believe the young couple and accuse them of having invented it all. They finally believe them when there is a mass in the cityâ€™s cinema, now huge, and everyone runs screaming through the streets. Then he joins the diner with a young couple and some others inside. Blob stops, spraying a load of fire extinguishers on him, and he freezes, which is his weakness. It is then transported by plane to the frozen Arctic waste and is disposed of there. But it is only frozen, not dead ... <br /> <br /> In this film, the situation typical of its period: teenagers and a small town. In the beginning, Blob has a good rock and roll song, and the film is really atmospheric. <br /> <br /> Continued, Caution! Blob followed in 1972, and the remake came in 1988, but this is the best of The Blob films. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) starred, and this film made him a star. and Aneta Corso plays her friend. I am not familiar with any of the other stars. <br /> <br /> Blob is what all science fiction fans need to see. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
