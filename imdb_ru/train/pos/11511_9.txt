Weak scenarios at times? Aha Vicious special effects at times? Aha Delightfully guilty pleasure most of the time? Aha More about Karl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Aha In my childhood I always loved science fiction, but I found so many things from Dracula, Frankenstein, Mummy and horrors, and not so much shit. Abbott and Costello needed to give me a new look at the classic universal monsters, and Karl Kolchak took me to the “dark side” of entertainment. The Duke had the Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck Magnum, Darren McGavin had Karl Kolchak. Mixed with all these weak scenarios, stupid special effects, this baroque group of supporting characters, actors and guest stars, Darren McGavin was in the role of Karl Kolchak. He had a strange sense of humor, despite the danger, he was an idealist in his pursuit of truth and a realist in accepting compulsory incompetence and possible concealment by government officials. In addition, unlike 98% of us, Kolchak was ready to stick his neck out and do what had to be done, even if it meant his demise, the end of his journalistic career or imprisonment. With all his flaws, including the lack of taste in clothes, Karl Kolchak was a charming and witty man who drove a beautiful classic yellow Mustang (at the time it was an old used car) to save the day for humanity. As good as any other fictional hero, Karl Kolchak was a man in the street who was brought to life every week for one season thanks to Darren McGevin. Now that he has been filmed and his show is on DVD, I hope that it will be just as fun to watch as I watch him play Kolchak The Night Stalker merrily again and again!
