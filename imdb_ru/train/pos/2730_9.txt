I saw it in the theater at the time of its first release, and then it was disturbing, as I am sure that there will still be. It was the first part of the 68th, and she was still making rounds in cities across America, and a massacre recently occurred in my hometown, where I saw it when one person was furious. The freshness of this event close to home combined with this dramatized true story led to a very exciting theatrical experience. It really enlivened the magnificent game of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I was familiar with the novel, based on Truman Capote’s true event, and Richard Brooks’s script and direction, wove the event and Truman’s interpretation into an irresistible hard cinematic adaptation. Music from Quincy Jones effectively assesses its history. Since then, I've only seen this a couple of times. It was too real. Almost like to witness the crime and ride with the killers. I would give 9.0 out of 10 possible. Society today is so desensitized to violence and crime that it probably seems slow and tame, and it can be viewed with less effect, but for those over 50, this will be a hallmark in investigating the crime of mind.
