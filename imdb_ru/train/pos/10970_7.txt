A fascinating, but disturbing look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) Aunt and cousin of the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. They live in an abandoned rodent-infested mansion, which the city considered dangerous to health. It quickly becomes clear that these two have long been eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the best because she’s acting with the ten-year-old’s thinking, although she’s actually 53 years old. The content largely consists of two things. The first was Little Edie Lambastes Big Edie talk, because she chased away all her potential suitors and destroyed her desire to become a writer, actress and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, meaningless and often amusing. The second part consists of long attempts at singing from both sides. Everyone, of course, thinks their singing is perfect, and only the other one sounds bad. In one amazing scene, Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with his cane to make her stop trembling. Very exciting, but there is a feeling that some serious exploitation is taking place here, and the subjects have gone too far to understand this. It seems that the filmmakers treat this as a strange circus show, which every day comes to record (and laugh) any strange behavior. In the end, this is a sad picture, because it shows how the world just passed by these two. Their hopes and dreams are destroyed in the same way as the mansion in which they live. Despite the quarrels, these two need each other more than ever. Without the other, there would be no refuge from loneliness. The most amazing trait comes from Big Edie, whose many cats feel better in her bedroom. Her response to the smell complaint is incredible.
