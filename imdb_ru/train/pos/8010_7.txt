I used to think that this film was the most lame of the Muppet films. I would like to reject this statement now. In my opinion, the worst movie of MUppet was the TV movie "This is a very merry Christmas doll, this is a wonderful life that was really horrible." MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is not special, but much nicer than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. <br /> <br /> The best songs are the song “You Can’t Answer Without Answer”, which the Muppets sing, and the songs for the biggest final. Since I liked the Muppet Babies TV show, I really liked the Muppet Babies episode here (I was told that this was what inspired the Muppet Babies show). <br /> <br /> The show itself MANHATTAN MELODIES has become a real show show Dolls from Sesame Street even appear at the wedding. As Kermit says, in his last line “What could be better?”. But I would like to see what was between the beginning and the end more interesting. There are cute cameos from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a magnificent dance sequence from Rizzo and Rats (set by the late great Jim Henson), and the film is certainly entertaining. I must declare, however, that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are the three main films of MUppet.
