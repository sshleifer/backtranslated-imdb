In Iran, women are officially prohibited from participating in sports activities for men. In June 2005, the Iranian national football team played an important game against Bahrain at the Azadi Stadium to qualify for the World Cup. A group of Iranian girls and football suit lovers, such as boys, unsuccessfully trying to get to the stadium after being arrested. <br /> <br /> Football (and Flamengo team), beach and cinema are my biggest hobbies; so I loved this little gem about a group of girls and their passion for football. Director Jafar Panahi from “White Balloon”, “Mirror” and “Circle” made this film on the day when Iran defeated Bahrain and was selected for the World Cup in Germany. The dramatic and funny adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): not available.
