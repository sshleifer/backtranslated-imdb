One and only was a great movie. I just finished watching it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought that this is a good image of what the life of a professional wrestler is like. Now this film was made 4 years before my birth, but I donâ€™t think that the difficulties of professional wrestling have changed a lot. Sad, funny, and everything around is great! **** 10+
