One of the best love stories I've ever seen. It’s a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion, but it's great nonetheless ... Big Edie and Little Edie look a bit like family members after watching this movie many times, and you can endlessly quote them: “It's a damn beautiful day, Will you just shut up now? The introductory explanation for Little Edie's costume only promises that the film will live forever, just like Big Edie's "World-famous Singer" and Little Edie's "World Famous Dancer."
