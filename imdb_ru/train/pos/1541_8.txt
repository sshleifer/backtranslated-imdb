Just watched this film today at the Seattle International Film Festival and got a great pleasure from it. <br /> <br /> Excellent script and directorial work, excellent and believable interaction between the actors, as well as a great time for comics. <br /> <This film covers topics that are universal - family and separation. As a result, I see how European, Asian and American viewers find points of similarity between this film and their own lives. <br /> <br /> If all this is not enough, this could be the best underground film about the date ... someone spreads it in the USA, please! <br /> <br /> Finally: thank you, Maria Flom! This is a really great movie.
