Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation in his quest for freedom in India, ignored his family and son, this film about his son Hiralaal, who feels forgotten because of the service of Mahatma Gandhi to society. The film begins in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi works as a lawyer and fights for the freedom of India against the British. Hiraral arrives in South Africa to help his father, who is a lawyer, because Gandhi was involved in the freedom struggle, he wanted his wife and children to join him as a public service, and as a result, HÄ±rralal has no chance of completing his education and not passing examinations, he marries his love gulab (bhomika chavla) against the wishes of his father. Hiralal has ambitions to go to England and become a lawyer, like his father, but his own dad refuses to give him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman, and instead gives her to another person, saying that the scholarship should not be limited to his family and should open to the most worthy student living in the colony. This makes Hiralal angry and the gap between father and son is widening, Hirallal hates his father for neglecting him and accuses him of being uneducated and unemployed. Hiralal struggles to make ends meet, and lands on the streets due to unsuccessful business attempts, and in a huge debt he loses his wife and children. Akshay Khanna gave a stellar performance in the role of Hiralal Gandhi ... thanks to him all, the direction and script are fantastic, a great picture. Overall, a great movie that you definitely need to watch. I put it on 10/10
