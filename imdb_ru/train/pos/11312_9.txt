Ossessione is in very poor condition, but is currently undergoing complete restoration at the Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The material used is the “Positive Master” of the 2nd generation, originally from print, Visconti was able to hide from the fascists. It was scanned with Spirit 4K (as 2K RGB data) and then processed using the DaVinci Revival recovery program. After this, all the rest is manual labor, and we do not expect the end until the beginning of spring. Sometime next year it should be available on DVD and hopefully also released on HD DVD. This film is beautiful, and we hope that the recovery efforts will appeal to many generations.
