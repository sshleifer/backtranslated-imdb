In fact, the story of the two daring brothers and their respective falls due to grace (because of drug addiction) and subsequent redemption. One brother, the self-proclaimed genius played by James Franco, is your typical sensitive but intelligent male child. The other brother is a hardworking future doctor who becomes less judgmental because he himself becomes a victim of addiction, dealing with stress, meeting his familyâ€™s expectations for both children. Not too cruel, as we would like, from fairy tales about drugs, and, in general, quite a realistic essay on the family dynamics caused by problems with drugs. I would recommend him to anyone interested in such character studies, and thanked James Franco for his efforts in what was clearly a love affair.
