“They all laughed” - is this magnificent Peter Bogdanovich, who finally receives the recognition he deserves, and why? For many reasons, the fact that it is set in New York, which really sets the tone, is a fantastic soundtrack, an attractive star from Ben Gazzar and the late John Ritter, who is great. and, of course, no classics do without Audrey Hepburn. the film is a light and fresh romantic comedy, which is very similar to the comic comedy of the thirties, a film about the Odyssey detective agency, led by Gazzara, who smokes and roller-skates with eccentric Blaine Novak (film co-producer) and John Ritter, mainly “Gazzar” falls in love with the wife of a rich magnate magnate (Hepburn), and Ritter falls in love with the beautiful Dorothy Stratten, sadly killed shamefully after the production: Ogdanovich.
