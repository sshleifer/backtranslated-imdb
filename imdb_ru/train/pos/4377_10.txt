The beginning, mid-90s, in my opinion, was the culmination of historical drama. The last of the Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy - all portrayed distinctive passion and intensity in their respective time periods. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy was a unique and intriguing taste of time and place, rarely represented by the film. It really has everything - an interesting story, a great game, a wonderful dialogue and breathtaking landscapes. I was particularly impressed with the seemingly genuine dialogue. I can imagine how people at the beginning of the 18th century spoke and behaved. <br /> <br /> What else surprised me was the vulgarity expressed by the characters. I found it more disgusting and shocking, although often more subtle than most of those found in contemporary films. The film had a very sharp and sexually rich plot that was unique and, most likely, very realistic in the context of the era. <br /> <br /> The pace was very tense, with a barely dull moment. There were many intrigues and political plots that made the situation a bit more complicated, but still did not distract from the main storyline. <br /> <br /> The action was also very well done and exciting. Something that I will find wonderful forever is that during the main event there is no soundtrack in the film. This creates a very intense, exciting sequence, as we have no musical hint of the direction and resolution of the scene. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy will always be number one on my list of favorite movies. I would recommend this to everyone.
