He-he-hi !! This is a really funny movie. In fact, in Party Girl, you have a fun, independent girl from New York in the early 90s. Together with her friends at the party she meets a mature Turkish seller. This is the age of majority for those new adults who are looking for what they want to do. Nice to see how a slacker turns into a mature woman. Hope is given to all of us, idlers, who, perhaps, feel that their only skills are the ability to maintain while they are beaten with a hammer, and a knack for holding good parties. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey makes this movie gorgeous. I have never been her big fan, but this film makes me just want to watch all of her films. There are subtle manerisms that have perfected her character. If you want to have a good laugh and have fun, be sure to watch this movie. Repeated views are required.
