I thought it was a great movie for children 6-12 years old. A bit witty, but the story is uplifting in a new way. This proves that teen dreams can truly become reality. I think this is a great story for any child who feels depressed or feels as if trying to deceive too many things among them. Very "cute" movie. Bravo.
