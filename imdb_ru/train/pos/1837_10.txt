Just a great movie, no doubt about it. Great story and great performances, whether Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. Film production in Hindi goes shamelessly with Mallika and Co., this film is absolutely free from vulgarity and, therefore, doomed to failure in vulgarity, causing dependence on our Indian society. But the idea and concept of this film is absolutely superb. Anu Malik (a boring imitator) could have been avoided, and Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reschiy could be used as a musician. I think Vipul Shah should have touched Gujarati a little, especially in music. Anu Malik is the worst musician in the world, and he considers himself a pop star, but this is not the film where presence is required - he looks good with songs in the style of Govinda. I felt good serious music with a couple of good gazelles or sad songs that could make this film more memorable.
