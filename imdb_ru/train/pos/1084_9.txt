Reflections: pure delight from start to finish. Not violent laughter, but more subtle, sophisticated humor. What a goldmine of great scenes and character actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paivu, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant is on the construction site of his new home, which is framed at this moment. The young carpenter, who will be played by the future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his "fake warts" or something that only a carpenter would know. Grant, not wanting to seem ignorant, replies in the affirmative. At the same time, Barker shouts to his comrades: “Well, guys, he wants them to quarrel, so ... KEEP EM!” A second later, you will hear ragged and tearing sounds, when about 20 large nails are pulled out from various boards. All Grant can do is moan. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is dated. You would never see so many carpenters working at the same time in a single-family house, and in a place like Connecticut, for example, you could have earned several million dollars. <br /> <br /> A classic film that is truly a treasure.
