Christopher Lloyd is fun and truly believable, like "Al main angel". This film is much better than the first one, but it has excellent special effects that the first one did not have, as well as a much better plot and script. <br /> <br /> Good - it was written for children, but adults have as much fun as children. Tony Danza is very realistic in her role, but this is NOT a Taxi reunion. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is really good and even seems very human in his emotions, and also demonstrates real acting talent. for a change, a pleasant change. <br /> <br /> Watch at least once - worth it to catch.
