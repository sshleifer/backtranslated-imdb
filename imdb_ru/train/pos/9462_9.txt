Clean family movie. I laughed, I cried ... I liked it. I was worried that I couldnâ€™t see Steve Carrell by any other stupid Michael from the Office. Boy, I was wrong. He must win an Oscar for his performance. I will definitely buy it on DVD when it comes out. My husband liked it, and he is not interested in films of this type. I saw it with two other couples in the 30-year range, and we all agreed that it was the best film we have seen in LONG time and, of course, the cleanest. Only 1 curse word! Not even sure why it was PG13. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy, drama, melodrama and more!
