I would like to laugh again, just like when I first saw this show. Since then, I have not done so. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that I laugh almost as much after watching the show again and again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard is educated, astute, a man of the world. He speaks deftly of politics, but does not feel the need to "participate" in political debate. He is above it. I would set him up against George Carlin, who uses his comedy to try to convince people of his ideas, and he doesn't seem to like the fact that he is trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> The funniest guy on earth
