I see what my ancestors saw in young Betty Davis. She's gorgeous throughout this almost insane political comedy, in which Warren Williams plays the role of a political operative who constantly defends his child support. Vivien Osborne is gorgeous, like his ex, and I was always rooting for her. The character Williams is not at all cute, and he is not even a decent opera. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibby is one of the best in his business. As a candidate, he was pulled out of sleep at a political congress and put forward a candidate for governor to prevent the nomination of a rival candidate, so this whole mess is connected with an internecine political war in a party called the Progressive Party. If you are a political thinker, you will probably see a different side than the one with which you are connected, as reflected in the fictional "Progressive Party" by Williams and Kibby. I could draw exact parallels, but we are not here for that. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies. If you've ever watched any of the old Wheeler & Woolsey games (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, THE RAINMAKERS), you will find that Frank McHugh, like the right arm of Williams, looks and behaves like Burt Wheeler. He fooled me. <br /> <br /> Yes, my wife and I recommend it.
