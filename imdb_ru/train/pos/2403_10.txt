I must warn you there are several spoilers in it. But for starters, I think I received the "Spanish judges" in February. It was mentioned that it was the last copy, but as I see it was not ordered. But in any case, I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see it mainly because of the great actor Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised that no one mentions the scar in the reviews), although this is kind of low-budget, getting money to make this film would be worth spending. Dude, what a good actor. <br /> <br /> The story of a scammer known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who “claims” that he has goods called Spanish Judges. If you don’t know what Spanish judges are or didn’t see a trailer for this, and this is the first review you read, I won’t even tell who they are. I believe that this will be a big turn, no one knew what it was. He needs protection, so he hires a couple, who are also fraudsters, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino), as well as a scammer whose name is Pees (Marc Boone Junior). He has a girlfriend who won't even tell anyone what her name is, because, as she said, she is from Mars. So they (mostly Jack) call her "Girl Mars". It all starts well, but then turns into one big game. A game that includes some lust, lies and betrayal. <br /> <br /> There were some excessive actions in it (Matt and Valeria, as well as Tamara were not among them). There were some scenes that they could have done better, and the score could have been a little better. Some grades were actually good. The theme they used to start and finish (before the credits) was a good choice of the song, this is my opinion. After all, the scene of the battle could have been a little longer and a bit more brutal, but what can you do? Another comment to Matt: Damn, he plays a smooth, clever con man. <br /> <br /> I know this is a review, but I need to make an amendment regarding NeCRo, one of the reviewers: Valeria Golino is not a newcomer. According to this site, it has been operating since 1983. For me and, I hope for others, she is well known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love interest in both Hot Shots! films. But a good review. <br /> <br /> Although I think this is one of the rare films I've seen, and it’s really good (that’s why I put it 10 stars higher), I’ll give a rating for what I thought when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
