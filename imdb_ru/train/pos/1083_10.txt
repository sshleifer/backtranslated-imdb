Another example of Cary Grant's unique talents. A performance worthy of Oscarâ€™s attention once again avoided the Academy. Mr. Grant in this amazing comedy tells about a man who decides to leave the big city. Pitfalls in the construction of the house are well described and became the basis (in a broader sense) for the more modern car Tom Hanks "Pit of Money." <br /> <br /> If you like the old, old-fashioned comedy without curses and free sex, this film is a must see.
