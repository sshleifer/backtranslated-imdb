I cannot say how closely the film follows the novel without ever reading a book, but since it takes about six and a half hours, it can be argued that most of the base is covered or, at least, we can say with some certainty That is not a compressed version of Reader's Digest. <br /> <br /> Production performance is high, which is consistent with the standards of other classic BBC series such as the Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes. We can believe that London Dickens looked, sounded and thought the same. Sometimes minor mistakes happen - some sportsman shot a pistol with a shock cap in 1840 or 1820, or whenever it happened. <br /> <br /> The action also deserves applause. Suzanne Bourdain is a polite and honest heroine who quietly does good. She is also cute, in an adult way, her beauty is in her compassionate nature, and not in coquetry. Denholm Elliott - her guardian (and moreover, as it turned out). Burden and Elliott are two of the very few characters that are nice in their pure form. The other is a former sergeant who is forced to do evil by evil people. The other is a poor and helpless youth. <br /> <br /> I don't think anyone else could write this. He has all the signs of Dickens - poverty, tragic death, raw capitalism, a generous rich guy in his closed house, hidden origins, ulterior motives and powerlessness or outright malice of the justice system. Well, not the justice system as a whole, but the office, which, obviously, was the court that decided the issues related to the distribution of property. (So, I gathered from Wikipedia.) It became so notoriously rigid and stretched that it was carefully updated in England in 1973. Twice the character Elliott describes it as a "curse." The most impressive scene involves a lender luring money chasing a retired soldier at the gymnasium of the latter during a fencing lesson. The sergeant is more manly in the traditional sense than any other male character I remember from Dickens. The apoplectic lender and tenant shouts threats from his seat, and the sergeant turns to him and does one subtle exercise with a saber after another, each advancement brings him closer to his tormentor, while the old scarlet-faced creditor squeezes back into his place. <br /> <br /> A few things are missing. Often, Dickens inserts at least one or two funny lines of dialogue. (“Hooligan!” Or “The law is an ass.”) Not here. A "cold" house is the correct name. Secondly, there are practically no Weberian “ideal types” - neither Mr. Mykobers, nor cunning deceivers, nor Scroogee. Thirdly, the atmosphere, the whole look is relentlessly gloomy. One sorrow follows another, usually touching money or some shameful peccadillo from the past. <br /> <br /> My God, this is depressing. As if the author is releasing his spleen to everything he hated in the world he knew. Poverty, good. He KNEW poverty. But someone wonders what the office did with Dickens to deserve such treatment. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should add that I just watched the first episode of the 2005 series - and this is better in two ways. There's more lightning in the direction, so the pace is a little faster. And the Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce case is explained satisfactorily right away, and not hidden in the shadows as a mysterious “curse”, so the plot is easier to follow.
