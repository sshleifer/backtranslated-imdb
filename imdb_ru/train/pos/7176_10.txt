Well - you want to check on someone, how comfortable they are with adolescence and embarrassing and manic changes - and get their reaction right away by watching this scandalous document about children making socially significant horror films in the suburban 80s. More than any film I have ever seen, the film is dedicated to the burden of sexuality and the ego completely human, never boring and flared up in the form of virtue inherent in youth, bleached by the insane adult world, where any Fancy is accredited to everything from insanity to perversions. Mini-mogul Darren Steen seems to be seeking a deeper understanding of his triumphs and fears as the patriarch of a strict children's world. What he finds in himself and others is not always beautiful - but shows how you can improve and put up with age. Which means change without thinking. I love this film.
