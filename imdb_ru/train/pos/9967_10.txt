There are things that I will never understand; why underwear comes in packs of three pieces, when this is not enough. In the same way, I will never understand this movie, and it's great. If you approach this film in anticipation of a real film, you can also approach Satan in anticipation of hugs; although it is quite possible if you greet the satanic figures of this film. Take for example Peck; the most ineffective, camp, inhuman image of the devil since Freddie Mercury and Wayne Son joined forces to create a ten-foot Satan costume from red body paint and horns covered with condoms. Nonetheless, it creates some of the most fun moments of any film ever. Seriously, this is not an understatement. The same can be applied to any other character, except for a little girl who acts so painfully innocently that she probably compensates for some serious crime of which she is a part. On the other hand, if Santa's interplanetary reconnaissance station is real, there is no chance that she could have avoided him for so long. Simply put, if you have not seen this film, you can not consider yourself a serious lover. The incredibly funny character, the acting, the concept and the almost hidden racism make it a prerequisite for showing any movie today (if you need pure laughter).
