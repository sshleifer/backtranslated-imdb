I am 60 years old, I am a guitarist, (leader / rhythm), and over the past forty years I have been in four groups, it's all there, fights, dips, rotten food, worst housing. . But clubs, fans and music made it all worth it! Just like weird fruit! I'm too damn old for that now, and the arthritis in my arms and thighs doesn't mean more swaying, but for the duration of this video, it all came back, and it was all there! Birds, fights and booze! And I was young again! It's like the voice of Billy Connolly: God loves the things of the 70s! Rock forever!
