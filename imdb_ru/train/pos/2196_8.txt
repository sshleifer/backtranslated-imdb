... so for the 10 minutes that were missed, which were so terrible that they had to cut them out of the original movie? We were three years in the film's production code ... Barbara Stenvik played a major role in the original play, but here, Carol Lombard plays Maggie King. Co-star Fred McMurray is probably the best known for “Double Liberation,” along with Stanwick, as well as his popular TV show, My Three Sons. Watch out for young Dorothy Lamour (films of Bob Hope) and too incredible Franklin Pangborn who spiced up almost every film recorded on tape. Of course, he works in a beauty salon on the ship! Add the exalted Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good time and smart banter at the beginning. Maggie Ella's buddy is played by Gene Dixon, who was the best friend on the Holidays and My Man Godfrey. In "Swing High," Maggie, a tourist meets a soldier who leaves the army. Maggie misses her boat when she leaves the port and gets confused with a soldier. The dashing 20-year-old Quinn has a small stage at a local bar in Panama where Johnson (McMurray) plays the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth) and Skid unite and try to figure out how to return to the States. Good singing Lamour. Good (but brief) acting by Cecil Cunningham as “Murf,” the wise, gracious owner of the local showroom in Panama. While others complain about how bad it is, it was not so terrible, and even a little exotic, with fake furnishings in Central America for the first half of the film.
