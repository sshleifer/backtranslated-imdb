This is a nice movie, even if the premise is stupid. It was a kind of guilty pleasure to watch. Meg Ryan seems to be able to film roles in this type of film (another example is Joe vs. Vulcan). This is what makes her a star, in part. Walter Mattau, of course, also had this ability, and he really puts himself on the role, creating a funny, kindhearted Einstein. I suppose you could say that they are both good at portraying cute characters, although they are attractive in different ways (cute young women versus cute cheater).
