*** Maybe this is not a spoiler, but I will rather be cautious than careless *** I never saw this film when I was small. I fell in love with her for the first time when I saw her with my three year old daughter. I can watch it again and again. <br /> <br /> For the little actress that Aileen Woods made in her life, she was the perfect voice for Cinderella; very attractive; very believable Music is really perfect for a movie. The game was great; loved mice !! You really "hated" Lady Tremaine and the half-sisters; they were just awful. Cartoonists portrayed bad behavior very well. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, especially if you like love stories. My daughter watched this movie about 25 times, and in the end is still worried.
