It is a warm, funny film, almost the same as the work of Almodovar. Of course, he has a 10-year-old boy who sucks milk out of his chest, but the style is so playful that I cannot understand all those readers who find him sick or perverse (but I would like my 10-year-old son to play the part ? Not sure!). <br /> <br /> Spanish cinema is often quite sexy, but in a very open and healthy form, which leaves the viewer without a sense of voyeurism or inflection. I think that if we, the northern European types, had the same attitude, we would be much better as a result. <br /> <br /> This liberal attitude is also manifested in the cheerful character of Fartman Maurice. As his lover tells him: â€œMost people are embarrassed to fart. You make it into an art form.
