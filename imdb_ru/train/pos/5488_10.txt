The case of being in the right place at the right time. What an exciting movie. It is easy to see why Chavez is so popular among his people. He does things. It is available. And it’s also easy to see why the West hates him so much. He controls the resources of his country and returns profits to people. Mostly poor. And it's easy to see how television stations can portray misleading images to put things in there. Just like the war in Iraq or the war on terror. Or those who miss the weapons of mass destruction. Or how about the axis of evil. People need to wake up. And get different points of view. Stop the neo cones ruling the world. Go watch this movie with an open heart. And decide for yourself. Then I invite you to look at Aaron Russo’s book America: Freedom of Fascism. The problem is not the people of America. This is a government.
