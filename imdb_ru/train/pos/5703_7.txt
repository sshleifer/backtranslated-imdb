I'm a fan of Crash and Blade Runner, and this film covers some of the themes I like about death on the highway and 80s films, so I liked it. <br /> <br /> In general, the essential stupidity of the protagonist of the film noir does not do well with the female role, and its hero is almost Neanderthal, hence the warning of kitsch.
