In Manhattan, American middle class Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Mirna Loy) and two teenage daughters in a four-room and one bathroom that is leased. Jim works in an advertising agency, collecting $ 15,000 a year, and he is uncomfortable in his apartment due to lack of space. When he sees an advertisement for the sale of a huge house in the country of Connecticut at an affordable price, he travels with his wife and a real estate agent and decides to buy an old house without any technical advice. His best friend and lawyer, Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas) sends a friend engineer to inspect the house, and the man says that he should demolish the house and build another one. Jim checks the information with other engineers, and they all condemn this place, and he soon discovers that instead of a dream home, he bought a “money pit”. <br /> <br /> “Mr. Blandings is building his own house” is an extremely funny comedy, with witty lines and a first-class script. Cary Grant is hilarious in the role of a man driven by the urge to fulfill the American dream of owning a huge house that has found a bad choice, losing its connection and feeling jealous of its friend. In 1986, Tom Hanks starred in a very funny film, clearly inspired by this amazing classic “The Pit of Money”. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Lar, Meu Tormento” (“Home, My torment”)
