Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Victor McLaglen - three soldiers in India of the XIX century, who with the help of a water boy (Sam Jaffa) free the territory from the cult of murderous thugs. Chemistry between actors helps make this one of the most interesting films of all time. Sam Jaffe is exceptional as a rogue water boy who is mistreated by everyone and who still wants to be accepted as a fighter in the company. Based on a poem by Rudyard Kipling. Must see anyone who loves this type of movie.
