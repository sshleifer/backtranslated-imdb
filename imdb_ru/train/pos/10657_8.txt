Jeopardy has the feeling that this is a kind of serial film - one of the films that film studios pump out between big budget and box-office films. It's only 70 minutes, and there are not so many sets in it, and the only star is Barbara Stenwick. But what a star, of course. <br /> <br /> Stanwick is once again a tough lady when confronted with a runaway prisoner when she seeks help for her trapped husband in the Mexican desert. Much of the film focuses on how she copes with her captor, who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help. Some psychological struggle there. <br /> <br /> This is an amazingly effective little film - its short length makes it taut, and the fact that Stanvik is great should remain without mention (but I will still praise it every time).
