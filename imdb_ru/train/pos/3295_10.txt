Such a film of beauty that is difficult to describe. Maybe this is the lack of unnecessary dialogue, or maybe this is an absolutely stellar soundtrack, or maybe it's just Mina Mumari's legs, but itâ€™s good to watch this movie again and again. I have never seen a single Indian film that was close to it, and few from any country vied with its perfection.
