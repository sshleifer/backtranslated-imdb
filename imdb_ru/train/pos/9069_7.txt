If you like movies about school hooligans, brave children, funny kids and eating worms, then “How to eat fried worms” will please you. <br /> <br /> The film tells about a boy named Billy, who, when arriving on his first day at a new school, discovers that some of his classmates have been making fun of him, putting worms at his lunch. The school bully, Joe and his "team" of friends start teasing Billy and calling him "the worm boy." <br /> <br /> Billy decides to play along, saying that "he constantly eats worms." Joe and his friends do not believe him, but Billy assures them and relies on Joe to eat ten worms in one day, otherwise he will come to school with worms in his pants. <br /> <br /> The boys take Billy to his bet, leaving a weak child with a stomach and a mission to win the respect of his classmates by eating cooked, fried or live worms. <br /> <br /> The film may seem rude, but there are many messages in it. On the one hand, it depicts real friendship and how to accept people as they are. It also shows why some bullies resort to bullying other children. <br /> <br /> The protagonist of the Billy film is a strong and brave man to whom we can all relate. It is easy to empathize with him, as we silently encourage him to achieve his goal, even if we do not always agree with what he does, or with the choice he makes. <br /> <br /> Children in the film are depicted as children in real life, and the film deserves great praise for it. Child actors are the stars of this show, showing real emotions and feelings than in most other children's films. <br /> <br /> Some adults may not like this film, but children, perhaps even teenagers. <br /> At the moment there are practically no other good films on the track, so if you are not in the mood to see snakes on the plane, try the worms on the plate in the section “How to eat fried worms”. This is a pleasant, funny movie, not just a fear factor for children.
