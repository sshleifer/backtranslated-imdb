I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to watch the premiere of this film - and I am very glad that I succeeded. As a big fan of movies and lifelong Northern Californian, I was surprised how many Oscar-winning films were shot in the Bay area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Bay area and not go to Los Angeles, George Lucas comments on perseverance, community and vision really resonated with me. <br /> <br /> Hey, if he and all the other directors can do it in SF, other artists can do the same. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie
