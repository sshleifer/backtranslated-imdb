Chief cinematographer Alain Rene likes to work with those actors who are part of his family. In this film, we also see members of the Rene family, such as Pierre Arditi, Sabine Azema, Andre Dussollier and Fanny Ardant, who deal with serious topics such as death, religion, suicide, love and their overall influence on our daily lives. The formal nature of the relationship shared by these people is obvious, since even friends, they refer to each other using a formal "you." In 1984, making L'amour à mort, Resnais dealt with time, memory, and space, to unravel the mysteries of the fundamental question of human existence: is love stronger than death? It was 16 years ago, in 1968, when Resnais made a somewhat similar Je t'aime movie Je t'aime, which was also about love and memories. The message of this film is loud and clear: true and deep love can even dishonor science as dead lovers regain their lost lives, leaving doctors to take care of their reputation. L'amour à mort is like a game that is not at all didactic. This is a film in which the music perfectly blends with his images. of the reasons why this film can be easily understood.
