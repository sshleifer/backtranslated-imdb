This movie is great entertainment for watching with your wife or girlfriend. There are a lot of laughter and some interesting nudist stories. All the actresses are very interesting and certainly deserve attention in their natural beauty. Maslin beach life is full of various nudists and personality types. The landscapes of the Australian coast are simply magnificent. What a place to visit, if not more, and one day it can be my refuge. I really like this film, and every time I watch it, I get more pleasure. I would like to see more of these characters, and I always wonder what became of them. Although the plot is somewhat bland, this film is, of course, an excellent opportunity to just sit on the couch and enjoy the beautiful and famous Maslin Beach with these wonderful nudists and your own stories.
