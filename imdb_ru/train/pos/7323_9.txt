Cruel, insensitive Michael Myers stabs his sister at the age of six on Halloween night in 1963; On October 30, 1978, he escapes from a psychiatric hospital and establishes a new regime of terror in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. He is being pursued all the time by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasant), who knows how evil this young man is. <br /> <br /> It opens with a bang and sets a really tense and atmospheric chiller, which is really excellent to many slasher paintings. It helped inspire. This is subtle compared to the dirty bloodbaths that many of these subsequent films have had; thin and scary. He retains the ability to make me jump even after multiple views. How many films actually can be scary even after they have already been seen? Not much. <br /> <br /> Pleasence is great in what was probably the decisive role of his career; Jamie Lee Curtis in her debut in the movie became a bona fide queen of screams after she starred in "Halloween", as well as in several subsequent slasher, and she is the intended victim for which it is worth supporting. <br /> <br /> Scriptwriter / director John Carpenter knows what works in this film, makes good use of shadows and a dark sky; notice how much of the movie happens after dark. With this picture, he and his former associate Debra Hill created a franchise that spawned seven sequels, a lot of imitators and the upcoming "rethinking." <br /> <br /> This is very quotable - who could forget Dr. Speech Loomis (please), in which he describes Michael Myers to the sheriff (Charles Sayfers, reliable repertoire in Carpenter's earlier works)? <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy to look for. This is my favorite John Carpenter movie ever. <br /> <br /> This is not entirely infallible - after all, there are holes in the scenarios - but in general it has a major impact. <br /> <br /> 9/10
