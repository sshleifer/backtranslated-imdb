“The cinema is dead, long live the cinema!” Said Peter Greenway, one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors, at last year’s Anonimul Romanian Film Festival, which was released for the third edition in the Danube Delta. This year, the director's prize went to Offside by Jafar Panahi. I saw it this evening in Bucharest at a festival retrospective. The cinema is dead, but still very much alive. Panahi’s film convincingly tells what Iranian society looks like. “Offside” is a story inspired by a real event that happened to Panahi’s daughter: the problems and risks that arose when they decided to attend a football match. It is banned in Iran, as we were informed. What Panahi manages to do is to do it with the help of several means, but perhaps with a lot of work, intelligence and humor cultural patterns in a society that puts women on a special level. The absurdity of the laws becomes comical. The film has a happy ending, because the Iranian team is sent to the World Cup. Most of all I appreciated the concept, the idea of ​​this film. I would be very interested to see other Panahi films that were also banned in Iran. I think he can be considered an activist director.
