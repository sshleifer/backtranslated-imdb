Just one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. This is a parody of criminal life, a parody of everything that represents Chicago in 1930. There is no need to underestimate this movie, because the rating is below 5. This is a mass opinion, and the mass is hypnotized. Whoever decides to watch it will regret; Whoever decides not to watch will regret it more.
