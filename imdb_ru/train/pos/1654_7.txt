A soap opera about a little married woman in town (Kay Francis) who works at a local newsstand plays a leading role in her local theater, but dreams of becoming a Broadway star. When a famous actor who is a ham, a talker and a shoemaker arrives in the city, she visits him in his room with dreams that he would give her advice to fame - he pretends that his valet is his “manager”, forcing her to believe in her she has everything she needs, but “experience” to become a big star. Her husband finds out and hits the guy, which led to the unexpected death of the actor, which leads to a trial for the murder and even more unexpected: a life sentence for her husband. The next thing you know, she joined a traveling burlesque show in the hope that one day he would get to Broadway and earn enough money to gain freedom for her man - while her child is sleeping in the chest! <br /> <br /> This film has a rather interesting plot, well, perhaps a little contrived, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you understood it) - everything * is strongly * reinforced by a strong, emotional performance According to Kay Francis - she just makes this film. The well-played Minna Gombell role of “getting close to forty” by an elderly lady who works in burlesque and is friends with Kay helps here. Worth seeing, especially for Kay Francis fans.
