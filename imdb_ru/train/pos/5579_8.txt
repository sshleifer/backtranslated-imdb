I have never heard of this movie until I stumbled upon it by chance while watching IMDB. I saw that he got a lot of horrible reviews containing very colorful curses about how he stank. Of course, this meant that I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised, because “Whipped” is actually a pretty good movie. I watched it with a group of friends, and we laughed more than in many of the recent, well-known Hollywood fluff comedies. This is an independent film and as such depicts his subject (sex and dating) without the usual Hollywood fake. I clearly suspect that people's opinions about this film will largely depend on their life experience. If you have never met or not met, you will not receive this film because you will not meet people like these characters. If you have, you will recognize many of the situations that are depicted here in a comedic style. The ending was also good, as it did not portray women as unreal, helpless, virgin romantics unlike many Hollywood films.
