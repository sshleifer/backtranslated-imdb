I confess that I was a little puzzled by the genre of the movie of a small child softening the heart of his / her reluctant guardian. Have I seen enough of them ?? Baby boom, Kohl, about the boy, mostly Martha and, to some extent, the whale rider ?? expect to miss the formula. What caught my attention in The King of Masks was the gloom of the situation: a small city in China in the 1930s. Extreme poverty was the norm, and girls were considered so useless for poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to anyone who brought them to the black market. When Van discovers that his bought grandson, whom he nicknamed "Doggie", is a granddaughter, he first expels her, even though she showed great promise as a street heir. Even after he reluctantly takes her, he is not too upset when she is abducted. This film shows toughness that shows how young, smart street girl had to leave in order to survive in this society. <br /> <br /> The two main performances are believable and seductive in a social context. In Western society, one might have expected, at least, a hint of resentment from Van for not having achieved greater material success. However, Van so thoroughly perceives his position as a famous artist with low social status, that I, too. While Doggie demonstrates the level of prematurity and cunning that can be suspected in a modern suburban child, it is plausible in the context of the fact that the child is constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls as garbage. And after she learned that her previous seven owners had subjected her to physical and mental violence, her strong attachment to Wang makes sense. <br /> <br /> A look at the life of a small town in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two leading actors, amazing plot twists and, of course, heartbreaking resolution - all this contributes to the creation of a very watchable movie.
