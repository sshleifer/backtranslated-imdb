Director Sam Fuller has a bit of a cult, especially in Europe. However, most of his films are more than forgotten. However, he made one truly amazing film in Pickup on South Street. Created quite early in his career, subsequent films were significantly worse. <br /> <br /> From the first to the last frame, the Pickup operates at all levels. It is filmed with impeccable fluidity, showing off the wonderful activities around. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter, both excellent record players, are at their peak. Widmark, who was not a stranger in the game of villains, although truly sneaky, still manages to uncover even the slightest humanity that makes his character delightful, and also makes the fall of Gene Peters's character all the more likely. <br /> <In this truly complex film, Fuller doesn't take a beat. There is a scene in which Gene Peters beats Widmark. This is really shocking for its reality. This is not the case for a carefully photographed photo. <br /> <br /> Less shy than many film fans of that period, it remains an excellent example of the genre.
