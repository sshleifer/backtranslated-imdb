This film is scary because you may find that it relates to the ideas that they have and can remember how other people speaking and having ideas simialr turn this film into a stunning, well-made film ... Camra's style is not so terrible to emphasize that it takes you out of the movie The Witch Blair, this only adds to the raw “real” feeling of the movie that does it.
