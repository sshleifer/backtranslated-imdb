This movie is just awesome. It was a very sensitive issue, and the film was excellent. This film did not cause any controversy in India (as far as I know), and its popularity also remained low. At first I thought that this film would be just a waste of time, since most Indian directors and producers changed the subject, although it is very sensitive and adds a love story to the original story and spoils it all ... most Indian viewers will agree on this subject if they remember Ashoku, Mangal Panday, LOC, etc. <br /> <br /> There were so many films in India that would become a milestone or megahit, if a part of the love story was not added unnecessarily. <br /> But its processing is very similar to the Pinjar film (also be sure to watch). <br /> <br /> If it matters, I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (director) for making such a wonderful film ..
