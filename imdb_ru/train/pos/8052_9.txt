This movie is not a kung fu movie. This is a kung fu comedy. And if, before making this film, Sammo Hung did not spend some time watching the films of the great French comic director Jacques Tati (that is, for example, especially “Jour de fête”), he certainly is at the same wavelength. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think Tati movies are funny; but they are not for every taste. Some have told me that they hate his work. I never understood why, but I think it is because the character that Tati himself usually plays is so deadly panorama, so unaffected by the events around him (which he usually causes) that many miss the more subtle comic bits happening around <br /> <br /> In any case, Tati’s main trick — or at least his most famous one — is to take on a pretentiously direct miniature bourgeoisie with a 19th-century feeling and send him to France 20 th century where he must confront society this largely determined by the gradual destruction of these feelings. He usually has serious problems with small things, such as players or radio. He is dangerous in the car, but the world is not safer when he rides a bicycle. But through all this, he never loses his aplomb, which follows from his inner recognition that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the twentieth in general. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the character played by Sammo Hung, played by a country boy who came to the big city of Hong Kong, is completely convinced that the city is interesting because Bruce Lee was making kung-fu movies there. This leads to trouble in small ways, as he takes occasional measures that will never be seen in a small town, but which are considered inappropriate in a big city - for example, the moment he seems to be urinating outside, the policeman stops him, only to discover that Hung actually just squeezes the water out of a shirt soaked during an accidental fall in the bay. What is interesting about this oath is that Hung doesn’t understand what a policeman’s bustle is - in a country town, while no one is watching, if you need to go, you have to go. In other words, Hung doesn't actually urinate on the street - but he certainly will - and what's the problem officer? Of course, Hung's obsession with Bruce Lee also gives him great trouble. He beats bandits who refused to pay their uncle, the restaurant owner. Of course, in the Bruce Lee film, thugs would be considered miserable, and they would learn a lesson. But in Hong Kong, Hung, reality, unfortunately, prevails, and the gangsters return when he is not there to disturb his uncle. <br /> <br /> Of course, Hun finally triumphant at the end, as always Tati. Characters like this should always win (at least in comedy), because they are completely innocent, and, as such, despite their comic mistakes and misunderstandings, they truly represent what is best in people we admire. and wish to be. We do not really want to be Bruce Lee (who needs to survive the loss of all his friends before he gets a chance to defeat the bad guy), we, in our own innocence, really want a world in which the characters of Lee are possible. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this world exists only in the movies. <br /> <br /> "But what if ...?" - and in this question we find Sammo Hung in his best comic strip.
