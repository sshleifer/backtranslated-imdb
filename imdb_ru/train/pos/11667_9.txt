Kells’s Secret is a film I’ve been waiting for years after I saw some early videos in Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. I am here to tell you that it was worth the wait. Cartoons are highly stylized, but not annoying, as I was afraid. The whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination, I especially like the animated book with light, where small pictures come to life on the page. The characteristic is superb, I like the voice of Brendan Gleason as a strict abbot, and I especially liked the voice of Erysling's sprite. The forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place. The story is well implemented, a mixture of facts and fantasy. and really attracts the viewer to support Brendan in his search for the perfect materials for the Book. I am a lover of calligraphy and lighting anyway, so the topic is close to me, but all the people I know who have seen it and are not fans of the craft agree that this is a great little movie. I will definitely buy a DVD when it comes out, and I would like to say well done by Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this gigantic project. Let there be many more. :) Coming back to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could, and distributed them for Christmas, everyone likes it! And I wish them all good luck in the world at the Oscars, such a joy to see that it is appointed.
