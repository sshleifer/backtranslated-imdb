This film was last week, and although at this time of the day (around 6:00 pm) the quality of the films was almost never good (at least on Mexican television), I could not turn off the TV. The story of Madeleine Moore really touches you. At first, she doesn't look like a very responsive character, but after seeing the entire movie, you just want her to succeed. This film really makes you wonder. And I think that mainly because of the great game Brooke Johnson. I had never heard of her before and did not consciously see her in another film, but it was a great acting game. Compliments Brooke. I hope to see her in another movie soon.
