This is a wonderful film about the Mormons and their final settlement in Salt Lake City, Utah. The beginning and the end is especially strong, and we must remind everyone that God does not speak, but communicates, if we only listen. As I write this in the midst of the horrors that take place in New Orleans and its surroundings because of Katrina, I was particularly touched by the fact that the Mormons had to leave everything behind and move on after Joseph Smith was killed. People came to this country to avoid religious persecution, and yet they could not. The struggle of the Mormons for the whole country, the price of life, the suffering they suffered, were truly impressive, demonstrating their immense strength. As for the true beliefs of the Mormons, this is not so important, and polygamy is mentioned, but not at all the central part of the film. <br /> <br /> The cast is first-class, although others who comment, know more about real characters and can talk about how true the images were. But as actors, Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donlevi, John Carradine, Jane Darwell all do an excellent job with the script they were given. <br /> <br /> Although the film could easily stand on its own (and, of course, today) Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell were added to the cast, so that the audience could go to the cinema to watch a movie about Mormons. The power is magnificently beautiful, like a young Mormon, and Darnell, like Zina, is not a Mormon, but remains in the family after her father is killed. There is little that the authorities can do until the end of the film, when he has a big stage, and Darnell (still a teenager at the time of filming) has even less, although they make up the perfect match. Their fate remains unclear with regard to her treatment, and in their case one may ask about polygamy. You can't beat any of them for eye candy, however.
