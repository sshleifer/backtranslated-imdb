Blimey! Recently I have seen a lot of bad low-budget films, but this one is great. A very realistic depiction of police life in a city on the East German coast contrasts sharply with other criminal films or TV shows. I liked the main actress and the absolute rejection of any common cliche about the police. This film is realistic, as documentation, and entertaining, like a drama at the same time. Perfect exchange!
