“The Man on Fire” is definitely one of the best drama / crime thrillers I've ever seen. Despite its slow start, the story is so surprisingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together pretty well. This is the ideal role of Denzel Washington, in which he plays a bodyguard, whose name is Christie, who is tormented by his past, and he is an alcoholic, but he never gives up his duty to save his last protégé, Pete. Dakota Fanning plays Pete, a very smart, enthusiastic little girl who loves so many things and acts very convincingly, she has a great future ahead. As I said, the story is somewhat complicated, to fully understand it, you have to watch it a couple of times. <br /> <br /> This film consists of two parts, the first hour, when everyone is happy, everything is in order, everyone just lives happily until Pete is kidnapped and where Chris is almost not killed. And then there is the second part, the rest of the film, where everything suddenly becomes complicated, somewhat awful and disturbing, when Krazi recovers from a serious injury and begins to chase and kill the numerous criminals and Hermamdad, who were responsible for the planning and execution of Pete. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington shows us his most advanced acting talents along with many other talented actors who have a great future ahead. It is unfortunate that this film did not receive enough recognition, Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance, as well as Fanning and the director. And even, maybe, visual effects that were of very high quality. <br /> <br /> If you like great, slightly abnormal, intense thrillers, this is one that is worth seeing. The most amazing thing is that the elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10/10
