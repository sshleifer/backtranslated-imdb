Willian in this film is a sneaky sob, and he seems to like what he does, which I think makes him so mean. I do not think that most men will like this film, especially if they cheated on their wife. This is one of those films that largely remain significant until the very end. But then, here it is, a candy bar that makes me look back and say: "KHOKI AS HELL." Pretty good movie to end. The end is the end that we would like to see, but not the end of such a middle beginning. And then there are the consequences of what happened. Guess you can determine the true end. I had a feeling that only one character had to survive at the end.
