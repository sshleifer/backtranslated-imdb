I read the negative comments before watching this movie and was not embarrassed, went ahead and began to look. I admit that I had to rewind quite a few times, because the film is incredibly complex, complex and full of details. This is good, but also quite unexpectedly in this culture of car chases, explosions, unreasonable sex, and general violence, which replace plot and character development. In fact, what a long-awaited departure, I’m so used to not paying much attention to what I’m looking at. <br /> <br /> This film is full of character development and storyline; the kind we used to analyze when i was in high school. This requires real mental participation from the viewer. What a nice change. I would compare it with “All Presidential People” in terms of a common theme. That is, this is a secret because of gross misconduct on the part of elected officials and those who have enough influence on officials to essentially "own" them. <br /> <br /> Unlike the film “All People of the President,” this film tries to give a couple of characters a real personality. In this sense, the film is a study of character, for example, The Negotiator with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In this film, their characters are city workers, and the plot is extremely rich. However, the plot depends on their characters' ability to cooperate with each other, trust each other, and ultimately unite against the corrupt police department. There is more gunfire in this film, and the particular plot is different, but in general, there are many similarities. <br /> <br /> I’ll say that the mayor’s office requires much more concentration. In fact, I was struck by how parallel it was to past and present political scandals that I had seen in my life, going back to Watergate. The fact is that the public knows for sure that something is wrong! but it’s difficult to keep track of the details. This film is not even as complex as in real life, but in fact it is realistic in its complexity. I think this is one of the reasons why previous posters criticized the film: unrealistic expectations. <br /> <br /> If you look at it, knowing what they are going to see, and they are ready for it, then it is truly excellent! I watched it 3 times in a row! The game is great and the direction is flawless. The weakest link is John Cusack's accent.
