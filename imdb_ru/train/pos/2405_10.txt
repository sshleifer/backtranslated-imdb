Wow, I can not believe that I am the first and only one who left a comment on this wonderful film. <br /> <br /> Although the film itself seemed quite interesting, the real thing that attracted me to this film is Matt Lillard, given that most people probably either think that he is too happy with caffeine, or just sucks, but we are both the same age and one generation, and I watched this guy so many times that he is now one of my favorites. This is one of the few films in which he plays a big role and starred, as in SLC Punk, another great movie Lillard. <br /> <br /> By and large, these are ordinary films with robberies, but with more turns than anything else, which are starting to come down to insanity. Also very prominent in this film is another great actor named Vincent D'Onofrio, a very underrated man in the film industry. The woman in the film is a newcomer, and she is not so bad, although you know that she was hired mainly because of her accent and nude scene =) <br /> <br /> This is Jack vs. Jill vs. Bob, because everyone wants to reap the benefits, but not share with anyone. They are all trying to force each other to kill another, and this is a time bomb waiting for an explosion. Matt reveals his true mastery as an intriguer Jack, who initially runs the whole scheme. Vincent and a woman play a couple of artistic thieves who need money because of a lack of business. Vince's character is a bit crazy and wanders around the movie, but it only increases the intensity of the movie. <br /> <br /> Surprises on the left and on the right are welcome, and the final is not very cliché and makes you feel happy. Well, maybe it depends on the type of ending you like. I was very interested in this film, except that Matt was in it, this is a great film, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves movies. The critics probably don’t like this movie, but they don’t watch movies because they still like movies.
