Most people, especially young ones, may not understand this film. It is like a loss story, when in fact it is a story about loneliness. Some people may never feel alone on this level. <br /> <br /> The character Chadles Johnson reflected the exact opposite of the character Sandlers Fineman. Where Johnson felt trapped by his blessings, Fineman tried to forget his life from the same point of view. Jada is a great addition to the cast, and Sandler draws tears. Chadle had a comic role, and he was a big supporter of Sandler. <br /> <br /> I see Oscar somewhere here. A very good movie. If you've ever lost and felt lonely, this film will convince you that you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
