You can call it a mystery, perhaps a little thriller or an intellectual film. <br /> <br /> The story tells about the life of one person who lost his life and hopes to return it. > <br /> I have to say that I was quite surprised that I really liked this film. Usually this is not the genre that I need, but the characters quickly became people for me, and I wanted to know what they were and what they would be like. <br /> <br /> Like many French films made in English, we can learn a lot more about the character and influence of their environment on their personality. This movie is character oriented and will not disappoint!
