I really like this show. That is why I was disappointed to learn recently that George Lopez was a racist, and that he fired Masiel Lushu from the show, simply because he discovered that she was not an Latino, but an emigrant from Albania. I learned about it from people on the show. She really was one of the best parts of the show, and thus find out that even among those who you think are sensitive to racism, that they can also hate someone, simply because of the country in which they were born , really disappointing.
