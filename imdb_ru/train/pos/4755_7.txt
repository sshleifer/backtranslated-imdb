A bus full of passengers was stuck during a blizzard. Police closed the bridge, saying that it was unsafe, and they were stuck in a small cafe until the road was cleared. However, after a while, their boredom turns into anxiety, as it seems that one of the passengers was NOT originally on the bus and may simply be a foreigner !! This leads to an ironic but rather ridiculous conclusion. <br /> <br /> This is another fun episode of the Twilight Zone. Instead of typical turns or social commentary, this one has no permanent message. However, it is also very watchable, so who cares? Exactly what is happening, you just have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, John Hoyt plays the role in this film - the face that most of you recognize from countless old TV shows and movies. In almost every case, he played the real grumbler (like Charles Lane in the same era), but I really liked the boy to see him - he perfected the grumbling persona and was at the same time funny.
