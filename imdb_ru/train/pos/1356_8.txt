I started watching The Apprentice about 4 years ago (maybe 5), and I really enjoyed it. The first thing that amazes you is the refreshing format, which, although similar to many other reality shows, is still very interesting. Donald Trump is wonderful as the presenter and chief judge of the show. A coup d'Ã©tat with intelligent people who have a beautiful appearance is also appreciated. But the best part of the show is the city of New York. Mark Burnett may have done a lot of shit in his time, but his ability to handle cinema is excellent because he makes New York look like a character in and of itself. Jazz tunes combined with excellent camera work make New York spectacular. <br /> <br /> An apprentice will always easily make my top 3 reality TV show of all time (however, The Amazing Race is No. 1). But, as in an amazing race, this show is always best to watch in moderation. If you continue to watch it for a while, the originality of the show wears out quickly (as well as with TAR). Star World broadcasters in this country have done a great job of presenting the show. The first three seasons were shown in a row, then after 2 years the next two seasons were shown, which kept the concept fresh. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you will enjoy this show, especially the first two seasons. However, if you keep watching the show constantly, then its charm wears out and quickly.
