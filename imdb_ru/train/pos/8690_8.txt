Alain Resnais films are strange in that they are not actually edited for continuity, but instead the picture seems to end where the memory was edited. “Love to Death” is sometimes a quiet existential drama and a round creative film with a magical realist, and in any case it attracts the audience to a completely new aspect of the Eros / Thanatos relationship ... or perhaps creates a new relationship - Agape / Thanatos relationship. <br /> <br /> Getting started is like a strange surreal horror movie. A woman is desperately running around the house, and a man dies in her bed - did she kill him or what happened? Soon, this tension disappears when the doctor comes and declares him dead, but from there a new, more strange drama begins: a man wakes up, and after death a woman and a man fall in love with really very tragic consequences. Meanwhile, their friends, who are both priests, follow and present their own debates about the nature of love, faith and devotion. <br /> <br /> It seems that Rene always has some kind of device to make these kinds of stories work. And what is surprising about his films is that these devices always work. In this case, Resnais interrupts scenes with shots of snow falling to an agitated orchestral amount that disappears and bleeds in subsequent shots that continue the story. From time to time getting into the trap of this elegiac, the film develops a rhythm, not too similar to the epic poem, and I got strange memories of Dante's divine comedy from this, despite the absence of a direct reference in the film. Resnais is known as a very poetic director, but he extends beyond just the structure of the film poem to something that gives the viewer a certain degree of introspection, which can bring some strange memories to the surface. A story about memory, creates Rene. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
