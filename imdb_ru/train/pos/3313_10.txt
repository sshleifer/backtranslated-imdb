I am a longtime fan of Bette Midler, I must say that her recorded live performances are my favorites. Bette pleases us with her jokes and brings to tears with her ballads. A literal rainbow of emotions and talent, Bette shows us her best of her solid repertoire, as well as new songs from the album "Bette of Roses". Embracing generations of people, she offers something for everyone. The only Divine Diva proves here that she is the most talented performer in the whole world.
