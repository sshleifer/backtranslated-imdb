If you went to this film to see the awesome presentation of the Academy Award ... well, well ... but if you want to see the funny, delightful adaptation of the old classics, you'll like it ... Jim Carey was incredible, as usual. The storyline was gorgeous, with a few added parts, like the story of Grinch, that made it even better. Ron Howard never misses a beat .. But although there were a few ADULT comments and added splitting, it’s supposed to be a show of children or a family. Try not to lose sight of this ... if you really don’t enjoy the movie ... and as for the comments about Ron Howard, try making a big movie and see how you do it ... it’s not as easy as it sounds .. .
