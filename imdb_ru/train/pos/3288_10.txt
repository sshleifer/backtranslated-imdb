This is a cool fantasy movie. One of my favorites, this is really cool. Directed by Bernard Rose, who directed the film “Candyman”, he started this film well. <br /> <br /> A film about a girl named Anna, who fell ill with glandular fever on her 11th birthday. She draws a house on a piece of paper from her notebook and falls into a dream in which this house is real. Each subsequent dream that she has is changed due to the presence of what she adds to the picture. In her third dream, she meets a boy, whom she thinks she calls Mark. She made friends with him, and their relationship becomes stronger, as dreams become darker and more terrible. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Burke, playing Anna, is an amazing actress, and it’s very strange that after just one film she disappears and never be in everything ever again. She really plays great in this movie. <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer is great too. Like in Broken Arrow, the music is ghostly and mysterious. Too bad the soundtrack is no longer available on CD. DVD is only available in R2.
