Another example of what British cinema can achieve: a simple story told and acting well. Brenda Bletin demonstrates a multi-level and warm role, as the recently widowed and financially constrained Grace, skillfully supported by a solid support actor. The “strange little town” map is played out to the limit, like many TV shows and films that have come from the British Isles in recent years (recalls Ballykissangel, Hamish Macbeth, and others). As mentioned above, this film uses delightfully beautiful rural landscapes, in this case the wet and wild coast of Cornwall. <br /> <br /> Some viewers may find it a bit difficult to adopt the mass use of cannabis, others may find the ending just too cute and safe. But it's a nice splice, to be sure.
