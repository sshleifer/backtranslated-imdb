This is one of the most daring and important of the so-called “Pre-Code” films, shot in Hollywood in the 1930s. Unlike some of the “Pre-Code” films, which occasionally indulged in plots that were never resolved after 1934-5, this film completely plunged into a very dirty, but interesting plot from beginning to end. The usual morality of the late 30s and 40s was definitely NOT obvious in this film, as the film is, in fact, about an insidious woman who sleeps on her way to the top - and without apologies along the way. This "broad" and enjoyed sex and used it on every man who could help her get rich - something you would never have seen in films shot just two or three years later. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Barbara Stenvik working in his father's speeches. In addition to being her boss, he is also her pimp and urges her to sleep with a local official so that he can allow an illegal bar to act with impunity. Although it is not entirely clear here, it seems that for a long time daddy “handed over” his daughter's body. <br /> <br /> However, after he was nearly raped and attacked this man, smashing a bottle of beer over Wu his Barbara skull was enough and he was heading for the big city. It doesn't hurt that she still blew up and killed her father, but her feeling that she was losing her composure and that she had nothing to show seemed to be a stimulus for movement. <br /> <br /> Despite the depression Barbara uses sex to get a job in a huge megabank. She starts with a rather boring job as a clerk, but for several weeks she sleeps from one job to another, while she does not sleep with the head of the bank. and his future son-in-law !!! All this ends in tragedy, but Babs does not seem to be too alarmed by the death of these two men. In fact, after some time, she is able to penetrate the life of the NEW CEO, and again she is at the top (perhaps more than one). <br /> <br /> So far this is a wonderful film because it was so rude and unrepentant. Barbara played a 100% sociopath - a woman without morality and without conscience - just a desire to squeeze as much as possible out of life, regardless of who she hurt in the process. Nonetheless, courageous writers and producers "got bored" and considered it important to stick to the redemptive end. Considering that this woman was so angry and insidious, her change of heart at the end was a great disappointment and distracted greatly from the film. In many ways, this reminded me of the end of Jezebel — like again, an evil person somehow “sees the light” and doesn’t change his opinion too convincingly. <br /> <br /> My advice: try to watch the RED WOMAN AND DOWN. RED HEAD WOMAN is in many ways similar to the CHILDREN'S PERSON, but in the end has no magic transformation - the leading lady is really a skunk deep! In DOWNSTAIRS, a film very similar to RED-HEADED WOMAN, the roles are reversed, and the person (John Gilbert) plays a similarly cunning character. Both are classic and slightly better than this film. <br /> <br /> This film is an amazing curiosity of a short period of often ultra-dirty Hollywood films, and in this light it is worth seeing the Cinephiles. In addition, the duke's fans take note - John Wayne plays a very small role in the film, and it is very unusual to see a very young Wayne playing such an ordinary role.
