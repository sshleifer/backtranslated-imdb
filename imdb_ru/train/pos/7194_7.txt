I rate this as the best of the plays of the chapter of Zorro. Fascinating music adds impressions to the exciting scene. There is an excellent cast and mysterious villain who will make you guess the last chapter. Reed Hadley copes with the role of Don Diego and his alter ego Zorro.Last, but not least of all, this is an excellent team of Whitney and the British.
