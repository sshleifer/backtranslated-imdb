So, there is a front view of a Taxi Checker, probably a model from the late 30s. It has large triangular headlights. Also in this black and white taxi, driven by a character, there is a DeSoto booth, almost musical love went wrong. <br /> <br /> A real pleasure here is a look at the interiors of the rooms of the 1940s, fashion and hotel elevators. Hairstyles, male and female, are gorgeous. If Dolly Parton had Victor Matry's hair, she could have made them big. There is an artistic attic that anyone who wants Andy Warhol can envy. <br /> <br /> If you look at it in anticipation of a magnificent plot in Casablanca or “The Sound of Music”, you will be disappointed. There is a suitable short story about the runway model in this movie. <br /> <br /> My copy on a DVD with another film for $ 1 was very clearly visible. The title sequence was cute, but not there with a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or Pink Panther. It was an RKO film, but there was no beautiful aircraft logo that RKO used. <br /> <br /> I liked Victor Mature in the film One Million, British Columbia, as well as Sampson and Delilah, especially in Forcible Saturday. See if you can find it. He was brilliant in a comedy with Peter Sellers, “Kaccia Alla Volpe” or “After the Fox”. <br /> <br /> Richard Carlson continued the series “I Lead Three Lives” on television in the early 1950s. <br /> <br / Vicky Mature was offered the role of Sampson's father in a remake of Sampson and Delilah. He was allegedly asked if he would have any problems with his father’s role, since he was as well known as Sampson. Victor replied: "If the money is in order, I will play Sampson's mother." <br /> <br /> tom willett
