Do we all create our own reality, or are we? This is the main question behind this very original and expertly thought-out exploration of the illusory nature of reality. The combination of Eastern and Buddhist philosophy with visual chic MS. Asher, this fascinating treatise manages to answer the rather cerebral question "Who are we and what is our place in the universe?" And turn it into an exciting and fun 100 minutes. The film tells about Bart, the writer who fights with his script "The sea that thinks." When he sits at his computer, the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of how he sits at the computer and writes the script. Soon he was stuck in a cool puzzle, in which everything he writes becomes reality. Director Gert de Graaff approaches his theme with a mischievous sense of humor and amazes the viewer with a series of striking visual techniques that oppose the nature and soundness of our perception. Ultimately, de Graafâ€™s film challenges the audience on several levels to wonder whether what we see, touch or try is really what it seems, or our whole understanding of the universe and our place in it - just cheating our feelings Note: After you have watched the movie, visit the entertainment website of the movie.
