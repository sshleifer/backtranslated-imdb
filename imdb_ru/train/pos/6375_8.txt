Although I really respect Disney animation films, lately they have not become what I would call “must-see”. "Atlantis" looked intriguing from the first poster and trailer for the film and, fortunately, met my expectations. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is a more mature Disney film in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual feature for Really Disney films), and is more focused on action and discoveries than any other recent proposal Disney The world of Atlantis, hidden under the earth’s core, is fantastic, represented as desert caves with ruins, and then slowly evolving into real ecosystems, which, although usually contain some reminders of severity, become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself will be reached. The presentation of just the landscape and setting of Atlantis, without any fun song, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing look. The inclusion of the Atlantean language, as well as attempts to link it with the mythology of real ancient civilizations, adds to this and works quite well. <br /> <br /> In addition, with the exception of some scenes involving Mole practical jokes, there seemed to be not a lot of “childish” element that I usually associate with Disney movies. Instead, the main elements were the struggle to get to Atlantis, and the constant discovery that took place in Atlantis, when Milo, the stranger, could learn everything he ever needed to know about the place, helping the atlantists discover parts of their own stories they didn't know about. In part, this includes the Atlantic "weapon", which is used in a very intense battle climax, which, due to the lack of a better word, is quite exciting. <br /> <br /> Of course, not the whole story is complete. There are no amazing new computer-generated visual effects in this film, but, apart from the Toy Story movies, this is the most interesting Disney movie I've seen in recent years.
