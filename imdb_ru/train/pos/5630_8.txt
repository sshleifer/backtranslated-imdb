Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett’s gorgeous and exciting performance) barely escapes the attack on her car by the evil serial rapist Joe (superbly played with terrible conviction and intensity by James Rousseau). However, Joe steals his wallet and finds out where Marjorie lives. He makes her visit on one fateful day. After Marjorie was subjected to numerous humiliations and psychological violence, Marjorie manages to turn the tables on Joe and lock him in the fireplace. What is Marjorie going to do with Joe? Directed by Robert M. Young and screenwriter William Mastrosimone compose a rough, tough and often troubling story of morality that shrewdly pierces cruel cruelty and painful humiliation of rape, and also shows how anyone brought to extremes can shock acts of violence and inhumanity. Joe sees women strictly as objects, while Marjorie sees Joe only as an "animal." However, to his delight, this film refuses to make Joe a mere nasty one-dimensional creep; instead, he is a terribly real and ultimately pitiful human monster with his wife and child (in particular, Joe’s climate recognition is truly acute). Fawcett and Rousseau are both outstanding leaders; they receive excellent support from Diane Scarwid in the role of the passive Terry, Alfre Woodard as the intelligent Patricia and Sandy Martin in the role of the handsome police officer Sudow. Flexible cinematography by Curtis Clark and J.A.C. Trembling on the Redford scale, crawling on the skin, significantly increases the significant claustrophobic tension. This powerhouse.
