Yes, these are film tops. Can't recommend it anymore. Gay or strait is a great document for those who love movies. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never boring Excellent access. The film is made with passion and interest in the subject. Some performances are amazing. If you find this film only on VHS, itâ€™s still worth seeing. Fine. 10 out of 10. I saw a part of this document ten years ago and did not understand what I was looking at. Interviews are very revealing to the ego of performers who look like heavyweight boxers trying to get out of the ghetto. The director was, apparently, the first timer, so this is an achievement. Great. Track it.
