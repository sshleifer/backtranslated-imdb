EARTH is a must for children and adults. My son had a lot of fun watching all these funny birds and ice bears. We can learn a lot from this film, and we should be proud of our great treasure on earth. There are some animals in danger of disappearing. This problem should prevent all the authorities of our planet. <br /> <br /> This documentary offers many exceptional photographs that I have never seen before. Then it is well accompanied by heavenly music. The director did a great job here, which receives high respect. Nothing can stop me and my family to give EARTH the highest rate. I very much hope that the material will create a sequel.
