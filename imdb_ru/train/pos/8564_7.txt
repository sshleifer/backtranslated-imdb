I do not expect this film to be well understood by viewers from Romania. This definitely speaks of the value or, perhaps, of the lack of universality of the film, but also speaks about how different the history and even the lives of ordinary people were in Romania compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> The film is a film adaptation of the novel by Marina Preda, a scandalous novelist who died during communist rule shortly after the book was published. He tells the story of an intellectual, a professor of philosophy, whose life collapsed after he was imprisoned on false charges at the end of the Stalin era. In fact, the first part of the film tells the story of his struggle to survive in prison, the second - his attempts to regain his life after his release. His release is really only obvious, the 60s Romania asks for various kinds of compromises and crimes from him, but, nevertheless, his struggle for survival is morally cruel, just like in prison. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are superbly shot from the best Romanian actors. Stefan Yordash, who plays the main role, will be a megastar at another time and in another place, we can get here a good idea of ​​his incredible acting art. Despite the fact that he suffers from indecisive story-telling and sometimes gets into irrelevant details or comics about the characters, this film is still an important milestone for Romanian cinema, as well as for the process of restoring moral and historical values ​​in Romanian society.
