I don't know what's with this movie. But films about history or religion are always criticized for their accuracy. Of course, this is not 100% accurate. Nowadays, it is difficult to make 100% accurate films, when even the “experts” do not agree with each other. Therefore, I prefer to judge the film by what he is trying to say, and not by all inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> So, to begin with, I liked this mini-series. But I agree with the criticism that his childhood years were too fast. The series was to consist of three parts, his childhood was the first part. But if they didn't have more money to make more stories, who am I to criticize it? <br /> <br /> I have only one real problem with this film, and it is a fact that it is told in the story. book way. Especially the second part, which is simply the sum of the events that occurred. I would prefer to see Hitler more humane (more scenes in which he doubts himself, etc.). Noah Taylor did it more in the movie “Max,” which seems to work better, I think. Nevertheless, I am glad that it was done, and I own it on DVD. Just to remember what happened, and see how Carlile does his best. 7.5 / 10
