I had no idea about the facts that this film represents. As far as I remember this situation, I accepted the information then presented in the mass media: the tangled situation around a dubious person: Mr. Ch√°vez. The film is a revelation of many realities. I wonder if this caliber has ever been made? I assumed that the main character was Mr. Chavez, but everyone who approached the picture was important, and in the end the reality of this entelechy: people were stunning. Thanks to Kim Bartley and Donnich O'Brien. <br /> <br />
