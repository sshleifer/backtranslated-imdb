This is a great American martial arts movie. The fighting scenes were quite impressive for an American film filmed in the 90s. Of course, the fighting scenes are not as good as in the Hong Kong films, in fact, few American films have the same fighting scenes as in the Hong Kong films, even in our days. When you watch an American martial arts film, you expect to see less impressive martial scenes, but you still have some good moves that can sometimes be surprisingly good, or at least that's what I expect from these films. I was impressed with this movie. Some of the martial scenes were really impressive, the acting, directing and plot were pretty good, so itâ€™s really worth watching a movie if you like American martial arts films of the 90s.
