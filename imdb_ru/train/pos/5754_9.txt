I remember seeing it when I was seven or eight. I must have found the characters round because they left an impression in my memory that lasted a long time after the end of the film. And the end, now it's sad, well ... for a 7-8 year old child. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to watch this movie again lately, and I found that the plot is too simple a character, two-dimensional ... I think this is a movie that you can only with the innocence of a small child ... Sorry ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to all of you, parents of small children ... (I saw it in the original French version, so I canâ€™t tell you if the translation is good or not. )
