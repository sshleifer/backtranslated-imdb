This film improved my opinion of Errol Flynn. While Flynn is, of course, best known for his rage and sprezzatura (to add a couple of European terms with a high degree of falsification!), This film gives him the opportunity to stretch (albeit slightly) as an actor, as he plays a shameless social climber with ego and a sense of courage to match. The supporting cast is excellent; each seems well chosen for their roles. <br /> <br /> The story is moving cheerfully and, although not particularly deep (it misses, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to make a social commentary on the extremely uneven distribution of income at this time), it certainly entertains and satisfies. From what I know about Jim Corbett, the story is also fairly true to the story. I also loved the magnificent images of San Francisco of the 1880s. In general, in this film, little is not pleasant ... very worth it to watch it.
