The key to the 40-year-old virgin lies not only in the fact that Andy Stiizer is a 40-year-old virgin, but also in the way Steve Carell presents him as a whole. In the genre of rough "comedy", a feature of which is the lack of humor and attractive characters, "40-year-old virgin" offers a colorful cast and intelligent, emotional script, which does not use its main character as an ass. cruel jokes. The fact that Andy is still a virgin in her forty years is actually not so much a joke as curiosity. <br /> <br /> Carell, veteran of “Team Ferrell” in “The Lead” and ex-actor of the Daily Show. uses the concept of the film to expand your character ?? we understand why Andy is the way he is. These are the little things that make this film work. When an Andy employee at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend, Andy describes his failed cooking attempts. When Andy rides his bike to work, he signals his turn. Does he not just decorate his house with figures ?? he draws them, talks to them and shows that some of the really old ones belonged to him since childhood. A little comedy wouldn't even focus on all these things. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simplistic ?? Andy's fellow colleagues find out that he never had sex, and they do it with their own personal desire to put him to bed with a woman. This is a child's idea, and the film does not try to hide its youth. <br /> <br /> Andy's friends complement his neurotic nature: David (Paul Rudd) broke up with his girlfriend more than two years ago, but Jay (Romani Malko), still obsessed with her, is a womanizer, and Cal (Seth Rogen) - tattooed sexaholic. Their attempts to drive Andy into the bag are repeated many times, and each time Andy feels less optimistic. <br /> <br /> Finally, Andy meets a single mom, Trish (played by Katherine Keener) and, unfortunately, his anxious buddies, who claim that mothers are not worth it, he falls in love with her. Do they start a relationship and agree to postpone sex for twenty days? Trish does not know that Andy is still a virgin. <br /> <br /> Directed by the 40-year-old Maiden, director Judd Apatov, the man who produced The Lead and The Cable Guy, and started a short cult television show. Freaks and geeks. Apatov is known for its unique sense of humor and script ?? in collaboration with Karell ?? offers a lot. <br /> <br /> However, in the end, the most interesting and (truly amazing) aspect of the 40-year-old Virgin is maturity. By now you probably know well that the film has received brilliant reviews from critics, and even I was surprised by its warm welcome. But after watching the movie, it's easy to understand why. We like Andy. We care about him. He is not just a cardboard sex comedy cliche ?? he is a real, living, breathing man. His neurotic traits combine the best of Woody Allen with childish naivety. His friends are not unpleasant assholes, and his novel is stormy and bitter-sweet. This causes a response in the audience. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a perfect film and definitely contains some rather gross understatement and sexual humor, it does not offend to the extent that there may be recordings of other genres because we have affection for people on the screen. Best sex comedies work this way? from risky business to american pie ?? and this is the main difference between something like a 40 year old virgin and 40 days and 40 nights.
