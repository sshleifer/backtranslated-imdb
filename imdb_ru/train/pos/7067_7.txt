Although she is little known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, an attractive teenager with a cheerful personality and an admiring operatic voice. This 1937 was her first major film, and it turned out to be the box office for besieged Universal Studios. <br /> <br /> THREE SMART GIRLS relate to the three daughters of a divorced couple who rush to their long-invisible father when their faithful mother says that he may soon marry - with the firm intention to undermine his gold diggerâ€™s friend . Although the story is insignificant, the script is witty, and an experienced actor plays it with a neat touch of chatter. Durbin has a pleasant voice and an attractive personality, and actors such as Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucille Watson, and Misha Auer complement the cast. Ultralight entertainment for fans of the 1930s movie. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
