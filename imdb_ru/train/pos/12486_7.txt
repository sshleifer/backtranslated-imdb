Well, this film is really complicated. To be direct with you, this film does not contain a lot of exciting story, but it does not make you want to know how it will end ... but I will tell you something now ... I never had it as tense and jumped earlier in of my life! This movie really delivers horse racing and thrills! To be fair, I watched him almost at midnight, so I was still a bit sleepy, so maybe this explains why I was nervous ... or maybe because this movie really shows it! Basically it is a couple who lost their child in a tragic event. They decide to leave and rent a house that looks like a house in the mountains ... everything looks peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors (I think this is the main character's sister, and she brings her husband with them) ... at night the husband hears noises ... checks it, and that's when everything starts to go really wrong ... they do not stop the other day and do not tell the couple that they have to leave as soon as possible, because something is wrong ... in short saying ... in the end they find out what happened in this house over the past few years, and decided that it was well but take care. <br /> <br /> This is not a Hollywood blockbuster. No, it has a huge budget, but please do not let this push you away. It's creepy, tense and very very nervous! Just try it :)
