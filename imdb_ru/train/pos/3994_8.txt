I went to this film only because they dragged me there, and I would immediately leave again, because the audience was mostly elderly people, and I felt out of place. Nevertheless, the film was extremely fascinating and far from aimed at older people. All the characters were very real and believable, and I spent hours discussing the film, the characters and the storyline. There are some pretty exciting scenes there, but they are necessary and help you better understand the situation. In general, this is a great and valuable film - a little off the mainstream, but this does not mean that this film cannot please people who prefer the mainstream. This is an exciting and interesting movie.
