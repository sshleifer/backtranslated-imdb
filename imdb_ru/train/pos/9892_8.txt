This movie is such a crappy kindness. <br /> <br /> A group of people locked in an abandoned school. They begin to kill, they know that they are persecuted, and what they do? One girl decides to take a bath, another decides to deceive her husband (who is also there) with an old guy, so that they somehow find the bed (in an old abandoned school?) And went to her. <br /> <br /> And this comes with blood and T & A. <br /> <br /> And this is also interesting from a historical / sociological point of view. Where the usual slasher of the 80s is a reflection of how we see ourselves, or how adults look at young people, or how Hollywood looks at the rest of the country, this has a unique perspective. This is a British film made to be an American slasher. It is nice to see how often British actors who try to speak American are unintentionally returning to their British accents. <br /> <br /> If you like rude slashers of the 80s (for example, plays), then this is for you,
