First of all, I think that the comment below does not deserve such a site. Obviously, you have no taste, and you do not respect the taste of others. Not to give you a history lesson, but I think it needs to be done. Black actors are simple, if not more successful as the others. If you do not participate in the "black" race, you can not understand the quality, creativity and brightness of old films, such as "Glitter", "Red Tree" and "Cool High". Unfortunately, you are not black, you have no pleasure in feeling what we feel when we watch this classic, so you need to keep your mad mouth shut and just stick to your non-dancing race. Thank you.
