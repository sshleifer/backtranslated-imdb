This is another example of the absolute genius of Gene Wilder. He wrote and starred in this amazing mystery. No one could do it better. Waiting was palpable everywhere. I would like Mr. Wilder to decorate us with one more of them. I enjoyed everything I've ever seen Mr. Wilder, but I didnâ€™t know how truly talented he was until I saw Murder in a Small Town and this is a continuation. He really firmly understands what the audience wants and how to express it in his works and, of course, in his brilliant game. His subtle wit penetrates the spikes. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves riddles and / or Gene Wilder's work. His star is getting brighter and brighter.
