This is a stupid film thinking person. If you don’t expect Star Wars and enjoy British humor, it can become a cult classic for you, as for my wife and me - from Cary Grant’s voice and Jack Nicholson as Martians to oversimplified population. a movie in which you can either sleep or watch carefully and enjoy one way or another. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone, but if you like a relaxed light humor that will quickly consider a joke when he slips past you, you will like this movie.
