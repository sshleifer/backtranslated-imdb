I really like this episode, Ruth Gordon is good, if not a little Hammy, as she always was. As already mentioned, the music is very good, and it has a moodiness, which is not in all episodes. <br /> <br /> But there is one big hole in the plot, so wide that you can drive through the fleet of trucks through It. It is established that the light does not work in the repository. Do you think that very clever Colombo or the rest of the police would think to check if the light bulb is working? You would think that in a fairly short time they unscrewed the light bulb and found a note. Of course, this is fiction for television, and various holes will always be found, but this seems too obvious. <br /> <br /> Colombo cannot be a hidden genius when the light does not work, but the testimony of the “deathbed” remains unfounded, apparently for several days.
