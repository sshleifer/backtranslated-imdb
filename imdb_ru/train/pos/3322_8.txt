If you want to watch something for “him” and “her,” so to speak, this film should be chosen. I am a lover of Roma, but my husband is not always so keen (what a guy !!!). In any case, I managed to get him to see it, because I told him that it was about the sport, and you know that, he loved it !!! <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is very funny and her lead man (sorry, but I can't remember his name) is equally good. When I watched the movie, it was called “The Perfect Match”, but I think the name was changed for the UK because it was based on the book “Fever Pitch”, and a football movie with that name was already shot (the same movie, but The UK version is fie!), <br /> <br /> In any case, all the reviews here will tell you more details if you need them to buy girls, take it away from me, show your husband / boyfriend in front of the TV. Saturday night, and you both will laugh and cry together. A real gem.
