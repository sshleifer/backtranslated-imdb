Gorgeous Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a television reporter who travels with her team (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) in Solvang, California, to cover the Danish festival. The problem is that their housing failed, and all the hotels in the city are overcrowded. Therefore, they travel from the city to a remote place and enjoy the hospitality of the seemingly friendly Ernest Keller (the phenomenal Sydney Lasik). Do you not know, Ernest and the meek partner Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) hide a big secret in their basement: pathetic, deformed, dressed in Junior diapers (Stephen Furst, in a wonderful performance), which ultimately terrorizes girls. <br /> <br /> Amazingly frustrated Lassik plays a real monster in this disturbing little horror movie. He slowly but surely develops to an intense confrontation / climax, delivering horror in small doses before the last half hour. The hotel and the premonition of the cellar - great echoes of "Psycho" here - excellent conditions. Moreover, the perverted plot includes incest and poisoning, which allows the film to acquire a truly dark quality. And yet it also becomes acute, because we understand that Junior is not an evil ghost on the one hand, but a victim, just like girls. The last shot is especially sad. <br /> <br /> “The Invisible” is a small, terrible horror film worthy of discovery. <br /> <br /> 8/10
