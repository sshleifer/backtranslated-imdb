Until recently, I had never watched this film on TCM and did not find this story concerning Poland and a small city that had to suffer from the Nazi occupation of local cities, such as many other European cities: Norway. World War I ended, and people in this city were still suffering from their lost soldiers and wounded, which war always creates. Alexander Knox, (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" returns from the war with a lost leg and was a former school teacher in the city. He was brought up by a German and was not very pleased with the Polish people, and they, in turn, also did not fully accept him. When Hitlerâ€™s party came to power, Wilhelm Grimm wanted to become a Nazi in order to go back and punish this small Polish town for treating him, which he was really thinking about. Marsha Hunt (Marya Pakerkovski), Chloe's Prayer, played a prominent role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically associated with Wilhelm Gimme. There are many memories and some very real truths about how the Nazis destroyed the families of people and their entire lives. This picture shows the livestock transport vehicles, and the Jewish people are sent to the Nazi gas chambers. If you have not seen this movie and you liked this item, take some time; this film is very mundane for a 1944 film and a story you won't forget too quickly.
