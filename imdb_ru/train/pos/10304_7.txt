“Bruce Almighty” looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from trailers. However, I found a deeper message in it that actually made me look more like this movie. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry with God and given divine powers to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man who is symbolized as God here, and although this is not his usual type of film or one of his best roles, he does an excellent job with what is given to him. Despite the fact that the film was at times rude, he had a lot of laughter: from Bruce, who divides his soup in half, as in the Red Sea, and the reaction of clients to him, as well as the seemingly unconstrained and wise image of God Freeman. From time to time this is overly exaggerated, and there is some rude humor, but on the whole he manages to be somewhat amusing. There is a decent cast, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell, who always helps. The end of the film turns out to be very romantic and audacious, and it is clear that we have to do what God called us and “be a miracle.” The film is far from perfect, but still enjoyable, and much better than I and many people would probably expect, especially if we see a deeper message of the film. <br /> <br /> *** of ** **
