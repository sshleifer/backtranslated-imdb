Japan has serious problems. The demons flooded Edo, taking possession of earthly forms and bending them in their wicked will. In addition, the revival of Ashura, the Queen of demons, is imminent. The only thing that confronts this serious threat is the Guardians of Demons, the awe-inspiring group of warriors who can be as bad as the demons themselves. <br /> <br /> Izumo, a retired Demon Guard who, five years ago, took up theater instead of Killing Demons after accidentally killing an innocent child (in a battle that strangely resembles a scene in a bar from dusk to dawn) . One day, having met him by chance, he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their destinies are intertwined (literally), and destiny obliges them to be lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think that this sounds like your typical Japanese fantasy / sword sword epic, you are mistaken. In fact, there is nothing typical in Ashur. This is a jumble of different genres of film. The ones you just mentioned, as well as comedy, drama and romance. Director Yojiro Takita ("Onmyoji") quite respectfully manipulates the genre (although comedy seems forced in some scenes), and the result is a funny, but really funny movie about popcorn. <br /> <br /> Of course there are flaws in the film. Some of the humor seems far-fetched and inappropriate. And the game is not the best. But seriously, do you watch movies Fantasy / Swordplay / Comedy for great acting performances? No, we are watching their actions and the crazy visual effects of computer graphics that Ashura shoots at Peaks. In order not to be misleading, the film is not the whole action, but it is generously spread out with lots of swords and buckets of green blood to make the average viewer happy. <br /> <br /> Outcome; The films have their flaws, and this is not an epic martial arts, but it is not, and they have interesting visual effects and good effects on swords. The reason why the film worked for me is that he never takes himself too seriously, and if the viewer does the same, he will definitely be delighted with this funny and silly fantasy action movie. <br /> <br /> My rating is 7 out of 10. Cool popcorn movie.
