I first saw this film when it was broadcast in 1988 by the BBC when I was working on the British 2000AD. My friend Steve Parkhouse recorded it on VHS and sent it to me. Up to this point, I really saw only the Kung Fu movies "Show Bros", with their sharp lighting (so that viewers could clearly see the movements), so it was a revelation to me to see what looked like it was lit by Ridley Scott coming out of hong kong. It was also my first encounter with Tsui Hark films (pronounced "Choi Hook"). <br /> <br /> Yet for all the smoky exteriors with backlit and ambitious special effects (Stop-motion? In a Hong Kong film?) At the heart of the Chinese GHOST STORY is a simple and touching love story, made even more real by an outstanding actor Leslie Cheng's talent (what a tragic, tragic waste of life!) And Joey Wong's beauty and elegance. Of course, Joey is gorgeous, but her ballet gestures give her character an unattainable eroticism that is difficult to analyze. And although Joey is now almost 20 years older (damn, and who among us?), It will always be in a sustainable way for this actress. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers say that the film is simplified and there are not enough surprises, but they lack the fact that this film is based on a famous Chinese story written by Pu Songling around 1700! It's like complaining that Romeo and Juliet have a predictable end and simply copy WEST SIDE STORY. (I just wanted to take it off my chest!) <br /> <br /> For me, “Chinese Ghostly Story” is a typical romantic tale. It has a high tragedy, because we know that Chio Xing and Sin Seen can never be together. It's about becoming mature, because none of us can grow up until it suffers heavy losses. It is about sacrifice, because sacrifice is an integral component of True Love. And comedy styles Wu Ma also does not hurt. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the ghostly history of China, trying not to view it through the filter of Western culture, and you will cope with it perfectly. ,
