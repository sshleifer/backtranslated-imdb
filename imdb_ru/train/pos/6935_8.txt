James Stewart stars in a classic western story of revenge, which is related to the fate of the films of another Winchester rifle star. Stewart, of course, perfectly adds a bit of a cold cold obsession to his usual calm cowboy. The story tells about the fate of the Winchester rifle and its owners after our hero won the competition and kidnapped the man he hunts. <br /> <br /> We meet players, gun fighters, Indian traders. and bank robbers, while we follow the path of rifles in Indian battles, bank robberies, etc. The supporting force is Dan Durya, who plays the role of Wako Johnny Dean â€” a live wire arrow with an itchy trigger. Also as a trivia, note the very early appearance of Rock Hudson as an Indian leader. <br /> <br /> The final fight is a classic tense battle with a rifle that was fought at a great distance in and around the rocky outcrops. Add to this the good old Western fighters, fistfights, shootouts and horseback riding, which makes it an exciting western adventure. 8/10
