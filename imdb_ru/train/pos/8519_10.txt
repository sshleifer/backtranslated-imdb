Amazingly ..... Perhaps it was an unsuccessful attempt to remake the already recreated film "The Sign", but I certainly liked it. <br /> <br /> The last commented person is a fool, this film was one of Kind, and Dark Music, Jerry Goldsmith himself, would have welcomed this film. <br /> <br /> Great recommendations from yourself to watch or buy this movie. <br /> <br /> I collect horror films and soundtracks. So listen to what I have to say, not this other idiot. <br /> <br /> There is only one thing that does not fascinate Me, the ending. <br /> <br /> According to Prophecy, this is all inaccurate, including the final conflict and left behind. <br /> <br /> But my conclusion is this: there are great films ... and they need to be seen before the Great Depression falls on us, and in front of the Democrats Take on the Presidency. <br /> <br /> So signed ....
