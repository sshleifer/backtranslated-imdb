Great view of a mature woman who is going to lose everything (even the shears have a mortgage). The way she gets involved in this special “business,” the innocence and true love that exists between the people of a small town, is perfectly combined to give us a fresh, light and fun comedy. I could not stop laughing at the very funny scene of two old women in the pharmacy. <br /> <br /> I love European films, and with such films my opinion is getting stronger. The film, which I also recommend with my eyes closed in the same genre, is “The Awakening of Ned Devine”. <br /> <br /> Salvation Grace is a comedy that many friends and I liked. You will love it.
