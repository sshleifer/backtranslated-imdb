Charles Boyer must be Spaniard, and he came to London to buy coal in the film The Secret Agent, a 1945 film that also starred Lauren Bacall, Katina Paksinu, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer - Louis Denard, and everyone wants to stop him, except for Bacall. His documents are stolen, he is accused of murder, but he is determined to mine coal for his people so that they can fight the fascists. <br /> <br /> This film has its good and not so good sides. It is highly appreciated for the atmosphere and anxiety, and it is very interesting. Bacall is incredibly handsome, Boyer is passionate, Paksinu is angry, Lorre is slimy, Hendrix is ​​respectively miserable, and Seymour is insanely wonderful. <br /> <br /> Not a good moment: Backall should be English, and Boyer should be Spaniard. No, Bowyer is great in his role even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not the British upper class. Two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is somewhat mistaken. Her acting is not suitable to sniff; she is better in other films. But she looks amazing woman, and much can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Paksin is almost an ordinary and hated man. Dan Seymour almost steals the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature. This is a great role, and its performance is flawless, while other actors are not so good. It was definitely a case of not small details, but only small actors. Seymour was not a small actor. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing even with its flaws.
