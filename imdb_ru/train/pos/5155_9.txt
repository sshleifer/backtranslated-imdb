"Hitler: Rise of Evil" was shrouded in controversy even before it went on the air, and this controversy may overshadow the success of the film. <br /> <br /> Those who criticized the film, which they had not seen, made it. so with good intentions based on the mistaken idea that it would be overly sympathetic to Hitler. However, they misunderstood the point: to humanize the evil Hitler can not sympathize with him. It is much more anxious to realize that the unspeakable acts committed by one of the greatest villains in history have been committed by man. Of course, the sick, the sick maniac, but, nevertheless, a man. You need to know the story of how Hitler was able to come to power in order to prevent his repetition. <br /> <br /> “Rise of Evil” is underlined by the brilliant, best-in-career performance of Robert Carlisle, who makes Hitler a man, never redeeming him in any way. Carlisle flawlessly captures the gaze and manners of the Nazi leader, not allowing imitation to become caricature or push us away (something Anthony Hopkins could not achieve when he portrayed Hitler in Bunker, another very good film made for television. Film). While Hitler is repelled by the depravity and wicked anti-Semitism, Carlisle gives him a certain magnetism and strength that the real Adolf Hitler must possess. In the end, otherwise the nation would follow him? <br /> <br /> Of the various plots, the most convincing features of Matthew Modine are, of course, the reporter Fritz Gerlich, who makes his whole life work to draw attention to reality. Hitler and Nazism. While Modina’s performance in the first part is a bit understated, in part 2 he seems to have settled, the character gives us a real hero in a film full of villains. Peter Stormare and Lieb Schrieber also provide strong support. <br /> <br /> The first part of this two-part mini-series suffered a little from excessive volatility, including a look at Hitler’s childhood, which lasts only for the duration of the debut. loans. And in the second part, sections in which Hitler’s relations with his niece and his mistress Eva Braun are described in detail are less successful than the central plot, but serve to give us a deeper understanding of his mental and emotional state. <br /> <br /> In the end, not a single film about Hitler can make us understand him. Fortunately, the average person is not able to understand a person who will try to destroy a whole race of people. "Hitler: the rebellion of evil" is not trying so that we understand Hitler, and more so that we understand how he came to power. This is an important story to tell, and it’s impossible to believe that someone who saw the film would blame him for having something besides good intentions and the ability to do anything other than good. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10. *** 1/2
