Perhaps the last film you expect to see from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (who wrote the novel on which this film is based). This is a neorealistic fantasy, really an oxymoron, true. An elderly woman finds a child in her cabbage shred and raises him as her own son. After a few years, the child becomes a little boy (named Toto), and the adoptive mother dies. He goes to the shelter and when he finally turns 18, he leaves. Immediately he discovers that he has no home. Toto is optimistic, and will not let anything break him. The man steals his suitcase, and instead of being angry with him, Toto becomes his friend and leaves and stays with him in a small slum. Toto takes the lead and organizes the lives of many homeless people in the area, and they build the best slums. Soon the landlord is trying to sell this piece of land, and slum dwellers must protect themselves. After many attempts, the owner installs the police to get rid of the homeless. At this point, the film becomes a full-fledged fantasy (before that it was a more comedic / fantastic melodrama in the style of Charlie Chaplin). This material is so strange and shocking that it is probably better for others to see it themselves. This is pretty amazing and very funny. There are objections that you could make about the plot of the Miracle in Milan, for sure. Fellini and Visconti were strongly criticized when they began to deviate from neorealism. I think I read it was widely criticized at the time of its release. At the moment, however, it is so nice - I really liked it. This could be my favorite film Vittorio de Sica, although Umberto D and the Thieves cyclists are very, very close. 10/10
