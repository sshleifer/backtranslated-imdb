I am sure that this is a show that is not familiar to anyone and may not be a good one; After all, it is almost close to Baywatch Hawaii. With actors, location, direction style and advertising ?? shows women walking on the beach and all that. No wonder people have the wrong idea and decide not to watch it. <br /> <br /> It was wrong of them. Because after I decided to watch the show, actually more things happen, really juicy stories and conflicts, it turns out to be really exciting to watch and to a great extent ?? Exciting. <br /> <br /> History of the hotel clerks, the manager, the owner and their difficult love life. Also enter the restless visitor of the hotel and an influential person trying to steal the hotel. It is actually more exciting than it sounds here. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that acting is crap, but itâ€™s not so bad that you turn away. The story is not so consistent, but quite good. The soundtrack fits very well into the script, and the action happens all the time. I shot a couple of episodes before something really happens, so be patient. <br /> <br /> Recommendation: I really enjoy watching it. A million times better than expected. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 / 10 (class B) <br /> <br /> Please rate my review after reading, thank you.
