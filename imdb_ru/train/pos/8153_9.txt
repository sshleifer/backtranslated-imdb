This is a really funny movie, especially the second, third and fourth time you watch it. This is a rather short film, and I definitely recommend watching it more than once, you will get “more” a second time. <br /> <br /> This is like a spinal cord, but like a rap version. There is a lot of attitude in it that can be negative in rap films under the influence of rap, but this is just the total amount, and this is not a problem because of the irony it creates. <br /> <br /> Many outstanding pieces, one of those types of films in which you will find quotes with your mates, and this will cause laughter. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite role is the "partisans in the middle" section. Great video, great!
