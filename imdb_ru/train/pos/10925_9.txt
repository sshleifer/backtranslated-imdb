I really like this movie. I can watch it regularly and not get tired of it. I guess this is one of my criteria for a great movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. He introduces us to 6 characters; Everyone has their own unique Kung Fu style, which is very secret and very deadly. Each of these characters is trained in the same master, but their identity is kept secret from each other. The dying master sends the sixth poison, his last student, to try to correct the mistakes that he suspects some of his students made. <br /> <br /> How will the last student find other poisons? How does he know which one is bad? The answer to these questions is part of what makes this film great. <br /> <br /> We also see poisons fighting each other in every combination. It is interesting to see how their styles relate to each other. <br /> <br /> If you want to see if you like Kung Fu movies, then this is a good movie to start with. It does not get better than that.
