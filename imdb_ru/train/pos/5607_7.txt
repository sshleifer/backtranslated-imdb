Once I watched "The Tenant" and interpreted it as a horror film. It uses many trails of the genre: ominous apartment, suspicious neighbors, visions, riddles, hallucinations. The life of the hero Trelkovsky seemed to be surrounded by evil, secret forces, trying to drive him crazy. <br /> <br /> Last time I watched it, I challenged this initial interpretation. If this film is a horror film, it’s just horror in the sense that Kafka’s novel is horror. In fact, this film can be understood literally as a lonely person who gradually goes mad without any outside influence. <br /> <br /> Polanski has shot three films about insanity in his career: “Disgust,” which I don’t particularly like, because the development of madness in heroin never convinces me; Rosemary's child, in which the heroine drives crazy with evil forces; and The Tenant, which is arguably the best paranoia ever made in the movie. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky is a young man who rents an apartment in which a woman killed herself. He becomes obsessed with her and gradually begins to become her: he wears her clothes, puts on make-up, speaks like she does. But is he obsessed with spirit, or does he just let his wild imagination take over him? It is this swing between what is real and imaginary, and that Polanski never resolves, that makes this film so exciting. Many events in the film can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as for ordinary reasons, and the viewer can decide what to believe. <br /> <br /> Although this is not my favorite Polanski film, however, this is a good example of his ability to create tension and depict madness in very convincing expressions. And technically speaking, this is also a miracle. Suffice it to say that he collaborates with film composer Philip Sard and legendary photo director Sven Nyquist (DP Bergman) in the making of this film. Slow tempo, and sometimes uninteresting segments can make this film difficult to watch, but, nevertheless, it is an experience.
