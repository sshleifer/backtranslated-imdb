<br /> <br /> I once saw No Man's Land (1987) - a link to IMDB http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and found that everything is in order. A movie about a guy who only steals a Porsche. It took sixty seconds, and 13 years have passed and added nothing to this. In fact, it has many scenes that cost nothing. And the end is very, very bad. <br /> <br /> The Sphinx has a magnetic screen that is better to use ...
