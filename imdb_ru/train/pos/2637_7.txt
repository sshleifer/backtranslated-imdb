This is a direct video, so it goes without saying that he will not compete with the first Lion King, but, nevertheless, it was absolutely good. <br /> <br /> My children liked it, but this is a matter of course, they love everything that is a cartoon. The big shock was that * I * liked it too, it was funny, funny about some parts (even jokes *), there were a lot of pretty creative connections with the first film, and even some jokes you had to be older, to understand (but not being risky, as in Shrek ["Do you think he compensates for something?"). <br /> <br /> A special note about joking jokes, I was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises (in fact there were almost no noises / images, the links were actually quite thin) there really was a / punchline / etc setting, and they were almost in good taste. I would like my children to think that there is more humor than going to the bathroom, and this film is good in this regard. <br /> <br /> Hmm, what else? The music was so-so, not as creative as in the first or second film, but very funny for children. No painful banal moments that were a blessing to me. A little action, but nothing terrible (The secret of the NIMH gave my children nightmares, not sure if the G rating was suitable for this ...) <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that this is a great movie for any children. age that is 100% safe to allow them to watch (I try not to be too sensitive, but I had to jump and turn off the TV during several films that were less suitable for children than expected) - but you can leave the room during of this. In any case, I would say, keep to the sides, you might like it too :)
