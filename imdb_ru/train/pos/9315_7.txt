Well-known lawyer Walter Pijon accepts a murder case on a voluntary basis, wins an acquittal and discovers that his client (Kif Brazel) was not only guilty, but also participated in the extortionate ring that reached the highest echelons of the city. Because of his complicity, he conducts an investigation, stumbles upon the identity of an “unknown person” who heads the syndicate, and kills him. <br /> <br /> Irony arises when Bracel is accused of this second murder and Pidgin must defend him, pointing to the existence of another “unknown person” - himself. Although the “Unknown Man” lags somewhat behind the bustle of the city and rhetoric for a long time, it refers to the noir cycle not so much in style or structure as in recognition of the widespread corruption of American municipal policies that emerged in the post-war years.
