This almost unknown gem was based on a French farce â€” which shows, and I mean it as a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) cares for a rich Argentine (Roland), who asks her father to help her in marriage. But Caroline is already married to Anthony (Coleman), who had just arrived on an airplane and immediately begins to remember the audience how Caroline last decided that she was in love with someone else: an amateur sculptor (Gardiner). The film tells about Anthony's strategy in removing Caroline from her sculptor and how this experience helps him with her Argentinian. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect cast: Ronald Coleman - the most sophisticated and charming Reginald Gardiner - the most picky, Gilbert Roland - the most exotic, and Anna Lee just delightfully capricious. The film is wonderfully directed by Lewis Milestone (who also produced); the whole production is felt as a labor of love. There are wonderful touches, such as a colman breaking the frame and facing the camera, and the exclusive use of the sliding door of the cabinet bar. It is a sinful thing that he was not released on DVD - such a film can alone arouse interest in a classic film.
