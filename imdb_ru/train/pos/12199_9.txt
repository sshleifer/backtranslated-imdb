The first mystery is to guess what the original Wells film was. This makes it a real adventure - to see the unfinished skeleton and use the cinematic expertise, imagine a beautiful woman who was once supported. <br /> <br /> If you do this, you will both see and, possibly, see one of the best films. riddles forever. As the puzzles go on, the story is pretty ordinary: a simple distraction, one jealous husband in the form of red herring. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is the placement of Wells's story in an artificial eye that sees a dark, dark multifaceted world, the first true noir, but even darker. This is not a clearly distorted world, unless you think about the camera. From first hand it is clear that someone creates a vocabulary that will later become common. <br /> <br /> In spite of all the celebrations, Kane was a success thanks to the magnificent drama and history. The eye of the camera was shocking, but experimental. Wells went from there to explore the mysterious narrative and the mention of Shakespeare about himself. Othello and MacBet both began during this period, and I consider them part of a single vision. <br /> <br /> Here, the sensations of noir depend on the fact that people are not even responsible for their lives - they are manipulated by random environmental factors. Therefore, in telling this story, Wells must turn the environment into a character. Several characters are suspected of being secret. <br /> <br /> Thus, we have a certain lighting, blocking and angles that we know (and have since seen countless times). And we have purposely closed sets: a park, a yacht, a picnic area, an aquarium, a dock, a courtroom, a Chinese theater and an entertainment house. I am sure that the barbarians were cut off a lot of "external" narratives concerning not the nature, but these strange conditions. <br /> <br /> My own solution to this riddle is that the fan house did it, among other characteristic environments presented as suspects. In other words, the manipulations with black Irish people (whom we know from notes and one of the scenes typing in the union hall, were aspiring novelists) were neither the force of a human conspiracy (park or civilized version, court hall), or nature. (Picnic or civilized version, aquarium). <br /> <br /> Instead, it was a deliberate caprice of the gods for entertainment. This, of course, is a self-reference to what Wells is doing: sending these people (including himself) to hell for our own whim â€” a question emphasized by the Peking Opera, in which Wells is doped. And, of course, leads to home entertainment, where the environment is directly dependent on perception. <br /> <br /> More about self-referencing: there must be a conscious comment on his relationship with his future ex-wife. But I believe that there is a strong subliminal comment about his own mockery of the environment in which he worked, the studio environment. Of course, Wells was as strongly attached to him as his character. And this deception took the form of the murder of this film, leaving the rotting corpse mentioned at the beginning of this commentary. <br /> <br /> The fact that poor Rita comes from China connects all this, the Chinese theater, the expected rape from above, the loss of a woman. Investment in the environment is paramount.
