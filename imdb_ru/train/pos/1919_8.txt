I did not read the book on which it was based / inspired. This is one of the (other roles) of the last work of John Ritter (RIP), and we hope it is fun. And this. Almost every time he is present in this, in fact. Most of the cast, both supportive and ordinary, play well together, and the material is usually great. He plays Paul Hennessy, the father of three teenagers: Rory, a typical guy of that age, Kerry, a depressed middle child who fights for reason and awareness, and Bridget, a popular fashionist. Sagal returns to being a female leader in a sit-coma, and her character is far from Peggy Bundy. The show changed a little after Mr. Threeâ€™s company passed, and for a while they seemed unable to make a decision if they wanted to laugh, or be sharp and respectful. One may wonder how or why it lasted so long after that: it can still be pretty good, some additions were successful (if you like David Spade, most of his role is that he made his game) and had that to say, My personal favorite episode last season. Humor is a pleasant mixture of "stupid person" jokes (mainly related to high school students), stupidity, dark comedy and coarse material. This was about sex and other topics for adults, but never in graphic form. The tongue is soft, and sometimes moderately strong. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it. 8/10
