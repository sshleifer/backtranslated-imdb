I heard that Madonna was briefly reviewed for the role of Catherine Tremell. Compared to Sharon Stone, Madonna is too rough and bower. She's not even close. <br /> <br /> EVIL TIME: Sharon Stone is a little long in the tooth, despite the reclamation effects of modern chemistry and surgery. However, she skillfully treats us with the frightening personification of evil beyond redemption. In the obligatory sex scene, she projects a pure, crystalline passion. Especially her shining eyes with a hood and a face with pleasure. Due to the brilliant use of lighting and other scenic techniques, the harsh age lines appear only occasionally. Rather, she seems to have a slight golden glow (YES, LANGUAGES). <br /> <br /> Places gave us a view of London, which is the long-awaited departure from ordinary London landscapes. Katherine's character is so strong and formidable that I thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed paths. I would not have a chance. <br /> <br /> ORIGINAL BASIC INSTINCT; Attempts at censorship: I must briefly comment on the original 1992 film, shot in San Francisco, a beautiful city worthy of this film. It is outstanding, from music to locations, scenery and so on. Paul Verhoeven pulled vibrant performances from the lineup and crew. <br /> <br /> The fact that the main villain was a woman did not escape the close attention of gay and lesbian activists in the gulf area. Attempts at censorship were categorically rejected. TO SWELL. These philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script, insisting on rewriting them that would promote their political and psychiatric programs. Example: sanctimoniously accusing sexism and misogyny, they demanded that the lead role be changed from BAD GIRL to BAD GUY. <br /> <br /> On the ground in San Francisco, gentle, tolerant activists tried to sabotage the filming of scenes with noises, flashing lights, and other tactics. Executive producers, Mario Cassar and Andrew Wajna, have vowed to fight any efforts to restrict artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy, and received prohibitive orders against subversive tactics. <br /> <br /> BLOWBACK: Thanks to active activists, the film received wide coverage in the national press - millions of dollars of free advertising. Their calls for viewers to boycott the film led to a negative reaction, as a result of which buyers waited in long lines, no matter where the film was launched. He also received widespread acclaim from critics. It was, according to reptilist Hackett in the NETWORK, “BIG HIT!” Sorry, Gentle Reader; I just could not resist it. Yes, this is a mockery. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I believe that the BASIC INSTINCT 1 and 2, with their brilliant musical scores, aesthetics and acting skills, are works of art <br /> <br /> that deserve protection in accordance with with our constitution.
