This has long been one of my favorite adaptations of the Austin novel. Although she is clearly not in the same category as the fascinating Pride and Prejudice, Emma is a lush and relatively true TV version of Austin's novel, especially given its short length. The biggest change between the novel and the film is a good one, since the unnecessary snobbery that Austin demonstrates at the end of the story is here removed and replaced by someone much more like Emma’s character in the rest of the book. I thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well chosen. Kate Beckinsale is a fine line between a girl and a social snob with grace, completely lost in Gwyneth Paltrow’s version of '96. Thin light strands of Samantha Morton fit her attitude and character, since the more simple one that accompanies her role in the previous characteristics has been replaced by Harriet, which we know from the book. The role of Mr. Knightley, in my opinion, is very well executed; both seriousness and tender compassion, with which the hero is painted in the novel, are present here in this very neglected, luxurious film.
