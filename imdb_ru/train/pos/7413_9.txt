The shower keeps itself in many ways. Almost the entire film takes place in an old bath where the inhabitants create humor, pathos and emotional touch. The love and friendship between the owner and his backward son is deep and touching. The way the elder brother is drawn into this tiny world seems unconvincing and convincing. The plot is sinuous, full of surprises and irony, and generally touched by the feeling of what I would call a neighborhood in relations and conflicts of performers. This is a film that I shoot when I want to believe in the world again.
