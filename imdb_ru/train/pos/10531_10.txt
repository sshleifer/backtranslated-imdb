I love this film. My friend Marcus and I looked through the local Hastings because we had the desire to rent something we had never seen and came across this wonderful movie. We had no idea what it would be about, but it turned out to be impressive. 2 thumbs up. I liked the way the movie was shot and the actors were very funny. If you're looking for a funny movie that makes you think, I highly recommend that you quickly go to your local video store and find this movie. I would tell you some of my favorite roles, but it can spoil the movie for you, so I will not. This film is definitely in the top 10 of my best films. Do you really think that there is nothing cheerful?
