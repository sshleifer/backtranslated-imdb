If you like the subtle (yes, I said, subtle) actions and reactions of John Candy, you cannot but like this film (pronounced Salvatore Di Pasquale "Fillum"). A non-observing (and ignorant) observer always saw Candy as a broad actor - a big jester. And sometimes he was (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But, when given such an opportunity, it can be really sharp and quite subtle. It is a pity that he played in so many roles that only showed his wide side, because we will never see more than others. Oh, yes, the movie. You can watch "Going Berserk" again and again (I know, I have) with the frequency of "Caddyshack". This is just good. The plot, albeit a bit confusing, is actually quite deep for such a farce. This allows Candy and the always underrated Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to bounce off Candy ... and they bounce off the hard ones. Definitely worth a look at those who loved SCTV or other Candy work.
