I showed it to my 6th grade about 17 years ago, and the students enjoyed it. I loved it too. The history of termites and their interaction with the environment is amazing. The composition of the creatures is deep, and they all play their part well. The battle between two cold-blooded titans is truly classic shots. <br /> <br /> Alan Ruth did an incredible cinematographic work, and this was to win the Best Documentary Oscar. My copy does not have Orson Wells telling about her (Derek Jacobi), and it is not called “Mysterious Clay Castles,” just “Clay Castles.” It makes me think that it must have been done with the addition of Wells for the power of the star and the push of the Oscar. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to find this VHS recently, and now it’s my children’s favorite movie. They brought it to the last family gathering instead of the Disney movie. If you can find this movie, you are really lucky.
