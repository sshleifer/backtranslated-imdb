One of the funniest John, Eugene Levy, is great and in this, I just want the studio to find out that this should be on DVD, I have it on videotape, but I feel that this film deserves a DVD (and additional materials will be great) the parody of Kung Fu Uuniversity (Kung Fu U) is very funny, like the whole movie, and the scenes he makes with his girlfriend and her family are great, this movie is never shown on TV, but it loses the most If you can find a video, I would advise you to buy it (ebay is a good place to IT copy). I will save my VHS until one day we see it on DVD. There are so many great films that are still not released on DVD, and this is one of them.
