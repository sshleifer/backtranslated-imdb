I remember when I first saw this short film, I really laughed so hard that, like in many other films that I saw, there was no sound! Curly is really good at opera singing, I am surprised that he did not consider his career a professional singer, because he was really good! <br /> <br /> If you noticed that it was filmed closer to the end of Curly’s career as a puppet, you could really say that he changed because he lost weight and was thinner, his voice went deep, his face was covered wrinkled, although he could still handle it, he looked like he was fifty at the age of forty. This was because he suffered from many small strokes before he finished his career. If he had managed to do it in his last! <br /> <br /> If you don’t mind the fact that Curly is really sick at this moment, this is actually one of their funniest shorts. I know that I don’t mind that Curly really changes, because I still thought he was great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
