Daniel Day-Lewis plays a remarkable role by playing Christie Brown, an artist who grew up with cerebral palsy, but managed to lead a productive life, successfully coping with his shortcoming and becoming a respected artist and writer. <br /> <br /> The film, however, is very difficult to reconsider - or even watch. Fortunately, I had a signature function to catch every word spoken, which would have been impossible if I had watched a movie in a theater. Although I regard this as a bold work on a complex subject, I cannot say that this is the film that I would like to see more than once. <br /> <br /> However, my attention was attracted by a narrative device, a memory created by the present, in which we see how Christie won the honor for his achievements before we see the memories of his youth and his struggle for communication with others, which undoubtedly rendered him loving care. br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis is certainly remarkable as a restless man who fell in love with a therapist (FIONA SHAW), largely because of his mother’s fear that when love is not reciprocated, his heart will be broken. The restaurant has a painfully long scene in which he confesses her love before others, and then falls into a furious rage after drinking too much. <br /> <br /> BRAND FREAKER does a brilliant job when a mother takes care of him. his father and his siblings, trying to hold a roof over their heads, until Day-Lewis succeeds in his work. She complements Day-Lewis's performance as a heartfelt mother and shares many thrilling moments with him. <br /> <br /> A very detailed story of a family that stayed together in the most unusual circumstances, with attention to the details of the period. every frame of the movie. Both Fricker and Day-Lewis won an Oscar, but Hugh O'Conor and Ray McCanally also are great. O'Conor is Christie as a child, and McAnelli is the father, who spends too much time in the local pub, but loves the boy. <br /> <br /> To sum up: Elmer Bernstein’s music is an added plus. Well worth it, but definitely not a movie for everyone.
