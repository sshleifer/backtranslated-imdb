I saw the film twice in one week, both times at the cinema in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place was crowded both times, and people had to turn away. From the very beginning of the film, when Henry Winkler was “injured” on the football field, the entire audience was shocked by laughter, laughter, which lasted until the credits. <br /> <br /> For those who love American wrestling, this film is a must, but be prepared to see Henry Winkler, as you have never seen him before. Also pay attention to a very famous actor, whose struggle for a trademark is dizzying, but! <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this film, then this is a family comedy at its best!
