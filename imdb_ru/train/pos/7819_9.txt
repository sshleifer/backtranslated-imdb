What movie! I never thought that Richard Attenborough could have such a film in it. Gandhi always left me indifferent, except for Ben Kingsley, and I never considered Attenborough to be a particularly good director. But Cry Freedom interested me, as recently few films. This is an exciting, fascinating political film with great performances by Kevin Klein and young Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> Klein plays Donald Woods, editor of the South African newspaper who is supported by Steve Biko, a civil rights activist. It begins as a difficult friendship, since Woods sees Biko as a black supremacist who preaches hatred against whites. But Biko, with his kind words, optimistic attitude and full transparency, wins Woods and introduces him to the reality of an apartheid, about which Woods did not know anything. <br /> <br /> Biko is a decent, law-abiding citizen who altruistically opposes all prejudices and a system that suppresses his people. One night, after an illegal meeting, he was arrested and beaten to death. The authorities are trying to hush up the issue, because Biko has become a huge personality in South Africa. But thanks to the efforts of Woods, the truth comes out. But what should be a triumph is only a nightmare when Woods and his family are targeted by the secret police. <br /> <br /> This movie has an interesting structure. In fact, he has two narrations: he first talks about Biko’s life and death. This is a terrific first half, dominated by the charisma of Washington, which may still be his best performance. <br /> <br /> The second half, no less interesting, talks about Woods’s attempt to escape from South Africa to publish a book about Biko. Woods became the enemy of the state, banned by man, which means that he cannot meet people or leave his country. Plus he constantly spies on the police. Kevin Kline is doing well in the second half. <br /> <br /> Although the first half is fairly simple, the second does interesting things with editing, giving memories of Biko and events that show repression against black South Africans. Some may argue that this should make it more interesting, but for me the second half is just as exciting because Woods and his family are developing a bold plan to save South Africa. <br /> <br /> Last minutes were so heartbreaking that I was in tears. The account of George Fenton and Jonas Gwangwa is certainly somehow related to this. Although I have never been a big fan of Fenton (I can’t bear his Gandhi score), I think the score for Cry Freedom is one of the most beautiful ever written for a movie. Thanks to music, combined with powerful images, the film sometimes reached incredible emotions. <br /> <br /> “Screaming Freedom” is definitely not just a film due to Denzel Washington. This is a film that must be protected in its entirety. Acting, writing, music, editing, cinematography are combined into an ideal synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit. This film deserves a place next to films such as "The Pianist", "Life is Beautiful" and "Escape from the Shoushenk."
