Sarah Silverman program ... better than other shows. No tracks of laughter, no painful jokes, just a program. Sarah Silverman program. If you are like me and love comedy, perhaps this show is for you. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman easily and naturally brings to the table funny and funny here. A combination of different styles that create their own. <br /> <br /> With this program you do not want to start a comparison war, knowing that it is absolutely not connected with them (other shows). This show is its own face, and I think most comedic heads will just like it. <br /> <br /> Go and see.
