I may be running ahead here, but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time, I watched it in parts at TCM last night, I have a question: why did they do it? putting their lives at risk, many of them died on the way, why should they undertake such a life-threatening journey, just to find food for their animals (!), as soon as they reached the “land of milk and honey”, why not they just stay there ? Would you endanger your life and the life of your entire community, just to find food for a herd of cattle? However dangerous it may be for this purpose, it demonstrates the innate simplicity of people of this type. The risk of death for the cow ?? Better than me!
