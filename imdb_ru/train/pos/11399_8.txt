So, the plot is on shaky ground. Yes, well, so there are a few randomly inserted songs and / or dance sequences (for example: Adam’s concert and Henry’s stage act). And Leslie Caron can't really, well, you know ... act. <br /> <br /> But somehow, “The American in Paris” manages to get through it all as a polished, first-class musical ... largely due to the incredible dance talent and choreography of Gene Kelly, as well as loads of charm, which he seems to be brings in every scene with Caron. (He needs to, because she seems to have ... a problem with emotions.) <br /> <br /> The most perfect and technically impressive number in this musical is obviously the 16-minute ballet at the end of the film. It's amazing shot, and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully. But my favorite number was to become the character Kelly, who sings "I Got Rhythm" with a group of French schoolchildren, and then begins to dance American dances. It just proves that you don't need special effects when you have real * talent *. <br /> <br /> Not at the level of “classics” with “Singin 'In The Rain”, but quite high there, nonetheless. Worth a look!
