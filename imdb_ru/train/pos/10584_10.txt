The “Foot Parade” is fascinating on many levels. Of course, the supposedly staged “theater prologues” could not be created in any theater on earth. Think, for example, of huge pools and three-story high fountains for “At the Falls”. (Berkeley shot John Garfield in "They made me a criminal" six years later, and the children from the impasse sang "At the Falls" when they were taking a shower.) <br /> <br /> The Shanghai Lily is the best Production number in the picture . This is a catalog of the feelings of the 30s Warner Bros. Pay attention to African guys mixed on stage with white and Asian prostitutes. You would never see blacks integrated into the social scene in other films of the period, if they were not porters on the train or maids in a big house. Here, the black guys sit at the bar and sing along with the rest. I also feel the thrill when military dancers make a presentation of the "card section" of Roosevelt's image. There is also an eagle NRA - the logo of the scandalous National Administration for the restoration of the New Deal. The FDR was a new president, and hopes were so great that he would pull the nation out of the depression. Of course, you will never see something like this, oriented to the working class, from MGM. Warner Bros. wholeheartedly supported the rise dictated by F.D.R. administration. <br /> <br /> Dear little Miss Ruby Keeler has never been better than she plays the Chinese prostitute Lil. She doesn't even look at her feet when she dances, which was one of her trademark flaws. <br /> <br /> Pre-Code is fun. The number “At the Falls” is wonderful in this respect. Girls dress up in bathing suits on a crowded bus that rushes through Times Square with all the lights. Common eagle girls floating above the camera provide the look of crotch images that will not be visible for 35 years. In a few months, the Manufacturing Code will eliminate such naughty pleasures.
