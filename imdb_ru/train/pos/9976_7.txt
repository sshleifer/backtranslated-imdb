Of course, it was stupid and pointless, and sometimes banal, but at least the filmmakers did not try. While most television films border on the edge of mediocrity, this film has some redemptive qualities. The cinematography was pretty good for a television movie, and Viggo Mortensen shows off Aragorn in a movie about a man who plays by his own rules. Most of the episodes of memories were pretty stupid, but the mountain lion scene was intense. I was kind of annoyed with the role of Jason Priestley in the film as a rebellious shock jock, but again, this is a television movie! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack was terrible. Nevertheless, it was nice to see that Tucson, Arizona, is widely represented in the film.
