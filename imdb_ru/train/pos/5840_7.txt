Although the premise of the film is rather unconvincing (Ollie is diagnosed with “orophobia”), the film is a pleasant and enjoyable film. It’s also damn better than the films they shot after that - perhaps since it was the last Laurel and Hardy film from the Choir Roach. In fact, it would be nice not to see ANY of their latest films, since all the chemistry in these films is lost, and the boys play their roles solely for the pathos - something that Laurel and Hardy would never do. They had a bit of a flaw that is not found in all later films. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie work at a horn factory. It sounds pretty funny, but it is not. Not surprisingly, with all the racketeering, Ollie will soon have a nervous breakdown, and he should rest. The Doctor (James Finlayson - in his latest film with the team) recommends a trip to the ocean. However, they do not like sailing, and Stan has an idea to just rent a boat tied to the pier - then they can get all the sea air they want, without any care! As soon as they are on the boat, the dangerous escaped criminal gets on the boat, and they all accidentally set sail. Fortunately, this part of the film was actually very dynamic, and the end itself was very successful. <br /> <br /> Although Laurel and Hardy was not an excellent full-length film, it was much better than many of them, because it had no annoying and distracting musical numbers (like in “The Devil Brother” or BABES IN TOYLAND ”). In addition, there is a decent amount of physical comedy - something that you hardly see after this film. This was partly due to the deteriorating health of the boys (and the growing girth of Ollie), and partly to the complete bad taste of these later films.
