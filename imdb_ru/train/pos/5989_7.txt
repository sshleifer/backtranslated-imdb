The film begins with a group of children in the reform school and focuses on a child named Gabe, who apparently worked a lot to deserve his parole. Gabe and his sister are moving to a new area to start all over again, and soon Gabe meets with Dead End Kids. “Children” in this film are small punks, but they are much less asocial than in other previous films, and at heart they are well-meaning punks. However, there are also some criminals in the area who commit insurance fraud with arson and see Gabe as a convenient scapegoat - after all, he reformed the school and no one would believe that he was innocent after being framed. . So, when Gabe is ready to be sent back to the “Big House,” the rest of the gang must save him and expose the real scammers. <br /> <br /> Dead End Kids appeared in several Warner Brothers films in the late 1930s, and the films were usually very good (especially “Angels with dirty faces”). However, after the boys had expired contracts, they went to Monogram Studios, and the films, to put it mildly, were very weak and formal - with Hunts Hall and Leo Gorsi, which were almost the entire performance, and the group was renamed “The Bowery Boys ". Since ANGELS WASH THEIR FACES had excellent writing and production skills, and Hall and Gorsy do not constantly rob the camera, this is a pretty good movie - and almost 7 points (it's really close). In fact, although it is not very good film from an aesthetic point of view, look at it very fun, p I’ll give him 7! Of course, it was a bit strange, especially towards the end, when the children took the law into their own hands, and Reagan ignored the Bill of Rights, but it was also quite interesting. Dead End Kids make their best performances, and Ronald Reagan and Anne Sheridan provided excellent support. Of course, this part of the film was illogical and impossible, but for some reason it was still funny and quite charming - so if you can stop the disbelief, it works well.
