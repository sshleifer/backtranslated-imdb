Riding Giants is an incredible documentary telling in detail the story and stories of three powerful surfers playing the big wave, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta did an amazing job taking on the role of director, and should be congratulated on such a brilliant job. The structure of the film is edited brilliantly and perfectly combined with narration, interviews, animation and surfing. The musical soundtrack simply adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this movie, making Riding Giants great viewing. Personal moments include any comments by Greg Noll, including his frank frankness, shots of Laird Hamilton on Teaupoo and the results at the end of the film. But in fact, this entire film is one big recommended zest, which is highly recommended if you have the opportunity to watch. It's a shame, it is not so well known, but it is a gem worthy of attention. 10/10
