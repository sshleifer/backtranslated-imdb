Hopefully, by now the score has changed thanks to my brilliant and amazing review, which convinces all of you to go and see the film, thus creating an instant chorus “8”, the true score of this film. <br /> <br /> As previously mentioned Chris Rock is King! Before I watched this movie, I wasn’t thrilled with it, but now I’m knocking on the doors of Chris Rock’s website, begging him to take me as my protege. This film is really funny, if you don’t find this movie funny, you REALLY need therapy, and it’s humor that targets all areas of society, including race (as expected), class differences, love, wealth, employment, dreams, comedies performances. . the list goes on. <br /> <br /> However, there was one slight disappointment for me. It was that, having entered this film, I did not realize that it was a remake of Heavenly Waiting, another good film made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. Thus, I was very surprised when I watched this film, and suddenly the plot began to disintegrate to be clearly similar to an older film that I watched on TV a few weeks ago ... Despite the fact that this film, in my opinion is the best version of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers, and the fact that Chris Rock is funnier than Warren Beatty at any second of any day of any week of any year of any ... you get the picture. <br /> <br /> Well, to the real plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Do not spoil the experience for yourself! Do not read the plot! Just go and see the movie, because IMDb still had two reviews that were crazy about it, go watch it, because this is the most fun thing you've seen in a long time, go and see it, because the movie experience it leaves you grumbling ad nauseam at the cost of movie tickets. Watch this because it's a good movie!
