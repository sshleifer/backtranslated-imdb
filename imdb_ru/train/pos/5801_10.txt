This film is exciting, bold and the music is very good. The film Moonwalker was supposed to coincide with the album Bad (1987). I have a bad. It is excellent (*****). The film begins with Michael Jackson, performing "The Man in the Mirror" on stage. He then reveals the story of Michael, from his early days in Jackson 5 to the "bad" era. Oh, and Badder is also good (Badder is a parody of a music video for a music video for Bad the single). Then he shows a video of Speed ​​Demon. The song and video are really very, very good. For example, leave me alone, which appears after. He then shows the movie Moonwalker. A few minutes later he plays in crime crime at a club called club 30. How and when he stoops. Anyway, good to see you. Goodbye.
