“Enter the Fat Dragon” is one of the funniest martial arts movies I've ever seen. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese guy who comes to visit a friend of the city. Just like Tang Lung from The Dragon Path. Wherever Sammo goes, trouble begins, so he must rely on his martial arts skills to resolve differences. Fortunately, Sammo's character learns the martial arts, imitating and imitating his idol Bruce Lee. He even strokes his nose with his thumb, just like Bruce Lee, and also publishes his screeching. He also uses nunchucks in the scene. It was like watching fat Bruce Lee. At the end of the film is a great show show, consisting of foreign fighters. Sammo must meet with each opponent one by one. It seems like the "Game of Death", where every fighter has excellent martial arts discipline from each other. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films that I really enjoyed watching, as well as the very first Sammo Hung films that I 'saw. Great fighting scenes and lots of laughter. A rare classic film by Sammo Hung, which I highly recommend to all martial arts fans. 8.5 / 10!
