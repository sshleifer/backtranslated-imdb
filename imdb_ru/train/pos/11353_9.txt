This film was excellent. It details the struggle between a dedicated detective against the devoted ignorance of a corrupt communist regime in Russia in the 1980s. I highly appreciate this film for the fact that there are no forbidden views on the birth and development of forensic medical examination in a globally isolated (thanks to the “Regime”) community. This is a graphic film. It presents a non-nationalized picture of violence, and these are tragic remnants. Nothing is “covered in candy” with excessive blood or blood to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen. This film is based on the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. I am familiar enough with the real story to really appreciate how deeply they have saved the film. This is not a comedy, but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor, this film is a must-see.
