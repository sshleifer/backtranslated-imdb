Well ... Vivah is a pretty good, but typical Suraj Barjatya film. It shows various aspects of Indian families, wedding ceremonies, etc. The film is more than good, but not very good. <br /> <br /> The big plus of the film is direction, music, the game of Shahid and Amrita (especially the last scene). The film begins with a common factor of the Indian film - the girl does not love her stepmother. The plot of the film is a bit common, but it's good, good enough to make the movie a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Minus is the usual story of a Bollywood movie. In general, I would say that you need to watch a movie twice if you want to see typical Indian family values ​​and, of course, love!
