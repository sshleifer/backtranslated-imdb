Not many things happen in this film, but many meanings. The woman thought that she had everything she could in life, but this was really not the case, and she recognized herself when she met this man, who did some research for his next job. In fact, there should be more types of films like this, I'm not even as old as it is considered “mature” (by the way, I am 13), and I still understood the idea and meaning of the film. The main thing in my opinion: do not think that you can not have a better life, simply because you now have this. <br /> <br /> Although I have to admit that I was thinking about another film, but after reading all the reviews and seeing the trailer, I chose this one, although I knew that there wasn’t much action in the film. I recommend everyone to watch this film, as it has very good moments in the film and a really good ending.
