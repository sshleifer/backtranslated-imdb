Alexander "Sasha" Luzhin (John Turturro) is a former leading chess player trying to return to the tournament held in Italy. His brilliance is beyond doubt, but his obsession with chess delays his growth in all other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a wonderful heiress who came to the same resort with her mother, Vera (Geraldine James), to find possible marriage partners. Vera is inclined towards a beautiful earl, but, surprisingly, Natalya is more fascinated by Sasha, whom she met on a walk. Sasha is also taken with Natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting. But with the concentration that Sasha should give to chess matches, and, considering that other events in his past still cause problems, can he win the heart of Natalia? Oh, and can he become a chess champion too? This is a wonderful film based on the novel by Nabokov. The game is gorgeous: Watson is very good at playing the role of a beautiful little rich girl, and Turturro is perfectly like a shy, awkward chess enthusiast. James gives a pretty nice twist, as the domineering mother and other actors are also wonderful. As for the appearance of the film, it could not be better. The scenery is varied, vintage costumes are gorgeous, and cinema deserves applause. Yes, the story is unusual and is told using memories, sometimes making the film a film that not everyone will appreciate. Then the end is bitter-sweet. However, if you love romance, historical plays, great game, knock-out scenery or the visual art of making movies, do not miss this one. You will be defenseless in resisting his many spells.
