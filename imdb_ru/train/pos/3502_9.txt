Blimey! I loved this movie and love Judy Martha! This girl is not just a stunningly beautiful face, she is funny and really very talented !! She made me laugh many times simply because she was very naturally rude to Victor, who was desperately hitting her! We will see her a lot in the coming years ... and, probably, also from director Peter Sollett and his colleague Viktor Rasuk! <br /> <br /> “Educating Victor Vargas” is one of the best films I have seen in a long time! Very refreshing! It's true, beautiful, funny, well filmed, he has everything: a good story, good actors, a good film guide! <br /> <br /> If you like simple, slow, real movies, movies about life, for example, Jersey Girl from Kevin Smith, you will love Victor Vargas! It is better!
