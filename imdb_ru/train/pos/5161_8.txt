Kirk and the team are landing on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode. They intend to evacuate the residents, but consider this place to be abandoned, with the exception of Mr. Athos, who runs some high-tech library. Despite attempts to get a direct answer from him about the whereabouts of each, Atoz is indifferent to their questions and insists that they must quickly "make a choice while there is time." They have no idea what he is talking about, but they wander, looking at the mirror disks at the audience, and they see images of the past of the planet. Then, while the disc is in the viewer, Kirk runs through the doorway and magically moves back in time to what on Earth would be like the time of Louis XIV (1660s). When he is followed by McCoy and Spock, another disk appears in the viewer, and they go to the Ice Age hell. Too late, they realize that the library is a machine and storage for time travel. <br /> <br /> Although Kirk's visit is rather short and not so exciting, Spock and McCoy are much more eventful, since Spock falls to some degree. for Marietta Hartley - who was sent to this terrible place as a punishment. The scenes with Spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical for the usually logical guy. <br /> <br /> Spock's retreat from the norm, a wildly inventive scenario and very diverse locations make this exceptional episode one of those worth seeing. <br /> <br /> For your information - Ian Wolfe, an excellent actor, played Mr. Atosa. I'm a big fan of old movies, and I saw him as an auxiliary player in countless films of the 30s and 40s, and he looked almost exactly the same as in this episode of 1969. Interestingly, despite the fact that he looked ancient, he lived for another 23 years - dying over the age of 95 years !!
