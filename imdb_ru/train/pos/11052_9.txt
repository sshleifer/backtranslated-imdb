When I was six years old, I found out about a show called “Los Campeones”, and even if I was a child, I did everything I needed to convince my parents to let me watch “Champions” and “Avengers” once a week . I think it was the golden age of the English series ... (I already have a full cycle of "Prisoner"!), But it also lasted a few years later with "The Tomorrow People", "The Worst Witch" (I'm just or is it “Harry Potter” in the girl, of course, before I want the Campions to be in Zone 1 or Zone 4, I also wait for “Doctor Who” (pack the whole series into a set, maybe 300 DVDs, please, I could not spend more on this, 8), “People of Tomorrow” and several other “low budget”, but wonderful stories that will be available in my reached zones. They speak English, but not all of my relatives, including my parents, who introduced me to these wonderful stories ... I hope that someday someone will feel the appeal of these series, and then be able to sell them as I originally did represented .. Voiced or with subtitles, but in the same format in which I saw them. Remember, zone 1 or 4 is OK with my TV!
