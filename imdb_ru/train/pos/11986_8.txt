One evening I was watching “Talk Easy” and thought that everything was alright, but I missed something. Maybe Buster Keaton, oddly enough, threw me off, or the difficult delivery line of the leading lady. The next day I kept thinking about the film. I couldn't get the Durante song out of my head, I kept trying to better remember the first scene of Thelma Todd, I thought that maybe Keaton did make some funny falls and physical comedy. The next night, I watched the scene with Thelma Todd as a sly chorus girl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal. Very funny scene, great actors, their faces, their eyes, their stupid expressions. So I watched another scene, their show opens on Broadway. Buster, in his blissful innocence, refutes every act. I laughed out loud again, appreciating Keaton's clowning and tumbling. So, the next night I watched the whole movie again, and this time I see it for the first time: this is amazing! This is sensational! It is sublime! Three great comedians! Todd is dancing! Durante sings! Keaton says! Of course, this is not a poison ... but there is a lot of laughter in this picture.
