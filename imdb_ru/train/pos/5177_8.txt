I watched it last night after not seeing it for several years. This is a really funny little film with a bunch of people you didn't even know about. Arkin shines as always. Check this; You will not be disappointed. By the way, it was released only on DVD and, unlike packaging, it is widescreen. The transfer is rather scanty, but at least the whole movie is visible. ;-)
