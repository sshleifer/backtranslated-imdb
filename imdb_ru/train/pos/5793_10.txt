Michael Jackson's Moonwalker is a real adventure film for the whole family! <br /> <br /> Before the real story of the film begins, we will see the play “Bad Tour” (“The Man in the Mirror”) and it will begin. a great movie. After that, we get a sort of Michael Carrier collage, as it was before the 1988 Moonwalker release. After several music videos (Speed ​​Demon, Leave Me Alone, etc.), the story begins. <br /> <br /> The plot basically lies in the fact that Michael and his 3 friends (who are children) are being chased by the bad guy in Mr. Big history because they discovered his evil plans to make children all over the world sit down on drugs. During the chase we see fantastic stretches, fx. Michaels video for Smooth Criminal, which is just fantastic with his dance episodes, etc. But then Mr. Big will kidnap one of the children, and Michael will dare to save her before she becomes a drug addict. <br /> <br /> During the film, we see special effects not only stunning for those times standards, but also impressive today. For example, see Michael turning to the robot / spacecraft to protect his friends! That is so cool! <br /> <br /> The film ends with the play “Together” (later published in Michael Histori’s double album), and you leave the film with a magical feeling. Amazing <br /> <br /> I recommend this for every family who wants to spend a pleasant night with sweets and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents can stand up and say: “But Michael Jackson is the alleged abuser of a child!” Yes, he really is, but, come on, we all know that this is not true! Wait and watch ..
