Tom Hanks starred in such hit films as Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile. For the most part, his roles were good guys that we cheer on. In the movie “The Road to Death”, his character Michael Sullivani is slightly different. <br /> <br /> In Sam Mendez’s The Road to Perdition, based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, he shows the story of a man and his son. on the road during the great depression in chicago. A distinctive feature of this small journey is that Sullivan is the killer who is hunted by his former partner. His boss or former boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) loves him almost more than his own son, Sullivan’s partner Connor (Daniel Craig). <br /> <br /> After the job is done wrong, because Connor, the only Witness for his mistakes are Sullivan and his son, who should not have been there. Therefore, Connor tries to take Sullivan and his family, but receives only his wife and another son, Peter. Sullivan intercepts the blow and hurries home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table ... just sitting. After the death of his wife and child, Sullivan sets out to find the answers. <br /> <br /> The story follows two, as Sullivan is trying to rectify the situation in the memory of his wife and child, as well as of Michael, who feels like his fault in all of this. He feels that his curiosity killed his mother and brother. Tyler Hechlin perfectly copes with the role of Michael Jr. He brings maturity as well as a sense of youth. His loss of innocence is well played when he travels from city to city, leaving nothing behind. <br /> <br /> Mendez's previous hit was American Beauty, which won five Oscars, including Best Film and Best Director. This film did not receive much success in the Oscars, having received only one award for the best cinematography, but received five other nominations for music, sound and Best Actor in the Secondary Play for Paul Newman. This picture is a wonderful story that takes you on a journey through the Midwest and tells the legend of Mike Sullivan: a husband, a hired killer, and a devoted father. This movie is a movie with a dream to watch for years.
