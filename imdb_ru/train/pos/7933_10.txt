Good times worked with the Quiroz brothers, and the entire cast on this project was like The Guy on the Bench. I was amazed at how well they managed to capture all the characteristics of a real horror film "B". I hope I will have the opportunity to work again with the team of Pumpkin Patch Pictures in the future. I moved to Detroit soon after completion, and after the release I was publicly admitted several times. One time was actually in the video store, and the girl, damn it, almost went crazy. It was pretty funny, and it was my first real autograph when I signed her receipt. Once I asked a girl in Blockbuster if a movie was often made, and she confirmed it by looking at the computer. At that time, it was rented more than Ring2, which was also a new release at the time ... The name really attracts immediate interest in more urban markets. She also noticed that in many cases the film was not returned by the client, which made me believe that the film is just so good that people donâ€™t want to return it ... Beware of ZoMbIeS when they get me in the hood! Jaysun Barr (The guy on the bench-2005)
