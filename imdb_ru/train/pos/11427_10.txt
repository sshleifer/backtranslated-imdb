I liked this film because, in my opinion, it so perfectly reflected what I imagined life in French colonial Africa, probably in the 50s (at least, “my” generation). But I was truly delighted with his quiet rhythm and glorious end. During the last 5 minutes of this movie, you should focus on what is happening. I have never been so impressed with the "completion" of the film. I remember shouting "wow!" when I realized that it was all over On the other hand, my two daughters fell asleep on the couch !!
