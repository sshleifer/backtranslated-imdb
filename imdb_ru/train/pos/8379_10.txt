I remember this film when I was 12 years old, it was amazing .. I remember it until today is not like most things I watched then, I even tried to buy it, but it's like a rocking horse, damn it! In any case, the acting is a bit chewing, but the story is amazing, considering that it was a real B movie with a small budget, and, despite the fact that the scenes of the fights were amazing, I probably watched it about 20 times. It was a very well-made film, and I liked the idea of ​​fighting giant human-controlled robots, it’s a pity they had to spoil it by making a lousy piece of “Crash and Burn”, don’t watch this movie because it’s full of pants! If you're a real fan of Sci-Fi movies, watch it, if it was redone today, it would be a winner ... I would really like to see a remake or even release its DVD.
