This series has all the typical characters of a comedy: a good guy, an idiot, a pervert, a rich girl ... but this happens in the 70s. This is the only difference from other television comedies. I don't know how you might like this show. His humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct ... A typical dialogue is: “Thess: Oh, Jackie, I want to have sex with you. (Audience laughs) Jackie: Fez, you're a pervert. Oh yes. (Audience applauds) “This is not funny. I think that if it were not for this laughter (I do not know how you call it in English, sorry), you would not laugh at all. This is not an intellectual comedy, it is an insult to the public. I like most American comedies, but this is not good at all. I would give 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my bad english again.)
