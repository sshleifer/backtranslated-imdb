I enjoyed this movie, but I hated it because I wanted to help this guy! I am over fifty, and I have many friends in the music business ... who are still trying to become adults now ... there are no more fans, fans, money, etc., ... and it is so hard for them to adapt to ordinary life .. how they see new bands, etc., getting the spotlight ... it's like they have to start anew ... this film is evidence that many of the old rockers of the 70s and 80s are experiencing now ... and this is where I find the film sad and dull. BUT he depicts the life of an old rock star - abandoned and lost - believable. Hollis Maclaren (Outrageous) ... and she is one of the girls in the movie for which you will be rooting. This film should be for those over 50 who have seen the ups and downs of groups, people who knew the participants, and watched how they hurt when their age is approaching, and their popularity is fading. It's almost a perfect movie ... a garden, but in a sense, positive ... because of the whales. MUST SEE!
