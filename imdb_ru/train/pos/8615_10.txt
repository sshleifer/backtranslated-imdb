For some time I waited for the release of this film in Canada, and when it finally appeared, I was very glad to see him. I really liked it. Of course, in the beginning, this is a very sad film (and it was the New Year, which makes it even more sad), however, it remains with you. The next day I thought about it again, because although it revolves around something so emotionally draining, after a few days you realize that this is such a beautiful story. As one person can be seen as a connection with many people, but sometimes you can be blinded by so many things. And as a character, Diane Keaton rescues the rest, just by being there. And how they save her in the process. It was such an excellent film, and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) provides the perfect comic relief. This is definitely a movie for which you need a box with napkins, but he really will stay with you for a long time.
