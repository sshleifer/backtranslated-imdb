I consider Sarafina to be an enormous effort for Whoopi Goldberg. In addition to her, there are no other stars in the film, and her role is smaller than that of the main character of the film “Sarafina”. Since I work in a high school with urban children, I think this is an important film to show the history of apartheid in South Africa. Sarafina is a film about education and the relationship of a teacher with her student Sarafina. I bought a video for free at the video store. I looked at it and quickly went through the musical numbers. But I highly recommend this film to teachers and their students to understand. Now, although I don’t know the other actors and actresses in the film, I guess they are very popular in South Africa, and I’m glad they played with the South African cast and crew, except for Goldberg in a small role, but if it makes Watch this movie, then Whoopi will reach worldwide appeal.
