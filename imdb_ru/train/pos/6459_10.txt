Returning to the roots "as in heaven" - what are the real values ​​of life? These Swedes create a message that appeals to every heart. We have already seen this twice in the cinema, filled to the last place: love purity and joy in the music of the choir, which is simple, but full of power when everyone finds their inner tone. <br /> <br /> From the glory of glory to the school of his youth, now empty and ready to become a new home after being destroyed on stage, Daniel wants to start listening and the simple, warm and rude people of the North are drawn into life. <br /> <br /> He wins hearts with music and gains the ability to love and be unconditionally loved. <br /> <br /> Do not go if you have been rationed to Hollywood. This material does not contain any additions, only your laughter, your compassion, your tears!
