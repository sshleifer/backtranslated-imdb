The sensitive film lacks brightness and, to some extent, narrative structure, but, nevertheless, it is beautifully shot and executed. However, the point of the narrative structure is controversial. While in the final scenes one gets the impression that they connect the free ends well and connect their thoughts with what the modern viewer can describe as a “story”, I am skeptical about whether this feeling needs a “narration” structure ” which is definite and detectable. It will inevitably be compared to SOMERSAULT in that its main character (I'm not sure that this is the right word!) is a young and very young woman, whose recently discovered sexuality is embarrassing and expanding her possibilities - although , Kate Shortland's film solves this problem better, but while it’s possible for reckless viewers to reject this film as a cliché, PEACHES is in some ways more ambitious than SOMERSAULT. Perhaps this is not the case. is different from the first Monahan function - INTERVIEW! I’m not quite sure how the sex scenes between Weave and Light added to the story. Who knows - maybe they did. They, of course, rammed the house of Weaving's compromised and spoiled nature - although I personally think that this was achieved without the need for these scenes. <br /> <br /> ***** JUST SEE A FILM AGAIN ***** **** <br /> <br /> At the second viewing I see how some will reject it as telemedia, dressed up as a feature . But I am not sure how much these categories differ, or even if we should make this distinction. In any case, I think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from Hallmark's efforts. On the other hand, the structure of the film is very formal, and its content is hardly difficult, at least with regard to SOMERSAULT, TOM WHITE, THREE DOLLARS, ILLUSTRATED FAMILY DOCTOR, LOOKING BOTH AND HUMAN ADVENTURE. All the performances are good, but I realized that the main reason I enjoy the film is that it fits the “Australian” genre, without adding anything ... and I can understand that this can be a pretty good reason for another person * NOT * to please! Indeed, it’s only when Lung enters a room in her Vietnamese dress that the film really begins to strike. But this leads us to other debates - * should * we expect the film to challenge us all the time? Of course, I like it when I get challenged by a movie (or a book, or other people), but there’s no more room for what is just a good story? <br /> <br /> I have not deleted my first post on this issue. the film, because I know too well the Orwellian overtones of such an act. But I would lower my initial rating from 8 to maybe 6.5. <br /> <br /> With regard to the nominations for the best AFI film, my voices go to the HUMAN EVENT, THREE DOLLARS, and LOOK BOTH - and I think, LOOK Both ways should win.
