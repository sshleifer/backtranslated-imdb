Cheech & Chong's Next Movie (1980) was the second to star in the loving duet Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. Attractive smokers burned out, now roommates. They live in a doomed building looking for ways to smoke more and just lie all day. But Cheech is “responsible.” He has a job and a permanent girlfriend. One day, Cheech wants to put on his freak, so he tries to pull Chong out of the house. Another problem also occurs, brother Chicha "Red" (Cheech - another role) is in the city and wants to hang with him. It is terrible that he could kill two birds with one stone: One Cheek and the Pawns of Chong and Red. What adventures will Chong and Red? Cheech get his freak? How long will Chong be without smoke? Just take a look CHEECH & CHONG'S NEXT MOVIE to find out !! <br /> <br /> Tommy Chong accepts the director's board to continue. He gained some experience when he did uncredited work on UP IN SMOKE. Funny, but not as good as the first movie. But fans of Cheech and Chong will love it. Following the NICE DREAMS. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
