Ernst Mariska, one of the most respected Austrian directors of the time, made films full of beautiful scenes, tender love and respect for everything valuable in life. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, if people find out about him, they associate the name Marishka with the SISSI trilogy (1955, 1956, 1957). Nevertheless, he made other great films, such as “DAS DREIMADERLHAUS” (1958), “EMBEZZLED HEAVEN” (1958) and, of course, this one, “MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN”, featuring Queen Victoria’s youth. Although it deals with a slightly different theme from SISSI films, I don’t see much difference between this film and SISSI. They are strikingly similar. <br /> <br /> The film is almost identical. Style, music, photography. In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! <br /> <br /> Cast ... Romy Schneider is one of the first lead roles. It was a great introduction to her role as Sissy, since this film was shot a year before the first part of the trilogy about the Austrian empress. This is also the film where Romy plays with his mother Magda Schneider. But Ernst Mariska was not the first director to invite Romy to play with his mother. Romy's debut, WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953), was her performance with her mother. Therefore, there were some voices that Romy began her Austrian career on the basis of her mother’s fame. Indeed, there is some truth in this. <br /> <br /> Again, as in SISSI, this film shows love very gently. Victoria meets Prince Albert in a small hotel in Dover. Their sympathy is based on pure elevation in dance and tender smiles. And now...? How would this be shown? Only sex ... But is this the only thing on which love is based? <br /> <br /> I am grateful to Ernst Marishka for these films. They had a soul and a message. Some people may call them kitschy, but I will never stop admiring these films. They are impressive !!! Unfortunately, very low!
