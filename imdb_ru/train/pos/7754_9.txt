Any way the wind blows is Tom Barmen's debut film (which is also known as the frontman of the rock formation 'dEUS'). Filmed entirely in Antwerp (Belgium), the film begins on a sunny Friday morning and rather superficially misses events that fill dozens of main characters. When the film ends, you have something to think about, because most of the different storylines remain wide open. <br /> <br /> There is a (purely instrumental) soundtrack in the movie that will rock your music. socks off In most scenes, music really enhances the overall atmosphere and feel, making the film hallucinating for viewing at certain points in time. The main scene in the film, the party, is very well filmed. <br /> <br /> The director did not hesitate to use the video clip technique, in which his main characters are dancing on one of the best sound tracks I have heard lately. <br /> <br /> Script excellent material. Camera angles and colors are very well chosen. "Costumes" are very hot and very "seventies" too. And I loved (most of) acting. <br /> <br /> In the film, I liked the subtle strokes of absurd, surrealistic, very dry or even cynical humor alternating. <br /> Without pretending to be a comedy (this film, of course, is not a comedy, but rather an alternative work of art), he still manages to make the audience giggle and even laugh occasionally. <br /> <br /> This is another director debut, which should not be an ending. I hope to see more movies about Tom Barman in the future, because I had a good time. Greetings.
