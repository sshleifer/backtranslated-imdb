Fascinating, breathtaking and terrifying, this intrusively beautiful film is Apocalypse Now, without fiction. Slow pace, calm mood, it gives good glimpses of poisoned parts of the Earth, which may well be signs of imminent death. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt - nature suffers and we are sick. Greed, the very essence of humanity, which drives evolution and progress, has turned us into something like a cancer, capable of absorbing the host and dying with it ... <br /> <br /> The landscapes produced are a totally unforgettable experience - at least I will never again treat my toaster and iron the same way.
