Steve Carell plays the lead role as a person with whom you can relate (sort of) to Dan in real life, a film that I expected not to love, but in the end I liked him. It’s not that the film is laughing out loud, it’s just a big heart. We all like Steve Carell, this is not what The Office fans expect from him, but you know that I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Carell plays the role of Dan Burns, the father of a widow, whose daughters are not very fond of. One weekend, he and his daughters go to visit his family. While there, he goes to the bookstore and falls in love with a woman. When he returns to his home, he learns that his brother Mitch (played by Deina Cook) is dating this woman (played by Juliette Binoche). <br /> <br /> Dan in real life, sometimes I found a little unbelievable Is the Burns family really the people who do the exercises together, play board games together and do other family things? I highly doubt it. I do not know of any family that would be such. Does it stop me from giving a thumb? Not. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life: *** / ****
