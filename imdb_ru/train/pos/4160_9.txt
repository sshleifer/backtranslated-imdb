One word can describe this film, and it is strange. I recorded this film once because it was Japanese animation and it was old, so I thought it would be interesting. Well, this is a movie about a boy who travels around the universe to get a metal body so he can get revenge. On the way he meets very bright characters and ultimately must decide whether he wants the body or not. Very strange, if you're a fan of animation / science fiction, you can check it out.
