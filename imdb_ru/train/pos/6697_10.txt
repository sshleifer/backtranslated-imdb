I remember watching Sabrina for the first time when she was on television in the UK on ITV1, when I was 13/14. I am now 24 years old, and I still love him as much as when I first watched it. I get a little stick from some of my friends for still watching the “baby show”, but I don’t care! lol Caroline Rhea as "Hilda" is my personal favorite character, and later Morgan also became my favorite character. I remember how much time I spent watching various special events in honor of Sabrina on Nickeleoden UK. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, she was great at Clarrissa Explains All, but much better at that. I was gutted when they decided to finish it! I hope that it will soon be released on DVD here in the UK - I will be the first in line! lol x
