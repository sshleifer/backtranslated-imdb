This man is simply amazing. You really feel as if you lived his life with him throughout all these tragic events, and in the end you are crying with his family. He was so passionate about his business, not only for himself, but also so that others who survive in him would not go through this pitiful pain. I watch this video every time I have a bad or "bad" day, and I always manage to make me see the great and bright side of life, as Johnny did, even with unbearable pain. My only regret is that I don’t know about Johnny before, since I’ve been to England 2 times in my entire life and could have said I’ve met him. Nice to know that Johnny is sitting in a cloud without pain! Rest in peace dear Johnny. You deserve it!
