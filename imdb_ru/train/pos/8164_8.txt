This film was very pleasant, although you will like it only if: - you hate going to the dentist, but you are not afraid of a film in which one of them is losing heart - you like horror movies <br /> <br /> I especially liked the fact that some caution was given to explaining the gross actions of the protagonist. The fact that he is completely obsessed with cleanliness (especially in the mouth), and then catches his wives, giving oral pleasure to a dirty man in the pool, is a rather plausible reason to go overboard. <br /> <br /> I liked it, I give it 8.
