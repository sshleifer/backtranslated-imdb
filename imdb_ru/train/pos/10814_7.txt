Given the opposite circumstance of 2009, when the reality is that we have a black president, this film takes on quite a powerful historical significance. For entertainment, I found this film both attractive and disgusting. Of course, I was delighted with the blatant racism of the time, but also found the music and dancing incredible. It is also very cool to see Sammy Davis Jr. as such a young child actor. He plays Rufus Jones, a little boy who is comforted by his mom. They say to him: "Why can you ever become president?" It was so ridiculous in 1933 that they scoffed at him and considered him cute, charming and funny. Most of the film is a fantastic sequence of what the government would look like if it were ruled by a black man. They portray government seats as the Baptist revival church. <br /> <br /> The fact is that when I once came across this film, he attracted me. It is really well made and very interesting. I believe that if we can go beyond racism, we will see this film in everything that it brings to us. In fact, to understand that having a black president is not only not funny, but that it is normal, it just makes this film much more relevant. This clearly marks the point in time for our collective consciousness.
