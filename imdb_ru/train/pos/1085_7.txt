This film was a rather interesting comedy about Murphy's Law applied to home ownership and construction. If such a film were filmed today, undoubtedly, the family would be unfavorable. Since it was installed in the “simpler” forties, we get what should be a typical family of the era. Grant, of course, perfectly combines comedic and dramatic elements, and he works with a more than competent supporting actor, singled out by Loy and Douglas. Their scams make for ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10.
