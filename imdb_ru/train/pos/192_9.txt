Before I saw The People Show, my impression of a quiet comedy was, in fact, a farce, and only a farce. I could not imagine how screen comedy could have been possible without relying to a large extent on the spoken word or numerous blunders. But this masterful film proved me wrong. Davis, in my opinion, was probably the greatest comedic actress who came before Lucille Ball. I mention Lucy primarily because Davis ’manners and facial expressions reminded me of her to such an extent that I wondered if Davis was one of Ball’s main influences. This comes from a 21-year-old teenager who has never seen a quiet comedy before, and I have to say that no matter how many reference links you get (in fact, I did not) you will not have to miss a movie. You will probably even laugh more than most comedies. This is not only my favorite silent comedy, but it is easily included in the top ten of my favorite comedies of all time.
