This film deserves better. This is a lot of fun, there are great jokes and fun in it, some of them for “Wunderkinds” among us (and we know who we are), and the effects are really effective. Watching a bunch of Paul Rubens in the face of an Oscar winner is worth one entry price. I never read comics before I saw the movie, but since then. No matter how good they are, I still recommend the MM movie. (Although having a Flaming Carrot as a character would be cool too) Greg Kinnear, well ... amazing, like Captain Fabulous, and NO ONE CAN BE a "Spade", except William H. Macy. “We have a blind date with Fate. And it looks like she ordered lobster. ” Watch this movie. BUY THIS FILM! This is only 5 bucks and some changes at your local Wal-Mart. You will thank me. Actually you will. Oh, and Miss Garafolo in this. ONLY ONE makes it worthy of hours
