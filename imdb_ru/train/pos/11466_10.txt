I was lucky to see a zero day last night. This is a terrific movie. This is very disturbing. <br /> <br /> In a sense, Zero Day is very similar to The Blair Witch Project. It is removed from portable camcorders. These are about 2 children. Just your average kids. Andre and Calvin. They begin a campaign against the High School called "Army of Two". <br /> <br /> The whole story is told in the form of a video diary from two children. This shows that there is a relationship with parents, among other people, showing that these are just normal children, just like the people we know or have encountered. We learn that the last mission of Army of 2 will be called Zero Day. They plan to shoot there in high school. <br /> <br /> You see how they get access to weapons there, how they plan it, everything. They emphasize that the media did not affect them at all, and there is no reason for that. As I said, all this is told in the form of a video diary, and then they store the tapes in a safe, which can be seen after zero day. <br /> <br /> The actual filming is shown through Survillence cameras throughout the school. Cooling really. The film is very scary. Some of the things they say, how they plan it, you just have to see it for yourself. One quote I remember is the only time Calvin is on his own. He says: “Andre thinks that we were just going to leave in a car to get to numerous schools throughout the country. I don’t know what he is thinking about, but the only way out of school is in a black plastic bag. ”I’m probably not even giving you guys the right idea about this film. You really should see it's yourself. Now there are festivals. <br /> <br /> A +.
