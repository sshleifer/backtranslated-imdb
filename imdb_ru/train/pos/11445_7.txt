A new way to enjoy the work of Goldsworthy, Rivers and Tides, allows fans to see his work in motion. Watching how Goldsworthy builds his works, everyone starts to appreciate every stone, leaf and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, rivers and tides inspire and influence his work. Although I was happy that the film captured most of the works of Goldsworthy (without snowballs), I feel that it was quite long. The filmmakers did a wonderful job, making Goldsworthy work, and created a wonderful film that was fun to watch.
