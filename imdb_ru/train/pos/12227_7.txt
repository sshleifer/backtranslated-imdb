I was looking for this when I saw the fun and linguistically complex “Clueless” (1995), perhaps the most famous effort of Alicia Silverstone at the beginning of her film career. In “The Real Crime” is Kevin Dillon, who should help improve the majority of film projects. In fact, everyone in the cast does a good job. The only disappointment that I think the film has for me is an awkward “feeling” for some scenes, caused by the need to reproduce a rather uncompromising, adult theme, as part of what the tone of the schoolgirl begins as an adventure. /> <br /> Alicia Silverstone is good at this. She tolerates naive enthusiasm and growing anxiety that affects Mary Giordano when she maneuvers towards the truth behind the serial murders. I believe that her MG characteristic also has some mileage. The conclusion of the storyline is that it continues a career in law enforcement. For a senior Silverstone, it would be really interesting to visit Giordano again during the crisis that occurred later in the officer’s life. Just a thought! <br /> <br /> “True Crime” shows its director in a good light. Pat Verducci also has a written loan. I do not know about any other work with the film that PV did. I can only wonder at what happened after such a promising start. <br /> <br /> As with most of the performances, this film is mostly an unknown cast, although Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is hardly like that. Over the past decade, he seems to have managed to achieve an impressive number of appearances on the screen. I remember seeing him recently in Carriers (1998), made for a television presentation with a military theme. Bill Nunn played "Captain Arends." Fans of the classic American television comedy show "Who's the Boss" may also be interested in "Carriers", because the leading player is Judith Light, which many people fondly remember because of her continued participation in the show. <br /> <br /> “True crime” might not have worked easily, but this is normal. I think this is an interesting story worth seeing.
