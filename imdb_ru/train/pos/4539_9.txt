The acting is pretty silly, but for people living in this area in the 80s and now being the automotive engineers of Detroit, this is a great movie. I even work with a Japanese supplier, which makes this movie even more fun. <br /> <br /> Jay Leno showed his age at The Tonight Show last night! He looks pretty young here ... 17 years ago. The opening scene of the drag race on Woodward Avenue was magnificent. <br /> <br /> Leno now also has some bad cars **, it would be great to see a remake of this with his modern collection. I am sure that the blasted Vette in the initial scene was his own car. <br /> <br /> A typical 80s movie. Watch it and enjoy. No computer crap!
