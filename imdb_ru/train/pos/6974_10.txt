Recently, I looked at Caprica again and thought that I could just as well come and write a review! I first saw it right after seeing the Battlestar Galactica series finals (being a big enthusiastic fan of the show, I remained attached to everything I could in the show universe), so I didnâ€™t know what to expect ... but I came out with a smile, although I have to admit ... <br /> <br /> The story begins with the planet Caprica, and we are introduced to various interesting characters ... I will not give too much away, but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of history, but I suggest you watch this. <br /> <br /> I must say ... Esay Morales is one of the actors he took off from the young Joseph Adama. .. (Admiral's father in Battlestar Galactica) I found his acting place, and I could believe that he is the father of William Adama from BSG ... <br /> <br /> Also Eric Stoltz exactly fits his role. ..! Special note was nice to see Polly Walker outside of Rome! Do not sit down and watch Caprica, expecting it to look like Battlestar Galactica, because the storyline is pretty straightforward, and anyone can see it ... without having to see BSG !. <br /> <br /> This show is a well-written drama for those who love drama there with a bit of science fiction strike!
