Police Story is an amazing series of stage compositions for Jackie Chan, demonstrating his unique talents and courage. Some of these tricks are one of the best and most dangerous for Jackie, and the entire final bout at the mall is probably Jackie’s biggest sequence of martial arts, more brutal and less comical than, say, at the end of the “Project A” or Drunken Master ”in which you almost feel the pain effect. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, the rest of the film does not stand up to this quality, as this is a rather formal police thriller with some elements of comedy. I always prefer JC in films like Project A, where his natural comic talents shine through. Within the serious boundaries of some elements of the Police Story, this just does not work for me. Having said that, although it is still there with the best Jackie films because of the incredible stunt work and pure spectacle. <br /> <br /> As usual with Hong Kong movies, avoid dubbing the English version of the DVD, as it is really terrible. subtitles <br /> <br /> An excellent trick, well, the film is a good starting point if you have not seen the JC movie before, and it’s worth seeing any movie fan. 7/10
