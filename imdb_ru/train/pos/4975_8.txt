Lord, I have not seen this for a long time. Probably about 18 years ago? <br /> <br /> The film tells us (children) everything about human blood and the circulatory system. Very professional - animation in the style of Disney, as well as human actors - director Frank Capra, for Pete's sake! <br /> <br /> Something like a bend. I wonder if the very high cost of production is worth what is the value of information about the human body for film? But those children who are watching this learn: even now I remember well how Hemo himself challenged Dr. Baxter to name what ordinary material most resembles human blood, to which the Doctor responds immediately with “sea water”.
