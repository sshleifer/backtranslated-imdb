I think this creator (s) of the concept of this film deserves much more praise than they ever received. Of course, this is not an Oscar film, but at least for me this film has left an indelible impression since I first saw it in 1984 (in the theater). <br /> <br /> I do not think that this (and I hope that this is not so) is a spoiler, but: imagine that you are acting on your impulses. Doing the first thought that appears in your head, pronouncing the first words on your lips ... There is no restraint, conscious, nothing prevents you from saying or doing what, like smart adults, we know that we shouldn’t really say or do it. In any case, this film only scratches the surface - it does not go as far as it could. <br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems to be obsessed with remaking the old “classics” to try and make money today, would it be nice to see how they remake the old film with modest success for the sake of going to the next level? A little further, or even investigate what the original team did not, could not or could not deal 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is just my opinion. : ABOUT)
