We tend to forget that the context of the master / slave of past centuries led to the creation of more than well-kept estates, managed by large groups of enslaved people, and a lot of money for the white owners. This led to the fact that a group of people was in the center - the offspring that appeared as a result of the fact that slave owners interfered with their female slaves. <br /> <br /> Some of these children just became more slaves, others became free ... but free and colorful, which then meant anything, but not in relation to their parents. <br /> <br /> A class — gens de couleur libre or free people of color — formed around these offspring, and this class could, to a certain extent, own property, raise itself from the oppressed to the educated and acquire comparative dignity. In other words, they were not slaves, but they were still subject to some exploitation. <br /> <br /> Often women lived as mistresses for owners of white plantations and rich people created in their countries. own homes, with benefits paid for their children by schooling and a kind of nobility, depending on the respectability they decided to impose on their families. In fact, they were engaged in prostitution in order to ensure their own prosperity and relative independence from labor — an arrangement called plaçage. <br /> <br /> The Feast of All Saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one such woman, the result of such an arrangement with a local gentleman and people who affected their lives, both negatively and positively. The fairy tale opened my eyes, to a New Zealander, without a real idea of ​​the black and white lines, not to mention the gray area in the middle, where Gens de Cooler Libre walked carefully. <br /> <br /> The characters are very three-dimensional, and were well represented in this adaptation of the novel by Anne Rice. The pieces are well-cast, the costumes are gorgeous, and the brutal way of drawing lines, with blurred areas that are becoming more distinct because of the conflicts that the main characters pass through. Gens de couleur libre could not marry whites, slaves could not help themselves, and whites, even sympathizers, could not accept the economic reality of the correct behavior of the people on whom they depended. <br /> <br /> I unconditionally recommend this story, both a novel and a miniseries. If you cannot cope with the truth, you will shrink and shrink in some parts, because one injustice after another is distributed in color, both by their white oppressors and by their own people. Keep in mind, however, that this is nothing more than reality, and this story is an exciting way to learn about it. <br /> <br /> I know that this may sound pointless, but this mini-series at the same time entertained me and delighted me, despite the sour taste that I found in my mouth, and I really liked it. Watch it If you do not read the period, because from all this you can learn a lesson.
