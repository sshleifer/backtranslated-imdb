Scott is right. The best duel of two people ever filmed is in the middle of this movie. Sword fights with several fighters are not the best, although not bad. However, the fight in the middle is even better than the samurai Japanese films. In my opinion, the Chinese sword scene never surpassed the Japanese in entertainment value. Japanese films are especially good in scenes where one guy has to fight with a group of enemies, for example, the TV series "Lonely Wolf and Novice." Despite the fact that duels in Japanese cinema last no more than seconds or minutes, the apparent intensity of these moments made them better. But this is one example where the Chinese sword game is superior to the Japanese. The scene in the middle of this film was a five-minute bout with the most amazing choreography. Other fights in this film are also good, but even if they sucked this film, it would have been 7 for this one scene. If you have not seen this, you should. John Woo is a man.
