I just finished watching this film, maybe the 7th or 8th time, filmed it one night, which I had previously watched on Blockbuster, and I really liked it, I showed it to 4 people, and they also liked it. Independent of Hollywood glamor, special effects and an emphasis on “shock factor,” this independent film by Paul F. Ryan hits the head with a nail, dealing with the consequences of traumatic consequences. Occurring after the high school shooting, the two characters, Alicia (Philip Busy) and Dina (Erica Christensen) form an unlikely link. Alicia, a stonehearted girl, a goth who is pessimistic about life, helps Dean to overcome the problems of life and death and live after it. Meanwhile, Deanna is trying to help Alicia again see the softness and light in the world. Not an emphasis on the shocking shooting event, but on interpersonal relationships among those who survived, this highlights this film. Despite the low-budget and short time of filming, this film is far from stupid Ryan respects the situation, which he never experienced, and tries to penetrate into the human psyche. With a terrific and upcoming actress, Phillips adds the necessary drama to the dialogue and overall feeling for the film, and Christensen helps balance the feeling of “gloom and darkness” that this film can have. In general, I recommend this film, and if you like the theme of school aggression and violence and learn more about it, I also offer the documentary “This is the world of girls”, released by CBC in 2004, which is dedicated to the topic of social bullying, comparing and contrasting groups of girls — one in Montreal, Quebec, and the other in Victoria, British Columbia — a group of friends and acquaintances of a 14-year-old girl, Don Marie Wellesley, who committed suicide after a cruel mockery.
