I watched it every night on VH1 last week. This is a stunning candid portrait of the drug epidemic and how drugs were presented in the media in the late 60s and during the 70s. Timber, Easy Rider, The Beatles, Morrison's Death, Hendrix, Joplin are all here. Vh1 fashioned a complete, intricate image of life and times during the "Years of Drugs". From the San Francisco Bay documentary to Studio 54, this documentary shows the evolution and development of the drug business, as well as death and new life, which he breathed into American culture. From the documentary “From Marijuana to LSD and Cocaine,” this document shows how drugs got into the country, the hippie movement, conservative resistance, and how drugs affected art (music, films, etc.). It features many exciting interviews and videos. <br /> <br /> Drug Films: a trip, a simple trip in the Madness Blow Boogie Nights chimney
