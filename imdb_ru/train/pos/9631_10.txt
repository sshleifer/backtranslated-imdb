LAUREL & HARDY Short Comedy. The boys arrive to sweep the pipes in the house of Professor Noodles, a mad scientist who has just improved his serum for rejuvenation. Stan and Ollie continue their dirty work, spreading destruction inside the house and on the roof. Then the professor wants to try his new potion ... <br /> <br /> A very funny little movie. The end is a bit harsh, but most of the farce leading to it is amazing. Especially good is the competition of wills of Stan and Ollie at opposite ends of the chimney. This is Lucien Littlefield as a professor.
