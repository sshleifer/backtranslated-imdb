Budgetary restrictions, time limits, filming a script, and then its cutting, cutting, cutting ... This team is a group of good young directors; thoughtful in this scenario - yes, allegorically - smart in zero-dollar effects, when time and knowledge are all that you have, relying on actors and friends and kindly others for their time, dedication, space; and get the first feature in the bank, item 1-in-1000. These guys make movies. Good ones. Check out their collection of short "Heartland Horrors" and look at the development. And I can vouch, work with them - the most fun thing you do in business. I got stuck in harsh, insulting criticism of this film, wondering if one reviewer heard at least one word of dialogue, pondered over one thought or concept, or all that was required of this work was a visual noise of beating and cutting edge, to satisfy some. thoughtless idea of ​​what horror should mean to the audience. Let the "Empty Acre" bring yourself to you. Do not think in advance about what you expect, simply because it falls into the horror / thriller genre because of its uncanny background. This is a drama with a depth beyond how far you can stick a blade into someone with a reverence for a message that does not attack the visual center of your brain, but rather attracts keen imagination to experience the sufferings of the mind and spirit of others. Mark Ridgway, Curtis, "Empty Acre"
