This amazing Oscar winner (4 in total) and the first winner of the John Ford Award at the Oscars, simply fascinates with his incredible result, Max Steiner. Itâ€™s called a feature film because Ford had very little money to make this magnificent story of wine, retribution, greed and stupidity. But what makes this film so classic is the direction and striking photography and the use of fog and lighting, which were so different from the usual American film, and more in the tradition of German expressionism. And the victory of Oscar performed by Victor McLaglen as a drunken Gypo is incredible. Basically, the film takes place in Ireland, and Jeepo turns a friend into a rebel movement in the English to collect 20 pounds to give to his girlfriend. But having all this money, he begins to inflate them all night long to get drunk and distribute, while the leaders of the movement try to track down the informant. The whole film is one night in a dark and foggy Ireland, and a set of characters that are remembered, but all the time, the whole world of Gypo is approaching it, both psychologically. If I had to choose, perhaps, three directors, so that ALL of their films would be on an uninhabited island forever, and no one would stand aside, John Ford would certainly be one of them. What a really wonderful movie ...
