** Warning Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that Rob Roy is one of the best films of the 90s. It was an amazing achievement for all participants, especially for Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones painted a wonderful portrait of honor and dishonor that people can imagine. But alas ... <br /> <br /> it constantly and unfairly falls in comparison with Braveheart. These are two completely different films, probably similar only in that they are both about Scots in historical Scotland. However, this comparison often worries me, because it almost seems to assume that Braveheart is a better film than Rob Roy. I really like Braveheart, but the idea of ​​comparing it with Rob Roy insults me a little. Simply put, I love Braveheart, but it's a pale shadow on how much I love Rob Roy. Here are my specific reasons ... <br /> <br /> “Rob Roy” is about real people. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, William Wallace in "Braveheart" is not a real man, He is a legend, a martyr, a major figure of life. Because of this image, he is also the ideal person, never doing wrong, and basically shows his Scottish countrymen to the promised land. When he finally fails, it is not his fault. Like Jesus, he was betrayed by the very people he trusted the most. He is even subjected to the most terrible torture, because he wants freedom so much. <br /> <br /> Wallace's image is very well done and efficient. But it really does not inspire and intrigue me. I find human ambiguity far more convincing than human perfection. That's why “The Last Temptation of Christ” is a better film than “King of Kings”, and this is also one of the reasons why I think “Rob Roy” is better than “Braveheart”. Rob Roy may be heroic and brave, but he is far from perfect. He makes several mistakes that have affected the lives of many of his loved ones. Of course, not a false claim to the Duke of Argyll was an act of nobility and courage, but also an act of egoism and self-centeredness. Let us not forget that by the end of the film, because of this act, the relatives whom he defended were homeless. But Rob did everything he could, and that was all you could ask him. <br /> <br /> Rob’s wife, Mary, is also a normal, ambitious man. Let's start with how she looks in this film. Of course, she is beautiful, but she does not wear makeup, and she basically allows you to show your natural beauty. Compare this to the two loves (or one, depending on your point of view) of William Wallace in Braveheart. Now these two ladies are hot, but it is hardly revealing how women looked at that time (especially laymen). Maybe this is not a fair comparison, but just another example of how Rob Roy’s attempts at accuracy are much more efficient. <br /> <br /> Throughout Rob Roy, Mary has to live with her cruel rape with the meanest scavenger Cunningham. She feels obligated to tell Rob about his fight, but not because she knows that Rob must avenge her rape. Such a revenge would surely mean Rob’s death, and Mary is not ready for such a sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Villains at Rob Roy are equally convincing. Although the enemies in Braveheart are well written, they are hardly original. Robert Bruce, a courageous and cowardly man, suffers from moral decisions that everyone should know in the fictional realm. Should he accept his demand as king of Scotland, or should he betray Wallace to secure his last name? Bruce is the most ambitious character in Braveheart, but from Brutus in Julius Caesar to Fredo in Godfather II, these types of characters are hardly original. Longschenx, although a convincing villain in himself, is very one-dimensional. He is an epidemic of evil, and his images of tyrants are directly opposed to the heroism of Wallace. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy has three villains who are great in their scam. First of all, let's start with the Marquis of Montrose. He is a man who is so obsessed with his self-image that he is willing to let an innocent person suffer because of it. “Make sure that I do not scoff,” - his favorite words to his “factor”. This is a man obsessed with power, upset that a man of great nobility, the Duke of Argyll, may be considered more of a visionary than he. He is shamefully obsessed and unsure. He is an evil aristocrat, but makes him unique. <br /> <br /> Cunningham and Callarn are conspirators at Rob Roy, as well as Roy’s direct opponents. Callarn is so insidious in his cowardice that it is almost comical. He will do everything to support the goodwill of the Marquis, including a stab in the back and deception. Cunningham is an irresistible character, as he seems to have been raised to do his best to gain Marquis status and affection. He needs a father, you never know, that the Marquis is his real father. Therefore, when Callarne has the opportunity to get wealth, he grabs it, even without questioning. He is very similar to the evil of modern man, so egocentric and vain, that he does not care about the consequences of his actions for others. <br /> <br /> Many criticize Tim Roth’s performance in this film as replay. Bullshit i'm talking about. It is clear that Cunningham is not just angry, but also a psychopath throughout the film. In a world where a man and his stepson can shoot random people for fun, is Cunningham too incredible a character? We live in a society where people seem to have reduced the value of human life. Rob Roy simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this reduced value have changed. Throughout the history of mankind, there is a problem that the vanity of the human heart does not allow to show the ability to compassion. Rob Roy and Mary give us hope that good will prevail, but snakes will always exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Another character I find fascinating is Duke Argyll. He is a true nobleman, and his values ​​of honesty and politeness are directly opposite to the Marquis. He appreciates the courage of Rob Roy and Mary and is directly irritated by the Marquis and his factor. He gives the world hope for the people of power. We hope that people like Marquis are the exception, not the rule. <br /> <br /> - The final fight in “Rob Roy” is more exciting than 10 scenes of battles in “Braveheart”. <br /> <I get tired of people telling me that Braveheart is the best movie because of the battle scenes. First of all, the battle scenes are hardly original. From Spartak to Gladiator, Hollywood has a long tradition of historical European battle scenes. Braveheart has some of the best battle scenes ever filmed, but they suffer from one major problem. These battle scenes have no context, except for the struggle for freedom. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, duels are hardly original either. In fact, films with duels are probably 10 times more than with battle scenes. But the context of the duel between Cunningham and Rob Roy is a beauty worth contemplating. This is one of the greatest scenes in the history of cinema. Let me explain why ... <br /> <br /> First, the fighting style and character of the two characters in this duel perfectly describe the characters. Cunningham is energetic and dangerous, Rob Roy is strong and brave. Cunningham uses a fencing sword, and Rob uses a wide sword. Cunningham fights with quick, cunning movements, and Roy’s fighting style is more obvious. <br /> <br /> The entire film, from a deliberately slow first half to an exciting second half, leads to this moment. This is a powerful thing, and it is clear that Rob must destroy this terrible evil from which his whole world suffers. When Rob finally gets the upper hand (literally and figuratively), this is one of the greatest moments in film history. Rob wins because he has something to live for, and his honor is more powerful than that of 10 Cunningham. Using music is absolutely scary in this scene. For me, goodness prevails over real evil, than to see how the dude is entangled so that he can shout “FREEDOM!”. But hey, maybe it's just me. <br /> <br /> - “Rob Roy” is more realistic than “Braveheart” <br /> <br /> I don’t know that people in the aristocracy or the Scots said the same people in “Rob Roy”, but I feel that this is clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns. It seems to me that many people are bored because of Rob Roy simply because they cannot understand what the characters say. If so, then read some shakesphere or put on capital letters. Rob Roy is in fact one of the greatest written films of the 1990s. Many of the dialogues in this movie are smart, but you may have to watch a movie a couple of times to understand it. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, the dialogue in “Braveheart” is hardly very interesting. Of course, what do you expect when the main character is a Scot, played by an Australian? This is a legend, and clearly there were no attempts to capture the speech of time. This film takes place a few centuries before Rob Roy, and yet they speak like people today. The reason that many like it more. Today, viewers are becoming increasingly lazy, and they do not want to spend time or patience to understand complex things. Therefore, as in many epic films, they expect to see the villains speak with a recognizable English accent, while the characters speak the national language, not too far from our American language. Of course, it is clear that Wallace is Scottish, but apart from the fact that it sounds like Scotty from Star Trek and a few yes for recognition, the Scots in this film fit into the Hollywood tradition of how we feel that the Scots should sound. br /> <br /> So, these descriptions prove that “Rob Roy” is a better film than “Braveheart”? Barely But if this proves one thing, it shows that it is hardly common knowledge that Braveheart is a better film than Rob Roy. Simply put, “Rob Roy” is a film whose themes are very relevant in the modern world. “Braveheart” is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic. You can decide what you think is better ... <br /> <br /> Assessment - Assessment - 9
