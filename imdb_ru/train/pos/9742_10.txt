This outstanding independent Argentine film is one of the best in 2000 in all of South America, including Argentina, which has been producing an amazing amount of quality films since 1999. Only in 2000, Argentina released many high-quality films that broke the Argentinean B.O. records. Half a dozen received international recognition, like this one, at important world film festivals. After watching this film, you can see how Russian Argentinean films last year managed to return 20% of their national film market. <br /> <br /> Directed by one of Argentinaâ€™s best directors, Daniel Boorman, this film explores the effects of globalization around the world, but emphasizes its impact on Argentina, and especially on the Jewish community of Buenos Aires. Daniel Hendler is wonderful as a good Jewish boy trying to survive and even succeed in today's business climate. Hector Alterio, one of the outstanding actors of Hispanic cinema all over the world, is perfect in the role of Simon, the Jewish father, like the rest of the actors, in which Spanish and Italian stars participate. <br /> <br /> There are so many relevant topics in the Urban Western societies studied, I do not have enough space to go into details. Daniel Boorman cleverly weaves them into a plot with different characters, personifying different dilemmas. If this film is playing at a festival near you or on video, do not miss it!
