The origin of caring bears and their cousins. If you saw the original film, you will notice a discrepancy. Cousins ​​are brought up with bears, and do not meet them later. However, I have no problem with this, I prefer to treat films as separate interpretations. Babies are adorable, and it’s interesting to watch them play and grow. My favorite is the Fast Heart Rabbit. The villain is a delightfully formidable werewolf. I could empathize with three children, since I was never good at sports. Cree Summer is superb as Christie. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, you love toys or enjoyed the original, this is not to be missed. 9/10
