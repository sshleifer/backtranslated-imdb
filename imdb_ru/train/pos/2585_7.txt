Here is a rare gem for those of you who have not seen or, most likely, have not even heard of it. In the 80s, Dennis Quaid was a popular product, but in the early 90s, Dennis Quaid disappeared from the scene. In 1993, he returned to the big screen with three films, which, unfortunately, were bombed. I really liked two of these films, and let me elaborate on one of them. <br /> <br /> Wilder Napalm is a crazy film about two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard), who are ... igniters of fire: yes, they have the power of pyrokinetics. <br /> <br /> Wilder decided to no longer use his power (in any case, for something useless) after the fatal incident that occurred in his youth, when he and his brother blew up an abandoned house that killed a man which was inside the unknown to them. Currently, Wilder is a firefighter and is married to Wacky Vid (Debra Winger), who is under house arrest, guess what, arson (see Movie, to understand this better). Wilder also didn’t talk to Wallace for 5 years because Wallace set his hair on fire during a bachelor party. <br /> <br /> Wallace loves his pyro power and uses it for fun. He also leads the carnival and is the main clown. When the carnival comes to the city of Wilder, Wallace decides to reunite with his brother, and also to see Vid, in which Wallace is in love! House arrest Vida sees the end, but Wilder is concerned. So, Wallace enters and the fun begins. Brother against brother ... fighting fire! <br /> <br /> Some great fireball throwing this film ... eat your heart, Drew Barrymore! <br /> <br /> There are also some really weird, but funny elements in the film, such as Wilder’s fire department singing songs of a capella during skirmishes and after wards. Jim Varney (world renowned as “Ernest”) appears as Wallace's carnival buddy. "Wilder Napalm" brilliantly shot ... and deftly complex ... very far from the wall and avant-garde. <br /> <br /> Look at this ...
