Our song is a wonderful example of passionate filmmaking in all its glory. Actually, this is a real movie miracle; insightful and insightful work of art, which tells about the lives of three young girls from the inner city (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) during a certain summer in their lives, when perplexity of their approaching adulthood will cause each of them to make a number of difficult, life events changing choices, which is likely to change who each of them is, as well as how they will continue to communicate with each other in the coming years. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay's letter / direction is elegant and confusing. In this film there is no juicy, no sentimental sentimentality, no cliché. What we see here sometimes seems incredibly real. In Our Song there is naturalism, so to speak, which surpasses the naturalism of other giants of this genre, including American graffiti and Coolie High. <br /> <br /> The great merit of the film’s spirit is its main characters. The combined presence of Melissa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha) and Anna Simpson (Joiselin) is incredibly powerful. It would be easy - and, of course, obviously stupid - to reject, as some, apparently, have, the actions of these three as apathetic or unemotional. In fact, their quiet charisma, their instinctive sense of dignity and their rude, sometimes unconventional intelligence, throughout the film, are absolutely breathtaking. One must be completely “not in the know” or completely indifferent to the behavior of teenagers, in order not to notice the amazing authenticity of what these three young ladies display on the screen. Similarly, the cast, in particular Marlene Forte as Lanisha's mother, complements the work of the three girls, as well as the general tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Our song is a movie that no one will miss. any age.
