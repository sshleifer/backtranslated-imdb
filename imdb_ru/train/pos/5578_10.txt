The cheerful and insightful perspective of the world of dating is depicted in this unusual comedy by writer / director Peter M. Cohen for the first time. The story unfolds when the four male protagonists meet weekly at a local diner to talk about their problems when they meet. We meet Brad: a cute Wall Street playboy, with quick-wittedness and a sharp tongue; Zeke: a cynical, sensitive writer; Jonathan: a sexually bewildered nice guy with a penchant for hand creams and masturbation; and Eric: a married guy who values ​​his weekly meetings with his lone friends in the hope of some understanding of his boring and banal family existence. The trials and tribulations of the lonely lives of men in New York are amusingly expressed, reflecting what is happening in the movie "Sex in the City" and the new HBO comedy "The Mind of a Married Man", and an insightful look at fraud. The story unfolds when three singles meet Mia - wittily played by Amanda Pete - and everyone falls in love with her. She seduces them with each of her strange ability to correspond to the personalities that they show. When they realize that everyone met and fell in love with the same woman, they chose her because of their friendship. Whipped is a realistic image of the dating world that the critic could not recognize. Simply put, they missed the point. The main character here is a caricature of real people. Exaggerations are hysterical, they mix satire and humility, and they should not be taken as seriously as the humiliation of the critic suggests. Watch this movie, you will laugh from beginning to end.
