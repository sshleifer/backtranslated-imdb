It was a bit difficult for me to follow this to the extent that it seemed to fall in the middle, while I tried to figure out who was fighting with whom and why. One of the problems is cultural / linguistic. Here we have a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem that we know little about, and because we just read English subtitles, we inevitably lose some of the subtleties. Another problem is that it seems to be too much only half explained turns and coincidences. However, it seems unlikely that the Miiki movie is completely bad, and this is certainly not the case. A lot of stylish and cruel tiny cruelties, a window on a bit less orthodox sexual relations and family aspect. In general, a decent trip, but perhaps checking the storyline may be useful before viewing this.
