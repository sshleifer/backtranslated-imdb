It takes courage to make a film about Gandhi in India, in which he is not shown as a man who cannot do anything wrong. This film shows how Mahatma could not be a decent father (at least in the eyes of his son). <br /> <br /> The performances are stunning, fantastic cinematography, a fantastic direction, but the film is addictive. If we were going to make this film without any box office expectations, which I believe is taking place here, then this is a brilliant attempt, but if the creators expected it to be a commercial success, then the fate of the film is doomed that day topic. <br /> <br /> After 20 years, this film will be remembered for the brilliant image of Harilal Akshay Khanna. He deserves an Oscar nomination for it ... And, to be honest, his is not the only performance worthy of applause, Shefali Chaya is also amazing ... <br /> <br /> Watch the scene where Harilal hears about his father's death. No conversations, no screams, but Hannahâ€™s silent shot. This is one of the best scenes ever filmed in the history of cinema <br /> <br /> Gandhi, my father is not at all an exciting movie, but yes, it's a great movie and a must-see. Brilliant attempt ..
