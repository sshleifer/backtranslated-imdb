Of the elements that make it the best at the moment, I must say that No. 1 is Christina McIntyre. Shemp's poisoning scene and reaction is really great.

His look was a great combination of terrible and comedic nonsense. It is unlikely that the character I would choose to meet in a dark alley or, in any case, anywhere. I would prefer a bit of a real secret of a harlot in this, but hey, when a short position is good, who will complain. Not me
