I really liked this movie is dark, it is not dodging a bullet, chasing the car numb your brain thriller. Many of the backgrounds and motifs of the characters are rather vague, leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions. It is pleasant to watch a film in which the director allows the viewer to make his own decision. <br /> <br /> In the end, motivated by love or revenge or desire to repent - he does what he feels “right.” “Will God ever forgive us for what we have done?” is not that question which mortal people can answer - so he does what he thinks he should do, what he is good at, what he has been taught. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington is a great actor - I, frankly , I can not remember a single bad film that he made - and he has a great cast, I would recommend this film to everyone.
