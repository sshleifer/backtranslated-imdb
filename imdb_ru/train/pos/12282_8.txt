At first I didn't like it very much, although I liked it. They did not include the third generation of Trueba, the love between Blanca and Pedro is not well explained, and some actors were too different from what I imagined. <br /> <br /> I later realized that the film was more loyal to the book, it would be like five hours, and it would be tiring. Now I like it a lot, because my favorite characters are present where I depict them. Clara really looks like an angel in person, and her introduction to the story at the beginning of the film was fantastic, loyal and short. Glenn Close is Ferula. I imagined her just like that, but not in all mourning. Esteban find enough. I never liked his character, and although he was interested in me, I hated him a lot, especially when he hit Clara. As in the book, the latest part is the most exciting, and there is also a real story in it. <br /> <br /> The film is really good, especially considering that it was a gringo film based on a Latin American film. book. It's amazing how many famous stars are there, don't you think so?
