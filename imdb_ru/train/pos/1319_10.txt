This movie is very fun. I recommend that you watch it yourself and then watch it again with your friends. I did last night, and it was amazing how well Norma Khouri could draw everyone into her world! I was a little strange to watch my friends go through the same roller coaster as the first time. But they all thanked me and loved the movie. You know that this is a great movie if you spend 2 hours after the movie talking about the movie! <br /> <br /> Once I saw a crook almost to the level of Norma Khouri, but not near a ring of the same size. He brings up very gullible and rich people in my old Berkeley, California. a group where everyone trusts everyone else. He "sponsored" only people who seemed to do it very well. Who knew that he would have stolen more than 100 thousand (in 1987, when it was real money), having spent only 1 month in the city. His sacrifices were very fragile, as they were in the first month or week of sobriety. He was angry with a lot of laughter and a smile on his face. <br /> <br /> This crime is nothing compared to what Norma Khouri did to her old neighbor. But I do not want to give anything. <br /> <br /> I just found this one night on the late Showtime channel, I think. It is always the greatest experience of movie fans to completely deceive themselves, to see something and go crazy. Just drag your friends to see it, and don't tell them anything. This is a very interesting film, it moves quickly and never gets bored. <br /> <br /> This should be an international classic for all times. I believe that all the great movies end up at the top. The time will be very good for this movie. I'm just sorry that no one has heard of this, in a sense, which makes surprises even better. <br /> <br /> The director and editor were fantastic. They deserve to win in the best documentary. <br /> <br /> JUST SEE THIS MOVIE!
