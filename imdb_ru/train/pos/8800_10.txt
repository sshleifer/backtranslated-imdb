First of all, I do not understand why some people consider this film to be so anti-American. Of course, there are times when the US is directly accused, for example, in the segments of Yusef Chein, Ken Loach and, to a certain extent, Mira Nair. But come on, these are not naive accusations; instead, they are based on real and documented facts, and all the documents that the CIA has published about Chile, for example, confirm this. <br /> <br /> But, returning to the film itself, I liked the most about it in it. The variety of moods we find in it. We find children trained with respect to all the people who died in this event; we find the unfortunate couple to be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find ordinary people whose feelings are lowered in the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently with dignity or disappointment; in the film, we even find someone who falls from the towers for a moment of real happiness. <br /> <br /> All of these and other visions - as powerful as these or even more - create a consistent mix and help the viewer see how different people spread throughout the world, reacted to the events of September 11. Thus, we see a panorama that is much more complex than white and black, and this can infuriate some people; but this is the world in which we live, and there is no place in it for Manichaean ideologies, no matter what presidents or priests can tell us. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think it is a shame that there is not even a release date for this film in the United States of America. It's a shame, because most Americans ask why this catastrophe happened, and this film can give them some clues. This film is very clear - differently than some people think in this forum - that everything we do today will determine our future, and that the mistakes of the past will affect how we live today.
