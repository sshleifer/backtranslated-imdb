Bug's Life is a very good animation feature. This film is for young children, but it is also a great movie for people of my age. The story of an ant named Flick. He brought chaos to his colony when he destroyed food destined for excellent grasshoppers. He is cast out, and he must find big mistakes to correct the mess. This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and a Pixar movie. The animation is great, especially in the late 90s. The story is good, but a little more detail will be enough. The voice acting is good, as in most animated films. It's nice to listen to music. Nothing special, but he received a nomination for one of the musical categories. In general, this film struck me. This is a good film for all families. I rate this movie 10/10.
