My wife is a teacher, and she knows the story very well by reading it in several classes. Although it never seemed so interesting to me, and I bought a DVD, believing that it would be a film that I really wouldnâ€™t like. <br /> <br /> In the first half of the film a lot of mood, and I found myself thinking that I was right. It starts a little slow, and I have to admit that I was a little bored - but curious enough to stay with him. Boy, I'm glad I did, because it turned out to be a very pleasant and rewarding movie. I would surely watch it again! <br /> <br /> Casting went very well. Since I did not read the book, I cannot vouch for accuracy, but I must say that John Voight was really amazing. You liked the characters that you liked, you hated those who were supposed to be hated, and laughed at those who were supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> I understand that some people may not like this movie. Sometimes it is tiring, especially at the beginning. All memories can be distracting (although they are important for the story). As soon as the story begins to come together at the end, I think you paid in spikes for your patience. When all is said and done, I think this is a very good movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
