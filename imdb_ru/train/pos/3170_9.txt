Writer / director / film colleague Adam Jones moves to great things. That's what I thought when I saw his feature film "Cross Eyed". Because of the independent film, I rarely feel as good as his. Skillfully written and expertly directed “Cross with Eyes” keeps you involved from beginning to end. Adam Jones may not be a known name yet, but he will. If there were one or two “Named Actors” in this film, it would be a box office sensation. I think that the main audience still has a chance to see it, if only one film distributor finds time to work on this film. No matter where it ends, if you get a chance to see it, you will not be disappointed.
