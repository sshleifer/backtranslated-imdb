This is one of the best films about Jodie Foster, and is largely ignored because of the misconception of the public about him as a teen movie. He has great performances, especially the fight scene between Jody and her mother, played by the persuasive Sally Kellerman. The three girls who play Jody's friends are a little amateur, but I think it's worth seeing.
