Excellent political thriller, played much quieter and slower than other, higher rated films of this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack, how do they manage to miss these amazing career appearances? The history of friendship, the relationship of father and son, corruption and deception. The two actors fit together perfectly, and the support from Aiello and Fonda is equally impressive, although Aiello is great, especially when newspapers run to the press. Instead of focusing on too complex a corruption scandal, he creates remarkable characters that show the human side of failure in the form of political bribery. The final scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and played.
