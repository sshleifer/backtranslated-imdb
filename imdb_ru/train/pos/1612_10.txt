This film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies. It is almost flawless! Writing, acting, design, humor and pathos - that's great! Even the music — from Dean Martin to Bohemia — is charming and delightful! <br /> <br /> Each character is extraordinary delightful and memorable, from the leading roles of Cher and Nicolas Cage to a variety of supporting roles - - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello - even grandpa with his dog! Each of these performers, as well as Norman Jewison as a director, perform in their ensemble work above their usual qualities. For some of the actors, this was an early major performance in the film, so the casting is also exceptional - and we have many actors whose careers have been changed because of their effectiveness in this film. <br /> <br /> I have seen this film several times all over - which sometimes can significantly reduce the impact of the film. Moreover, a few years ago I realized that whenever I go through the channel, I get on the scene from this film - any scene - the scene was attractive and beautifully processed. In the original meeting of the heroes of Cher and Nicolas Cage there are so many amazing and memorable scenes where Cage tells his story about the mountain; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his lover in the opera, amid the splendor generated by his plumbing business of the gold mine; Olimpia Dukakis scolds John Mahoney for flirting with his student in a classic line about connections with colleagues: “Damn, where you eat!”; Danny Aiello at her dying mother's bedside; Nicolas Cage "accepts" Cher, as the delight of aria hovers in the background! <br /> <br /> There are, of course, many wonderful romantic comedies, among them Sabrina (both versions, but especially Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden); When Harry met Sally; Apartment. <br /> <br /> Nothing compares to Moonstruck!
