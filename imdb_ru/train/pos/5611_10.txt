I saw this film at a time when I was timidly playing with the idea of ​​moving to my apartment and starting my own life. Maybe that's why I took it so seriously. I fully believed in the psychological degradation of a poor character in Paris due to timeless construction sites, dust, poverty, selfishness, rudeness, anger and corruption. I pay tribute to the artistry of Polanski in his direction, his game and his inevitable scenario, but I fainted during the terrible final scene and had to be restored by brandy in the office of the theater manager. Fortunately for me, my life in itself was not as catastrophic as this (so far), but I always respect the artist who can fulfill such illusions and so completely immerse into the (fake) reality that he is trying to convey . Simply put, man is a genius of the first order and the merit of humanity. This film is the sum of many, many examples of excellent acting and excellent casting. Since some performances were made in English (scenes with Shelley Winters and Melvin Douglas among others) and others in French (with most other characters), and Polanski did his own dubbing in English and French, I wholeheartedly recommend it if You turned out to be bilingual, to switch the sound from French to English and vice versa, during the relevant scenes while watching Paramount's excellent DVD transfer. This film is part of the so-called "trilogy of residential buildings" Polanski, which also includes "Repulsion" and "Baby Rosemary." Unfortunately, “Repulsion” still hasn't produced a decent DVD transfer in Region 1. Needless to say, three films would make a great box set.
