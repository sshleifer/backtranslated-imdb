The Pentagon’s scientific team seems to have perfected the serum, which causes invisibility, but when the master experiences it on himself, he cannot reverse the process. Frustrated and drunk with strength, he turns psychos into the classic tradition of HG Wells. <br /> <br /> This is an amazingly scary story about the Invisible Man, delivered with pleasure forever with the taste of Verhoeven and Bacon as a genius who has become a genius loonytoon-maniac. As in many works by Verhoeven, it has a terrific unbridled sense of the adventure of the Boy Comics (a secret underground laboratory where scientists work is simply wonderful) in combination with the most terrible and depraved visual effects (women in underwear grope and are attacked). invisible villain, animals beaten to death, literally gallons of blood and mass murder on the last two drums). While the story does not affect any new twists and turns of the old idea, the special effects of Scott E. Anderson’s computer graphics are strikingly vibrant, as we see that veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissues, bones and flesh literally appear from nowhere . In particular, the sequence in which the team returns the gorilla from an invisible state, and the scene where Bacon drowns Devan in the pool, is simply breathtaking in details and the artistic invention of the effects. The film also has an excellent Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack and Jost Wakano's classic horror picture. The young cast is largely overshadowed by the film’s technical pedigree, but Shu and Dickens have impressively emerged from their depths. This is a very funny and unpleasant movie.
