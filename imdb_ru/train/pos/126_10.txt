Zentropa is the most original film I have seen in recent years. If you like unique thrillers influenced by the film noir, then this is exactly the cure for all those Hollywood summer blockbusters that are littering theaters today. Von Trier's follow-up actions, such as Breaking the Waves, have gained more recognition, but this is indeed his best work. It is luxurious, non-distracting and offers the perfect combination of vagueness and dark humor. It is a pity that he decided that portable cameras were the wave of the future. It is hard to say who dissuaded him from the style he demonstrates here, but itâ€™s a loss for everyone that he went in the direction of his theoretical dogma.
