This film is the first of six notorious guinea pig films and is one of the best. At the same time, it looks realistic and unreal, just knowing that the film is a fake. The story of a woman who was caught and tortured in various ways. The person at the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address, and it includes a manga video showing torture. People who capture it check the limits of a person before they die. Some scenes are shocking, for example, a scene with an eyeball, while others are not shocking, as if the girl was beaten 100 times, because you see blows in almost every film. There is a lot of blood in this film, so I would recommend it to people over 17 years old. <br /> <br /> 9/10
