In general, I am not a big fan of movies and at first ARM did not attract my attention. However, knowing that this film was made in repressive Czechoslovakia during the Soviet era, the more I watched the film, the more I realized how disruptive this innocent film was. This subtext really revived the film and gives it real power as a work of art and political statement. <br /> <br /> A sad little movie made without any dialogue, but it's pretty clear what is happening. A cute little wooden man makes an earthen pot and has a great time when an intervening lively hand suddenly appears that destroys the pot - instead turning it into a hand sculpture. Well, the wooden man tries again and again to ward off his hand and do his own thing. However, over time, the hand becomes more and more persistent and ultimately keeps the person in the cage. And, in the end, the man is dead, thanks to the intervening hand, and this hand, as a sign of real hypocrisy, gives the person the funeral of the hero! <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is an obvious attempt by the brave Jiri Trnki to criticize his powerful government. It is not surprising that, although the Czechs loved the film and criticized it, the state (that is, the hand) banned this little parable. Unfortunately, Trnka did not live to see the moment when his nation was liberated just over two decades later during the so-called “Velvet Revolution”.
