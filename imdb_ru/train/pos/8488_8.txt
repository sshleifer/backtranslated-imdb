I just have to throw my two cents. Relax, it's a comedy. Yes, for the most part, characters are widely written and acted upon. I can not think of many comedies where they are not. This is not a new release, it goes on video and goes on the air almost every week. Will I see it in the theater? Of course, I did when he first came out. Funny ... that should be enough. <br /> <br /> Even if I didnâ€™t like it at all, I would still watch it on cable for Michael Keaton. He is an underestimated and underestimated actor. I can't think of a friend who is so capable in every genre. Also, I can't think about who is so successful. Comedian, who is also an action movie star (short-lived, but still), who is also a romantic lead and also dramatic actor; villain and hero. I can't think of anything, at least not in Hollywood. Of course, no one was successful in all these genres. I mean Tom Cruise, but for me he is better to be Tom Cruise than to become a character. However, this is not about Michael Keaton vs. Tom Cruise, so I will continue. <br /> <br /> Gong Ho is worth renting, damn, it's worth buying, since you can find it for $ 10.00 or less in stores like Wal-Mart. It is worth looking at the cable (if you have a cable or satellite). This is one of those fun movies. You can pause your brain, just relax and laugh. <br /> <br /> To ask for more, in my honest opinion, is too much.
