OK, here's how I do it. I rate movies on 10 components. Each component will start with 5 points. Then he can lose or get 5 points for possible 10 or 0. <br /> <br /> Mood: thriller, romance, comedy, drama, suspense - I give this component 10 points. It had a perfect balance of all five aspects. The action was fun and exciting. The novel was not exaggerated, but still very emotional and exciting. I laughed for a long and long time throughout the film, and yet I was fascinated by the fantastic drama and exciting anticipation. <br /> <br /> The plot - I give this component 10 points. I thought all the good fairytales have already been told. I found myself sitting in the theater, returned to my childhood, and at that moment I again believed in unicorns, evil witches and shooting stars that make dreams come true. <br /> <br /> Filming - I give this component 8 points. Despite the fact that the film reflected the plot well in most angles, I repeatedly tried to find out what happened, just behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> FX - I give this component 10 points. I like that they used C.G.I. poorly Epic scenes were believable. The magical powers were frighteningly realistic. In general, less is more, and that was all! Cast - I give this component 10 points. Without names and experienced actors, the cast was awesome! Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderfully angry, Charlie Cox made Tristan come to life, Claire Danes gave emotions to the stars, and I will never again look like Robert De Niro. <br /> <br /> Acting - I give this component 10 points. Even novice actors brought their rolls to perfection. Once again, I will NEVER see Robert De Niro again and again. <br /> <br /> Character development - I give this component 9 points. I felt a bit hasty, and I think that if the film were a little longer, they could have made the characters a little better. <br /> <br /> Dialogue - I give this component 10 points. Was the dialogue intelligent, witty, cheerful ?? even porridge had a good dialogue. <br /> <br /> Score - I give this component 7 points. I can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire film. I'm not complaining about the fact that music can be more memorable. <br /> <br /> Ending - I give this component 9 points. Almost perfect ending! I feel that some aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced, while others might have been more muted, but not a single thread was untied. <br /> <br /> Total: 93% Buy a DVD? HEL YES! See it in the theater? Most likely! The bottom line: a great movie for everyone! EPIC! I highly recommend watching this in the theater, I know I will be back for a few seconds!
