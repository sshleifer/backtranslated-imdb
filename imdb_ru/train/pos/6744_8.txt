A hot cop accidentally kills a murder suspect and then conceals a crime, but he has to deal with a guilty conscience while he tries to solve a murder case. Andrews and Tierney reunite with director Preminger in the film Noir, which is just as effective as Laura, which they talked about earlier. Andrews played well as a serious cop, a good guy who was in adverse circumstances. Acting is fine, including Malden as a tough police captain and Tully as Tirneyâ€™s defensive father. The script of Hecht, the great and prolific screenwriter, is intense and intense, and Preminger creates an excellent atmosphere.
