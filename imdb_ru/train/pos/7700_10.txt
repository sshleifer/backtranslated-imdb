Not only are the effects extraordinary, against shit, like “land against flying saucers” - a real “killer” - this is “the universality of the plot” - everything depends on two principles - the ancient concept of a father’s incestuous-minded desire what happens if the world technology reaches a point when all the wishes of a citizen become apparent. <br /> <br /> There is no need to say that everyone we wanted to die would die, not so many, if any, remained - and this became the fate of the population of the "forbidden" planet - quite modern, in fact. Unfortunately, the “Krell” equipment — wasted because of ignorance, remains, and Morpheus, the incestuous father, knows how to get access to such technologies — and does so in order not to lose his daughter because of another. ancient plot, beautifully designed. <br /> <br /> and given his age, he remains a stunning classic storyline, action, human emotion - and visually very modern - don’t miss this - - it foreshadows all modern science fiction - and its psychological content raises it beyond any genre - eternal work - <br /> <br /> and soundtrack! you will not see / hear a pure “synthesizer” and a perfectly designed von Muga - “don't miss” ---
