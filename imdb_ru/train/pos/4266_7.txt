We first saw it half a life back on a black and white TV in the small village of Samoa and thought it was fun. Now, seeing this a second time, much later, I do not find it funny. I don't find anything funny anymore. But this is a witty and carefree comedy that moves quickly without stumbling, and I really liked it. <br /> <br /> It's 1945, and Fred McMurray is the 4th, who dies in order to get into one of the armed forces. He rubs a lamp in a landfill, which he controls, and a gin appears to fulfill a few desires. (Ho-ha-ha, right? But although the introduction is nothing more than a good thing, the fantasies are quite vivid.) McMurray says the genie wants to be in the army. Poof, and he goes along with Washington's soldiers to a particularly warm and welcoming USO, where June Haver and Joan Leslie wear a lot of lace napkins or whatever, and lavender wigs. Washington sends McMurray to spy on the enemy - Redskins, German-speaking Hessians, not the British. Hessenians are trapped in the Bierstube and sing a very funny drinking song praising the virtues of Vaterland, "where the white wine is more grape / and the Rhine water of the Rhine / and sausage is softer / and the yellow hair is more yellow / and the Frauleins are juicier / and the goose steps are goose." Something like that. The characteristics are fabulous, as good as the best sig rumann. Otto Preminger is a suspicious and sinister Hessian general. "You know, Heidelberg, you have 241 against 1, but you are not afraid." <br /> <br /> I can't continue these fantasies for too long, but they are all quite funny, like the lyrics. When he wants him in the navy, McMurray turns out to be with Columbus, and fantasy is presented as a great opera. “Don't you know that sailing in the west meant / terribly expensive investments? / And who, in your opinion, provides the means / except for Isabella, the queen of queens? When they see the New World, someone notices that it looks great. "I don't care what it looks like," Columbus mumbles, "but this place will be called Columbusland." <br /> <br /> In any case, everything is finally fixed, although the genie by this time is pretty drunk, and McMurray finds himself in the Marine Corps with the right girl. <br /> <br /> I made it sound too cute, maybe, but it's cute. Children will enjoy smoke, magic and a banal love story. Adults will enjoy the more complex elements of the story (who are the Hessians?), Unless they become college graduates, in which case they may want to stay with legerdemain and say, “Wow! Amazing! ”
