This is a very entertaining film, considering the budget and its duration. The storyline is hardly ever affected in the movie world, so it also brought a sense of novelty. The acting was great (P'z to Dom), and the cinematography was also very well done. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in thrillers, he will not disappoint you!
