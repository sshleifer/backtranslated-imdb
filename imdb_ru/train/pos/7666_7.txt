Two sorcerers fight in the fourth dimension, one (Brian Thompson as Kabal) tries to destroy the Earth, the other (Jeffrey Combs as Anton Mordrid) tries to save it. Cheese. The plot is pretty stupid, and the blood is completely absent, but the film is very short and interesting. So if you have enough time to kill, look at that. My rating: 7 out of 10.
