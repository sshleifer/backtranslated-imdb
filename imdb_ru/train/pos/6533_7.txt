I have to say that it was not very interesting, but to talk about fashion and strange ways to solve the mystery. Too easy, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb ... it's fantastic! I really liked this part of the movie ... <br /> <br /> Corky (Josh Flitter) was very funny ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) seemed really hopeless ... he had to be more angry with her for how she treated him ... <br /> <br /> Well, this film is a hidden tour and fashion. Anyway, I recommend this movie, just for summer fun. Encore Nancy, just for fun. More Emma Roberts teenage spy movies .. Spymate ... remember? She becomes good at this clever detective work.
