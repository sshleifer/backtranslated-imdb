This stupid movie is really fun for a young audience. His characters are a pair of stupid detectives whose sophisticated views lead them along very silly roads. In pursuit of a major murder, you will see how these detectives go to great lengths to solve a crime. No nudes, but a lot of sexual connotations, gross nonsense ... all that teenagers are on. Low budget, but very interesting. Certain cult classic potential.
