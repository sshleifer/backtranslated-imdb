This will be a different view. I watched this movie twice on TV and would like to get a copy of it, because it tells about Panama City and the winter beach, which is my favorite time there. It was the first film that I saw Ashley Judd, and she was great, and I liked everything I saw in her. The Sundance reaction made an impression on me, too, like the director Victor Nunes, the Director, and wrote several films about Florida. This film speaks to me, and I have not seen anything with which to compare it. The plot tells me less than the environment. Well, I said it would be a different review.
