The film is very pleasant, with a great cast and a great director James Eves. The film is fascinating with a very charismatic performance from Stephanie Beecham, and all played well. James Eve is well versed in castes and leads, as a conductor, knowing exactly when to start an action, fall, and then rise to a climax. He does it with an element of humor, a lot of turns, thrills and blood. This is the return of an old film about vampires, filled with blood, blood and screams. The film works with great speed, and the characters send you on an amazing adventure, but what makes it work is that the film does not take itself too seriously with a lot of tongue in its cheeks. Fine!
