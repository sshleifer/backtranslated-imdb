I watched this movie with some curiosity. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni could play in Chinese and 2) Louise Rainer deserved her Oscar. I got out of the movie, thinking YES! Seeing Muni in just one movie, where he was pretty Hammy, I was expecting the same performance here. I was glad I was wrong. Although some may criticize him for being too childish and stereotypically simple in the Hollywood idea of ​​Asians, I thought that he was just in that role. Kay Luke, if he had been given a chance to play a major role, perhaps he would have played about the same. <br /> <br /> I was especially impressed with the camera work and the use of crowd scenes, especially during the looting of the palace, where O-Lan was a slave. The graphic and gloomy atmosphere of the firing squad and the drought made this epic completely different from others at the same time when everything was brilliant and brilliant. I watched this movie from start to finish in delight. I can’t say the same thing for the epics today.
