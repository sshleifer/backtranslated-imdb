This is not the only Scorsese film that I would put on my favorite film list. But this is the best I've run through my DVD player in five years. Scorsese's patient explanation of the filmâ€™s favorite moments and how Hollywood works are incredibly kind, calm and intelligent. <br /> <br /> This is material from 3 sides of a DVD. It should have been British production, since everything in American corporate culture would have been crushed by the quiet, methodical, no-nonsense approach that focuses on the content that is used here. And American production would require him to say that he only likes movies that were popular favorites. I would like everyone to take a page out of his love for the movie. You have to love films that you make for personal, individual and special reasons. Not only I, too, vote for The Godfather, etc. People have no idea what ideas are explored in their favorite films. If they did, the films would be more interesting than they were. Scorsese REALLY knows what ideas are being studied, and this makes him a compelling, interested speaker on this topic. I really appreciate his eloquent, generous interviews over the past decade. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Scorsese is better when he is excited to show you some kind of incomprehensible film, and not when he doesactically teach you something well-established. about the history of cinema. And I would very much like him to tear out these three hairs from the nose. It is very distracting.
