Oh my God. This film really really shows the talents of the actors. Billy Connelly flexes his acting muscles. A really amazing person, if you look at him in the Absolute as a rebel, a Bundo of Saints as a madman / killer, and then finally, at Fido as a zombie! His character in Fido looks from cute to scary, absolutely incredible! Cary Ann Moss is also not a hacker! Jumping in the career from the Matrix and Momento as a more somber character, to the hearty conservative housewife of the 1950s! It is rare nowadays to see that actors cannot be so abandoned. <br /> <br /> Now let's get to the storyline (no spoilers, don't worry). This film could please Max Brooks (author of the “Guidelines for Survival in Zombies and World War Z”)! Finally, a well-made turn of zombies and comedies. <br /> <br /> If you like zombies, if you don’t like zombies, if you are just bored or you are too busy, watch this movie!
