As a child I thought this film was great. He had animals, he had beautiful music, and I had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. I still love this movie for various reasons. These are well-trained animals that pass through various stunts and scenes that look great on camera. It has a beautiful, well-written musical that fits perfectly into scenes, with fiery, fast-paced melodies and a heartbreaking main theme that still makes me cry. Even when people hum it. And he has my favorite actor, Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> On the basis of the book it is told about three pets, about an intelligent, overly gullible and significantly paternal laboratory called Shadow, a witty and vain, but still intelligent cat with the fear of water called Sassi and a street nerd, ridiculously a curious and slightly neurotic bulldog Chance. All three go to a friend's farm when their family leaves. Alarmed and alarmed, pets break out and plan a trip through the Sierra Mountains for the trip of their lives. A truly incredible journey. So maybe the house is right above that mountain. But what if it is not? <br /> <br /> I offer Homeward Bound for people who like three amazing actors, providing voices for the main characters of animals, and for everyone who ... yes, everyone goes to watch it.
