A few years ago, a friend received a video from Michael Mann's “Heat” from one of his friends. After we finished this film and were about to get up, we saw that right after that there was another film, hard on the envelope of the tape, which the owner did not record. And yet we were all glued to our seats with the help of their distinct opening, in which there were no credits. <br /> <br /> Two hours later, I just sat and wondered: how could I not have heard of this masterpiece before? . <br /> <br /> This film was Europe. Lars von Trier woke a film noir from the dead, a wrecked reality with deliberately obvious scenes, but often I saw similarities with the post-war German photos I saw. And then tricky cuts! <br /> <br /> The story itself is a complex moral odyssey that has no happy ending. A young American pacifist of German descent arrives in post-war Germany, intending to do something good to pay for the bombs dropped by his compatriots. But he mostly meets mistrust and self-destruction. He hires Zentropa, a company producing canteens and sleeping cars (modeled on Mitropa), which is owned by one of the Nazi employees Occupiers Whitewash. Our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of a werewolf, Nazi post-war terrorists. When he no longer understands the world (or only Europeans), he is in a rage blowing up a railway bridge under the train he has just saved. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, for historical correctness: in the real world, a werewolf was nowhere as important as the film suggests, basically it was the last propaganda coup of the Nazis. After the SS unit killed the Major occupied by the Allied forces of Aachen, two months before the surrender, the Nazis announced the creation of entire legions of saboteurs and terrorists who would be ready to fight for the lines, a werewolf. But only a few hundred mostly Hitler youths received some training, and although two or three times some of them were sent to kill suspected communists or foreigners in Bavarian villages, to capture the constant fear of the inhabitants, with the death of Hitler and the end of the war, all it fell apart. <br /> <br /> However, werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the invaders. Everywhere they were afraid of the werewolf, they suspected him of any serious accident - but without exception, another reason was found later (ignored by some recent pseudo-historians). For example, when a gas pipeline exploded at the police headquarters of a blown-up Bremen, or when a Soviet military commander died in a motorcycle accident in Berlin. The effect was strongest for the Soviets, who “pre-emptively” arrested tens of thousands (mostly children!) On suspicion of werewolf and closed them in camps, where many of them died.
