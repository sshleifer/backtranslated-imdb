I watched this show on the basis of what was said to me that it resembles David Lynch's Twin Peaks - a show that I adore. The show quickly begins to acquaint us with the main characters, and it is rather unusual that the pilot episode for me is the best of all, it is extremely dramatic and really reveals the entire evil side of the show, ready to develop during the rest of the season. My biggest criticism was that I felt a little disappointed in the show - perhaps not through my own fault, as it was canceled after just 1 season, it seemed that the show showed great potential, and it deserved a much better attitude than it turned out . The acting is great, and this show has some of the best characters (good and evil) I've ever seen that have developed well in a short time. For the first 5 or ten shows there is a strange effect, which is a bit too dramatic, but this is corrected during the season. Worth seeing, definitely something unusual!
