I have seen hundreds of silent films. Some of them will always be classics (for example, Nosferatu, Metropolis, General and Wings), but among them my favorite is the film (it may not be the best - but loved, yes). In fact, when I looked at IMDb, I noticed that I immediately laughed to myself, because the film was damn cute and well made. In this film, Marion Davis proved that she really had a talent, and she was not just William Randolph Hearst's mistress. <br /> <br /> The story tells how the Georgian woman arrived in Hollywood, expecting her to become a real star! Her experience and interesting cameos of the stars of the era make this a real pleasure for movie lovers and must-see!
