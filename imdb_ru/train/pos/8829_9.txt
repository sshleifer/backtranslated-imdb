More directors such as Nacho Vigalondo need more bang for their talents. 7:35 De la Manyana is an absolute genius. The fact that Nacho can pass in 8 minutes, some Hollywood directors take hours of cinema. I watched this smile, but I felt a little dirty and not sexy. You sit and wonder what you should feel after watching these 8 minutes. nugget. I was entertained, but at the same time disturbed. Not many people can do it in just 8 minutes. It all starts quite simple. A young woman comes to breakfast in her usual place. She sits down and someone starts singing. From there the film takes you through so many different emotions at the same time that it is difficult to describe. It is black and white, but it helps to create the feeling that the film gives you. This film makes you want to learn more about the characters, how they interacted earlier and how the final influenced their lives afterwards. I think it's like an old saying: “Leave them, wanting more,” Nacho Vigalondo can do it. Watch it when you can. Show it to your friends and wonder how 8 minutes can be so fun without taking off your clothes.
