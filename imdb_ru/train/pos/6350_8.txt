I waited and waited for the release of this film, the trailers seemed to be included for years, it was worth it. I'm not a big fan of watching movies again and again, but I can not wait until it comes out for everyone to buy! Not a big fan of Jim, but that was fine with him, there was so much to see, and the “well-being factor” was off scale, perfect for Christmas. I think Ron did an amazing job turning it into a movie. If you haven’t seen it yet, do it, if you have it, look at it again, I know what you want!
