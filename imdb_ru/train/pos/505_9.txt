Very good start. I was a little surprised to find that the technique was not so advanced: it had to be more coarse to match what we saw in the original series. The cast is interesting, although Lady Vulkan seems too human. She needs to learn from Spock, who is, after all, the model for this race. Wish they could have chosen jeri ryan. I like Miss Park, the Korean (?) Lady. The doctor has opportunities. Did not understand with other men, except for the black guy. He is really cute. Bakula has to find his niche - in QL his strong point was his sense of humor and his desire to try something. He, of course, is big enough and strong for heroics. Heavy were fine, although I did not like their makeup.
