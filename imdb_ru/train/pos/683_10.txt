I like ghost stories. Good stories about ghosts night beats, voices that can not be explained. Now I see many of them. Since efx specials are becoming increasingly popular in modern films, sometimes you have to turn back time to find a real gem when screenwriters and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories. Now this very rare pilot episode for the Ghost Story series called “The New Home” was one of the scariest films I've ever seen. It was once in 1972, ... I was only 9, but nothing since then even compared to that. After the entire remake takes place in Hollywood, someone has to do it “as is” with no more special effect than the original. This episode was damn scary. I was lucky to find it finally on DVD today, and it is very rare and difficult to find. The only 2 Ghost stories that could be picked up were the ORIGINAL "Ghost" and George S. Scott in "Changling." I wish someone would make more similar ghost stories.
