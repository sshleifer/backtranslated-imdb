George Lopez was never interested in my comedy, and he still does not. But this show is a work of art. It never shows where the jokes make you laugh every time you remember it (and the jokes that are remembered at the same time). This show has an optimistic look, and the characters range from an old, shortly drunk teenager to dyslexia. I don't know who wrote this show, but this person does an excellent job. If they only continued the show, I am sure that it would receive a positive response from the critics of this great country. If you are looking for a good traditional comedy, then George Lopez is the show for you! One bad thing is the name. George Lopez? Indeed? Imagine Fresh Prince Bel-Air - "Will Smith." Come on man! But otherwise this show is brilliant! 10/10
