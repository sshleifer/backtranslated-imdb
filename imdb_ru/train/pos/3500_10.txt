This film works because it seems so authentic. The story is simple and realistic, it perfectly reflects the joys and anxieties of youthful love and sexuality that most / all of us experienced in our teenage years. <br /> <br /> Actors are as natural as the figures in a documentary film, but just as convincing and as charismatic as experienced performers. The dialogue is fresh and honest ... and, fortunately, is not filled to the brim with pretty pop culture references. In addition, the cinema is both sandy and beautiful, so life on the Lower East Side comes to life very significantly. <br /> <br /> On an artistic level, I love this film because it reminds me of great Italian neo-realistic films like The Bicycle Thief and La Strada. Movies are rarely as “real” as they happen ... or like Bicycle Thief. And the only other film that I saw that relates to teenage sexuality with the same degree of seriousness is “The Splendor of Eliya Kazan in the Grass”. Writer / director Peter Sollett deserves great praise. This film is a real achievement. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I’m always happy to see a film that treats ethnic America with love and respect. As an Italian-American, I hate how my own people act in films (racist, feminine, criminal geniuses in annoyingly popular epics), and my aggravation on this score makes me acutely sensitive to other bands and their terrible silver screen. representation. Latinos and Asians in particular seem damned for playing villains in westerns and action films. (It's good that Gong Li didn't try to become famous in America!) <br /> <br /> Of course, thanks in large part to the appearance of indie paintings and the influence of Miramax, we see a few more pictures about ethnic characters here and there ... but bringing up Victor Vargas is easily one of the best. While I really like my big fat Greek wedding, this is a refreshing change in that in Raising Victor Vargas playing straightforwardly (with less exaggerated and widely drawn characters), but still very funny in and of itself. Finally! Latin American characters worthy of attention. I have a feeling that this film will be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course, now that he has made this wonderful picture of a family from the Dominican Republic, I hope that Peter Sollett will come to his senses to make a film about Italians soon! :) - Marc DiPaolo
