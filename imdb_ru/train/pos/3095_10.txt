So what is the reason? Is there any vendetta against this AWESOME show or is someone involved in this? Why was the best show I've seen in recent years been canceled? I am addicted. I happened to see this show last fall, and immediately loved it, and watched it every week. Then he left, and I tried Tivo, but it was not broadcast. So I forgot about it for a while, until I found the episodes on the ABC website. Now I want more. I agree with everyone else - with the rest of the junk on TV today it was nice to see something as versatile and developed as this. I watch Boston Legal for my eccentric comedy novel, and House for my intellectual and mystic prankster. My wife loves Grey's Anatomy for her “realism,” and I love / hate the show, but it could not be further from the real for me. Too much drama. Everything that can go wrong does. But this time there is a drama that is really real. Real people, real problems. Of course, there are some extremes, such as the former gangster became good, the girl runs from the crowd, etc., But these people (especially in New York) do exist, and I treat each of them. I can't get enough. I just hope that ABC pulls his head out of his bean counts and continues this show. Get some respect for the QUALITY drama there. This may be one of the best shows of all time. If someone just allows it.
