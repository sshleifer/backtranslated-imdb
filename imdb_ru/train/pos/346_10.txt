What a cool movie! It was very scary, great acting, well-written, good plot turns, interesting characters, very good leadership and an unexpected ending that will leave you with a smile on your face. This is a popcorn horror film that lovers of not horror may not like, but still (nevertheless) one of the best thrillers today! I highly recommend it to fans ONLY: <br /> <br /> 1) horror genre <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> 2) there is an actor or actress in it. <br /> *** of **** stars! <br /> <br /> PS- I'm tired of people who compare this and other modern horror films with SCREAM. I know that they do not want to be like a scream. Everything is like, “Oh, they copied SCREAM!”. Well, if I'm not mistaken, SCREAM also copied other movies! In fact, almost EVERY horror movie, copied earlier. SCREAM, however, was a good movie. But still ... stop comparing and enjoy what is! <br /> <br /> Go and rent out! <br /> <br />
