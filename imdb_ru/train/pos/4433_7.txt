Story: Photographer Bob, who makes a photo session for the magazine, meets the mysterious Kathleen on Texel Island. Her free spirit and lust for life intrigues Bob, who had recently experienced a very traumatic experience. However, her life is not as simple as it seems. Through Kathleen, Bob gets entangled in a dangerous network. Can Kathleen gain his trust? <br /> <br /> Review: The dialogue in this film is very natural, and the story unfolds beautifully, although it remains a bit on the surface, and it would be nice if the “psychology” character were developed a little more. Why do these people do what they do? What motivates their choice? This is what gives the film depth and what to think, in my opinion. The story never reaches an emotional climax, although the characters go through enough to justify it. Thus, you will not recognize characters on this deeper level. The actors do a good job and play in a very natural and “believable” way, but I think it would be better if the film would be suitable if Kathleen was played by a younger actress, since the naivete of this character is not quite suitable for an adult. up woman. Camera work is good, and there are great pictures of nature on the island. I give the film 7/10.
