This film may not show the Catholic Church in the best light, but it tells a story based on real events. Unfortunately, not everything in life, including religion, everything is beautiful and rosy. Sometimes people and groups do things that seem right at the time, but in retrospect they don’t look as good as they used to. “Shared love” tells a family story, yes, it includes religion, but in fact the story is about the family and the ability of this family to stay together, no matter what is thrown at them. This film is also based on real events, which does not mean that this story, scene by scene, is true, but if you watched the news articles of that period of time, you would see that none of the churches coped with the incident in a way. which was useful for the family. Both churches are to blame, primarily the Catholic Church for imposing such a position on the family and not responding to the violence that accompanied it, and the Protestant church for telling the mother that she should just obey her husband and his priest and not put up In this case, both let down this family. I believe that the film shows well this struggle both in the church and in the family. This is by no means a form or a form of suppression of the Catholic Church, on the contrary, it shows how one case can change the course of ideas of this religion and how one person can have a much more significant effect than himself.
