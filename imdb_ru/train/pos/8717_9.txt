I have to admit that I am not a big fan of "family" films these days. Most of them, IMHO, are sentimental. But this one, like TOY STORY, the previous Pixar film, is very funny. The two main characters were perhaps a bit too soft (especially compared to the two leading ones in ANTZ, but otherwise this movie is better), but the rest of the movie is more than completed. The animation looked great, the humor, although wide, was always good (I especially liked the Hopper line “If I had not promised Mother on her deathbed that I would not kill you, I would have killed you!”), And the actors are all voices, except for the two main ones, they were amazing (Denis Leary was shooting an animated film; what a concept). And, like everyone else, I loved it! I hope the video has new ones.
