I was adopted at birth, and, of course, I had no problems that Fisher encountered in the film, but I still share some emotions, and this film really helped to identify them and make me cope with them. It even made me realize that I did have a “missing piece,” and I am now going to find my own parents. <br /> <br /> I cried almost a day after seeing it for the first time. Antwone’s confrontation with his native mother, compared to the reaction of his father’s family to his sudden appearance, is strong for those of us who do not know what will happen if we find our native parents. And his self-confidence and self-assertion of his mother and against the rapists of his past were so strong. I really could identify with this and with my need to tell people: “Yes, my parents suspended me when I was born. But a different set of parents picked me up and loved me. And now I have succeeded! ”<Br /> <br /> This also helped my wife understand me and our adopted children, who had a tragic experience before they came to our house. And this helped me to understand how spoiled our social system is. If you remember reading last year's story about a foster child in Florida who was "lost" And then the story of Miranda and Ashley in Oregon City, where the SCF ignored numerous complaints of sexual violence against the person who eventually killed them And in the week this film was released another story in New Jersey about three children who were ignored by the system. One died. The state seemed to think that the house they were in was in order, because the guardian was hired (as a stripper) and “only occasionally” used heroin! <br /> <br /> There are so many problems in this film - and the script and acting skills cope with them so well that Antwone Fisher will surely be nominated for “Best Picture”. It does not matter whether you are adopted or not, but it is a heart that cannot be ignored by anyone who cares about the children in our society.
