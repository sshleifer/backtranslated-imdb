I remember seeing it a few years ago when it first came out, and I was amazed at the performance of Parker Posey. And the film was pretty good too. For those who have spent too much time in nightclubs / after hours, this film will have a special charm for you. Not too seriously, mostly funny, and Parker Posey definitely glorifies his talent in this indie gem. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the character Diaz (reminded me of every DJ Iâ€™ve ever encountered). And many other films could take a hint from this film about how to preach the virtue of responsibility, without missing or missing this. <br /> <br /> Babaganush!
