A very well-made and frightening horror film from the PRC film company living below the poverty line that usually produces really crappy films like DEVIL BAT or THE FLYING SERPENT. German director of emigration Wisbar works wonders with a small budget and its swamp set in the studio. The dude and nasty Charles Middleton is effective as a strangler.
