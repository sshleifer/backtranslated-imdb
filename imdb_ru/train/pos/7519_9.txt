PRESIDENT BETTY (2006) *** 1/2 Gretchen Maul, Lilly Taylor, Chris Bower, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn, Austin Pendleton, Norman Reedus, Dallas Roberts. <br /> <br /> Mol in the role of a beautiful biographical film - the legendary queen Betty Page, who became famous as Mol. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is probably best known for mocking the “Next Girl” back several years when no one knew who she was, despite the notorious Vanity Fair cover story among other dubbed media , but, despite several roles played in the same place, her glory predicted, it seemed, still flickered not so brightly. Here, like the famous queen of movie stars Betty Page, Gretchen Mole is really a shining star on the rise. <br /> <br /> Betty Page was born in Tennessee as a god-fearing and family-oriented real girl who seemed to find the unwarranted object of lust and affection when she got older. The forgotten gangster rape is not wisely depicted graphically, and is not a subtle indication that her own father has a less than decent design for her family, which is important for understanding how Paige managed to avoid a possible nightmarish life for a career as an Actress set off to New York in the 1950s, when in fact it was the time and place to catch the light in the bottle. What Paige did not realize was that in fact she would be exactly like that when she arrived. <br /> <br /> A beautiful red-haired sweetheart with a divine figure, Paige once saw a black policeman on Coney Island asking to take her picture, which leads to her posing in the basement of his house and eventually to the Irving Clow studio (Bauer) and his sister Paula (Taylor), who satisfy their vulgar, but are considered pornographic footage from a unique clientele :. fetish types <br /> <br /> Although the Page is rather naive she is undoubtedly intelligent and knows that her body is not a sin and can see the forest behind the trees in the sense that she is under control - or at least staying in what she offered to work in quality, in that it is not indecent, and she with pleasure in her more and less clothed portraits - until the Congressional witch hunt is looking for several scapegoats to make pornographic images a crime . <br /> <br /> Talented director Mary Harron and her scriptwriter Guinevere Turner (“American Psycho” and “I Shoot Andy Warhol”) rather accurately optimize biographical cadres and perhaps too quickly try to figure out who The business was Betty Page, although they do justice in depicting an era of tension at its zenith. Many thanks to the talented cinematographer Mott Hopfel for his languidly gorgeous black and white images, as well as scattered color segments that resemble Douglas Sirk films of that era for melodramatic kindling. Partly the feminist pact and partly the American dream perfectly complemented the plot stories along with the wonderful performances of his ensemble, including the comedian Bauer and Taylor as brothers and sisters in a dirty smut, and Harris had a field day as a buddy-photographer with a taste of wine and chatter . It's funny to see that Strathairn acts in a stunt as a senator in the campaign for righteousness after the news bulldog Edward R. Marrow spoke in his last speech, "Good night and good luck". <Br /> <br /> But hats off to the truly wonderful talents of the Mole as unrestrained, but deeply moral and, most importantly, smart Betty Page, who misses her childish innocent flash through bold nudity and is now considered tamed and bizarre. Border postures, which for decades attracted the attention of men and are still the basis of human sexuality in this country and, possibly, in the world as a whole. The pier is beautiful and strangely resembles the subject of her portrait to her knowing teasing smile. The real Betty Page was reportedly not involved in the project, but apparently gave her a blessing and continues to live a somewhat secluded life that is referred to in the last minutes to find Jesus and chase away her “notorious” image once and for all. Shame since this film in a strange way embraces the resounding decency permeated by his subject, radiating everyone's eyes in his naked magnificence.
