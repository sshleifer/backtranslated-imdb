A year after the loss of the magnificent Jane Parker (Maureen O'Sullivan) because of his love for rival Tarzan, hunter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) returns to the jungle to once again hit the hearts of a brunette. Mixing business with pleasure, he also plans to take an ivory from the cemetery of elephants, which is located behind the ledge of Mutya, the stomping ground of Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Accompanied by his slimy, dissolute friend Martin Arlington and a group of consumables. The carriers, Harry finally arrives at their destination (barely escaping death at the hands of wild natives and monkeys throwing stones), only to find that Jane is still passionate about her muscular yodler, and, even worse, Tarzan refuses to let the hunters take any ivory from the cemetery. <br /> <br /> Nastya Arlington solves the problem by setting up an ambush and shooting a monkey, and then informs Jane and Holt that the crocodile attacked Tarzan and ate it. Of course, Tarzan is not dead, only wounded; after Cheetah regained his health (!), he returned to action just in time to save Jane from a tribe of evil savages feeding on lions who attacked the Holt expedition. <br /> <br /> Tarzan and his assistant, the second film featuring Weismüller as a man of several words in the jungle, is often mentioned by fans as the best of the series; although I prefer the original a little bit, I can definitely understand the popularity of the film: it's damn sexy and there are some great action movies! The undisputed chemistry between Weismüller and O'Sullivan is incredible and leads to some pretty pair scenes, and with both stars wearing unique outfits everywhere, there are spectators of both sexes abundant in eye candy (despite the widely advertised O'Sullivan) Underwater nude scene actually performed with a double body, the beautiful girl still shows a lot of skin, even threatening to make the “Sharon's Stone” at one point, as her loincloth reaches for one side!). <br /> <br /> The most exciting moments of the film take place in the form of a wonderful underwater battle between Tarzan and the crocodile and an exciting finale where Jane attacks the lions and natives, but she is saved by her cavalier, his monkey buddies and many elephants. in the full mode of the crushing lion (again, sometimes the violence is surprisingly disgusting, although, as I understand it, there is nothing more shocking than the evil pygmies and their gorilla pit from the first film). The cheetah also has his share of excitement, dodging rhinos, crocodiles and big cats, riding on the back of Tarzan when he crosses the river, and even jumps on an ostrich for a trip. <br /> <br /> Like its predecessor, Tarzan and his buddy really suffer a little from some bad effects and inconclusive supports: a quirky projection of the back, several ridiculous monkey costumes, more Indian elephants, disguised as their African cousins, and poorly disguised trapeze swing - but this should not spoil your enjoyment of this very interesting movie. In any case, they make it even more fun! <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded to 9 for IMDb.
