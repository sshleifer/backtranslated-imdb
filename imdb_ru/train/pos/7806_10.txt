“The cry of freedom” is not just a film. This is a historical story, a heroic story and an understanding of the cultural background of an important event in history. Denzel Washington not only does an amazing job of imitating a motivated, determined hero, Steve Biko, but also conveys to the public a message about the horrors of South African apartheid. The story of Biko, an influential leader and his main "influential person" Donald Woods, is heartbreaking. But the ultimate success of his life could go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. "Cry Freedom" manages to convey to the audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing storyline. It is through such wonderful films that the public can learn about terrible historical events, great leaders who were trying to end them, and about how we will never allow them to happen in the future. Because of this importance, "Cry Freedom" is an amazing film that should see everything.
