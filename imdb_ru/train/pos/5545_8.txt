**** Includes spoilers **** <br /> <br /> I have been a fan of horror films for many decades. Just when I think I have seen all the wonderful, another appears to surprise me. I have never seen this movie before. It was a pleasure, including along the beaten track ... not only on the way to the swamp ferry. Here is a horror film, filmed in the 1940s, that dared to try something VERY different. A beautiful girl (sip) is fearless for change and saves men, including the man she loves, from the monster! How is it to turn. This girl was the exact opposite of most women in the films of that time, not shouting at her own shadow, not losing consciousness from fear, not stumbling over a leaf when she runs. This girl was not afraid to live alone in a secluded hut far from the rest of the village. Not only that, but the place was in a misty swamp, rumored to be persecuted. Hell, she even napped on the grass in the street ... like the regular version of Ripley of the 1940s. No snake, alligator or ghostly strangler dares to disturb this girl. Books on early feminist films must include this missed work. <br /> <br /> Look at this if you, like me, are a fan of those amazingly atmospheric classic black-and-white horror films that they made only in the 30s, 40s. And don't forget to wear a cast-iron tortoise for protection.
