"Winchester 73 years" was the first of a series of westerns with the participation of James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. Like most of them, the hero Stuart has a strong advantage that threatens to explode at any time. <br /> <br /> The name refers to a one-per-thousand rifle that can participate in rifle shooting competitions held in Dodge City on July 4, 1876. Lin McAdam (Stewart) and his partner High Payde (Millard Mitchell) come to town, following in the wake of the Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) for the last sneaky act. They arrive just in time to see Marshal Wyatt Earp (Will Djir), the manager of the saloon girl Lola (Shelley Winters) from the city. It turns out the Dutch Henry is also in town for rifle shooting. Lin and Dutch Henry shoot him for the coveted prize with a victory for Lin, but the Dutchman Henry robs Lin from a gun and runs away. <br /> <br /> Lyn and High Spade follow Dutch Henry across the country, where they run into Lola with her cowardly cavalier Steve Miller (Charles Drake) delayed in the American cavalry camp in anticipation of an Indian attack led by Young Bull ( Rock Hudson), who acquired a valuable rifle by killing the cunning shooter John McIntyre. He got the weapon by tricking the Dutchman Henry in poker. The young Bull was killed during the attack, and the weapon was transferred to Steve. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, at the ranch, Lola and Steve meet with the notorious fighter Waco Johnny Dean (Dan Durya), who kills Steve and takes a valued rifle and lola for himself. When Dean meets with the Dutchman Henry, he allows him to pick up "his weapon", planning to kill him later. In the city of Tuscosa, Lin kills Dean, as Dutch Henry’s plans to hold the bank are crumbling, and he escapes into the hills with Lin in pursuit. In one of the best final shootout both met in the final match. <br /> <br /> I believe that this film was the only one from the joint work of Stewart and Mann, shot in B & W. It was beautifully photographed, especially the scenes in the “wide open spaces” and, in particular, the final showdown. Stewart, playing against the font, plays a hero with a strong revenge motif, emotions that he will carry in future films with Mann. <br /> <br /> As in most universal westerns, this one boasts experienced veterans and contract players of the day. In addition to those mentioned above, J.S. Flippen plays the role of cavalry sergeant, Steve Brody, James Millikan, John Doucette and Chuck Robertson as various minions, Ray Thiel as a sheriff pursuing Durye, Tony Curtis and James Best as new recruits and Edmund Cobb, Shl Yovlachi and Jon Johl and Jon Joh Bach and John Best as new recruits and Edmund Cobb, and Jon James Best, and Jm. on different roles in the episode of Dodge City. <br /> <br /> A classic western in every sense of the word. He was responsible for recreating Stewart's career as an action movie.
