I read the outline and suddenly I saw Elisha Cuthbert ... I thought that everything okay .... and watched the movie ... I didnâ€™t realize that Elisha made films before ... "The girl next door and 24" Elisha shows a satisfactory view, the plot is a little wacky, but the film works .. It's amazing how this young the girl became the hottest babe in Hollywood!
