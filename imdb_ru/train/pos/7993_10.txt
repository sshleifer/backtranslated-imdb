There are many reasons to watch this film: to see the reality that beats Latin America regarding kidnapping, police corruption at the continental level, among the many realities that we live in with the Latins. <br /> <br /> Denzel Wachington’s performance was brilliant, this guy continues to be a great actor, and so it goes. Dakota Fanning just for 10 years has become an excellent actress and I congratulate her. The rest of the film was amazing, I have in my collection. <br /> <br /> I hope they accidentally went to Hollywood to make a full film in Venezuela, where they better show our reality regarding crime, drug trafficking or political problems. They had few films in which they play in Venezuelan land (for example: Arakofobiya, Jungle 2, Jungle, Dragonfly), which they have to do more than in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The song “Una Mirada” I hope it comes out on the soundtrack, that's great. My voice is 10/10
