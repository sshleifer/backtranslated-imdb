I saw this movie on TV and was fascinated by the beauty of Jennifer McComb. It was a neat film, and you can watch it for the beauty of Africa and, of course, McComb. At that time, I was delighted with watching this film, and since then I have been trying to find the VCD of this film, but I cannot find it. Huge African lions appear in his film, and we will be fascinated simply by the size of these animals and the grace of them. This film can watch the entire range of viewers, especially children. But some scenes involving McComb require parental guidance for this film. This is a nice holiday movie for everyone.
