I have not read Kurt Vonnegutâ€™s book to which it was adapted, but I am familiar with some of his other works and it was interesting to see how it will be translated to the screen. In general, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. This concerns the history of an American living in Germany, who was recruited as a spy in the United States. His job is to enchant themselves as high-ranking Nazis and send secret messages to Americans through his weekly radio show. But when the war ends, he is convicted as a war criminal, but he escapes to New York, where various strange plot twists are waiting for him. <br /> <br /> If Mother's Night has a problem, then it is too sentimental once. But for the most part of the film, Schmalz is kept to a minimum, and a very strange plot is permeated with skill and aplomb. And there are some incredible moments of black comedy involving three right-wing Christian fundamentalists and a very highly regarded Nazi in a prison cell. Highly recommended.
