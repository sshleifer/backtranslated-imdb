About two hundred members of Cleveland, Ohio, USA, called Cinematheque, gathered on August 19, 2000, to watch the unspoken film of Michelangelo Antonion's 1970 film "Zabriski Point." Cinematheque director John Ewing, who does an excellent job of getting the best prints for his series, shared with the audience in advance that this imprint was specially delivered from Italy to show just that. <br /> <br /> The audience was fascinating, as the film unfolded its skills on a huge panoramic screen. Observing this excellent print, shown in the way Antonioni intended, made you realize that this is truly a work of modern art. Moreover, it was appropriate that the series is located at the Cleveland Institute of Art in the University Circle. <br /> <br /> Antonioni’s compositions are created for the Cinemascope landscape. His beautiful balancing of images, the striking use of colors, wide choreographic movements - all this is the work of a real artist using the screen as a canvas. <br /> <br /> At last, viewers were able to understand Zabriski Point. As the story unfolds, it became obvious that this work was not about the plot as such, but rather about the impressionist transfer of the artist's passing images of his subject. The setting of some of the more hectic actions of the sixties provides only a dramatic engine for the artist's wide collage. <br /> <br /> Antonioni is not bound by traditional narrative standards and can pause at any moment in order to creatively embroider an event with grandiose decorations. The audience eagerly walked with the flow of his remarkable imagination, as his huge images on a massive canvas attracted close attention. While the audience may have only been indirectly involved in character relationships, she realized that the topic here is human outrage, a recurring topic of the director. <br /> <br /> It was also realized that no single imprint of lesser or lesser quality than this original in Cinemascope can justify this particular rendering. Therefore, the audience was more grateful for watching “Zabriski Point” in its original, breathtaking format and at the end burst into applause.
