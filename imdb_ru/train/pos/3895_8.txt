A few little things, because I can't figure out how to submit the quiz Painting to Jetta (best seen in chapter 18), this topic is the subject of a musical Sunday Sunday evening in Sonheim Park with George. <br /> <br /> A few trifles, I can’t figure out how to Send the Little Things: one of the images in the background of this performance is George Surat’s painting “Sunday afternoon on La Grande-Jattes” . The theme of Sonheim's musical Sunday in the park with George.
