My comment is limited to the first season, 1959-60. <br /> <br /> This magnificent series was one of the first to be broadcast in color, and it was very influential in convincing Americans that they needed to buy a color TV, which cost about $ 800 in 1959, which is equivalent to more 3000 dollars today. How many of us will pay so much for the privilege of watching a show transmitted by a cathode ray tube on a 17-inch screen? I was eleven years old when the series began, and I watched it from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> Watching it now, 50 years later, a few things come to mind. First, many storylines tell about Comstock-Lod and the heyday of silver mining, which dates back to 1859. In 1859, weapons and clothing, for the most part, are not authentic. (Haircuts are excluded from the discussion.) In essence, this is nothing. <br /> <br /> Ben would not be able to arrive in the Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and recruit 100 people. ranch in the next twenty years. The pioneers were still trying to solve the problem of Sierra Nevada in 1847, and the Gold Rush began even two years later. <br /> <br /> Native American actors do not play Indians. John Ford used Native American actors in the 1920s. The producers of Bonanza could easily do this thirty years later. For me, this is a big niggle. <br /> <br /> There are other temporary problems. Mark Twain appears in the first season, and is portrayed as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was 24 years old in 1859. Stories also fluctuate between 1859-1860 (before the civil war) and what was more appropriate for the 1880 period. There are problems with continuity, again and again. <br /> <br /> It is also somewhat unpleasant that in the first season there are so many murders. Over time, the number of murders decreased. <br /> <br /> Many episodes have a socio-liberal bias, which is difficult to believe, given the time frame, but the authors believe that they foresee seismic shifts in relation to the nation, which began in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, the game is good, and in recent years I came to the conclusion that Adam's character was painted better than any other. I don't think Pernell Roberts ever got the credit he deserved. In addition, the first season confirms the fact that Dan Blocker (Hoss) was a good actor. <br /> <br /> In many stories, real historical events can be traced. The invited stars were interesting. <br /> <br /> It was a great family entertainment, and the show copes very well with any task.
