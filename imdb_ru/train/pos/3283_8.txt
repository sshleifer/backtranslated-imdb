As a lover of surrealism (in art and film), I was glad to discover this film on the IFC. This is definitely a keeper. Most of the other reviews tell the general story (not everything is correct), so I will not miss anyone with this. The main thing is the concept of alternative worlds, caused by the impending Anna's illness, and how she manages to get involved with someone else after she is so “lonely” and, finally, with her family, which, I think, is all still a little worried. The horror film can only be called the fact that there are frightening scenes in it, but this is fantastic (with a slight hint of “coming of age” only because Ana is a teenager who “hates boys”). I wholeheartedly recommend it to those who value their imagination.
