John Waters shot the most frightening, heartfelt, gloomy, personal little movie I've ever seen (well, maybe Fast Food Fast Women is coming soon) are a personal and strange reflection of the family and its own inner life ... the tone never was forced or stylistically excessive. <br /> <br /> There are no pretentious design shots, fuss or magazine evaluations .... Martha Plimpton is amazing like a sister. Eddie Furlong is inspired by the casting. A grandmother with Mary talking, packs of tea, recycled clothes, yesterday's rubbish becomes today's art - and the filmâ€™s lesson is that the most important thing we can appreciate is family ... and a modest life.
