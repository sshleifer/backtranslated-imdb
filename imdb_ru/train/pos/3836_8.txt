Extremely interesting and intriguing film. Similarities with David Lynch (who are even quoted literally by the presence of red curtains in the film) and Franz Kafka’s novels (the housekeeper in this film is called Mrs. Grubach, as in Der Prozess ...) are clearly present, but in this case are accompanied by clear references Belgium's colonial past in Africa. The exact content of the film I can not clearly describe: this colonialism is an important part, as well as the inability to cope with such a past, but the personal memories of the main character are also a central problem, and his desire for social contact and love. These are symbolic themes that I brought out of the film, but in reality they are nothing more than impressions. <br /> <br /> But even if you just try to follow a linear story without these symbolic backgrounds, you will still find an extremely exciting film filled with gorgeous images (beautiful close ups of the Beatles, larvae and other unpleasant insects alternate with gorgeous dream episodes , as well as the dark atmosphere gives the film an additional style). Perhaps you can say that I didn’t quite “understand” the film, but I looked as if hypnotized for 1.5 hours, deeply impressed by the visual quality and fascinating mystery.
