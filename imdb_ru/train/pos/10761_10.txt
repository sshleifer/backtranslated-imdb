My roommate bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her. She is from China and has heard so much about 9/11 and wanted to know the cold harsh truth, and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary. I felt terrible when I watched this documentary, it was like experiencing a nightmare, and it still causes tears in my eyes. <br /> <br /> But I am very grateful for watching this documentary, because on the day of September 11 I am sure that we all remember where we were and what we did when we heard, we all could think only to certain questions: “Why?”, “How?”, “What is happening?”, “Oh my God!”. Almost all Americans were grateful for the brave firefighters and police who risked their lives to save others. But I don't think we thought about what they were really going, though. In fact, this was not supposed to be a documentary about 9/11, the operator simply shot a normal working day, and they were a couple of blocks from the World Trade Centers and got everything, both outside and inside. tape. <br /> <br /> On September 11, I thought to myself, “It's all right, the police and firemen will pull out the surviving people.” Honestly, I thought it was an accident, I was in high school, changed after classes in the gym and was preparing for science classes. Someone entered the dressing room shouting "In New York, they just blew up the building!" We all quickly got dressed and ran to the classes when we watched the first tower burning on TV. Not only after 15 seconds a second plane hit another World Trade Center live on TV, and we knew that it was not by chance. A few minutes later we learned about the Pentagon and that a plane was flying to Chicago, but it was shot down. There were so many thoughts in our heads, and I kept thinking: “What are the firemen and the police going to do?”. But I thought it was a procedure for them, they would know what to do. <br /> <br /> The first tower collapsed, we knew it, so many lives had already passed, the second tower collapsed, things will never be the same. Those firefighters in this documentary showed courage, confusion and strength, real rude human emotions. They did not know what to do, they were just as scarred as other people who were in the towers. They heard the bodies fall to the ground from people jumping out of the windows. And so I was in class, just crying, seeing everything that was happening on TV. I was amazed by this film and just wanted to go to New York and tell them how grateful all Americans are for their help. I know that they feel that they are just doing their job, but they did more, they were heroes. Every day after 9/11, they continued to dig for 3 weeks, knowing that there were no survivors, but they continued to hope and pray. May God bless their kind and brave hearts. <br /> <br /> As for my roommate, she cried and confessed that this was her first time when she cried from these attacks. She saw the truth about what happened on that tragic day. She asked why. I didn’t know what to say, it breaks my heart that people can be such an evil. “It’s a click,” but it was an ordinary day for everyone, ”one of the firefighters said in a documentary. No one expected this to happen. Not that those people in the World Trade Centers, or in the Pentagon, or on hijacked planes, they just did their job, turned out there, or even just flew by. They were not just killed, they were killed, and these hijackers did it with a song in their heart. Then, seeing all the people in the Middle East celebrating, why do people do it? They celebrated death and loss: mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, friends, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. Why? <br /> <br /> So, thanks to these people for making this documentary. You really think of firefighters, policemen and troops in Iraq, and it gives hope that there are good people in this world. Thanks to all those people, you are our heroes. <br /> <br /> 10/10
