A piece of fine art. Maybe a masterpiece. Undoubtedly, a special story about the ambiguity of existence. Tale in the style of Kafka about the impossibility of victory or survival in the eternal strange world. Life in this film is just an adaptation exercise. A lesson about borders and original sin, about the fragility of innocence and the delusion of his ways. <br /> <br /> Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. An image of the Judicial and an equally ambiguous woman. And Europe is a symbol of a major crisis that has many aspects, such as chimeric wars or the ongoing search for truth / essence / golden age. <br /> <br /> Metaphor or parable, the film is a story of a disappointed evolution. War, peace, business, or lies are just the details of gelatin time. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love is an agreement. Sacrifice is the only way to hope for an understanding of the painful reality
