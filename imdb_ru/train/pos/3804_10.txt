My 3 year old loved it. I loved it, my wife loved it. So 10 out of 10 from our family. As for the level of violence? Not very cruel, mostly from a slap. No one really dies, no blood, no blood, no torture, so this is definitely suitable for children, much more than many Saturday cartoons in the morning. <br /> <br /> This movie really takes the idea of ​​CG movies where it should be go. <br /> <br /> First of all, beautiful graphics, textures are beautifully made, with true depth, not trying to be realistic, but forming an artistic whole. Moss on stones, rust on metal, reliefs on wood and stone all add to the whole. <br /> <br /> Character modeling, unlike many modern CG films, is again strange, not pretty, again in an artistic whole. Individuals may look less pliant than in some other films, but the characters are more like puppets than people. I think it is good, it gives truthfulness, however strange it sounds, it is easier to suspend your disbelief. <br /> <br /> Hair, fur, clothes, on a par, at least with such as Pixar, Just mark in the first scenes when Lian-Chu battles with a giant slug; Guizdo is standing in front of some farmers, and all of them have detailed clothes, because of which I stopped at the film just to admire them. <br /> <br /> Decor. Far beyond loves cars, and even walls. The space has been made many times, but the fantasy neighborhoods of the Dragon Hunters are comparable only to some scenes in The Infinite Story and The Lord of the Rings, but again this artistic whole, in which many good ideas are embodied without much effort. Magnificent vistas, such as the scene at Monsters Inc., where they pass all doorways through the vault, or the wall, where we see the huge garbage towers that he made, in this film everything is splendid but never stopped; it's just the background all the way! Interlude, where they walk on the territory with fantastic waterfalls. Chinese wall, islands floating in the sky. Broccoli in the sky? It is here that I believe that CG should go, do something that is breathtaking, and do it again and again. <br /> <br /> The sound is good, the music is diverse, not only epic, but, fortunately, without any vocals, and purely original for the film. <br /> <br /> Animation is not bad. Inspired by cartoons, it is especially useful to stretch and squeeze. Sometimes this is not so realistic, but 3d models are also not realistic. <br /> <br /> Characterization is also well done. Liang-Chu, a gentle and uncertain giant, gradually grows in confidence, basking in the attention of little Zoë. <br /> <br /> In the end, Guizdo, the cunning manager Lien-Chu, buys himself, while Zoë really hasn't changed at all, but who wants this cute baby to change? At least I loved Lian-Chu more than any other recent character from the time of Sally in Monsters Inc. <br /> <br /> Internal divisions in the group are smoothed out by external pressure, as it should be in a real fantastic story. . <br /> <br /> This story is most reminiscent of the “Endless Story”, especially about how the world is falling apart. Monsters are a fairly standard fare other than flocking. Does he lack the emotional impact of Wall ?? E, which is really the strong point of this film, but this is a much more fun trip, and it lacks an annoying musical scene that reproduces the previous one and the action from the first scene. This film is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time. <br /> <br /> The whole film, as I mentioned, is a whole vision that seems to be strictly followed. <br /> <br /> It seems that the setting is ready for new adventures, and I would hope so. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the French actor performing “Lian-Chu” sounded a bit like Jean Reno in the first place, but I am glad that it was not him, although he is one of my favorites. Nice to hear a new voice for me. <br /> <br /> I give him the maximum rating, a little surprised by the mediocre and low marks of some; I tried to solve some of the problems expressed in the two reviews with the lowest votes. Approach this film as an adventure, and as a European film, not unlike Hollywood, but in a different way.
