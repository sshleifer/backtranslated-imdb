A friend of mine recommended this film, citing my vocal and inflectional resemblance to De Hole, the main character of the film. I suppose, to some extent, I see it and, perhaps, a little more, I am not very sure that this is a flattering image or not. <br /> <br /> This is a rather unique work, the only film to which it can lead to more than a fleeting resemblance could be found with True Romance, and not in content, style of shooting or dialogue pace more, well, of course, calmer). But instead, they both represent modern love stories. <br /> <br /> In general, I am a big fan of Canadian films about music and musicians (for example, I highly recommend Hard Core Logo) and, in particular, this film. He has an innocent charm, Des is not always the cutest guy, but there is something in him that evokes sympathy.
