This film is very interesting and never boring, even if it lasts almost 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michel Fieffer and other actors are great in the film and very believable. The violence was a bit extreme in the film, but then it showed how fierce the drug trade was during the film. The ending is amazing and probably one of the coolest scenes ever. Great movie, and you will probably really like it.
