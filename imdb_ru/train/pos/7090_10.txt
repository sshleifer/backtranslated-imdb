Linear displacement inside a nonlinear structure. It is a fact that time, in 12 monkeys, flows in this coming between the present, the future and the past. However, the linearity of the film cannot be avoided: it is the work of the projector itself, the disclosure of the narration. <br /> <br /> What we see at the heart of the temporal theme is a reflection of the inevitability of our actions. The world of this Terry Gilliam film is a world in which there is little room for free will. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, we are told about the prophecy of a schizophrenic, according to which plague will rule the Earth in 1997, forcing the few survivors to live underground is the only place where the virus was not affected. <br /> <br /> Cole (Willis )’s mission is clear: go back to the mid-1990s to investigate everything related to the release of the virus. There is no way to change the past: all that can be done is to gather information that can help the scientists of the present (which is the future for us, the audience) to find a cure. Not to change what happened (the past is inevitable), but to make the present better. <br /> <br /> In his “returns” in time, Cole gradually faces an amazing dilemma: his past life is better than his present life. <br /> <br /> The latter is gloomy and inhuman, controlled by totalitarian scholars who choose “volunteers” (this word is very ironic) to go on a journey into the past. <br /> <br /> Scientists have not yet reached the highest level of achievement in time travel, and Cole is on the wrong dates - this later, in the plot, will serve as proof of his sanity for the psychiatrist Catherine (Stowe). <br /> <br /> As the plot progresses, we see that linearity and nonlinearity alternate in circular temporality. <br /> <br /> There is more than one moment when the scene is the first and ends almost the last - and certainly the climatic one - appears. He changes himself, in accordance with the memories of Cole, which emerge in his dreams. <br /> <br /> At the airport, a man is shot, when he runs, armed, to someone else. Blonde running for the dead. <br /> <br /> This is the scene that connects the past (in which Cole is a child who visits the airport with his parents), the present (story time) and the future (adult Cole) Throughout the story, Cole feels he has already lived the reality that is experiencing now. His prophetic dreams are proof that it is impossible to avoid or avoid what happened. The agents who shoot him prevent him from killing the mad scientist, Dr. Peters (Morse), who is responsible for spreading the disease. <br /> <br /> Something that could not be changed. And, in the case of Cole, that was, it will be. Forever. <br /> <br /> The film is not completely clear to many. For me, this is nothing but a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Other good films with a similar theme: “Return to the future trilogy” (this is another aspect regarding the nature of the “mad scientist”, and although he shares the atmosphere of decay - especially in the second film - he is much more optimistic , than the work of Gilliam, this is a strange Hollywood picture). <br /> <br /> In another register there is Forest Strawberry, one of Bergman’s masterpieces; this includes an astounding and informative journey into the past through dreams and memories. <br /> <br /> I have never watched La Jetée, but only because I cannot find it.
