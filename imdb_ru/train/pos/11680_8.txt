The silent film “OK, Clara Bow”, released in 1927, is the result of “Rain”, where Bow plays the semi-Hawaiian wild daughter of a local pineapple king, who fell in love with a balanced English engineer, Clive Brooke. Bow competes with a local widow (Arlett Marshall) for his attention, but both women get a big surprise when his wife (Patricia Dupont) appears. Predatory wife is ready for divorce until she discovers that he may be on the verge of state. Onions quickly solve their problems. <br /> <br /> Luka has his own personality, and he has some wonderful scenes: her opening nude bath, her hula in a grass skirt and a dog rescue scene in which Bow and Brooke do their own stunts. <br /> <br /> Note. IMDb credit list is incorrect. The authors of the film (from the DVD that I have) indicate that Patricia Dupont is played by Mrs. Haldane, and not by Margaret Truax, as stated in IMDb.
