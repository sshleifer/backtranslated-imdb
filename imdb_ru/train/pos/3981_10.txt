This is my fourth short film about Joe MacDawax, which I have ever seen, and the funniest one. In this, Joe takes vocal lessons from a recording depicting Charles Boyer and Ronald Coleman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (by the way, the company behind this series), he asks Jack Carson about the directions that confuse both. He then meets actor George O'Hanlon (who is also MacDawax), who speaks in his more normal voice, which is not too far from his later Heroj Jetson, and gets to the set, where he automatically upsets the director. I’ll stop here and just say how funny I found all of this and I was fascinated by the movie star cameos near the end. The final scene was especially noisy, so on that note, go to YouTube if you want to watch “So you want to be in Picutres”!
