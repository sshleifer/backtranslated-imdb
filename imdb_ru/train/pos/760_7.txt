I have not seen this film since the late 80s and decided to take its VHS version. The plot is very slow, and the actors almost seem like robots in this breakdance film. Music, hip-hop / freestyle and breakdance scenes are what makes this movie special. Break dance is actually better in this film than in Breakin, but I have to say that Breakin '1 & 2 carries energy and excitement to the screen much better. This is a film that I will keep in my library, but this is not a film that I can watch again and again, only once in the blue moon.
