“Intruder” (L'Intrus), a film directed by French director Claire Denis, is the release of the film. He follows his spirit in time, space and character. Maybe the plot, but what I understood, I understood from the description on the cover of the Netflix DVD. To be honest, it’s probably better not to know anything about the film before watching it, because then the viewer can drop any expectations. The film requires the viewer to think, but also scoff at the fact that he or she does not get complete understanding. <br /> <br /> The human heart is a mystery of the film. Each image casts doubt on its role, its nature and its form. The heart of the attacker, the viewer and Louis. The character Louis plays Michel Suborus with the peace and mystery required by such a character. Honestly, anyone could play the role of Louis if he or she had a wandering, ready and comfortable heart. Yet Subor is the one shown here; he becomes a film, his personality is inseparable from him. Many images of the film that linger in my memory revolve around his vocal expressions, but mostly physical ones. <br /> <br /> The violator is poetic in his ability to capture stillness and fullness of movement, but more mobile than any literature form that he refuses to accept. “Surreal” was the term used in the description of this film, but perhaps “quasi-realistic” is a more appropriate term. Nothing in the film exists outside of the possibilities of reality; a simple ubiquitous assessment confirms that by presenting in music the connection between the heartbeat and dim light. <br /> <br /> Watch the trailer several times if you are attracted to visual images; Watch the film to see the effects of a combination of verse and desire for freedom.
