This show was great, I thought it was not only for the kids, but for the whole family. <br /> <br /> The first season was devoted mainly to the father, who looks after two daughters and a son. Unfortunately, I passed away in the second season, I could believe it when I heard about it. <br /> <br /> I am dressed that they have continued the show, as it will really happen in real life, and I should mention “Farewell Episode” it was so well done, it must have been so hard for them to shoot it, you could say they were real tears in their eyes. I am 24 years old, and this episode made me cry, because I know how they felt when my father died, when I was 13, just like Roy. <br /> <br /> In the 2nd and 3rd seasons there was a great comedy there, in the third season, there were some of my favorites, such as Freaky Friday, Secrets. <br /> <br /> I still think that the show was strong enough to continue, I was disappointed that it ended, it was one of the best, wasn’t it the best family comedy show since Home Improvement passed, and these could be the following Friends. <br /> <br /> it should never have ended, but I still love to watch replays every day.
