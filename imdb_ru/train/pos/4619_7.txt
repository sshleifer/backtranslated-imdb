First of all, I'm a big fan of movies from the 80s, as well as Jennifer Connelly. So, yesterday I wandered into a local store for used books and films and found a VHS copy. I read my back and it sounded good, and for $ 3.99 it was a good deal. I took it home and put it in the video recorder. What a sweet movie! Now, at my age, I relate more to such films as “About Last Night” or “The Fire of Saint Elmo,” but I still remember what it was like to be 15/16, to love an older guy, and so on. if it doesn't work, we are heartbroken and think that we will never cope with it. But, of course, we do. Many times. This is the sweet quality that I really got from this movie. Feeling “Oooh! I remember when something like that happened to me ... ”it all goes away. Characters interesting and developed. I recommend it to anyone who loves movies of the 80s, in particular, films for teenagers, or anyone who just wants to come back and remember a simpler time in their lives.
