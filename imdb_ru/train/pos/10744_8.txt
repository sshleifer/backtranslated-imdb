The events of September 11, 2001 do not need additional human interest in the form of tracking the training of a novice fireman or the progress of two French brothers. In my opinion, it would be better to leave it aside. I think that the directors tried too hard, perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as background. The comment of one of the policemen - “this is not a bloody Disney” - is appropriate. <br /> <br /> However, this is a compelling look at the description of events. The filmmakers were in all the right places at the right time, other shots of that day do not coincide with what they were shooting.
