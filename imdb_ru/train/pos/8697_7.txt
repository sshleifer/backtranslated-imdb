Often laugh out loud, funny games about sex, family and classes in Beverly Hills, where the milk laughs more from the zip code than it has been since the days of grandmother and Jed Clampett. In the center of the plot are two chauffeurs who have put one of them to sleep with their employer (both lonely and soon lonely, rather sexy - Bisset and Ravens). If Manuel wins, his friend will pay his debt to an aggressive Asian street gang - if he loses, he must play the lower man with his friend! <br /> <br /> A lot of obscene dialogues, a rather sick physical humor, etc. But most of the comedy is just below the surface. Barthel is remembered as a very sensual family member who eventually takes his sexy young niece in the year of the “missionary trip” to Africa. <br /> <br /> Merry fun.
