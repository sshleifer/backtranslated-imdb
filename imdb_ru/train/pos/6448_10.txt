Kay Pollack (the man behind this film) is a real great man who tries to share his life philosophy in different ways. He wrote a bunch of good and well-written books about how to control your feelings and keep your soul happy. The message in most of his books and this film is that your thoughts are actually the cause of your problems and that the cause of your anger is hardly ever caused by what you think. The main thing is that you can be happy, but hardly ever do it. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and learn something very important in life, you must keep your mind very open and LISTEN to all the “hidden messages” (or guidelines to get through life) that most parts in this movie if you listen and watch. Watch this with your ears. <br /> <br /> You will not know the meaning of life, but you will learn how to live and get the most out of it ... <br /> <br /> Therefore, watching, please keep in mind: <br / > <br /> “The mind is like a parachute, it does not work if it is not open!”
