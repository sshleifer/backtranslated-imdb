Although I love this film, I can hardly watch it, it is so real. So, I put it on for the night and hid behind a bank of my computers. I remembered it well, but I just wanted to see if I could find something that I hadn’t seen before ........ I didn’t do that: because it’s so real to me. <br /> <br /> Another “user” wrote that the age of the commentators should be shown with their summaries. I'm all for it! Obviously, most of these people who commented on the Midnight Cowboy may not have been born when he was released. They mention other films in which John Voight and Dustin Hoffman later appeared. I will also be terribly frank: I am 82 years old. If you are familiar with some of my other comments, you will know that I was a professional female imitator for 60 years and also starred in the film - you will never recognize me, even if you were familiar with my nightclub persona. Do you think I know a lot about the characters in this movie? YOU BECOME WHAT I DO !! .... <br /> <br /> .... and I'm not ashamed. If you have not encountered some of them, this is your loss - but you have a huge chance, but you just did not know about it. So many moms, dads, sons and daughters may surprise you. It should not be a secret MANY actors / actresses appeared on the background of "Midnight Cowboy". Who should judge? I can name a few of the current BIG-TIME stars that were raised on the gloomy streets of many cities and were not affected by the time spent there. I do not blame them because they are people just like us all - love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility: you call attributes, they all exist, regardless of what the package looks like. <br /> <br /> “Little things” that Hoffman is really begging on the streets to prove that he can play the role of “Ratzo” is a gem - you can see him driving a car all over Los Angeles - like you think how he gets his input? I can also name a lot of male stars who stood on the streets and went to the bars for money. Although the nightclub, in which I last worked for 26 years, was world-famous and legal, I can also name a few HUGE stars, which I had to constantly chase away from our back alley to look. <br /> <br /> This should not be surprising today, although it is definitely an action in Hollywood and other cities, large and small. Wake up and smell the roses. They smell no less sweet, because they have a different shade. <br /> <br /> Some of the “users” thought that “Joe Buck” was mocking his grandmother. Although I saw him in her bed with a boyfriend, I did not find any cases of this. Believe it or not, children ALWAYS did not have their own rooms - because today it should tell you that something strange can happen in the master bedroom. Whose business? Hoffman may have asked for change on the streets, but some “users” point out that John Voight was not the main star on the set of The Midnight Cowboy — his actual salary will surprise you. I think he was robbed! No one can doubt the clarity that he put into his role, and that she MADE him a star for such a great work as “Liberation”. He identified a strong man who defeated his devils and was better for this: few commented that he was raped in this film. The end of the 60s, perhaps, was one of the first films that were so open, but society has always been fashionable. <br /> <br /> I also did not find any homosexuality between “Ratzo” and “Joe” - they were clearly opposites, unattractive to each other. They found a much higher relationship — true friendship. If you do not understand this at the end of the film, then you have wasted your time. Joe was perplexed, but shameless loyalty was obvious. Yes, Voight deserved an Oscar for this role, which John Wayne will never be able to remove, and he was just as beautiful in his youth. <br /> <br /> Hoffman - this is Hoffman - you are expecting fireworks. He gave them great. Wayne got his Oscar. Every character in this film was beautifully defined - if you don’t think they are still there, you are wrong. "A party" ? - attend some “raves” that young people attend ..... if you can enter. Look at the ranks of people trying to get into hot clubs - you will see every outrageous person. <br /> <br /> Brenda Vikaro was the epitome of charming women in society who occasionally came to a close. If you were shocked by her brilliant game, thinking that "this is not real," take a look at today's "ladies" who live on the edge of ill fame .... and admire it. <br /> <br /> The cruelty of "Joe", manifested in the robbery of the old man, unfortunately, is also part of life. You do not have to put up with it, but this is not too different from any violence. "Joe" pointedly called his goal - in this situation, I would give the money faster than he asked. This is one of the scenes that makes this a breakthrough film that I don’t watch. My heart is broken for both ..... <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger must have been familiar with this abomination in order to direct this frighteningly beautiful sensation - Waldo Salt did not write about clairvoyance. Anyone who had any part of the hit on the screen should have realized that they are making history, and should be proud of the honesty of it. Perhaps “only in America” we can turn a blind eye to unpleasant situations, while other directors do not hesitate to present it to the public. Do not look does not mean that he is not there - tell me the truth every time. Bravo! everything......
