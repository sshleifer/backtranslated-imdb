Why did Dynamo not have pants ?! Where did they go?? This has never been explained. That's why this movie was so cool. Plus Starsky gave AIDS to his children !!!! Great acting too. Richard Dawson has earned the title of Best Supporting Actor! A I D S My favorite line from the film was “It Fell In” A I D S. This film was for “birds”. I tried to give this film "stinkeye", but he continued to play. What am I doing wrong???!!!! I thought "HATEBOAT" was funny lol;) I would like this for the show. Why were there no trousers on Dynamo? I know that his hand was twisted, but ... What happened to these crazy networks of the future. Why did that fellow from family feud Ray Combs not get the net ?? He could use one. AIDSSSSS
