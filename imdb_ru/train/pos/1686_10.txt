After a long, hard week at the table, making all the serious decisions, this film is a great way to relax. Like Wells and the original broadcast, this film takes you to the land of alien humor and science fiction. “Captain Zippo died at the head of Buick. He was a brave man. Jack Nicholson’s impressions shine right through this alien face with dark sunglasses and a leather jacket. And always remember to beware of the "donut of death"! Keep in mind the rule number one of this film - suspend disbelief - sit back and relax - and get ready to die scum! You just have to see it yourself.
