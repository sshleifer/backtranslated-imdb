I discovered that this film is a fascinating study of a crisis family. When Leo, the oldest, announces that he is HIV +, the reaction of family members alone and with each other was touching and yet strange. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a family that is physically as demonstrative as this one; none of them can scream at each other like that. I did not understand why the family felt that the younger one could not cope with the news, but one day, after going through this, I discovered that this film is very touching. <br /> <br />
