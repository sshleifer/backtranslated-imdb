I agree with many negative reviews published here for reasons that I will discuss later. But this mini-series is powerful and convincing, because the talented cast really reflects the grim truth about Hitler’s world. <br /> <br /> Peter Stormare is perfect as Ernst Roma, the brutal leader of Braunshirt. Each of his scenes with Hitler is explosive! Hitler is so angry that he dominates all but the gangster, primitive Roma - and he clearly digs Roma for this very reason. The interaction between Stormare and Carlisle highlights how Hitler enjoyed Roma’s cruelty, but later sacrificed it for political reasons. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone turns into a heartbreaking performance like Geli Raubal, Hitler's doomed niece and victim of his unspeakable perversion. Without revealing any sexual dirt, Jena Malone plays the whole horror of the slow extinction of the spirit of a young girl. She uses her eyes and voice to instill all the horror that will befall millions in the coming years. And she is gorgeous! Zoe Telford almost goes to Jena Malone with her image of Eva Brown. Eve is clearly ill, cruel and heartless, but at the same time almost pitifully dependent on the perverse tenderness of her Adolf. The torn love scene between them (hinting at the tingling of the truth about the immense hatred of Hitler himself) is both frightening and erotic. <br /> <br /> Liv Schrieber plays adorably, like a caress, like Putsi Hanfstengel, a man without a backbone about a city seduced by Hitler’s promises about wealth and power. While cattle such as Rum just loves the idea of ​​smashing skulls under their boots, Schriber's character is one of many Germans who do not tolerate Nazi violence, but cannot resist the quick and easy way to money and power. His limp hoax over Hitler soon loses respect for his wife, with the gorgeous and sensual play of the stunning and regal Julianne Margulis. They give a real portrait of marriage and betrayal. <br /> <br /> These performances accompany the mini-series, easily overcoming the random shortcomings of the script. There is one exception. Unfortunately, the acting chops of Matthew Modine just can not. His noble shaggy journalist destroys every scene he has - the viewer can hardly wait for the brown shirts of Roma to trample that smug, righteous look from his ignorant, naked Hollywood Hollywood golden boy. But the story still works. <br /> <br /> Now, with regard to the actual inaccuracies of the script, the perversions and cruelties of Hitler are presented in a bright, irresistible drama. But the record of Corporal Hitler is highly distorted. As if the frightened audience could not cope with the idea of ​​evil and courage in the same person, the authors make Hitler look like a coward who ached, “asking” for an iron cross. As if someone in the Kaiser army could get a medal, just whimpering about it! From the film, it seems that Hitler was a coward in the trenches when he was a fearless soldier. They also suggest that his comrades despised him, when in fact he was widely admired by officers and military personnel. It is depressing that the mini-series is so well able to honestly represent Hitler as a monster, but they just can't resist a cheap shot. <br /> <br /> In general, however, Hitler: RISE OF EVIL is a rapid success, marked by powerful performances.
