There are many people in our life whom we meet only once in our lives, but for one reason or another we remember these people for a lifetime. This is once in life a friendship between people who have great distances between them, and there are always some natural reasons for which we no longer meet with these people. We don't always even know their names, since we never introduce ourselves to each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are. It's funny that ordinary humanity makes random friends, and we like to keep it as such, because reunion can spoil pleasant memories, or we don't know if they do it. We are too afraid to check it out. <br /> <br /> The film Before Dawn just caught me watching. I never had the intention to look through it, but since the discussion between the couple seemed interesting, I watched the rest of the film. I did not know what to expect from this, but I didnâ€™t know a young couple either. They had time to discuss with each other before the sunrise, and everything could happen before they were to separate. I believe that this film had good reviews, because the situation is something that everyone on this planet has experienced at least once or twice. It makes us all think about all the people we met only once in our lives.
