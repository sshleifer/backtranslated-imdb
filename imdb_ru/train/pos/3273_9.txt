I give it only 9 out of 10, because I need to look at it again, in a more current state of mind, in order to have a new perspective. I remember the amazing psychological thriller that blinded my brain and eyes when I watched it. I would watch him every time he appeared on HBO that day (maybe in 1990 or so). I could even record it, but Iâ€™m sure that this record is long gone. <br /> <br /> I wrote to GreenCine to try to get this title, but currently it does not carry it. I hope I can find it at the local video store. <br /> <br /> I would strongly recommend trying it if you find it anywhere. This is at least interesting. If you like movies like Edward Scissorhands, Beatlejuice, Gammo, or something weird, try this one.
