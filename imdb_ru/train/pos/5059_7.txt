We watched the VCR and found it to be fascinating. Without knowing anything about this true story, I thought, “Oh, no, P. Brosnan as an American Indian (“ red ”Indian in the film), what a bad choice,” until I learned the truth about the Gray Owl. The film well demonstrates the dignity of these indigenous peoples and undermines the racist myths about them. And Annie Galipo, WOW, what a beauty and very persuasive, like an Indian woman (I believe that she is French Canadian; she most likely returns to too familiar this kind of speech). Despite Brosnan’s curt, snarling style, in the end he convincingly manifests himself as a passionate, devoted man. The plot is a bit weak in demonstrating its transformation from a trap into a protector of animals. Good movie, highly recommended.
