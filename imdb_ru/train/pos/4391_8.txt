You wait to see if the remake will be better or worse. I rated the Odie Murphy film as 3 (I'm a stern grader), the second lowest I've ever given to Odie (the worst of them is “The Battle on the Bloody Beach” if you're interested). I assign a rating of 8 to this film (and I am a severe grader). This is the story of the civil war about the "soldiers" of the renegades, if you want to call them that, against the North. People like Quantrell, and people who traveled with these criminals. <br /> <br /> The original was a watery version with a very clean neckline, which still depicted the horror of what these people did. In fact, films like the old version are best watched by mature viewers who can discern the story. I would be more inclined to appreciate the original “R” and this, with its rude character, GP, because the new film gives a very honest version, the message is easier to decipher for minors than the older version. <Br /> <br /> Filmmakers have been praising Realism since the early sixties, but few of them manage. Instead, they simply give gloomy decorations, gloomy costumes and gloomy events, but with stereotypical characters from cardboard comics — the weakness of the spaghetti era. <br /> <br /> Modern filmmakers have realized this mistake. This is evident in the superb western style that we usually see today. This film is an example. He gives realistic settings, but also gives us characters who, as we can believe, exist in that era. <br /> <br /> He has a few slumbers, which makes the complex work a little more difficult, and there are some unexplainable situations in it. But unexplained situations are good, as long as the whole movie is kept, and the characters are quite intriguing. <br /> <br /> Everything starts a little politely, but it is really improving. The main character is the one we can identify, and at least there is sympathy for him. Odie Murphy's character in the early film really doesn’t evoke sympathy and is too smug without motivation. <br /> <br /> The character in this film follows the lines of a true anti-hero. There is a motivation and method to his madness. We never feel that he is truly “right,” but we can understand where he comes from. <br /> <br /> In the movie a lot of action. There is also a bit of humor. One good scene is when the heroine tells the hero that he will not lie to him, and he ponders this. <br /> <br /> This film succeeds in what directors have been trying to do for decades. This team of directors and writers understood correctly. <br /> <br /> Recommended. Complete success.
