I was glad to finally see the release of Amazing Stories of the first season on DVD. I just forgot that the star cast of actors and directors worked on this show. For a long time, you have seen this wonderful series only with collections of VHS 2 or 3 episodes or when Sci-Fi restarted the episodes. However, when Sci-Fi does repeat starts, they usually stick to the same episodes. In the first season, for example, in the “Mission”, there were several outstanding episodes that they did not repeat. Does anyone know exactly how long this episode ran? Here at the top, in IMDb, written from 1985 to 1987, but I thought it lasted longer than two years. If you like the Twilight Zone, the Night Gallery and the Outer Limits, you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.
