I liked this movie, reminded me of my marriage. It is very clean, you can see it with the family. Very nicely made. The songs are fine too. I think the screenwriter director is great. The film shows how marriages evolve over time. They have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their lives. The film beautifully depicts several parallel stages in one story. Some of the conversations are pretty good. The film depicts complex human emotions very well, without too much dramatization. Also the show is perfect, after all, not so perfect. Very well shows the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new. The film is very well written and directed.
