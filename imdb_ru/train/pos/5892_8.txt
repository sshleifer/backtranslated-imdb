Thomas Ince has always been able to bring simple home stories to life with fullness and grace. “Italian” is such a film. The solid game, especially of George Beban, the father of the silent child actor George Beban Jr., and the wonderful scenery convey a realistic sense of the early immigrants in New York. This gives this 1915 film authenticity, which is unusual in the characteristics of this vintage. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the modern day, when a man (George Beban in modern clothes) reads a story about an Italian immigrant, and then we turn to the story of George, who plays an immigrant. He collects enough money to bring his bride from Italy to America, marries her and has a son. But times are tough, and the family struggles to survive. I wondered why the mother did not breastfeed her child and avoided difficulties with the dirty mixture, but, well, yes, even the early Dream Factory was pushing for the politically correct behavior of women in 1915! <br /> <br /> The best scene in the picture is when Bebang has a chance to take revenge on the criminal boss who carelessly put him in jail, and at the last moment he decides to abandon the planned course of action. Very neat. I liked the curtain effect, it was great. Wonderful use of lighting in this film. <br /> <br /> I give the “Italian” 8 out of 10.
