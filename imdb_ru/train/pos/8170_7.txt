As if most people have not had a nervous look at the field of dentistry, this little film will surely make you suffer from paranoid patients. A successful dental hygienist watches his wife walk down to a man in the pool (on the anniversary of all their days!) when planning what to do with his "whore" wife. There are many close mouth-to-mouth shots, cutting the tongue and caressing of the beauty queen, as well as Corbin Burns's amazingly crazy presentation. The scene in which he binds the gases before ruthlessly pulling out her teeth is definitely difficult to observe. A dentist is absolutely not the person who wants to leave from the depths, and this film accurately explains this in detail. "Dentist" is incredibly interesting, fast-paced and sometimes funny.
