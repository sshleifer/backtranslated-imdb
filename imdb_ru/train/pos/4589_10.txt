Well, I would consider Police Story one of the best Jackie Chan movies. The plot, the fighting scenes and the stunt works are superb. In this film, Jackie himself acted as a police officer named Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions), who successfully arrested a criminal lord. After the criminal lord was released due to lack of evidence, he framed Chan for killing a policeman. Because of this, he is wanted by the police. Later, Salina (Bridget Lin), who was the secretary of the criminal lord, went to the shopping center and began to find evidence of the crimes of the criminal lord from her computer and get ready to transfer them to Chen. However, the criminals knew that Salina downloaded his compromising data and hired her minions to catch her. Later, Chan appeared on the scene and began to fight with all his minions, defeating them one by one. On the last scene, Chan was seen hitting a criminal. Finally, this is the best action movie and comedy. Everyone should watch this. Highly recommended.
