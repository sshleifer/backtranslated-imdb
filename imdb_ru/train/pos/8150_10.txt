My Kasi Lemmings is definitely a beautiful woman. This film is a lost gem, a ruthless satirical “mock-up” in the hip-hop scene of the early 90s, when MC Hammer just started disappearing on that good night. We are following the three members of the NWH when they embark on their strange journey of future wealth and glory. And like Nicolas Niklbi, at the end they end their journey not far from where they started, but at least a little wiser and much less naive. This is one of the best films that no one has ever heard of, but this is one that you either love or hate, very much like Company Man in this regard. I view this film as 1000 islands in upstate New York: this is a wonderful little secret that you want to keep with you.
