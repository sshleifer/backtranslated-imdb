As in the classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this film has a sense of humor at different levels. I just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. Both enjoyed the film - laughed quite often ... and my daughter is not very fiction lover. The film made me laugh, even though I saw it several times ... adult-level humor (i.e., humor, which adults will get just because of a lot of life experience, there are no body or R-rated items) that keeps the film the same pleasant for adults. For example, adult-level humor, Martian voices are based on characters from different films / actors. The Mars flyer Blazy possesses the voice and manners of Jack Nicholson; a scientist, Dr. Peter Seller, Dr. Strandzhelov. The special effects are surprisingly good for this film. The lack of top 10 actors actually works in favor of the film, and the actors / actresses play their part well - in fact, I would say that the producers chose actors and their skills for the needs of roles compared to the box office (excellent example of Wayne Alexander "Vern" character). I had to write this review ... the kids play it for the third time in 4 days at dinner right now. Good for a rainy day or a late night weekend, the film "Nothing on-ah-me-boring."
