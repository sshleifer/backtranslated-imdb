I watched it many times, and I plan to buy the full function. I love the whole comedy of Jason Steele. It is very different and unique and very pleasant. I love indie movies, and this one is just great. The plot is strange, but very funny. This short film about a talking scapula named Edward. The order of events is a bit jumbled, which makes this film very interesting to watch. At first you see how Edward fights with spoons, but then the focus changes to an earlier one in his life. It's a stupid movie, but of course it's still great. I highly recommend you watch this movie at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It is very funny. Humor may not please everyone, but still watch. It only takes 16 minutes of your time, and it's free. GO LOOK A SPEAR!
