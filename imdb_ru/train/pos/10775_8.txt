A good movie with a great soundtrack that covers the rock landscape of the 70s and 80s. Radiofrekiya describes a generation, describes life in a small village near Correggio (Ligabue's hometown, the singer who wrote the book that inspired the film), describes the lives of young people and their problems related to the world. This is reminiscent of Trainspotting, with a bit of an Italian touch.
