This film is a delightful, frivolous look on both sides of the place where the enthusiastic scene of the “club child” merges with the New York world of art, music and performance (with the cameo of omnipresent Miss Bunny). This "Torch Song Trilogy" for fun girls. “This girl” is for our disgruntled, affected millennia. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is fast and fun, and the customer, Parker Posey, deserves, if not an academy award, at least a stadium “wave of appreciation.” <br /> <br /> Of course, this film is based on Miss Posey’s very stylish platform heels, and she played well. Like many of her other acting works, she may not be very deep, often self-reliant and, well, pose ... but it all WORKS. She is a talented comedian, an incredible artist, and this film is entertaining, she wears it on her shoulders like an artificial leopard film, and never lets her fall to the floor. <br /> <br /> Mary is a superficial party fashionista who is not taller, stealing designer clothes from a friend's wardrobe or working with someone else's boyfriend. At a deeper level, this is the story of a girl and her friends who are carefree in every sense of the word, including other people; and the learning process that care is necessary for life. <br /> <br /> The script is well thought out, witty, and the only performance that disappoints is the aunt, whose role was too one-dimensional and heavy; her more nuanced performance would deepen the relationship between the two ... but ... hey ... it's a comedy. The surprisingly deep role that gives this film some essence and worldview is the guy selling the fallafel. We should all be so lucky ... is it for Mary? or one that goes away? <br /> <br /> I rate it as 8, because it’s not a great moment in the history of cinema, it’s not a classic or a great art (it all gets deeper and richer when you re-watch it). Like “Desperately Seeking Susan,” she represents something very true in her time period, but over time can become irrelevant. Nevertheless, it has everything that an entertainment film needs, and it’s worth to watch several times just for clothes!
