I like this movie. It was rare to see post-war Vietnam, and this film without battle scenes and exciting bombs and shooting did it. I had no idea that this would affect me so much. What an amazing look at what alien vets feel. Frankly, it was hard to watch. We all understand the fight and the drama Apocalypse Now, but it is so different. What happens when they come back and try to live life? They can not. It made me realize a large group of people who rattle around the lost in America. Can not communicate, can not sleep, can not make love, can not deal with "normal society". They feel completely separate. This is a huge tragedy, and it is not well developed. Yes, we changed our attitude towards Vietnamese veterinarians, we like them now, so what? It seemed to make no difference to them. Too late? So it was a great movie, but I cried a lot. I have no other criticism.
