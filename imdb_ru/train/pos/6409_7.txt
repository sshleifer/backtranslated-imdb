I have not heard of Brashear before I saw it. This is a story about him and the man who trained him, helping him become the first African-American diver of the US Navy. Tale of willpower. The plot is well written, and develops well in everything. This is what seems like a typical weak thing, and it does not contain too many surprises. It’s also pretty Hollywood, but hey, I don’t know a real person, maybe it’s close to how it actually happened. Nevertheless, he does his work, with dramatic scenes and hardships along the way, and this inspires anyone who has ever heard the words "no, you can't" talk about your dream of a lifetime. Acting everything is fine. De Niro and Gooding Jr. both shine when they are on screen. Rapaport is amazing too. Characters are well written, trustworthy and consistent. It is well edited, and shows good cinematography. Production values ​​are high, and it convincingly enough transfers us to the 50s. This is the only film that I have seen with this director and author, although now I can consider what they are responsible for. There is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise there are no offensive materials. I recommend this to anyone who finds the subject interesting, and / or fans of those who did. 7/10
