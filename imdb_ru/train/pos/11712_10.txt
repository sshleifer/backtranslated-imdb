This is such a wonderful film “Call Me Anna”, because it shows how a person suffered for so long, not knowing what was wrong with her. Patty Duke’s going public and telling his story is a source of inspiration for those who suffer from this disease. I respect her very much as a person. The only thing I don’t like is that I can’t tape it, I tried to find it, but without success. Anyone know how to get this?
