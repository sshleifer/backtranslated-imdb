This movie scared the hell out of me! I have to admit that I watched it through most of the movie, but what I saw was really scary. I screamed out loud two or three times during the show. <br /> <br /> When shooting a movie, I loved sound and photography the most. The sound was especially great, and the setting was really very beautiful. I read somewhere that this is some kind of strange team of husband and wife who did this. For some reason, this makes me even stranger. <br /> <br /> If you like jumping and jolting scary movies, then this one is for you! A very intense and excellent movie for hire with a group of friends who love to watch movies, curled up on the couch and screaming like little girls!
