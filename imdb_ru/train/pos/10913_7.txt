William Powell is a murder doctor and ex-wife in “Former Mrs. Bradford,” which also starred Jean Arthur, Eric Bloor and James Gleason. It seems that Powell had chemistry with almost any woman he was with. Although he and Myrna Loy were a perfect match on the screen, the actor made several other films like “Thin Man”, one with Ginger Rogers and the other with Arthur, both with very good effect. <br /> <br /> For some reason, No one gets tired of seeing Powell as a witty professional, and “Former Mrs Bradford” is no exception. Ex-Mrs. In Mr. B received a subpoena for alimony, and then returned to help him unravel the mystery, in which she dragged him. And this is not the first time she does it! It seems that before this was the film "Bradford" or that he was to be the first of a series of films - Mr. B. complains that his former mystery writer constantly attracts him to consider cases. This time, the jockey riding his favorite horse mysteriously drops from the horse and dies right in front of the finish line. <br /> <br /> The decision of the case is something outlandish, but not the main thing. The fact is that the joke between the couple and the intervention of the former Mrs. B. Jean Arthur is quite glamorous in his role and very funny. However, with an actress who is going crazy, like Arthur, humor seems deliberate, not crazy. I suspect the author was referring to something else — say, the stupid side of Carol Lombard. When Arthur hears that the police have arrived, she says: “Ah, that is probably because of my child support. I waited until the police put a hand to it, ”- this is rather Powell’s rib, and not a serious statement. It still works well, and it shows how a good actress can play a role. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing, as always were William Powell and Gene Arthur.
