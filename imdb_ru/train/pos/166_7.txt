It was the first film that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable made together, and they will make some more. Crawford acts as a young rich girl whose father died in the collapse of the stock market, and she and her brother had nothing left. They have never worked before, and the brother, William Bakewell, gets a job with Gable, who is a gangster, and Bakewell thinks it will be an easy job, but he will do the job pretty quickly. Crawford becomes a newspaper reporter, but he wants to work on big stories, but he is given useless things to work with. This is a massacre in which several Gable men were killed, and Crawford witnessed all of this. This is a good movie, but not one of the best.
