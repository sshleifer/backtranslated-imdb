For a Danish film, I have to say that this is a very good film. <br /> <br /> This is a separate class, but it has international potential. <br /> <br /> The film has a large budget, it was filmed famous Danish actors and a few newcomers who play very well. Anyone who loves adventure and a small ghost movie can watch it. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid, be delighted!
