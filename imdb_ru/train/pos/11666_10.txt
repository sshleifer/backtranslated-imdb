SECRET KELLOV, perhaps the most exquisite film I have seen since the TRIPLE OF BELVILLES. Although stylistically very different, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and (stunning 2D-sequence) KUNG FU PANDA, an incredible artistic direction, thoughtful design, background / layout and richness of color that pleases the senses. KELLS is so luxurious - almost gothic in its location (somewhat reminiscent of Klimt), surprisingly flat in its general form, richly decorated with Celtic and lighted designs, but the characters are so simple and attractive - and all this is perfectly combined. You fall in love with the characters from the moment they meet. You so much to every detail of the story and to every stroke of a pencil and brush. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul, and everyone in Cartoon Saloon (and their extended teams) have done with this small budget / VERY small crew movie is absolutely amazing. The justification of support among our animation community is phenomenal. This film is breathtaking, and our colleagues recommended this film as a wildfire. Congratulations to KELLS with numerous awards, the nomination of Annie and the current qualifying race for the Oscars. They all very deservedly nod ...
