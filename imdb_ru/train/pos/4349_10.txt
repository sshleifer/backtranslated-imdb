Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) unexpectedly comes to the place of his son. His son, Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser), was very surprised to learn that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis), had left her father. Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) and his three sisters try to find Muriel, while Ben and his father go to a farm that is for sale. But this is not the end of their journey. Their trip turns into a long therapy session between Ben and his father. Raymond De Felitta - Director of “Things about My People” (2005). Paul Reiser is behind the script, and he did a wonderful job. The dialogue between Ben and Sam is amazing. And he worked with the script for twenty years, so it is not surprising that it is so good. Who would have played a father better than Peter Falk? No one, I can tell you that. And I really like the story of why Paul wanted Peter Falk to play a role. Peter was an actor who made his own father laugh. And Peter definitely made me laugh in this movie. It's just funny when they go fishing. And as the old guy hits the youngest in a game of pool, and then hits him with a stick. The film is often very funny, and I laugh several times. But sometimes it can be touching. Could you tell a story better than here.
