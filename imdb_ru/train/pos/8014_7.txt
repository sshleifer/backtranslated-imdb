But if you like dolls, I challenge you not to like this one. Basically, the same plot, regurgitated (this time in New York, and not in Los Angeles), has a lot of funny cameos and a hi-jinx mappet. Many dolls leave the film quite early, as it is centered around Kermi and Miss Piggy. I really liked it. Have fun watching with your kids.
