The second of the series “Why we fight” is devoted to the seizure by Hitler of the Sudetenland and not only when he turns into a dummy Neville Chamberlain and starts conquering Europe. <br /> <br /> Clearly understood as propaganda, over time this series has become an informative documentary over time, and much of the Allied bias turned out to be a historical fact. The Fuhrer rises on his own firecracker with smug statements to his people and the world when he says one thing and does another when his army moves east. The Czechs and Austrians quickly capitulate, but the Poles are leading a heroic struggle against overwhelming odds. <br /> <br /> The discrepancy between the military might of Hitler and Chamberlain, waving the Munich Treaty like a white flag, proclaiming “the world in our time” to this day, has strong propaganda qualities. Here, in its original context, it sounds even more powerful, since the darkness of World War II attacks Europe, leaving the American audience two options: freedom or slavery. In 1943, there was no deviation from this simple truth, and the Nazi Strike effectively proves its point.
