There is a story, but more significantly, the world of this film begins in chaos and comes to order within ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This is a celebration of life and an optimistic statement of objective truth and good. This film should be presented in every high school along an axis not studied in the previous cinema. <br /> <br /> * CHIASMUS *
