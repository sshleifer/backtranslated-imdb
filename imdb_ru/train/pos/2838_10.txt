New York, I love you, full of love and power. Not for everyone, however, but this is a beautiful film. <br /> <br /> There are people like Shea LaBuff (in the films “Transformers”, “Durburgi”, “Charlie Angels”, “I am a Robot”, Indiana Jones and many others), Maggie Q. Kevin Bacon, Blake Lively, Natalie Portman and many others. This film with impeccable actors and stars, no doubt, great. <br /> <br /> For many top-notch directors around the world, he cannot help but impress. The variety from one story to another is creative and unique. <br /> <br /> It’s safe to say that “New York I Love You” is a film about popcorn, and you need to watch it on BIG TV! Trust IMDb this time, because this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to Shanghai, I love you in 2010. <br /> <br /> See NY ILY, you will not be disappointed,
