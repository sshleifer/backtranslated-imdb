This film has many strengths. He has one of the best horror roles outside the circle of Lugosi-Karloff-Cheney: Lionel Atville, Fay Ray and Dwight Fry, as well as presenter Melvin Douglas. It has all the necessary ingredients: bats, a castle with lots of stone stairs, a mad scientist, townspeople swinging torches and hunting vampires, a character like "Igor", a beautiful girl, even a blunt burgomaster. The camera work with soft focus is capricious and creative. The script even has a good comic relief. <br /> <br /> But in reality this is not a monster, because in Kleinschloss (“little castle”) nothing supernatural happens. The plot revolves around a common madman (played by Atville), who values ​​his work above human lives. <br /> <br /> This is not top level material, due to the indecent plot resolution and some awkwardly bad dialogue for Dwight Fry. But it is worth seeing if you like early b / w horror pictures.
