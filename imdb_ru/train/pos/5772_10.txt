I watched this show as a kid, and I liked it! I watched him when he appeared back on the Toons of a year ago .... Damn, I'm so old! Probably, I was 13 or 14 years old when it happened ... But in any case, he had a great storyline, and I am one of those girls who watched (and Terrified) Sailormoon, and I really liked it. The animation was not the best ... Actually, in some parts it was pretty funny, and the sound was VERY lame at first, but it was all a good watch, and I found myself diving into it day after day. <br /> Samurai Warriors / Ronin Warriors is a classic and one of my favorites. Go Ryo !!!!
