Two warring shops in the leather goods shop are secret lovers, since they correspond to the pseudonyms with the numbers of the boxes. Within the framework of this simple idea and everyday situation, Lubic creates a rich tapestry of wit, drama, wit and irony, which never surrenders. Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as a regular couple with real emotions and tension, while the rest of well-developed characters have their own plots and jokes. Although it mistakenly eclipsed Stuart's great films from 39/40 (Destry, Philadelphia Story, Mr. Smith), it's easy on one level, and we enjoy a number of acting tricks that have never been seen before in other films.
