I found memorable quotes in search of video clips; they forgot one of my favorites ... <br /> <br /> Old Man 1: You know, I remember the first time they played this thing. <br /> <br /> Old Man 2: You remember pterodactyls. <br /> <br /> Old Man 1: And I remember that you fell in love with it, hook and sinker. <br /> <br /> Old Man 2: Oh, no. <br /> <br /> Old lady: You did just that. You put a big bucket in your head and take the army guys with you to fight the Martians. <br /> <br /> Old Man 2: You haven't died yet?
