Beautiful film, pure Cassaveti style. Gene Rowland stuns the actress, who is waning, dealing with success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism. She tries to escape from her own subconscious ghosts, embodied the ghost of the death of a young girl. The recognition of oneself, the state of a person, despite his general difficulties, is the real purpose of the film. The parallel between theatrical episodes and the film itself is puzzling: it seems that the scene has become a heroin outlet. If all American films could only be of such high quality, touching on human relationships at the level of adults, not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings ... One of the best dramas. 10/10
