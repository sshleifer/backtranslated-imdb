Representing Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a cute film, but in my opinion it could be better. Judy Garland, as always, is gorgeous, but some of the scenes in the film seem out of place, and the romance between her and Van Heflin develops too fast. <br /> <br /> I mean, once he is ready to beat her ass, but the next minute he falls in love with her. I believe that this performance, film editing and screenplay (even though the photo was great, the scenery was good and the costumes beautiful) could have been a little better. It seems that the production was too hasty. <br /> <br /> The cast was also good, especially little Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter, Rosie. She is 11 years old looks very cute, and it is a pity that she has not turned into a young comic actress. She is much better in this film than in her previous Warner Brothers films in the late 1930s (with the exception of the 1938 Broadway Musketeers, she is really good at it) when they tried to turn it into a Shirley Temple / Sybil hybrid of Jason. In general, this film could have been better, but in the end Judy gave her everything.
