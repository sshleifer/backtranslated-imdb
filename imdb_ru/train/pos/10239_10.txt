I do not agree with those who did not like this film. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie when I was small, and so far. It is cute, funny and warms your heart. And this proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> And although he didnâ€™t have a special story, it was still wonderful, I raised 10 and two thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and this proves that your most cherished wishes and dreams can come true. (Tear, tear) <br /> <br /> I like this film, personally, if someone says that it sucks, I will say: "Shame on you." Because it was an amazing little movie, and I'm glad that at least some people liked it.
