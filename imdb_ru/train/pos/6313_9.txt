Cosimo (Luis Gusman) is told in prison about the theft committed. Since he is behind bars and cannot do it himself, he must leave it to his little girl Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson). Soon, five guys organize a crime - five guys with very little mental potential. The brothers Anthony and Joe Russo are directors of “Welcome to Collinwood” (2002). This is a criminal comedy, which is often very funny. You can't stop laughing when things go wrong with these guys. actors playing these characters. William H. Macy plays Riley. Isaiah Washington - Leon. Sam Rockwell - Feather. Michael Jeter - Toto. Andy Davoli - Basil. Gabrielle Union plays her love interest Michelle. (also producer) plays Jerzy, a tattooed guy in a wheelchair. This is a very interesting movie. I will definitely recommend it.
