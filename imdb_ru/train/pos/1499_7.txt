For fans of the hammer horror films of the 1970s, this film should be a pleasure. The only thing I didnâ€™t like about the film was that Peter Cushing was wasted in the worst episode. In general, however, this is a solid, creepy little movie. If this is not Amicus best film, this is definitely one of them. The best episode, by right, saved for the last, is the scene with the participation of John Pertwee as an actor in a horror film - it is really great. No matter how good Pertwi was in this role, it is hard to believe that he did not act in such films. In general, this is an interesting film that scared me to death, and which still gives me goosebumps to this day.
