I say that the domino principle is an extremely underrated film. Anyone who took the time to explore our modern conspiracy history, jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and many others, can only conclude that the author of the domino I really knew what I was talking about. Tucker could be Lee Harvey Oswald, or James Earl Ray, or Sirhan Sirhan, or Arthur Bremer, perhaps even John Hinckley or Timothy McVey. in fact, this is not fiction, but an ominous part of our confused existential history. Help us, but the domino principle is more a fact than a fantasy. if it causes a slight loss of sleep, perhaps it should be. Do not take my word for it, explore for yourself.
