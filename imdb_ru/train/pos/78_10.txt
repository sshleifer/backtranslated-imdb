Despite the fact that he has one of the standard “Vengeful Plots”, this film is my favorite of the works of Vincent Price. Gallico has a quality that many horror movie characters lack. When you look at him, you feel him, you feel his disappointment, injustice towards him and encourage him when he goes to revenge, even if he scares you a little with his original fury. As the film continues, his character becomes tragic. He committed his murder, but now he must kill to hide it. And again to hide it. And again ... your stomach is drowning in his soul when he goes down in a spiral, as if his beloved brother turns into a hood. Even if the story of revenge is old, the plot tricks themselves are original - Gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways. It is a pity that it is not available for home.
