A real classic, ten out of ten! Every actor is perfect, the script is a series of disturbing scenes. The scenes in the car and the scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. Interestingly, this film has already been released on DVD, because it needs to be viewed in the widescreen version. I saw this film at the end of the fifties, maybe three or four times, and since then I have never forgotten it. I remember that it was one of the first Warner functions, like cinemas, called the Warnerscope, which gave a very neat cinema. Shelley Winters and Jack Palans deserve an Oscar for their performances. The only thing I can criticize is that I was not sent by someone like, say, Nicholas Ray, to increase his rhythm and tension.
