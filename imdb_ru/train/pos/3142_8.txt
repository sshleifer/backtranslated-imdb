In what is truly a diverse composition, this show impresses with its success at FOX. This is the kind of comedy that grows on you. If you just watch 1 show, you may not like it, but if you watch two or three you will be hooked. <br /> <br /> This is because some jokes fall, and some - depending on how you view them. As usual today, the topics are very mature. Humor is usually also very mature. Often the funniest parts are the parts in which mature themes encounter innocent ones. <br /> <br /> Red (Kurtwood Smith) is a veteran actor who demonstrates the very good unabashed humor in this series. Debra Joe Rupp also plays well in this ensemble. Danny Masterson, Kids' oldest actor, is also very good. Laura Prepon (Donna) looks better on the early shows as a natural redhead (who had the idea to make her blonde?). She often shows a very good talent and comedy time. She looks good without makeup. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best FOX recordings in the sitcom department, and is the most successful live recording ever since she married children.
