Although by today's standards it is not necessarily the so-called “classic” film, it’s still worth seeing. The main reason is that after watching this movie, you get the feeling that you also experienced the countercultural idealism of the 60s, regardless of whether it is good or bad. <br /> <br /> I accidentally saw this film in the English literature class at SUNY Geneseo, and although at first it seems just a meaningless composition of icons from the 1960s, the film is far from simply “assembled”. <br /> <br /> I want to say that if you leave the film, feeling dissatisfied and confused, the film did its job: he conveyed a bleak look to the future that leaves you insecure and angry. Perhaps it was the same feeling that the film tried to explore in his youth, of which he was an example. <br /> <br /> Thus, Zabriskie Point may not tell a very good (or interesting) story, and at the same time its characters can be one-sided and predictable. Nevertheless, he also conveys this kind of rebellious, rebellious desire to get out of existence, which Mark and Daria have to share. Even anti-institution students are as unreliable as the government against which they rebel.
