It is impossible to deny that Ealing's comedies are good, but for me this film stands out as one of the best. <br /> <br /> The main premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London turned out to be part of Burgundy, and not of Great Britain. Then we monitor the lives of the inhabitants in their battle in order to preserve the treasures found after the bombing, and do not let traders into the black market, who soon realize that, being freed from British law, the rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners on their own street due to the fact that the government decided to close the border, we see how they are resisting the system. <br /> <br /> They are forced to ration water and food in the fight for what is right. In fact, the situation is getting worse than it was before everything started, that is the moral. It is when they lose all their food that they think they are beaten and demand surrender, only for all of London to respond to their plight. sending food, a lot of it. Thus, allowing them to continue their struggle. <br /> <br /> This film is the right note everywhere, the acting is great, stand out Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren. It sounds just right, not too sentimental, and the moral of this story does not drive you to the throat. Worth seeing
