The Lady in Question (1999), starring Gene Wilder, is a well-played mysterious drama that reminds me of the old black and white series by Raymond Burr Perry Mason. Both Perry and Cash made me guess to the end. There were many suspects with the motive for the murder, but I had no idea what character it would be. <br /> <br /> Gene Wilder has a special charming wit, even in his facial expressions and vocal inclinations that make him ideal for the part. Fragments of the film, which depicted the actors, played very well. Iâ€™m sure this is an extra challenge for the cast. I am not surprised to see that he made some recordings for the film. Even his singing was a delight. I like him in this role more than his former "stupid" roles, such as "Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka". I hope that A & E will continue this series. They should call it something like A & E Gene Wilder Mysteries. <br /> <br /> Music corresponds to the period. I liked the cool live combo and swing tunes. In the beginning, I was a little unclear whether we saw the memories or whether the action took place at that time period. And I do not agree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary to execute the script. For me, it is always a distraction. <br /> <br /> In general, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this second in a well-thought-out start, which we hope will be much different - like one of our favorites: Raymond Berry Perry Mason.
