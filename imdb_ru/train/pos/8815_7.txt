This collection of eleven short stories in one film is a great idea that presents some great stories and some disappointing surprises. Based on the tragic event of September 11, 2001 in the United States of America, eleven directors were invited to talk about their American tragedy. The result of most of them is not only individual sympathy for the American people, but mainly the world’s intolerance towards different cultures and people. <br /> <br /> Ken Loach (Great Britain) represents the best segment, about September 11, 1973 in Chile, when the democratic government of Salvador Allende was destroyed by the dictator Augusto Pinochet with US support. <br /> <br /> Other excellent segments are owned by Yousef Shahin (Egypt), a demonstration of world intolerance and the number of victims committed by US governments in different countries throughout modern history; and Mira Nair (India), showing a true story of injustice and prejudice against a Pakistani family, whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in the United States when he really was a hero. <br /> <br /> Some fragments are beautiful: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows innocent Afghan refugee children preparing a harmless shelter from bombs, while their teacher tries to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world; Romantic Claude Lelouch (France) tells about the life of a couple in New York near the WTC; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia and Herzegovina) shows the consequences of their war in a small place and the lonely protest of widows; Sean Penn is very poetic, showing that life goes on; and the story of Shohei Imamura is probably the most impressive, showing that there is no holy war, but there is sadness and shame. <br /> <br /> The Idrissa Kvedraogo (Birkin Faso) segment is very naive, but it represents the terrible bad conditions of this African nation. <br /> <br /> The Amos Gital segment (Israel) is very boring and manipulative, showing more violence and terrorism. <br /> <br /> Alejandro González Inarritu's segment is very disappointing, terrible, without any inspiration and, of course, worse. <br /> <br /> My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “September 11” (“September 11”)
