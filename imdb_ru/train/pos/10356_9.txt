In August 1980, the disappearance of Azariah Chamberlain’s baby and the trial of her parents Lindy and Michael for the alleged murder of a child caused an uproar in a country that was very angry at the time. The media and the public have already tried the accused couple and accused her of bloodshed. This was followed by a gross error of justice. <br /> <br /> Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that while camping near Ayers Rock, central Australia, the dingo took their ten-year-old daughter from their tents when they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area. No one believed them. Lindy was charged with the murder of her child, and Michael as an accomplice. The whole country was covered in the whisper of ritual murder. The trial of Chamberlain ended before it began. <br /> <br /> Lindy never proved her innocence, so she was found guilty. There was never enough evidence to convict her, but the jury was subject to the influence of the public and the media. How can we, as a nation, judge? Where are we from, how can we assume to know? If there was no absolute evidence and no reasonable doubt, Chamberlain should have been justified. <br /> <br /> The Fred Shepizi film unconditionally and sincerely supports the argument of the novel by John Bryson that the Chamberlain were absolutely innocent of the film. the charges against them. That fateful evening in Ayers Rock, this dingo actually captured baby Azariah. <br /> <br /> Chips brilliantly captured the mood of the blood-thirsty nation, filled with hellish thirst to expose the truth. He shows Australia in a rather disappointing light as people who were completely obsessed with paying Chamberlain! His script, written in collaboration with Robert Caswell, energetically arouses emotions and will surely arouse in the audience sadness and anger over the parody of justice that occurred. <br /> <br /> Outstanding Meryl Streep gives an incredible idea, because the Woman is accused of the most terrible acts. She most convincingly brings to life a strong little Australian who was ready to resist the charges and put the world in order. Even her emphasis is almost, but not quite, in place. Very good effort to master this profession. Sam Neill is no worse than a Stripe than Michael, who at first is faithful but disappointed, who cannot understand why their world is falling apart, and he begins to doubt his Christianity. His, like the Strip, is a manifestation of a huge emotional force that deeply touches you. The entire cast is also great, with some of Australia’s top actors and actresses participating. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is also great, and photo director Jan Baker shoots this great land with magnificence (especially Rock). Editor Jill Bilkok holds the entire film tense and very emotionally charged, while Bruce Smeaton provides a convincing assessment. <br /> <br /> For all Australians, this is a must-see if you look with a shocking look in the mirror, to which we, as a country, turned to a family that simply wanted justice to serve, and the truth was known. As Michael Chamberlain said: “I don’t think that someone really understands what innocence means to ..... for innocent people.” <br /> <br /> Saturday, May 20, 1995 - Video <br /> <br /> Even after reviewing the story of Fred Shepissi about a parody of justice that befell the Chamberlain who lost little Azaria in Ayres rock in 1980 , still emotionally strong and honest. <br /> <br /> Shepisi and Robert Caswell experienced John Bryson’s romance on the screen, telling with horror the simple horrible vacation story that had become terribly wrong for Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, whose newborn daughter Azariah was taken from a family dingo tent literally a few minutes after it was laid. <br /> <br /> Against the background of media speculation and vicious public rumors, Lindy was charged with the murder of her child, and Michael was accused of complicity after the fact. What followed was just a lawsuit on the part of the media, and since the Australian people decided that it would be suspended, Lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor, although the prosecution could not provide any reason and only circumstantial evidence. <br /> Meryl Streep is in great shape because the accused woman who is fighting with Australia is going to prove her innocence. She is truly amazing, and the only thing that lets her down is a true blue Australian accent, although she tries her best to sound like a tamer. You may wonder why the best Australian actress was not played in this role, but the star power is probably the answer. Next to Meryl is the equally impressive Sam Neill, an eminent husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes, while he feels himself powerless to do anything about it. A strong Australian cast provides irresistible support. <br /> <br /> Editing by Jill Bilcock is very timely, Jan Baker's cinematography on rock and other harsh places is visually brilliant, and Bruce Smiton’s music is perfect for this piece. This is really necessary for all bona fide Australians. <br /> <br /> Sunday June 15, 1996 - Video
