A good film about martial arts. The fighting scenes were good. Michelle Kissy did a good job shooting his first film without Van Damme. The story worked without obscene language and excess blood. Writer Jeanette Francesca has a good line in history that works. It would be great to see something else from her in the same genre. She likes art and has strong women. THIS was definitely worth a look. I recommend the movie to all lovers of drama and martial arts.
