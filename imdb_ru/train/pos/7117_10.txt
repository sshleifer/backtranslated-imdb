This movie is a fantastic movie. Everything, in my opinion, was at the highest level from acting to directing. I know that Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s, but most of his other films are on video, if not on DVD. Then why not this one? My friend recorded it on TCM for me, but it would be great to burn it to DVD. With regard to particular features, they might say that the marines historian speaks of a battle, and if Mr. Schmid’s wife or son is still alive, they can also be interrogated. In any case, this is a great movie and I highly recommend it. If it is ever released, I hope it will not be painted. The coloring in my opinion would just ruin the whole effect of the film. The scene of the battle was quite realistic when watching a 1945 film. Mr. Garfield did a fine job with the image of Schmid. Some actors may have been tempted to replay Mr. Schmid’s disability part, but I feel that he got it right. I sincerely hope that someday they will release this film on DVD as a tribute to the courage of Al Schmid and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in World War II.
