The highlights of this feature are 1917. The clan's pride tells the story of a young girl who becomes the leader of the clan after the death of her father. On one of the islands off the coast of Scotland, villagers live the simple life of "fishermen". My copy is very dark and sometimes difficult to read, but the film boasts stunning seascapes, and great boat work. Maurice Turner shot Pickford in this nice movie. Pickford was already the main star in 1917, and this film seems to have been written only for her: a brave young woman defeated unhappiness. The Pickford Whip, weaving lazy countrymen to the church, is very funny. And the last scenes on the sinking ship are very well done. Not the best movie in Pickford, but still worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is a love interest, and he is good as a healthy island guy. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers, but I couldn't see her. My copy interleaves many bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells ring. Very effective.
