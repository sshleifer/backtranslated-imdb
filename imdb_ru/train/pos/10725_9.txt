Space Camp is a pretty decent movie. The plot is predictable, but the actors do well with their work, and special effects are worthy of that time. <br /> <br /> This film was originally released during the catastrophe on the canoe, and it really bothered about how popular it was. <br /> <br /> The scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply amazing ... on the big screen, that is ... on the TV ... it looks just average. I remember this scene in the theater. It made you feel that you were really there. <br /> <br /> It would be a good movie to watch on IMAX, but Iâ€™m sure this will never happen.
