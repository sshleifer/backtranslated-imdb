"California" was released in 1993, as 3 of the 4 main characters grew and reached the level of fame they now possess in 2006. This is a good psycho-thriller, which should appeal to all fans of David Duchovny because of his dry and clever narration, which find their place in his work, as in most of his episodes of The X-Files, Playing God shoe. " <br /> <br /> People who were pushed aside by Brad Pittâ€™s heavy southern accent and Juliette Lewis heroes obviously never spent much time in the south. For each "Brian and Carrie" in the south there is "Adele and Early", and in 2006 this is a real horror of this film. <br /> <br /> Besides this, I think the film was written with the intention of a cult film - as with a photograph of Carrie, it is not suitable for mass consumption. But if you have a copy of this in your personal library, I think it speaks of your taste for fancy movies.
