The first thing you encounter when you study fascism is ostracism: since this “philosophy” is a fake, scapegoats must be used to evaluate “thought”. Etto Scolo's film, probably his masterpiece, focuses on outcasts, scapegoats mode. <br /> <br /> From the historical event (Hitler and Mussolini alliance) we see almost nothing: some kind of military march, some garlands, some scattered voices ... Our two heroes are not invited to the celebration of masculinity. “Genius is essentially male”: this is the golden rule of Antonietta (never the best Sophia Loren) embroidered on her pillow, Antonietta, whose world is equal to her kitchen, whose pride is her children. At the beginning of the film, she became a victim of this hypermacho world, but she is not aware of this. She thinks she should be happy. Gabriel, on the contrary, is politically aware, he knows about cancer, which inexorably destroys his country. But as a gay man, he will not be arrested. <br /> <br /> Forgetting about everything that happens between them, they realize that they have in common, and make love. This is an act of rebellion, especially for Antonietta, whose ethics should prohibit such things. Becoming an adulteress in a country where politics and religion come together to suppress women, as always, leads her to some political awareness. One of the latest pictures shows that she is listening to news on the radio. <br /> <br /> Expect the unexpected and, possibly, the teaching that is denied If a person, his close personality, sees that his days are numbered.
