I love this film. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed. <br /> <br /> It’s true that Frank Sinatra cannot sing so much in this film, but it's also nice that this is not just another Frank Sinatra film. where for the most part he sings. <br /> <br /> I really thought it was better to use Marlon Brando’s own voice, as he has the right voice, and I couldn’t see someone with such a great voice that evokes a gangster feeling. his voices. <br /> <br /> Stubby Kaye "Sid Down, You Rockin 'the Boat" is an easy song that I just love. With his version it is difficult for him to follow, and I still love him. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is just great in this piece, and Adelaide's Lament is my favorite of her songs. <br /> <br /> I really thought Gene Simmons was perfect for this part. Perhaps I would not consider her first, but after seeing her in the role, it made sense. <br /> <br /> Michael Kidd’s choreography is timeless. If it was delivered in 2008, I would not change anything. <br /> <br /> I found that many times something was lost from the stage version to the film version, but it retained the sensation of the scene, although it was on film. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was well shot. I have performed in regional versions of this, and this is one of my favorites of that period.
