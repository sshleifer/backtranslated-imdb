Sammo should have 10 out of 10 for this film, since it has everything. Great story, great fights, great characters and great cameos. <br /> <br /> In this film, Dick Wei plays with Billy Chow and Chong Fat. Sammo plays Lau Kar Leung in a casino, Sammo loses the fight, but what a fight, he is full of high tempo action and comedy elements. <br /> <br /> Some wonderful and touching moments in the film, Lam ching ying pops up in a cameo and they kill him - gutting. <br /> <br /> At the end you will reach the rewind button, as this is one of the best end fights I've ever seen. Sammo takes a lot of guys and ends up growing up to Billy Chow.
