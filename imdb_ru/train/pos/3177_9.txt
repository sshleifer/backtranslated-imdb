Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. I didn't like anything in this movie. Cross Eyed was beautifully shot. Adam does a great job, developing not only the main, but also secondary characters. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed gives hope to every low-budget film. That you do not need to spend a lot to create something worth seeing. There is something that everyone likes. If you had a terrible roommate. if you ever picked a dork in high school. if you ever parked anywhere in the city. if you have a sense of humor at all, you will love this movie. This is a type of film that will appear over time and will eventually reappear once Adam makes a bigger name for himself. I look forward to future projects of Adam.
