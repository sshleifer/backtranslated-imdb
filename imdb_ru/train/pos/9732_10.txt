How to lose friends and strangers was published in 2008. He was bombed at the box office of the United States. This is an absolutely funny movie with a great cast. Simon Pegg superbly plays Sidney Young, who wrote the book How to lose friends and alienate people. I know this is not a true story. The only way I know is that Sydney wants to go out with an actress named Sophie Mace. Sophie Maes doesn't exist, but beyond that, the film can be real. Losing friends and strangers is probably the funniest movie of 2008, and I think you should definitely see it. As I said earlier, the film has a fantastic cast, including: Kirsten Dunst (Spiderman, The Virgin Suicides) Danny Houston (“Number 23”, “30 Days of Night”) Gillian Anderson (“The X-Files”) Megan Fox (“Transformers”, “Confession of the Teenage Drama Queen”) Jeff Bridges (Big Lebowski, Disappearing) In general, how to lose friends and alienated people is fun. I think Simon Pegg and Kirsten Dunst work well together, and I think you should see it. Although there is some strange nudity, including trans-sexuality, this is a fun and awesome comedy. One of the best in the performance of Simon Pegg. <br /> <br /> Story: Sidney Young, a journalist from England, goes to New York to work for Sharp magazines. There he meets an actress named Sophie Mace and tries to sleep with her earlier than his boss.
