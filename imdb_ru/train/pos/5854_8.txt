This game is fun, and there is a story in it that you can actually see in the comics. Spiderman was created by a mysterious impostor. The city is flooded with strange gas, and symbiotes, similar to the symbols of Yad and Carnage, appear throughout the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could this be Doc Ok? Well, he seems to have turned the new sheet. The poison also does not seem to be involved, as it is only noted that Spider-Man apparently cost him a pretty good photo opportunity. Well, cameos from other heroes and many villains, later Spidey will solve the mystery. Fighting is basic, not hard to raise, fighting with bosses is pretty fun. You get the opportunity to collect comics, you are running out of web, and itâ€™s quite fun to travel around the city. However, this is also a weak point. The span is not as large as all you do is hovering around the city, since Spider-Man appears to be sticking its web to the sky. You also do not have much maneuverability, especially compared to, say, the video game Spider-man 2. Nevertheless, this compensates for a rather poor interaction with other elements, especially with the story. So get ready to see Scorpio, Rhinoceros, Poison, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus and Carnage in one wild action trip.
