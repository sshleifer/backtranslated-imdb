{Spoilers are possible ... you were warned.} <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite musicals and films! (The other is Damn, Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston). As we all know, sometimes the brilliance (not to mention the songs) of a show is lost when moving from scene to screen. It is, for the most part, DEFINITELY not here. <br /> <br /> The sets are divine, bright and colorful, the characters are bigger than life, and you can't help but love them, and Michael Kidds Choreography is absolutely amazing. (It’s so nice to know that they used the original Broadway choreographer) <br /> <br /> All the actors “bounce off the ball” (i.e., have unsurpassed chemistry) to perfection in this film. Frank and Marlon are absolutely plausible as the owner of New York’s oldest permanently floating crap game and the most notorious player who stakes on even the smallest things, such as raising the temperature to 104 if he doesn’t accept. penicillin. Sweet, fresh Gene Simmons is perfect for the role of Sarah (although her singing pipes are not as outstanding as Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzmán) - a missionary doll with a golden heart and a desire to cure everything. Last, but not least (on my list anyway), Miss Vivian Blaine, who plays a role on Broadway in the role of Miss Adelaide, is a Hot Box soloist and dancer who would like to finalize her 14-year engagement with Nathan herself. Psychosomatic herself the cold he gave her. <br /> <br /> First, thanks to Stubby Kaye and BS Pulley, as they repeat their roles on Broadway as Perfectly Beautiful Johnson and Benny Southstreet. There have never been two more attractive players than these guys. <br /> <br /> Brando is great as usual, and although he doesn’t have the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher, you forgot about it - he has such a sense of determination to bring everything he can to his role as Heavenly Masterson. "Good luck, lady" gives me a chill every time I see him play the number. It is especially nice to hear him say: "Dad ... I have a cider in my ear." <br /> <br /> Simmons is charming and pleasant in a role that suits her appearance, voice and how she behaves well. You are so eagerly waiting for her not only to conquer Sky (or, ultimately, believe him), but also help people overcome their gambling, drinking and other sins and live with God. Her performance of “If I Were a Call” is great, if not more! <br /> <br /> Sinatra is a man. He is so perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit - and here he sings the parts that Sam Levine of the Broadway cast could never have (a terrific actor, but the guy was deaf ... go figure). I really liked the addition of the song "Adelaide" ... I wish some guy sang to me like that. Frankie's cool, dexterous behavior is beyond the scope of this film. But most importantly, you want him to marry Adelaide. <br /> <br /> And speaking of Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is just perfect in this role. From the accent to her singing "Lament of Adelaide", she is simply amazing. And she is also my favorite part of the whole movie. She really makes you feel Adelaide ... especially when she cries right in front of this, and then again during Sue Me. I still haven't decided if I like "Pet Me Poppa" better than "Bushel and a Peck" ... maybe I like them equally. In any case, she copes with these issues, as well as with "Take your mink." (I’m sad that they missed the "hollanderize" from the movie ...) It is absolutely MIRACLE, not to mention fun, and my favorite part of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this movie is their jargon. This is a mixture of high-end and street slang. They never use “This,” “I,” or “This.” It is always "It", "I will" and "It is so." In general, Guys & Dolls are one of my favorite movies and musicals of all time, and each time it turns on, you should spend time watching. My only complaint? No "Marry a man today." Now this is a good song.
