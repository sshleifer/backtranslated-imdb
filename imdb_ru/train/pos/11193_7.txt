I kind of liked the Lonely Lady. Give Pia a break. She looks great and has really good eyes. What don't you like? The scene where she was raped by Ray Liotta with a garden hose was rough and brutal. In fact, much of what is happening in this film is rude and cruel. But this is a disgusting movie. Many trashy movies are not all bad. I liked it more than in the Valley of the Dolls, which was not only dirty, but also boring. At least it was not boring. <br /> <br /> Pia is often exposed and looks like a writer. Watching her talk about Pushkin and Byron with a guy three times her age is incredible. I am sure that Pia is a good person in real life, she simply does not project the spirit of the writer. She looked much happier when she worked as the hostess of this Saturday fever guy and wore a brilliant disco dress. <br /> <br /> A couple of funny scenes. The one where she tells the actor-double that she is pregnant, and he rolls his eyes and looks back at her to "stop hanging around!", At the same time he almost caresses all jumpers jumping past. <br /> <br /> Pia's nervous breakdown scene is good. It was probably a mistake to wear such a supernova (a whirlwind of floating faces and a freeze-frame cry â€” whoo!), And her subsequent catatonic stupor overdid in part. <br /> <br /> Reception speech - scream, though. I want to see someone deliver this speech in a drama class. <br /> <br /> But again, this is the garbage we are talking about. You can find the worst on any movie of the week in the eighties.
