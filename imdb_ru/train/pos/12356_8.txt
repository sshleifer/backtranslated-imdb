Contrary to some people's resumes, the women in the film are not a geisha. They are Oirani (prostitutes) living outside the most famous pleasure areas, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a large number of Tokugawa women. I cannot say that the stories were particularly instructive, but their charm lies in how typical they are. Themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I really liked the artistic direction and acting skills. I felt like I was getting a glimpse of time and a place that I could never see otherwise. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main Oyran, were thrilled to watch. I would recommend this film to people who want to try Japanese culture, or those who like quiet and emotional stories. This is a great example of both.
