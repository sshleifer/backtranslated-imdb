The key to joy and beauty, pain and sadness of life is our ability to recognize that life is basically what it is, so we don’t constantly struggle with this one irresistible truth. With this we find peace. Elegant in its simplicity, but so difficult for most of us to understand. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director shows us this truth, but allows us to discover it in our own way. This is a beautiful but simple story, more like a fable, which is played very well. Watching actors is more like being in a room with real people than just watching the actors. <br /> <br /> I tried my best to write a review of this wonderful film so that others were motivated to see it. I'm at a loss. The story of men in the bath. Sounds like a real switch, right? But nothing could be further from the truth. The American name for this film is “Shower”, but this is almost the complete opposite of the main thematic element of this film - “Bath”. I'm still at a loss. A story about a story or characters does not bring them proper. <br /> <br /> So I’ll just tell you how I enjoyed watching this movie and how touching and exciting this experience was. I was also quite entertained. I deeply cared about the characters and deeply cared about what happened to them. For any story, this is the highest form of praise. <br /> <br /> If films like the King of Masks or Not One Less are touched, be sure to watch Soul. Netflix has it, and the DVD video and sound quality are excellent. I watched it in its original language with well-made and well-located English submarines. <br /> <br />
