A forty-year-old urban explorer / photographer and longtime fan of the original Kolchak: Night Stalker series from early childhood, one aspect that was not really mentioned was the amount of urban research Karl undertook during the series. He always managed to get into one large abandoned sewers or tunnel after another. Armed only with his reliable flashlight (well, thatâ€™s why he had some flashes in the primary monkey episode tunnel) and with his camera, he never wore any other equipment to protect himself or facilitate research. <br /> <br /> Many here, I recently purchased a DVD box from two pilot films and subsequent television episodes, and gradually returned to all the TV shows. And although I remember watching them in the early 70s, when they first went on the air, more than 30 years had passed ... so many of them seem new again and again. Campie, outdated and fun - but charming and very interesting. They just don't do such things these days. Now it's all spewed side effects with predictable characters and plots. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, my 16-year-old daughter sat down to watch these episodes with me and appreciated them (she likes the Genre). This gives me hope and faith that the series will be passed on to new generations of fans for many years.
