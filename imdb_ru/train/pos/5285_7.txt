You might think that a serious excursion awaits you when the premise of the film unfolds mainly between two heroes, when they travel about 3000 miles from France to Saudi Arabia, passing through most of Europe - Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia. Turkey before arriving in the Middle East. But this is not a tour, and there are no stops to dive in the sights. <br /> <br /> Reda’s father is in his twilight years and wants to make a hajj. However, since walking and walking on a mule is out of the question, he decides to go to Mecca by car. He cannot drive, and therefore enlists the help of Reda, to protest against his son, to deliver him there in their broken car. <br /> <br /> But Reda does not see the point in forcing him to go along with him. when his dad could pick a plane. He resents the idea of ​​suspending his personal life because of this pilgrimage, which he could not understand. And, therefore, we went on this difficult journey with father and son, being not best friends. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this film is to see the development of a pair of father and son, the problems they face. the person, the strange people they meet, are forced to descend into different weather conditions and alternate rest stops between motels and sleep in a car. We see an obvious gap between generations, when they try to communicate with each other, the father tries to impose on his son, and the son tries to establish himself as an adult, but the circumstances we see show that Reda is a real fish out of water. Thanks to many meetings, they actually combine quite well, despite their differences. <br /> <br /> It is quite possible that this film will be released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji and be able to watch our main characters join other pilgrims in their Hajj. The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight, and you too will feel claustrophobic and fear when Reda tries to hunt down her father among thousands of people gathered together. The sights of Europe may have been deliberately undisturbed in order to create an anticipation and focus on the final destination. <br /> <br /> This, of course, made you think and tell your relatives how much you appreciate them, who they are. Don't miss it, and yes, book in advance - I was pleasantly surprised that today's session was still a sell-out.
