Four words explain why this film was made - "She did it wrong." The huge commercial success of this Mae West car convinced the studio that Gay 90's melodramas were a viable proposition. Here we are rewarded with a fast, well-written romp that neatly targets the personalities of its stars. <br /> <br /> Wallace Beerie and George Raft are excellent as friendly rivals; Jackie Cooper is a little harder to take, but it's Fay Ray, who steals the film with her girlfriend in distress. With a strong director — as Walsh argues — Ray could carry a lot of blows, and she is perfectly plausible as an object of love and Raft and Take. <br /> <br /> A lot of atmosphere, beautifully designed, this is a forgotten film, worthy of rebirth.
