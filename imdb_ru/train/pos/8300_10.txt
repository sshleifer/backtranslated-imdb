It's no wonder that Blouse later developed a tumor in his sinus, this film is also a bad decision, but I liked it completely. The first 5 minutes are the most boring 5 minutes in any movie; a boring, bad dialogue, and then, with the position of Spider-Man, Buzie screams the worst line in any movie that has ever been created ... "Your worst nightmare loaf!" I coughed a bit of my egg, laughing so hard. This line resonates so well that it even surpasses Clooney's notorious Hi, Freese, I Am Batman line. Other classic moments are that Bucy is constantly upset about people reminding him that he killed his former CIA partner ... what he did by accidentally shooting his chest (this was made possible by a super slow motion which makes the paint look dry seems exciting). There is an ashtray for notching, blows to the face and "it was not my fault, and you know it!" Well, the footage shows that he was missing the bad guy and hit his boyfriend, so ... Other loud cries must be related to the fact that his ex-girlfriend throws a grenade on the ground to escape - a plan that challenges everyone logic, physics and absurdity. Finally, when McBain jumps out of the Thunderblast during an intense guerrilla war and starts running away and throwing a small object, I almost wet myself. Some of the best works by Busey today, rent or buy them today "Buttorn!" My voice is the perfect 10 (on the poo meter).
