This very good movie crackles with tension. The stakes are, of course, high — will the police and the Vidmark, a public health physician, detain criminals who do not know that they are carrying the plague before a full-scale epidemic breaks out? But smaller plot elements put tension on every scene — between Widmark and the captain of the police, between the bad guys played by Palance and Mostel, between Palance and the dying man afflicted by the plague, whom Palance mistakenly thinks that this is a hunt for people because some valuable goods were smuggled between Widmark and his wife, and with the basic question of whether it is better to serve the public, informing them about the danger or hiding the situation in order to avoid a full-scale panic. The film is superbly shot by Kazan, in an unusually well-placed long frame, shot on a film set in New Orleans, and ends with a terrific climax when Palance runs like a rat from his pursuers through the docks and warehouses of the city. The comment is excellent, perhaps the best I've ever heard, it covers cinematography, framing and lighting of the set, production design, selection of non-professional actors in small roles, as well as irony and parallelism in the plot, such as an insightful workshop on cinematographic techniques of the 1950s and cinema noiru in general. Watch it once to enjoy the film itself, and, if you are interested in making the film, a second time with a comment to the training.
