The version I saw in this film was “Blockbuster Rental” with a similar name, but obscene language. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty darn funny. This was also true for the bone. If you have ever spent time in Hollywood or in the vicinity, you will understand the humor. If not, you may not "get it" at all. <br /> <br /> The story of two people in business trying to do this, until they finally reach a critical point, is a rare gem. It says it's a drama, but it's a drama just like “The Deer Hunter” is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Lauren Dean, as always, is a wonderful supporting actor. Jamie Kennedy could feel good about himself. His performance is especially impressive on the poodle stage. The only downside was Carmen Electra, but we can't have everything.
