I shot this movie on the Sundance channel via cable late at night. You can say, "Who loves the sun" is the perfect pastime in history, why not. You can hang out with the trio: Lucas Haas is Will (comes back after the sudden departure of all people many years ago), Molly Parker is Maggie (we learn that she is a very large part of the Bloom family), and Adam Scott is Daniel (he is a friend or an opponent or groom) at the picturesque Lake Falcon in Manitoba, Canada, captured in graphic compositions, combined in bright summer colors with sun rays and shadows. And in the support of the trio, two more members of the family are involved: Wendy Crewson is the mother of Mary Bloom, and R.H. Thomson is the father of Arthur Bloom. Writer-director Matt Bissonnett presented a brilliant unfolding of the storyline and its various connections with tentacles - do not worry, Haas may have a “limp” face, but humor will come when Parker and Scott enter the circle of reunited friends, smile wryly Break and knowing joy move . The dialogues may be brief or even null, but we would get an idea of ​​what is cooking, stunned or surprised. <br /> <br /> Yes, “Who loves the sun” can very well be categorized as sleeping. Chemistry between all five principals guarantees gels and "combustion", giving a vigorous ensemble of ideas. In the end, it's all in the family, and the film certainly does not take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> It seems that the official website is still available on "wholovesthesun.com", and on the soundtrack there is Mac MacCaughan information (Portastatic with guitar melodies and strings) that plays excerpts of the score, as well as backstage stage notes, interviews with the writer-producer-producer Bissonnett about how the film and the concept, casting, and much more. Molly Parker has always appreciated since her uncommon, but fascinating performance in 1996, Lynn Stopkevich “Kiss”, and she is married to Bissonnette, who “wrote the role of Maggie for Molly”.
