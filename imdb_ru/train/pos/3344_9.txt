I went to Fever Pitch with my mom, and I can say that we both liked it. It was not a typical romantic comedy, where someone longs for something else, and blah blah blah ... You did not wait for the first kiss in the climate or how they finally get together. It was more real because you saw them through relationships, and not the whole movie about how they get together. People can actually relate to the film, because it does not seem like unusual circumstances or impossible situations. It was really fun, and I think it was Jimmy Fallon's best performance. All in all ... I definitely recommend it!
