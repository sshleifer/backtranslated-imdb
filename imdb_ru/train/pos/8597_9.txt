I like this movie. I thought it was a great political thriller about something that had never happened before - the Secret Service agent went bankrupt and participated in a plot to kill. Unfortunately, for Michael Douglas "Pete Garrison" they think he is a mole, but he is not. <br /> <br /> He is just a morally corrupt agent dealing with the First Lady! Since he does this, he cannot give an acceptable lie detector test, and this makes him suspect number one when it turns out that there is a conspiracy to kill the president. <br /> <br /> The Garrison is forced to flee, but at the same time it is still trying to do the right thing by defending the president. Douglas copes with this role. I don't always care about the people he plays, but he is a great actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is as good (at least here) as the other SS boss who hunts Douglas until he is convinced that he is telling the truth. When he does this, they work together in the finals to discover and then stop, if they can, the plot. Scammers, by the way, are also interesting. In addition, I have never seen - and, unfortunately, I will never see the first lady, who looks as good as Kim Basinger. <br /> <br /> It’s just a smooth action that entertains from start to finish. Are there holes in it? Of course; there are probably many, and for this reason you see so many critical comments. However, here it is unfairly violated. It’s just not reasonable for geniuses here on this site. My advice: relax, just go for a walk and enjoy all the actions and intrigues. Yes, in the end he gets a little Rambo-isha, but otherwise he gets high marks for entertainment ... that's what movies are about.
