In the concept of a magnificent film that explores the tension that occurs in family life in an idyllic location on the island of Galiano off the coast of British Columbia, “Lotus Eaters” is overshadowed by the fact that it was packed as a television movie reducing itself everywhere, adding fun music to scenes, as if preparing to interrupt advertising. Sorry, really.
