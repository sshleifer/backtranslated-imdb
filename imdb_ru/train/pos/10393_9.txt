Let's talk briefly. I loved every minute of it. Generous fantasy in true Arabic style. There is an evil wizard, a beautiful princess, a genie, and everyone lives happily ever after. Modern Hollywoond does have one or two things to learn from this classic. The only remark: the special effects are outdated (though Sabin loved the foot of the genie!)
