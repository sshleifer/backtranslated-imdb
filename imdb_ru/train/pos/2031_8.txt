Such a masterpiece as the first of these two films about “The Snowy River”, the continuation of “The Man from the Snowy River” is all that is needed to continue. He does not step on the fingers of his predecessor, preferring to leave the legend, which was the first film, alive in some unique immortality. <br /> <br /> “Man from the Snowy River II” is based on the return of Jim Craig to the country of the Snowy River after a three-year absence. The film subtly tells the story of change in the nineteenth century, Australian history, legends and horses. The storyline demonstrates the subtle hues of Hollywood, an aspect that was completely absent from the first film, but it is uniquely combined with a distinct sense of Australian patriotism. The plot is much brighter than the first film, and much more spectacular, with particular aspects of the previous one included in the film, but “The Man from the Snowy River II” has all the essential characteristics of the first film; sensationally beautiful cinematography, the stunning focus of the Australian highland country, the second most impressive video of horses ever filmed, and the fantastic and deeply touching soundtrack of Bruce Rowland, which is in every way equal to the first Jeff Burrows did a great job with this film, and he deserves recognition, especially regarding the quality of the Australian film industry. The main cast, from Tom Barlinson to Sigrid Thornton and the well-replaced Brian Dennehy, plays his roles with the same passion and difference as in the first film. As for the sequels, The Man From Snowy River II is a masterpiece; deeply exciting and inspiring experience again.
