Well, this is not a perfect movie, but I disagree with the general opinion of IMDb that this is really very bad. I watched a lot of Hong Kong films in the 1990s and loved this era very much. I never saw the “Black Mask” at that time and only saw it for the first time last week. In addition to the embarrassingly bad rewriting that my DVD-copy did not allow me to turn off, the film contains raw energy and bravado that permeated Hong Kong films at this time. I still hold onto my weapon, believing that when it comes to action, these guys, regardless of their budget, add an element of magic to the screen: “Bourne Supremacy”, “Casino Royale” or “Mission Impossible” (I do not knock for these films - I just think that they lack the spontaneity of it and I feel that they are too adjusted) to ever be reached. What is it? It seems that the filmmakers experimented when they were filming and filming, not afraid to go into some shortcomings, to learn the lessons the next time. For me, this makes watching movies even more fun and dangerous.
