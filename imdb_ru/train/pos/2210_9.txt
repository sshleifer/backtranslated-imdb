I can't believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He was my favorite show host, hands down. I hate gossip with celebrities, and I don’t like talk shows at all, but when Hal Sparks was taking Talk Soup, he had to watch TV for me. I rarely missed an episode during his run, and was saddened when the guest hosts started pouring in (although most guests still did a good job). <br /> <br /> In any case, for all the people who don’t like Hal Sparks, I think they have never seen special offers for the weekend. These were the hour-long episodes of Talk Soup, which included the best clips of the whole week and were supplemented with comedy sketches. The original bits that Hal Sparks made were fun. In one of them, he was obsessed with a bad comedic demon, and in a scene like an exorcist, his head was spinning as he told dated jokes about the airline's food. One episode was dedicated to teasing over Multiplicity when a group of cloned Hal Sparks continued to breed throughout the episode, overloading the studio. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe it doesn’t sound so funny when I describe them, but all I know is that apart from “The Soup of Talk” the only two other shows that I constantly watched in those The years were “The Simpsons and Late Night” with Conan O'Brien. So if you like the comedy styles of these shows, then you will probably like Talk Soup in the Sparks years. <br /> <br /> However, Henson and Tyler were both great hosts. All three hosts contributed something of their own, but, in my opinion, they were all good comedians. Of course, throughout Tyler’s life and guest stars, my interest in this show began to weaken, but from time to time I catch Soup, the spiritual successor of the show, and, of course, the new owner may occasionally cause rather unexpected laughter. at the time. <br /> <br /> Okay, I spent enough time talking about a TV show that no longer goes on the air and on a channel that I usually despise. Go see something else!
