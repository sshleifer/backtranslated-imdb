... this is a classic with so many great dialogues and scenes that no one should miss. A good story, funny situations connected with wealth - Mel Brooks is a good leader, perhaps not perfect, but he is funny; D Ignore the rating, this is the BS. Look at it, then look at something like the final destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves about the same rating. If you do, I don't think we can be friends XD. At this point, I recommend the fourth season of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" to every Brooks fan;) Vote 10 against ignorant opinions of inch worms! Should I make 10 lines here to leave a comment? I do not want to write a book here: P
