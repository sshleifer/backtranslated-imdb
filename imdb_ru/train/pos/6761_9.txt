The cycle of films Noir Dan Andrews Otto Preminger - one of the (mostly) unsung gems of the genre. Since they do not have paranoia, misogyny or hysteria, they may have seemed out of place at the time, but clear-eye images, a difficult game with personality, masculinity and representation, undermining traditional psychological principles, a rigorous, geometric style — all of this today is strikingly modern and very much like Melville. The clear irony of this film is so loaded, cruel and ironic, that the “happy” ending is one of the most cruel in Hollywood history. Brilliant at the level of entertaining thriller, intense and intense double-edged dialogue.
