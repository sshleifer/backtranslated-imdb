Honestly, when I saw this film a few years ago, I immediately wanted to turn it off. When I sat there for the next 10 minutes or so, I realized that the actor playing Nun had stolen the show. His facial expression and comedic behavior make me shake my head about WHY he was no longer in comedies. He has this thing with Marty Feldman, but MUCH, MUCH more talent ... Nothing takes Marti. The film really shocked me with how close it was to the original jerk, but again, it was MUCH MORE. I really think that if this film were released first, and I saw the film “Steve Martin” 2nd, I would have thought that the 2nd film is cheap plagiarism. I know it sounds like a bold statement, but it's true. I actually really like Steve Martin, but his performance is second only to the actor on The Jerk Too. I would like a copy for my collection. I urge you to see it, if you can find it.
