Fantastic show and unrealized classics; The League of Gentlemen remains one of the greatest modern comedies of recent times. <br /> <br /> With a dark and bizarre style of humor that rises above the tired, formal approach of his subordinate, but, unfortunately, a much more recognized successor. “Little Britain”, “Gentlemen’s League” was really something special during a rather quiet era in British comedy. <br /> <br /> Before her appearance on the stage, there was never anything like the “League of Gentlemen”. At first glance, a seemingly simplified sketch show, the show soon unfolds as a bright, ominous, but incredibly cheerful universe, filled with all sorts of brilliant comedy creations. What really sets the show apart from the competition is his approach to the story of his story. Instead of serving us with newly-hashed sketches that are barely distinguishable from the next, here we see how each person or group of characters goes through different travels and storylines. No visit to them is the same, and every time they offer us a surprise. <br /> <br /> Gradually, for the three series and the Christmas special offer, the fictional city of Royston Vasya rises with a grotesque yet cheerful population. And this is probably the main reason why the show is such a joy to watch (as well as the reason why the series easily deserves more TV shows). Unlike other current shows, such as The Catherine Tate Show or, more importantly, Little Britain, the League knows when the character has completed his course, and he has the opportunity to handle it. Several fan favorites, who could easily be supported to have fun, bowed before the series came to an end, leaving room for other characters to grow bigger, or allow representatives of the newer Royston Vasey to leave their mark. <br /> <br /> Another thing that puts this show above the others is that the writing team approaches the script process with care and intelligence. As mentioned earlier, all four members of the League have common sense when it comes to assessing the longevity of their creations, and when it comes time to call it, it leaves in relation to certain characters. This awareness also meant that the “League of Gentlemen” was undergoing a bold evolution, which is not usually seen in a show of this kind. The narrative and much darker third series is a bold step away from the first two episodes, and this bold League move really pays off. With the third series, they do not urgently need to please the public, and, like the Christmas special occasion, they pursue separate stories with a clear narration, unlike previous episodes based on sketches that (successfully) tie together different sets of sketches into a long storyline series. <br /> <br /> The third series is a refreshing change of style, as well as a real pleasure for fans who have already seen the first two. Despite some divergence of views on the third series, any real fan of the League will appreciate what the third series has to offer, as well as truly enjoy episodes based on characters that only delve into the favorites of the fans, but come together in pairs and unite . Wine characters who previously could not intersect. <br /> <br /> It may take a little effort to change the style, but it is definitely worth it, and in my opinion, the third series is the best and also gives a solid conclusion for the series. <br /> <br /> The show is not without flaws, and sometimes some characters and scenery are inappropriate, but for the most part, brilliant writing, the dark nature of the show and many brilliant characters (which are often too close to real life) make real fun and prove what should be a comedy, and put most of the recent, catchy phrases in motion and often desperate attempts at comedy shame
