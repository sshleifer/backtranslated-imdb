No, it should not be a high-budget brilliance, but in itself it is great. You should take a look at it to see what it is, a low-budget masterpiece with the participation of a zombie rapist who owns a 12-inch love rod, which he does not allow to slap in stride. Those who came to give this film a small overview probably looked for the next cult classic or hidden gem, as they say, and simply did not get to that. I like how everyone points to obvious observations, such as “a child of 5 cents tied to a fish pole,” hahaha, yes. I don’t think that a film with such a budget could afford “good” actors or effects, so they worked with what they had. the guts and entrails were actually very persuasive. the film was a bit choppy, moving from sequence to sequence, but overall, this is one of the best films I have seen lately that does not follow any trend or predictability. very good for a laugh.
