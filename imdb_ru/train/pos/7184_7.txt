I love this show very much, but first I saw the second episode. After watching the first episode, I understood why people were first turned off. The humor of the first episode is not the best, and they struggle to start the series correctly. However, I still love the light and humorous attitude of the show. Characters evolve much more after the episode and become really nice characters. As a first episode, it really does not accurately represent the rest of the show, which is really quite good. The episode is not bad anyway, but as the show evolves, it gets better and better, so watch more episodes before judging the quality of the show.
