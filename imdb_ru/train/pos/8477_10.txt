in a not very common sense of the word. <br /> <br /> This film was one of my favorites in childhood, and I just recently remembered it and thought to search for it. While many of the details are no longer clear in my mind, the general feeling that the film gave me has been with me for many years. <br /> <br /> If parents feel that their children can handle mature and sometimes violent topics, then I highly recommend this film. He taught me a lot about life and death and caused a lot of emotion in me. To this day, he remains one of my favorite films.
