Ree, Sutherland, Demun and von Sidow (in a small role) are all brilliant in their speeches. Sutherland is especially good in such a role where he has to portray a character whose morality is not at first clear to the audience. As is often the case with the heroes of Sutherland, we must ask: “Is he a villain [in this case secondary] or a hero?” <br /> <br /> An intriguing story about incompetence and terrible bureaucracy in the old Soviet Union that hampered the efforts of extremely competent people. As the character of Sutherland ironically notes, "the measure of bureaucracy lies in its ability to make no special exceptions." The “committee meeting” (between the heroes of Rea and Sutherland) after imposing restructuring, with its revelations, has a tremendous emotional impact. You can feel the suffering of the devoted people who worked in this system. <br /> <br /> A handful of dramatic scenes depicting family members of victims adds emotional resonance to the influence of the story. This is rarely a feature of a movie with this disgusting theme, but it reminds us that the victims had lives and were loved. <br /> <br /> This is a sad but very important film that deserves to be shown on Canadian history television.
