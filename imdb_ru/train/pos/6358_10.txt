I love this film, but I can’t understand what I don’t like in this film. People who don't like this film should be Richard Rouper and Roger Ebert. But I can't believe that Mr. Kerry is behind all this makeup. And I am sure that most of the actors and actresses in the film were shot before. And the film has a new face. Taylor Momsen, who plays Cindy Lou Who. When it opens, Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes out of the underground. And delivers a little fun to those in Whoville. Since we know who loves Christmas. While the Grinch does not like Christmas. And even laughs at little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), who is the daughter of the city postmaster (Bill Irwin). Film director Ron Howard. And the voice of the narrator is made by Anthony Hopkins. And Geoffrey Tambor (Muppets from Space) was appointed mayor of Vivilla. Who does not like to talk about the Grinch closer to Christmas.
