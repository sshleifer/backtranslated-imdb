I need to be honest. I watched and enjoyed this show because it was rude, offensive, funny and rude. Yes, a lot of humor for every taste. For example, if you like the humor associated with making fun of people falling from skateboards, you will have a great time. <br /> <br /> Or if you like people who perform extreme stunts badly, you will also have a great time. And if you like scatological humor and extreme situations, oh, you will enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> I like all three kinds of humor that are offered by "Dirty SÃ nchez". I like to laugh a lot with the situations of the show. "Donkey" is like a walk in the park compared to this. So, if you're tired of the typical American Jackass stupidity, try the English extreme stupidity on this show. With all due respect. <br /> <br /> This is a show that does not have a special taste or class. This is not recommended for those who are easily offended or quarreled. <br /> <br /> Now these guys should turn to a psychologist. Especially the Paco character.
