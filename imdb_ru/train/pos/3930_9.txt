It is noteworthy that for the auxiliary players of the "Young Mr. Lincoln" Ford plays less well-known, different from the stars, actors. This not only enhances the attention of his film to the main character of Lincoln, but also gives viewers the opportunity to refresh Lincoln’s understanding as a person of his time and place, a person who, like each of us, is inexorably involved in problems and problems. mood of your time and finding a way to solve them. This is not so much due to the words and actions of Lincoln Linda, but to the reactions of supporting players, which Ford tells the story of the formation of the young Lincoln’s worldview, the sense of place in society and politics, and how people reacted to it. The words and deeds of Mr. Lincoln believed this man, whom they thought deserved respect and attentiveness. <br /> <br /> Try it: instead of focusing on the Henry Foundation, the next time you see "Young" Mr. Lincoln, turn your attention to the supporting characters - I expect you will be richly rewarded with deeper appreciation both Lincoln and Ford. I like to suspect that Ford’s story, through the reactions of supporting characters to Lincoln from the Foundation, may have appealed to David Lin when he sent Omar Sharif to Doctor Zhivago, in which the support characters to Zhivago actually speaks about Zhivago.
