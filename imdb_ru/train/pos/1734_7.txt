I just watched this movie for the first time, and I liked it. Her dances were very interesting. I read somewhere that she got a role in this film because she knew how to dance. The scenery was great too. Yvonne is such a talented and beautiful woman. We laughed at the silly kissing scenes, but this is what is great in old movies! I grew up with her on Munsters, and I like to watch her in her early films. Perhaps they are not all the best, but still worth seeing how she plays and sings. I slowly buy all her films and watch them as they arrive. I have a large collection of her memorabilia.
