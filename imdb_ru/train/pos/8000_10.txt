... do not read the summary of the plot, because in words the plot may seem trite, insane and meaningless. The film is great, the acting of Denzel and Dakota (she will go to heaven, trust me) is incredible, and the plot is amazing. In fact, “fabulous” is a small word for such talented actors. The film is based on real facts, and some characters are not invented, which reinforces the shock that I experienced during and after the film. If you like both the actors and some crazy movies, you have not watched your favorite movie ... Believe me, in the end you will have a strange and inexplicable feeling. The movie is awesome, watch it, rent it, buy it or something else ... just don't miss it.
