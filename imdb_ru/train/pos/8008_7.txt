As far as I know, this show has never been repeated on British television after its initial show in the late 60s - early 70s, and most episodes now, unfortunately, "disappear, presumably erased." <br /> <br /> Series 6 since 1971, however, still exists in its entirety, and I recently got the opportunity to watch it all, the best part of 4 decades. <br /> <br /> After I rushed home from school, Freewheelers was an important preview for me and many others. of my contemporaries in those serene days of flared pants, Slade and chicory. And his repetition caused a nostalgic lump in his throat. <br /> <br /> Never mind the bad / hammy game, unintentionally funny battle scenes, plot holes wide enough for piloting a large ocean yacht and “awful, awful” RADA accents of leading players. <br /> <br /> No - forget it all. Because Freewheelers goes back to the past (I dare say "golden") age of children's television dramas, when the show was just about unbridled fun and did not take themselves so seriously. Before they become obsessed with all the "perversions" that modern scriptwriters worry about their main characters, such as relationships, pregnancy, drugs, STIs, etc. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this is "redone for a modern audience "these days of pervasive political correctness, the boss figure would be a black woman, one of the young male heroes would be Muslim, and the other a white boy bewildered by his sexuality, and the girl is a fan of all actions with IQ off-scale, will forever extract guys from the king in and make them look stupid - in other words, a million miles from the top of the washer respectful Wendy Padberi <br /> <br /> This show is very much "of its time" but is it bad example, I do not think so..?.
