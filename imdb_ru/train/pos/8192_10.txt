This two-part was excellent â€” the best since the series returned. Of course, part of the story was taken from previous films, but the fact that television shows do not do this in our day. We got an amazing science fiction story. The great, big (really scary) monster imprisoned at the base of a deep hole, several superb aliens in The Ood are the best "new" aliens who came up with the animated series, a set of mostly sympathetic and believable human characters expendable "people from the security service in the true style of Star Trek), some large-scale philosophical themes (love, loyalty, faith, etc.), as well as some special effects of the top box. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of it.
