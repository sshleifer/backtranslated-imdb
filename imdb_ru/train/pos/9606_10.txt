It was the best movie I've ever seen about Bulimia. He understood exactly what Bulimia is really about, and how not to be thin and not to go on a diet. This showed how people with bulimia tend to think about things like their outlook on life, friends and themselves. The best line and the part that really shows what the problem with Bulimia is is when Beth says: “It's not you!” This line really talked a lot about the character and others with the same problem. This showed that people with bulimia do not have this problem because of something that is related to someone else. It is associated with them and only with them. This shows that it is time to talk about a person with a problem instead of focusing all attention on himself. This showed that Beth needed to attract attention at this moment, and she needed the attention of her mother at the time most.
