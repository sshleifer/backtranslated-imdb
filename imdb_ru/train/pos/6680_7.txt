It was different, that's for sure. Just look at the cast! Let's talk about weird balls. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were stars, although in this farce about superhero imitators a group of actors almost shared the spotlight. The most outrageous was played by Paul Reuvens from Pee Wee Herman. <br /> <br /> He has a lot of humor, bright colors and no consolations. This is quite an interesting, light comedy, in which there is nothing but silly characters, all of whom want to be heroes a la Superman, Batman, Spiderman, as you call it. They have talents in strange areas, however, the real heroes do not have (and do not want!). It's stupid, but you know what happens. <br /> <br /> This is also a movie that you can watch in installments and do not miss a single sequence. It's a long movie for one so hectic, so rest here and there is fine. The language was manual, so that the children could enjoy it too. In fact, I donâ€™t remember anyone cursing here, except for the guy in the theater next to me, who continued to say: "What a stupid, damn movie." I thought it was fun for two hours, but I'd rather watch it on DVD and take a few breaks.
