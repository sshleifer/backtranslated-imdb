Joseph H. Lewis was one of the best directors of the film noir. This is definitely his best. <br /> <br /> It lacks some of the standard features of what we now call the film noir. Although it is made in America, it is completely in England. He lacks gangsters. He lacks a femme fatale. There is no shortage of crime. <br /> <br /> The title character responds to the ad. She is very happy to make some money as a secretary. Instead, she wakes up a few days later as a pawn in a frightening plot. Only a very strong man could have survived such a terrible anxiety test. And Nina Foch gives the feeling of a strong woman, like Julia. <br /> <br /> Part of the excitement comes from casting against the type: Miss Foch has an elegant manner. She is not a screaming, shrinking victim. She is actually a bit icy and patrician, albeit indifferent. This makes her character's position even more believable. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the most exciting element is the cast of Dame Mae Vitti. She was (and is) probably the most famous thanks to the enchanting title character in Lady Fade. She has a pleasant manner and harmless, slightly vague manner. But here she is not a heroine. <br /> <br /> George McEredy is excellent as her extremely worried son. The whole cast is really great. <br /> <br /> It seems that this famous and brilliant film was shot almost by accident. No doubt the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it with a low budget. In this high and the charm of the film noir, this film noir: it is small, convincingly meager and, in this case, unforgettable.
