The combination of gorgeous black and white photography and the plot "Eugene Onegin with a twist" made it a real knockout for me. The atmosphere, created mostly by very dark frames, contrasted with the sometimes very bright overexposed white, was breathtaking. There was an excellent moment when transparent films were shown - obviously, ordinary holiday pictures, but when the actors' faces revealed the character and situation subtly, but instantly - accompanied by the heartbreaking aria of Lensky from Tchaikovsky's opera Eugene Onegin. <br /> <br /> For me, the hallmark of a good movie is that it must take advantage of the opportunities offered by this tool, which means that the story is often less important than the images and the atmosphere. Last year in Marienbad is a good example of such a film. , Krishana in the same form.
