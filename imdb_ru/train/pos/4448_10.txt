Yesterday I saw this film for the first time and completely liked him. I learn to write on the screen, and I liked how the secondary characters intervened precisely when something crucial / climatic occurred in the scene. <br /> <br /> I thought that the dialogue was very sharp, and the premise of the story is rather shocking - at some point Barbara Stenvik openly flirts with her daughter's boyfriend; And inflaming the passion of her husband, whom she had not seen for ten years; And with the firearm signal “two shots, and then one,” she connects with her old, shaggy Dutchman (the reason she left the city in the first place!) ALL SIMULTANEOUSLY! The moral majority must have been completely angry when they saw this film back in the 50s. <br /> <br /> I love the costumes, the cinematography and the direct connection with the fashionable dialogue - just to see how Barbara Stenvik and Co. play “Bunny” Hug 'is a good enough reason to rent this movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of that period that I have seen in a long time.
