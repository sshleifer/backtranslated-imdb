Diagnostics Murder is one of the few programs that I regularly watch on TV. The way all the main characters have things to do in each of the episodes makes it very unlike today's shows, where they concentrate on 1 or 2 people in the episode, and everyone else moves aside. The work of Mark's brain is also so unclear that you never know what he thinks about, and if you think this is so, you are mistaken. <br /> <br /> Murder Diagnosis affected a wide range of issues, not only in cases, but in each of the personal life characters. Everything from racism and adoption to terrorists and technology. <br /> <br /> As for the elderly? I am 24!! I do not think I can be classified as old. <br /> <br /> I just want to know when they release all 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC) so that I can watch them all in order. They seem to do this with many other programs of the same era, so they can hurry up a bit!
