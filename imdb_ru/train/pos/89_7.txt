To be honest, I had no idea what this film was about when I started it. That's how I watch movies when it is possible. No prejudice. I thought it would be a movie about stoners in the forest or something like that. I was wrong in some way. <br /> <br /> At first Loaded was pretty boring, but as soon as it began to develop, it really hooked me. I know the feeling that I am being dragged into something dangerous when you feel helpless, but do what you don’t want. <br /> <br /> Another user commented on how stupid and implausible this film is, but I allow myself to disagree, Such things happen. Sorry, but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen, and insane situations are "implausible." Really sorry, but the reality of the WORLD is that they really happen. Sometimes everything turns out well, sometimes it’s bad, and that’s life. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
