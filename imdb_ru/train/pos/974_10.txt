One of the directors Miike Takashi is the best. It is so good that it is difficult to express in words. Approximately fifteen years older than the target audience, she fascinated me from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> It recalls similar children's films from the 1980s in the sense that (unlike today) these films were not afraid to frighten - there are many unpleasant details that I first discovered, but I soon realized that this is nothing different from what I grew up on. The film is a collection of conventions on children's films of the 80s. You call it, it is there: a young boy-hero, driven out of his unfortunate / dysfunctional world into another, inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins; the desire to save both worlds from evil power; a beautiful heroine with whom he is in love; a sadistic minion (Go-Go Yubari by Kill Bill Vol. 1); the leading villain who draws his evil power from what everyone in the world can relate to. But all these genre conventions are given a new spin and additional depth. <br /> <br /> One of the IMDb reviews begins "Where was this film when I was a kid?" and this feeling, with which I sincerely agree. Even while watching, I mourned the fact that I did not grow up on it; that it was not a part of my childhood, like the "Labyrinth", the "Masters of the Universe" and, to a much lesser extent, the "Endless Story". These films and others, such as Guni, are remembered, but never copied - Miike mercilessly offers us a new look at things. <br /> <br /> A bad CGI is the main product of many of his films, sometimes due to budgetary constraints, but just as often the artistic choice is the desire to present things in a strange way. Here, CGI is mostly average, solely due to budgetary constraints, but, nevertheless, it does a fantastic job at the spectacle. The effects of computer graphics combined with traditional dolls, animatronics, and truly unusual makeup create a world filled with rich characters (and characteristics) that often borders on the visionary. <br /> <br /> This is one of the greatest kids movies ever made. Not for younger or more sensitive children. <br /> <br /> Just awesome. See for yourself, and if you think your children can handle it / appreciate it, then show it to them. Let them grow up in the Yokai Great War as a small compensation for what you could not.
