With all the violence on television and in the local news, it is very nice to have a show that does not have violence or language for adults, but is still interesting. My children are looking forward to watching with us every week. Each of us has a favorite cook and favorite judges. We all like Elton Brown. We like to learn about the basic ingredients, unique vegetables and seasonings. We play at home to guess who will be the winner. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent entertainment and informational hour. Best of all in our vanity, vanity, this is the hour that the family spends together.
