Hey. I just watched this movie today 14 times in 3 days today. I am a history teacher who has too much time. I need a life I found a film containing a striking resemblance to a broken mountain. I also found myself looking very much like Gene Lafitta, if he was white. In addition, my favorite line in the entire film was from Mr. Petey - “this child can shoot a chipmunk from 300 yards !!” his work, and drumming until his death, as if this drum would end the war in general .... but it will not be well, that's all I would like to say about this film. OH, one more thing .. Bonnie Brown is a crazy physical bipolar mood waving a BEEYOTCH. it's all.
