The film was shot in Movie Flats, not far from Route 395, not far from Lone Pine, California, north of the road to the Whitney portals. You can still find splashes of cement and iron beams plastered over the rocks where the kits were built. And you will recognize this area from any Randolph Scott movie. <br /> <br /> I will not worry about the plot, because I am sure that it is illuminated elsewhere. The film features three athletes - Fairbanks, who probably learned a lot from their father - Grant, an acrobat in his youth - and McLaughlin, a professional boxer from South Africa. All their physical skills are demonstrated. <br /> <br /> Not a single moment from this film should be taken seriously. We are talking about Thugees, a sect in India, whence our English word “bandit” I cannot go through all the bliss of this film, but I should probably note that director George Stevens was an erudite with experience in the films Laurel and Hardy - see his choreography of fighting scenes - and Shane and the Anne Frank diary continued to dissolve in infinitely long . Dynasties rose and fell. Geological epochs came and went, and Liz Taylor and Monty Clift kissed "Place in the Sun." Here, in his comic style, he is superb. <br /> <br /> This is a story about male connections, and it would be easy — too easy — to absorb homoeroticism in it, as many people do with Howard Hawks. Or hate women. But this is not at all the case. Sometimes things depicted on the screen do not deserve special attention to heuristic attention. Men will create bonds by working together like women. (Women share secrets.) Read Deborah Tannen, no one thinks about an anti-feminist. Well, when you think about it, this is what evolution should have done. For most of human history — about nine-tenths — hominids were hunters and gatherers, and men hunted, and women gathered. Hunting is more effective as a team company. The men who were not very good at connections were Darwinians, leaving men who have a lot of team spirit. And Grant, Fairbanks and McLaughlin succeeded. <br /> <br /> Sorry to talk about evolution, but I am an anthropologist and this is an occupational disease. Have I ever told you about a horse in Vaytongi, Samoa, which slipped on cement and fell with me in the bath? You have to watch the hoof. <br /> <br /> Joan Fontaine is beautiful, really. I only met her in the following years and wondered why she starred in many films. I lived in Saratoga, California, where her sister, Olivia De Havilland, grew up and went to a monastic school. A nice place. <br /> <br /> If you miss this adventurous lively flying chronicle of British Empach in full swing, you should never forgive yourself. He is so famous that he is parodied in Peter Sellers’s The Party. Yes, the colonel should know.
