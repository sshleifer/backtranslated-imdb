This film is a must-see movie for everyone. Congress should see this truthful documentary from the point of view of a soldier, like everyone else in America. The previous reviewer completely missed the point - the point is to uncover the truth about how to teach our soldiers to kill people who are NOT terrorists but who simply live in our “enemy”, and what it does to the soldiers. We must support our troops by bringing them home IMMEDIATELY before another person is killed or injured. It also shows that the government is not helping its veterans, those who have been traumatized, with post-traumatic stress disorder or physically, with lost limbs. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
