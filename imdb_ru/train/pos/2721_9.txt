The real story (occurred in Kansas in 1959) of the murders (Perry and Dick, two former prisoners who raided the remote house on a rainy night to steal and kill everyone they met). Richard Brooks directed Capoteâ€™s frightening and disturbing book about the reasons that led these children to crime (Are they natural killers?). The crime scene is very cruel and persecuted due to the lack of feelings and the reasons for what we saw. Awesome black and white cinematography from Conrand Hall, great country road music from Quincy Jones, amazing plays in two main roles from Robert Blake and Scott Wilson and for the first time in the film a sad comment on the death penalty in the last minutes before their death, Jones, Hall and Brooks (as director and script writer of the adapted script) are nominees for the Oscars. Fascinating, superbly directed and frightening, one of the best films of this decade.
