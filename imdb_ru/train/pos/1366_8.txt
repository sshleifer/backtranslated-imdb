Am I the only one who saw the connection between Camus' discussion of the "myth of Sisyphus" and the life of Mary? in the camouflage version, a man is doomed to spend eternity with a giant boulder with which he must roll a hill. unfortunately, every time he reaches the top, the boulder slides off and ends at the bottom to start it. perhaps a buzzard peeped in his eyes, now I'm not sure. In this film, Mary spends her life fighting to collect her life, unfortunately, every time she gets some support, she falls and loses everything. An example is the party that she arranges, where she is intoxicated, insults her lover falafel, and is practically attacked by Lev Shrieber. if you doubt this theory, notice how this scene ends up trying to climb a star flight, while the books fall out of nowhere, hindering its progress, until eventually it falls. the next morning, when she wakes up, she is still on the stairs, never reaching the top.
