<br /> <br /> Arriving on a wagon in New York, an insightful young woman with BABY FACE begins to methodically make her way to the upper floors of power in a large bank. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stenvik is charming as the immoral heroine of this influential drama before Codex. Without a shred of decency or regret, she coolly manipulates the removal or destruction of men who are not fortunate to be in her way. A wonderful actress, Stanvik has the full opportunity to show his vast talents here. <br /> <br /> Having appeared rather late in history, George Brent is a welcome addition since he can deal with Stanvik; his refined style of acting makes a good counterpoint to her icy behavior. Douglas Dumbril, Donald Cook and Henry Kolker depict the continuity of their unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> John Wayne appears for a few scant seconds as an unfortunate admirer of Stanfield's affection. This will be the only time when these two artists will appear together on the screen. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers should recognize Nat Pendleton as a secretive client, and Charles Sellon and Edward Van Sloan - as bank executives - are not exposed. > <br /> The music that sounds on the soundtrack throughout the film and perfectly emphasizes the plot sounds like “Baby Face” (1926) by Benny Davis, Harry Akste and St. Louis Blues' (1914) W.C. Conveniently. <br /> <br /> CHILDREN'S PERSON is a prime example of pre-code prank. In its frank and implacable treatment of sex, this is the film that is intended to eliminate the use of the 1934 Code of Production.
