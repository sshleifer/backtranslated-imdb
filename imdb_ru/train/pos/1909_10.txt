I initially looked at 8 simple rules on the Disney UK channel for the first series, and I was completely hooked. When they no longer showed it, it was annoyed, but then abc 1 satred showing the 2nd series. I did not think that another episode would begin after I read that John Ritter died, but the 2nd episode was not surprising, the last episode returned to its old excellent standard. I hope they will release more shows soon, although I could watch every show a thousand times. Kaley Couco - my favorite character in the role of Bridget, as well as the great Charmed. Rory is also good, he shares my name and Grampa. I will continue to watch him until he ends, and I hope that he will be as funny as before
