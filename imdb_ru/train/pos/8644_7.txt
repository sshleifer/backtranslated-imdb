**** = A masterpiece that will be recorded in books and will never be forgotten <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 = Classic in time; just need to see <br /> <br /> *** = Good, interesting and interesting part <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 = Good movie, but there are irregularities or noticeable flaws <br /> <br /> ** = May still be considered good in areas, but this work has either serious problems or is limited by the inevitable elements that are considered unavoidable (eg, genre) <br /> <br /> * 1/2 = Basically it's a bunch of frivolous moments <br /> <br /> BOMB = Not visible quality <br /> <br /> - California = *** <br /> <br /> - Unclassified (for strong material violently significant oh sexuality and language) <br /> <br /> I was shooting the film, waiting for the celebration of the quality of Brad Pitt in the summer as a blockbuster, but was pleasantly surprised and disappointed. This is actually rather a drama, and very dark ... I remember a few emotionally rich voiceover behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> Pitt is playing his, possibly the sexiest movie with amazing talent. The one who started out as a hopeless but innocent husband of “white trash” realized himself as a cruel, disturbing alcoholic with a mad mind. In some of the final stages of the film, it was difficult for me to continue to watch him - he was unpredictable and scary. It turns out to be a very good script and acting. <br /> <br /> The entire movie is filled with bizarre, sensational scenes that made me hold my breath at least once, and I don’t mean the action movies. I mean the dialogue scenes so brilliantly crafted that I actually started and suffocated from what I saw. It was like watching a rhinoceros and a lion in a cage and how they nibbled each other to death. Again, I am very impressed with the screenwriter (s); whoever they were, they did the impossible: they mixed oil and water. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the performance of Juliette Lewis. This talented young actress so rarely appears nowadays that when she does it is such a joy. Some of her moments in this film brought me to tears. I mean that. The emotions that this girl can cause in your head are incredible, and I clearly remember how I became blurry several times. <br /> <br /> It almost seems to me that I am deceiving the high-quality craftsmanship shown by the filmmakers. Only giving "KALIFORNIA" *** rating. But the dark feelings he evokes are too strong and dull to lift him. I believe everyone should see this movie. I really do.
