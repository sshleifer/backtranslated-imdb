This movie was pretty good. I'm not too big a baseball fan, but this film was made to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc. Danie Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricher Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza and Milton Davis Jr. are represented with many talented actors and an understanding of the sport. The plot was believable and I love the message. William Dear and the guys made a great movie. <br /> <br /> Most sports films revolve around real stories or events, and they often do not work. But this film reaches 10 points on the impeccability scale, although here and there there were several small errors. <br /> <br /> 10/10
