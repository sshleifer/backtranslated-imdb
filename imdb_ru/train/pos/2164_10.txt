We watched this last night and were shocked by the emotional storyline, the excellent development of the character and the good karmic atmosphere emanating from acting and the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Without giving away too much plot This starts with the usual Joe, who goes to the office every day to work and is inspired to take dance lessons. Along the way, the main character and various characters, whom he meets in his desire to be smooth on the dance floor, learn lessons about others and about themselves. <br /> <br /> History has a prologue that dances in Japan symbolize sociologically, so learning to dance in Japan is not as easy as here in the USA. <br /> <br /> Carefree film; You will laugh out loud at some of the spectacles. Yet it is also worthy in a way that is hard to describe. All the characters in the film are taken seriously as they are, and not one is reduced because of their "imperfections." <br /> <br /> I was thinking about taking social dance lessons with some friends. It so happened that a friend lent me a video about how to learn to dance. Is it synchronous or what? I think so, because now I am really interested to try. <br /> <br /> Watch this wonderful family movie (small children may not get it, but teenagers will certainly get it), and smile at the sincere care you see in it over and over. <br /> <br /> Why they would do a remake of Shall We Dance is a mystery, as it is perfect as it is.
