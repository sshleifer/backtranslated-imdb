The film was much better than another reviewer said. This is a good family movie. It has a funny fantasy aspect of some time travel. The story revolves around a 14-year-old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel through time in the old elevator of her apartment building. Of course, no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances. She finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and can help the girl’s family in many ways. She is also able to help her long-term relationship with her father. It reminds me of the film Hallmark, so give it a shot and decide for yourself. It seems that he is more focused on children around 6-12 years old (maybe a little older), and this largely corresponds to PG or G. I am an adult who can appreciate a good “family” film - I think that another reviewer not.
