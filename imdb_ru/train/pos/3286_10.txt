Simply put, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> It starts simply, looks like a study of a rebellious young girl and becomes a wonderful horror movie. <br /> <br /> Don't expect blood or zombies. This is psychological, and just as in the Candyman, Bernard Rose conveys a horror that is not believed. <br /> <br /> Every time you watch this movie, youâ€™ve increasingly understood what is happening and how the two worlds in this movie are connected. <br /> <br /> Drawings have never been worse.
