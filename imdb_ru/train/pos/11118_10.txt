The gangster genre is now a worn item that too often undergoes a parody. In retrospect, the series is the culmination of previous clichés that were used in their genre, and, fortunately, the authors have advanced this shortcoming, creating realism that has been applied to it. Sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates its content with psychological depth, which is characterized by subtle nuance, humor and unpunished violence. The key protagonist Tony Soprano is perceived by his team as a dangerous general, devoid of fear and moral values, but Tony belongs to one person who is bestial, while the other is in conflict with guilt and outrage. Without any prohibitions or contradictions, I still firmly believe that Soprano has the best ensemble of recent memories. Given all this, I could make a detailed statement about the series, but I will not. If there is a visual dictionary in global consumption, look for these definitions of vital, ambiguous, implacable, epic, uncompromising, and the soprano’s ruined face will smile back at you.
