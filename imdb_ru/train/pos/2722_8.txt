This re-creation of the notorious murders of 1959 in Kansas, based on the book Capote, is completely filmed by Brooks and the cinematographer Hall in black and white, which gives a documentary character. There are good performances by Blake and Wilson in the role of the murderers and Forsythe in the role of the policeman who pursues them. The scenes leading to the killings, filmed in their own house, where the crime occurred, with soundtracks with whistling winds, are quite intense and frightening. Brooks is a director with great enthusiasm and uses several interesting transitions between scenes. The only complaint is that it is a bit long, with a denouement and some preaching.
