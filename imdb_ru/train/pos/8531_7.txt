Although sometimes the plot was a bit dull, and VERY hurried at the end, as if the director had exhausted his allotted time and had to hurry and finish the story, on the whole it was pretty good for “Made for wilderness” - Cable-TV genre. <br /> <br /> However, the actress who played the babysitter Mariana Claveno was very good! I hope to see more of her in the movie country. The music was also well done, getting all sorts of chills from rising tensions based on music like dah-DUH-dah-DUH (think "JAWS"). <br /> <br /> I don’t think I would like to see “While the children are sleeping” again, but if I did, I would have focused on the performance of the talented Clavéw.
