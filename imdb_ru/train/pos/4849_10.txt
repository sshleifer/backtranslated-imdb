The ghost train is a treat for those who appreciate the typical humor of the 1940s. This includes the second world war in the plot, but not as much as I originally thought, and the characters are a unique blend that plays its roles quite well. Askey, who plays the role of Tommy Gander, is what will brighten the story for parts that could be portrayed as boring or drag-and-drop. <br /> <br /> The history of the haunted station is actually terrible even for the present day standards. It is unique, and the way the characters communicate with each is fantastic to liven up the mystery, which is the Ghost Train. Gander is basically a nuisance for everyone else, while the rest get along pretty well. He is always in the spotlight and can be called "annoying", but those who do not appreciate the humor of the 1940s. His humor is innocent and childish makes him enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> If it were not for Askey / Gander, than this film would have been shorter in action, pleasure, and the result would not have been so effective in my opinion.
