This is one creepy movie. Creepy, than anything, David Lynch, and it shows what a great director Polanski, because it is not his usual type of work, but DIAMOND. <br /> <br /> It all starts with the fact that Trelkovsky enters an apartment building in Paris. Soon he learns that the previous tenant, a young woman, had committed suicide, and he believes that the other people living there brought her to it. He also believes that they are trying to do the same with him. The result is an amazing and frightening look at paranoia. <br /> <br /> A classic horror is written throughout the performance: from images to music, the viewer can feel how poor Trelkovsky accumulates terror. <br /> <br /> They all want to kill him? Or just driving him crazy? Is there any difference? Find out for yourself. 10/10
