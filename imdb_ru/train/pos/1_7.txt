If you like comedy films for adults, for example, South Park, then this is about the same format about the little adventures of three teenage girls in Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina gave explosive sweets and behaved like bitches, I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also little stories going on with school teachers. There is an idiotic director, Mr. Beep, a nervous math teacher and many others. The composition is also fantastic, Gina Yasher Lenny Henry, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack The Doony Mackichan, Dead Ringers Mark Perry and Nina Conti from Blunder I did not know it was from Canada, but it is very good. Fine!
