Class reunion is a very underrated comedy gem. This is the year 1982 and the 1972 Lizzie Borden High class for a 10-year reunion, among them are the usual stereotypes: handsome, baby, fat, nerd, etc., But former students are waiting for a night grin, one of their classmates is Walter Baloer, a weakling who was subjected to the joke of the comedy by the rest of the class on prom night, and since he has been in an asylum, Walter escapes and now plans to avenge humiliation ,,,, <br /> <br /> Despite the gloomy premise, it really is just a reason for sets of very funny jokes and scenic figures. Saying too much will spoil the movie, but if you liked The Naked Gun and The Plane films, you will like it, and what other movie does the Chuck Berry music cameo? A great comedy that deserves a wider audience.
