This should be a unique twist of two genres that have ever been seen. Genre of the movie "Giant Monster" with the genre of "live mummy." This unique blend creates a unique and compelling story. The castings are outstanding, including TOM BOSLEY, which, as far as I know, has never starred in horror films. The effects are impressive, and the idea of ​​a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is cool. My only complaint is, I just want us to see more of a giant mom, but besides, I think they did a great job. The dialogue, the characters and the story were perfect. The game was great. It should be the best movie coming out of the science fiction channel. You heard me, the best movie from the sci-fi channel. I give the Fallen 9 out of 10.
