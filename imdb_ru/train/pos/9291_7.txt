An interesting look at Japan before opening to the West. John Wayne, as the first Consul of America in Japan, arrives in accordance with the agreements arising from Perryâ€™s canoner diplomacy. He is not welcome. Eventually, Wayne wins his meeting with the shogun after he has put under control a cholera epidemic launched by an American ship. The capital is followed by a colorful procession with gifts for the shogun, including a bottle of old bagwash. The meeting with the shogun, the debate among the Japanese nobility and the killing during the archery exhibition present an interesting look at the policies of that period. In general, quite a nice movie, and, moreover, how often you see how the duke loses the battle to the guy, half his size.
