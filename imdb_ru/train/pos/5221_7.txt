I did not have much interest in watching the Herd. Andrew Lau was one of the directors of the Hellish Cause trilogy, but he was fired from Stud, and was replaced by an emergency director named Nils Muller. I had the feeling that Lau made a good film, but he didn’t satisfy the study, so they fired him and hired another director. This usually does not work (let's remember the Invasion). But Pack turned out to be better than I expected. This is not a great movie, but it is an interesting and entertaining thriller. Character development is very well done, and I could know the characters well. In addition, the relationship between the two main characters are natural and trustworthy. Richard Gere and Claire Danes give a competent presentation. Now let's go to the negative points. One of the elements that really bothered me (there was a moment when it annoyed me) was an excess of tricks with the publication to give the film more “attitude” and style. These tricks seem inappropriate d their presence is arbitrary. Plus, I think the film should have been more ambitious. Despite this, I recommend The Flock as a good thriller. This is not at all memorable, but it is interesting.
