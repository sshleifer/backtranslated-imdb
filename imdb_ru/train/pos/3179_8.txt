Who made this movie? I love this film? Someone has a stupid sense of humor ... <br /> <br /> This Zany, surrealistic style of filmmaking is attractive, but difficult to create - or easy to forget - this substance and characters who really have souls that gives such a depth movie. Without this, comedy is just a bunch of ideas. What's the difference. It may cause laughter, but it passes through you like a half-cooked hamburger ... the next ... <br /> <br /> Cross-country may not be going to change someone's life, but I appreciate the depth and pithiness. They sneak up on you. I started this film by thinking: “Oh, I understood - indie comedy - from the wall - gonzo ... yes.” And this is true - but if you pay attention, there are sub-points and moments of the character that fill it. In this sense, the film breathes. He makes proposals that give pause - if you are ready to see them - and then, of course, he goes on his insanely cheerful way. <br /> <br /> You will miss a moment if you do not sign a contract to suspend faith in the moments of the film. The step between reality and unreality is one of the main features of this film. <br /> <br /> The Cross is not perfect, but smart people have done it. I want more. <br /> <br /> The dining room scene is an absolute catch. <br /> <br /> Put on the seat belt.
