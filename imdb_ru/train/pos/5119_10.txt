I just have to say this is one of my favorite films of all time. I can't even count how many times I've seen it. I was already in love with John Travolta, but the first time when the camera shows his body after he is completely shaved, he looks great on his first trip to Gilly, I was delighted. Debra Winger, as always, copes well with the role of the young, naive wife of Bud, but with the necessary attitude to marriage with a stubborn and hardworking cowboy. If you are not a fan of country music, and I didnâ€™t do it, this is 1 soundtrack in which you will sing along with every word. If you have a chance, watch this movie - it will not disappoint.
