The newcomer made me smile from beginning to end. Dennis Quaid played his part perfectly. The little boy who plays his son was fantastic. He made this father-son film to remember. The messages are good. Follow your dreams. Fail in the chase is fine while you try. The excitement is palpable. I believe this movie will be a classic.
