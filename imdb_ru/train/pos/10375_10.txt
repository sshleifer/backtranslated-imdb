The Australian Rules Player (Mat) is sent from the countryside to the city on the eve of the most important AFL test match, where his cousin must pick up. And then everything goes wrong. <br /> <br /> His cousin was hopelessly entangled in a drug deal in which local moneylender / drug dealer Tini participated (who is everywhere like any gangster, but definitely Australian). Needless to say, Mat is entangled in the chaos, and soon thoughts of tomorrow's match got lost in the depths of his mind when the insane events of the night fell apart. <br /> <br /> Experienced Shakespearean professional from Western Australia Actor Toby Malone plays an excellent role as Matt, a young, naive country boy, and successfully plays a role much younger than his age. Better support comes from John Batchelor as Tiny, as well as the entertaining role of David Ngombujarra as one of the cops after the events. Roll fast, often fun and very useful hour.
