A brief meeting of David Lin (1945), United Kingdom <br /> <br /> Well, when a woman goes to the station, something can happen. And it happened! How she wanted to be there, in a small tavern waiting for the man of her dreams. But she was married ... this man was unfamiliar to a fantasy woman <br /> <br /> 2. Xiao Chen Ji Chun, Fei Mu (1948), China <br /> <br /> Well, when a woman goes to the market There is a lot to think about, the melancholy of her life, her sick husband in self-pity and the lack of a future ... to buy fish, food and medicine, going through the ruins of the ancient wall in a small town the doctor, something happened ... the doctor was a high school honey fantasizing woman <br /> <br /> In both films made by great British directors and China, and a passion for self-restraint was so strong, but in the end did not develop intimate feelings in any physical contact. It leaves you with a strong aftertaste, intensely sniffing, not biting.
