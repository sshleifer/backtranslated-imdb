This show was one of those that I loved when I was a kid. Although I see it now through glasses of nostalgia in pink, I can still say that it was a quality show, very informative, but still funny. I have not seen the original French version, only the Swedish one. I have no idea how good the dubbing was, it was too long to remember. <br /> <br /> The premise of the show was to show you how the body works. I swear the school still hasn't taught me half of what I know from this show. It is also related to other things, such as what happens if you eat junk food and do not play sports, with good examples in the body. Who wants to get another chocolate bar if you know that miniature viral containers can invade you? : D The cartoon looked beautiful, of course, very friendly for children, but done with care. Cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling animated figures that are very similar to how you expect them to look in an animated body. <br /> <br /> This and serials about history (especially the ecological finale) were key parts of my childhood. I'm so happy I found them here.
