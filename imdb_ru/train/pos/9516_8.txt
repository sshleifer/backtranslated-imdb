Tom Hanks, as if you had never seen him before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan's “Angel of Death”. He is an assassin of his surrogate father, John Rooney (Paul Newman), an elderly Irish mafia boss. Sullivan's youngest son (Tyler Hechlin) is witnessing that his father makes a living, and both are soon on the way for seven weeks robbing banks to avenge the murder of Sullivan’s wife and another son. Enter Jude Law as a reporter / photographer who wants to kill Sullivan himself for the opportunity to add dead gangsters to his collection of photos. Filmed beautifully captured drama of the life of the 30s. Sometimes the pace slows down, but then a surge of graphic violence keeps the story alive. Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and connection of a secretive man and his young son. Other famous actors are Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Lee. Hanks is again excellent in a very memorable film. Make room for some Oscars!
