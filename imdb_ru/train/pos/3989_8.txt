“Mother” tells about a mother of two adult children (Reid), recently widowed in the mid-60s, who, following the death of her husband, discovers that she wakes up from sleepwalking because she has an affair with a young carpenter who is married to her lover . The film tells about a quietly passive mother, her uneasy relationship with her adult son and daughter, the silent needs she tries to comfort in bed with her young lover, and the convolutions arising from this. To some extent, the antiseptic drama with thundering psychodrama over, “Mother” copes with realistic solutions of uncomfortable questions, while avoiding causeless sensation. It will be best to play with a more mature audience, perhaps with women who can better sympathize with the central character, its needs and problems. (B +)
