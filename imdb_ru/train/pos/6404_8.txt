When I watched this movie and began to see how his characters develop, I felt that it would be a great picture. When you experience this feeling, and the film truly lives up to those expectations, the experience is rare. I had that feeling throughout the film. Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Junior played exciting and surprisingly strong roles worthy of an Oscar. The supporting cast was just as strong, creating a winning basis for the development of the film. I can say without hesitation, he will not disappoint to see this film.
