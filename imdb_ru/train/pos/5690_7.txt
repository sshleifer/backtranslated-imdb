I just watched this movie on DVD and thought the acting was very good, but overall the story left something to be desired. This film has the same texture and looks like Panic in Needle Park or Cowboy Drugstore. It is hard to believe that people can lead such a lifestyle; in perplexity of a society in which their full existence is based on the cruel use of drugs, crime, violence, sex and the complete lack of self-esteem to anyone or anything, including themselves. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmore is outstanding in his role as “burned out” former porn star John Holmes. The cast is also good. Nevertheless, it is a dark, dark, anxious and depressive film. The murder was cruel, but the daily lives of these people were also cruel. If you are not interested in these murders or were not a “fan” of John Holmes, this is really not a film to watch. If you want to see a documentary drama about murder, then in the 1960s Truman Capote “In Cold Blood” with starring Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are much better.
