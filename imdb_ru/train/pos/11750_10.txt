I saw it in the theater in '86 and fell off a chair, laughing more than once. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Beirut ... he's the best fucking baseball he ever lived." <br /> <br /> You know how this ends, but it has a great time getting there. The training scenes are very funny, but the best scene can be when Jack and Reno try to watch the game “Falcons against the Vikings on Monday night” during a make-up dinner with their wives. <br /> <br /> Williams and Russell seem to have a lot of fun with this, and it’s a great pity that he’s been overlooked as a super comedy.
