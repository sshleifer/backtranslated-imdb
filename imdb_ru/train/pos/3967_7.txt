This is not one of the best Jimmy Stewart films - I quickly recognize that. However, although some consider his film to be pure propaganda, I wonder what is wrong with that? Yes, of course, as in the FBI television show, this is an obvious case where the Bureau is doing some public relations work trying to enlist support. But as the entertainment goes, it does a good job. Plus, surprisingly for the time when it was made, the film focuses more on crimes than on spying and “commies.” Instead, it is an invention of one of the first agents and the career he chose. Now, considering that Jimmy Stewart plays the role of an agent, it’s quite obvious that the acting and scripts were good - because it was a film with a real budget and a studio that wasn’t going to waste a star in the third film. In general, it is worth a look, but not particularly great.
