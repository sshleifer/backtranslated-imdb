I studied Charlotte Bronte’s novel in high school, and it left me a terrific impression. There was a wonderful novel about the struggle of a young woman to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and simple character with a strong mind and will of her own. Her story, which Bronte told with Jane's own eyes, was sad and inspiring. <br /> <br /> As part of our research, we observed the adaptation of this story in 1983, and it struck me. The mini-series not only tried to remain faithful to the original text of Bronte and the essence of the plot, but also the actors who portrayed the characters were simply gorgeous. Both Zela Clark (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover named Rochester) brilliantly captured the essence of their characters. I can not imagine anyone else in their roles. (In other versions of Rochester, in other versions, such as the 2006 version, there is not enough passion, energy and tenderness to accurately depict Rochester. I say that Timothy Dalton wins because he has all these characteristics in his Rochester image. Clark Not only looks like Jane Eyre, but also brilliantly captures Jane's quiet but firm and passionate nature. She keeps her emotions, like Jane from the book, at appropriate moments in the story, but allows her to start a fire in Jane. Passionate scenes. Chemistry ARC and Dalton portray in their scenes together, as trustworthy and faithful devotee of Jane and Rochester's relationship.) In addition, the actor is also ideally suited to their roles, and the decorations match the gothic nature of history. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this version of Bronte’s classic fairy tale. If you have not read the book before, then you can see this work as a sure introduction to this beautiful story.
