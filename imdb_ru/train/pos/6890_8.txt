This was one of the highlights of the second ST: TNG season, before they "grew up" or grew into their own in the third season and beyond. This was not only a showcase for newbies such as Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher, but also a continuation of the search for Data about his “humanity”, this time through the concept of comedy. Still one of my favorite episodes. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I am still disappointed that I cannot pay tribute to the actress, whose character of the window was going to make a date (after the character Teri Hatcher) before being rudely interrupted by Lieutenant Worf. I remember watching this episode “First Launch” at my friends' store at that time, and we all thought she would be the perfect Gene Gray / Marvel Girl. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know who this beauty really is ...
