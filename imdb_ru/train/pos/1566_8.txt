A series of Leslie Charteris novels about the adventures of a slightly shadowed Simon (“The Holy One”) was presented on the screen in the late 1930s, when George Sanders became a Templar. It was a cautious choice - Sanders usually played villains with random "good roles" (ffoliott in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE, the main character in STRANGED CASE OF UNCLE HARRY, "Robert Montgomery's best friend in frame in RAGE IN HEAVEN. Here his willingness to break the rules and break the law for a short time corresponded to his "heavy person", while his appearance and courteous behavior made the templar a suitable dark hero, like Boston Blackie by Chester Morris and (to some extent) Peter Lorre "Mr. Moto. " <br /> <br /> Films are not the best series of mysterious series, but they are intact. As in the Holmes Rathbone TV series or in the Charles Oland TV series, the series often recurred as actors or played new ones (Wendy Barry played the heroine in the second film of the series). This and slightly familiar sets of films make the series a convenient experience for viewers who hear the buzz of dialogue (always showing Sanders' intelligence, staying one step ahead of the bad guys), not noticing the obvious plot flaws. All of these puzzles are flawed due to the fact that even the best authors of the genre cannot avoid repeating old ideas again and again and again. <br /> <br /> Here is the moment when it happened, when one of the actors admitted his affection for Barry, about whom she had long known. Soon after, he tries to protect her from the police. But when the film told about the identity of the criminal mastermind, it became obvious that this man was so noble that he deserved to become a mysterious inspirer (that is, the script disguised him as the least likely suspect). <br /> <Barry - after the proof that her father (who died in prison) was framed by real criminals in a predatory gang. She is assisted by several people — circles such as William Gargan — and she receives advice from her mastermind on planning embarrassing thefts that cannot be entrusted to her. YES. who accused her father (Jerome Cowan) of being determined to get Barry and her gang. The only detective who seems to have a chance to solve the case is Jonathan Hale, who is following Sanders but reluctant to work with him. <br /> <br /> The actors have a few pleasant moments in the script - Hale (currently on a special diet) is tempted to eat a rich lobster dinner prepared for Sanders Willy Best. As a result, he gets a serious upset stomach, which allows Sanders and Barry to escape from Sanders' apartment. It is best to remind him (when he feels better) to go to the place where Sanders told him to go at a certain time. <br /> <br /> Gilbert Emery also plays an interesting role. Usually playing decent people (for example, beaten by her husband in “BETWEEN TWO WORLDS”), he plays a socially significant weakling here, whose death resembles the death of a character from the Bogart film. <br /> <br /> In general, a well-made film for the second half of cinema billing in 1939. He will entertain you, even if he does not remain in your memory.
