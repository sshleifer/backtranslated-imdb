Beautiful film of Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to explore more. The film tells about what we perceive as real and what is real, and how it is so difficult to distinguish them from each other. Beautifully shot and acted, although David Niven does not seem to be 27 years old, as his character claims. It's fun to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This film made me think while I watched it, and then.
