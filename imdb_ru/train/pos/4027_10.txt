Very good adaptation of the novel Amrit Pritam. Urmila and Manoj Badzhpay tried their best. <br /> <br /> There is a natural talent in the film, and I felt it through and through. It looked like Bollywood finally gave away its glamor, and several quality artists appeared on the screen. <br /> <br /> In terms of content, the film very accurately showed what exactly happened during the section, showing the suffering of a certain family, and the show that trust in your life goes beyond religion. <br /> <br /> The best part is that they didnâ€™t turn it into a drama with lots of tears and melodrama. <br /> <br /> I just liked it.
