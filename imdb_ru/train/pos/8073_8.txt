A brilliant portrait of a traitor (Victor McLaglen in the Oscars), pursued by his own conscience. McLaughlin plays the IRA Rouge, who betrays her leader to receive an award during the Shin Fein Irish rebellion. Scenes showing the fights and actions of the mafia are very realistic, focusing on the despair of individual people. The absence of hope for a better future seems fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> Directed by John Ford beautifully creates a dark and tense atmosphere, reinforced by a hazy and dirty image of the Irish landscape. Dramatic music by Max Steiner adds cinematic delight. Oscar Winner is also for the best screenplay nominated for the best picture. This is one of the classic Hollywood films.
