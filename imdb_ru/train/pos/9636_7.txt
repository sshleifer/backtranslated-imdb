The lonely depressed French boy Mathieu (Jeremy Elkaim), resting in the summer, meets and falls in love with Cedric (the gorgeous Stefan Rideau). Silent and slow, this is a very frustrating film. On the one hand, I was absorbed in this and really felt for these two boys. On the other hand, I was annoyed - the film constantly flashes from the past to the present, without any rhyme or reason. It is very confusing and meaningless. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> There are also a lot of holes in the plot - Mathieu, at some point, is doing something that leads him to the hospital. What is it - we were never told! Then he breaks up with Cedric and tells everyone else that he lives with him. What for? We were not told. Then he inexplicably connects with another guy at the end. What for? No explanation. It is clear that Cedric loves Mathieu, and Mathieu lives in the same city, so ... However, this is a tribute to a film that cares about characters so much. Had just been explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim, like Mathieu, is not good. He is tall, handsome and has a good body - but he cannot act. His idea of ​​acting is to sit with an empty expression on his face - all the time. Rideau, on the other hand, is great. He is VERY handsome, has a very beautiful body and a damn actor. He also has incredible sexual magnetism. In the film, there is a full frontal male nude, a lot of kisses and a rather outspoken sex scene, and most of the films shy away from showing love scenes between men and men. This is not the case, and it helps to see how the characters care and feel each other. <br /> <br /> So, a frustrating film, but something worth seeing - especially for Rideau's nude scenes - if you like beautiful nude young people! <br /> <br />
