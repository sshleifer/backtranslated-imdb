I saw this film a few years ago, and I must say that I really love it. Jason Patrick was perfect for the strange role he played. Producer? I don't much about him ... don't care. The script is good, that's for sure. In a nutshell, I have to say about this film, which is strange, strange, even dark, but good. I saw him a few years ago and have never seen him since. I want to see it again and again. I know that I will not get tired of watching him. The scenes, the atmosphere, the actors, the story ... all is well. The film should have lasted longer. I think 120 minutes should have been perfect. I was hoping for part 2 for this movie. It is a pity that this did not happen. Jason Patrick: you're a man! very good movie end. :-)
