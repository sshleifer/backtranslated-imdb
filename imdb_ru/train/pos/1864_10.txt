I just watched Antwone Fisher at BRAVO. What a terrific movie and incredible young man. This film should be watched by anyone who deals with how to overcome child abuse and abandoning it as an adult. Denzel Washington poses a prominent role just like the young man playing Antwone Fisher. Kleenex alert - I feel good and cry. The most heartbreaking moment is when he finally meets his mother, from whom he was taken away at the age of 2 months. And one of the most daring was when he confronted his abusive adoptive mother and sister. I saw this film on Bravo in 2008, and I would like to know about it many years ago. Definitely a movie to add to my DVD collection.
