Wow, I forgot how good this movie is until I stumbled upon it, looking into the garage. This is a kind of strange combination of the biography of Michael Jackson, a collection of musical vignettes and stories about superheroes fighting to save some young children. The vignettes are good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of this film is the superhero segment, in which Michael Jackson turns into a car, a robot, and finally a spaceship (and this is as strange as it sounds). Joe Sands is hilarious, and he has enough cool images and great music to entertain everywhere! <br /> <br /> This pearl is an incredible video "Smooth Criminal", thanks to which the film should be purchased only for this part!
