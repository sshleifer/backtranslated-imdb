In a series filled with brilliant episodes, this one stands out as one of my favorite ones. This is not the deepest episode, there is not much meaning or message. But this is a lot of fun, and there are some great performances. <br /> <br /> But what really makes me stand out is that, as far as I know, this is * the only * episode of the Twilight Zone with * double snapper ending. The zone is justly famous for giving a big surprise at the end of the story. But this time you get a surprise and think that this is so, but it turns out that there is another surprise. I just like it that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other is deeper, more message-oriented).
