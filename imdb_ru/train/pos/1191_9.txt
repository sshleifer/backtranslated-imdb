Robert Taylor as mad bison hunter Charlie Gilson is the main character in this film. In the beginning, I thought that Charlie would eventually redeem himself, like John Wayne in The Seekers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur. But as the movie progresses, Gilson continues to commit atrocities until you realize that there is no hope for him. Stuart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop the hunt, because she understands that there will not be buffalo soon, and he becomes disgusted with the murder. Gilson is a natural killer who makes no distinction between animals and people. Debra Paget as an Indian girl is an amazing character, given the self-censorship of the time. She lies with Gilsson in complete retirement, although she hates him. The last scene of frozen Gilson is unforgettable.
