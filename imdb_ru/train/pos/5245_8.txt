I thought this movie was funny. This is a funny, not taken seriously, film about one person’s distorted views on life, love and ... well, ladies "from a modest bus station to a high-class debutant ... bus station by bus." Tim Meadows is played by a guy (Leon Phelps) who was raised in a Playboy-style mansion with the help of Hugh Hefner-Esquire's father, surrounded by constantly beautiful porn models and actresses. When his “father” expels him to the street, he must learn to protect himself, having only a chauvinistic view of life, which his youth taught him ... this is an incomprehensible, almost mystical level of charm and dull luck. And so begins the hijinks! If you have not seen this movie and you have enjoyed a carefree, insane, comedic / love story, then I strongly recommend renting a “Lady”.
