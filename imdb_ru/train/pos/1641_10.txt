I saw it 25 years ago on PBS. It was very difficult to watch. So believable. Watching this little family fight in the winter was heartbreaking. There is no time for courtship: fate brought us together, and we put our shoulders on a grinding stone and make it work. It was based on the actual diary of a woman I read many years later. In her diary, she said that her parents died when she was little, and all their brothers and sisters had to work on the farm to feed themselves. She learned how to mow, which was not feminine. She was afraid that not a single charming prince would want to have a woman with callused hands burned by the sun, but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to mow, and she was glad to do it. Both were widows, and together they worked to build a new home. It was so sad when the baby died. Of course, if they had it today, Iâ€™m sure it would be nice. This only makes the tragedy very sad. I cried so much. But then they came out and successfully pulled out a new calf. Spring is coming and life goes on. In her diary she had two more boys, and they lived.
