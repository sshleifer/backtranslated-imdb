Since I saw this film in my childhood, more than 30 years ago, I have not gotten tired of watching it. I think it was their best film in recent years: from the first scenes at the horn factory to the car engine running from the back seat to Ollie answering the phone and accidentally pushing it out the window. After that, they moved to 20th Century Fox, and although these films were not terrible, they did not have enough comic time for this film. Jimmy Finnlaison, their longtime hindrance, in his latest appearance with boys appearing as Doctor, super! quote: "I said goat milk," his answer to Stan asking him how you milked the ghost! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin appear! I would say, in general, one of my favorite comedies L & H.
