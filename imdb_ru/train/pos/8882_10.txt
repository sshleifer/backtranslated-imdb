John Singleton's best film, before blockbusters such as The Mines remake, is a thought-provoking film with great acting and an excellent balance between the stories of the 3 main characters, each of which has recognizable young problems. <br /> <br /> What I liked the most is that it also covers the problem of complacency among young blacks, a problem that is largely ignored by the media and other films that focus on social and economic problems and white racism. . This film shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist. <br /> <br /> In this film, the skill lies in the fact that it affects so many topics without becoming superficial. It is not only about racism, but also about how difficult it is to accept a new world (college), date rape, disclosure of sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Christy Swanson each perform well, and the cast is equally interesting with Jennifer Connelly as a yay and with Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes as college asses, causing minor disturbances. <br /> <br /> The only minus is a caricature of Professor Lawrence Fishburne (“Mint?”). Of course, many professors are crazy. But they are not so flat. Skinheads are also a bit caricature, but I think they are the same in real life. <br /> <br /> In general, a great underrated film, if you liked The History of America X, you will like it. . <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10
