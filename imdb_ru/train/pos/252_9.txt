The performances were great, the costumes gave a unique feeling of that period, and, being a Victorian Living Historian, I was impressed by the precision of the weapon and the attention to detail. <br /> <br /> I would not say that you need any knowledge of the Kelly saga to stay in the mainstream of this film, but to understand the events and attitudes of that time you will need some basic historical knowledge. Do not expect that, as some rather stupid people do, any of the characters with the AUZZI accent, as we know it, was a country in infancy at the time. <br /> <br /> Well, the story had some elements of fiction, but they are necessary for a wider audience of the film. Gregor Jordan said in an additional article on DVD that he wanted his film to “arouse interest,” and this is exactly what happened to me, so this film gets a thumbs up here. <br /> <br /> Watch it and you will not regret
