That was great. When I first saw the Japanese version, it was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It was not blood and guts, it was creepy, atmospheric and scary. When in the Japanese version the mother's ghost was leaning against the bed, I almost had a heart attack ... I was worried that the American version would be softened and that Buffy would take away the dark creepy nuances of the original version. I didn't have to worry. The creators of this film wisely kept the same Japanese, who were associated with the original film, and gave the direction of the film to the same person. They also installed it in Japan in the same place, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director tried to remake the same film as the original, the only difference was the casting of American actors. This actually turned into a benefit, as it added the element “Strangers in a foreign country” to the general horror. Not only were they haunted by an absolutely terrifying and implacable ghost, they also stuck in a completely foreign country, having difficulties integrating into society. It only added to the general anxiety built into the film, and I thought it was a great touch. <br /> <br /> Buffy actually does a very good job. She looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well. There is not one clever comment that would be so often seen in American horror films, or any comments that would distract from the total darkness and horror of the characters' situation. In fact, it was as good as the “Ring”, which I also really liked. I hope that the future of American horror more accurately follows the Japanese New Wave of Horror, which began with the incredible success of Ringu. We finally get movies that can actually be categorized as “Horror” !! 8/10
