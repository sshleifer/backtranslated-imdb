El Mar, the director of the Catalan director Agusti Villarona and based on the novel by Bly Bonet, gives an insight into Spanish history through the eyes of a Balearic author who returns the viewer to the times of the civil war in this country. The film tells about three friends, and they follow them from the first days of the war in Mallorca until several years later, when two of these friends met again when they were in a sanatorium, lost in the countryside. <Br /> <br /> At first we meet three boys who play happily. Not everything is as it seems. The tragic death of one of them points to the cruelty of the one who commits the atrocity. The boys forbade the girl, about their age, to participate in their games. <br /> <br /> When we meet Ramallo’s adult again, he goes to a sanatorium. He seems to be suffering from tuberculosis. To his surprise, Manuel Tours, one of his childhood friends, is also being treated, and a young girl who was not invited to participate in their games is now one of the nuns who are monitoring their medical care. It is obvious that the Tour looks at Ramallo so that it only means that he is in love with a tough bully. Their relationship will be devastating. <br /> <br /> Roger Casamagior does an excellent job of portraying the eldest Ramallo. Bruno Bergonzino makes an impression of the Tour, vulnerable youth. Antonia Torrens plays Sora Francis with conviction. Angela Molina, appears as Carmen, the wife of the institution caretaker. Simon Andreu is great as Alcantara. <br /> <br /> “El Mar” is a dark film, which clearly shows the talents of Agusti Villrony, thanks to whom the novel comes to life for the viewer.
