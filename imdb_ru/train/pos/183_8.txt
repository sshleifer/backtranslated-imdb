Exquisite comedy starring Marian Davis (with friendly William Haynes). Young Peggy arrives in Hollywood in search of fame. The performances of the Cameo showcase MGM's “All the Stars in Heaven” on the famous commissioner's scene, as well as many vintage details for filmmaking for the scientist. Peak also captured for posterity the famous viciously sarcastic imitations of the main stars of the day (her Swanson is beautiful!). <br /> <br /> “Peggy” even catches herself meeting the famous star Marian Davis in tennis picks up his nose and comments: “Oh, I don't like her!” <br /> <br /> My imprint was perfect. The plot, directing, acting genuine charm and the need for all the quiet afinado.
