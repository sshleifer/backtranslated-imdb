It amazes me how much I love this movie, despite the fact that I donâ€™t really like dogs. Fox, Field and Ameche do a great job with the voices of Chance, Sassy and Shadow, and the game of the animals themselves is simply amazing. <br /> <br /> I have seen this film 72 times already (I know it sounds scary, but it's true!), and each time the final scenes still turn me on. I highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers. This is really my favorite movie of all time!
