Saw it today with my 8 year old. I thought it was cute. I agree with another poster that it was not the book that I remember, but we still enjoyed it. All the kids are pretty good and generally quite interesting. Billy is a new child who takes on the challenge of a school bully to eat 10 worms a day. If he loses, he must walk down the hall at the school with worms in his pants. The beginning of the film is tuned to show that Billy has a VERY weak stomach, and he pukes on almost everything. Fun is accompanied by a bunch of different ways of cooking worms. A good message about how to resist the bullies and, of course, about the juicy happy end.
