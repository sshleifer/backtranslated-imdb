After being forced to sit with these stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl), I really enjoyed watching “Fried Worms”. This time I did not guess the ending! It was fun and entertaining and did not resort to a ton of rude humor, despite the name. My boys (6 and 10 years old) liked this too - oh, and my 45-year-old "boy" was smiling all the time. This is a family film that is not just tolerated for parents. Relationship with the younger brother is so close to real life. "He doesn't stop singing to piss me off !!" In addition, the way a new child tries to make friends, and how these friendships actually form, are close to how children behave. Of course, parents should be a little stupid, but my favorite scenes were related to the fact that my father got used to his new job. Have fun!
