"Killing college students" - my first acquaintance with the writing work of Edgar Wallace ?? and generally my first real acquaintance with the films "Crimi" in general ?? and I can say that I am moderately impressed. This material is really interesting, although I would never have expected this to be so ?? stupid! The film has a thrilling and pleasantly tangled plot, with a healthy dose of humor, bright twists and rather ingenious killings. Is there some kind of evil mastermind like James Bond ?? who always sits in the shade and in front of a large monitor - recruits prisoners to kill certain girls in a certain college with a new type of poison. There is also a villainous monk with a whip, dressed as a Communist member of the KKK, getting rid of the remaining characters, as overly curious teachers and the like, as well as a strange police commissioner who insists on dealing with a psychological approach. Seriously, if I had known before that these Crimi films were so colorful and crazy, I would have already bought a whole collection of them. The plot of the pretzel actually raises more questions than answers at the end, and the overload of comic tricks to the account of Inspector Scotland Yard Higgins sometimes swallows a little, but I donâ€™t care because it was sublime entertainment. Even the cool 60s soundtrack stayed in my head for a long time. This is an option in Italian Giallo, but with elements of farce.
