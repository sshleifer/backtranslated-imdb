It took me some time to watch this version, because, unfortunately, I can't rent it at the video store, only in a different version, but I fell in love with it. I was always on the verge of another Emma. Gwennet and Tony Collett, since they are not British, naturally, should put an accent, and this does not seem natural to me. It seems worn. Sorry, but do not think that Tony and Gwennet did a brilliant job there. I could not warm up with any of the characters, but this version warms the heart more and looks more like a person whom I imagined as Emma. This is definitely a version to which I will return from now on. I was disappointed that Mr. Knightley did not look better, but he is persuasive. I also prefer Jane Fairfax (played by Olivia Williams). I never warmed her in the film version, but she is better portrayed in this version. If you think about it, (except for Mr. Knightley), all the characters play better and much less. Unfortunately, both came out at about the same time, and the Paltrow version received much publicity. Sorry ...... I also love the new scene at the end. Well done, Kate Beckingsale! So if you're a fan of Jane Austen, don't forget to watch this one.
