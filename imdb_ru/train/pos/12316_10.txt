China Ghost Story Ching Siu Tung and Tsui Hark, in addition to being one of the greatest films in the "Usya" series, is a wonderful and romantic love story, as well as an impressive martial arts choreographic film that should be in the collection every movie lover. Very bored Hong Kong superstar Leslie Cheung plays a traveling tax collector who spends a night in a haunted temple. While in the temple, he meets colorful characters, including the swordsmen Yin (Wu Ma) and Xiao Hou, the Devil's Tree, and the wonderful ghost of Lit-Sin, seen by the beautiful Joey Wong. <br /> In order to free her from the claws of the evil Devil of the Tree, he must reincarnate her body and go to the underworld to defeat an even more powerful demon. <br /> <br /> About a sufficient number of good things you can not say this movie. The pace is perfect, with a great combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and the final with a hectic pace should give you little chance to breathe. The chemistry between the surprisingly tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Chung (whose legendary career ended too early) really allows the viewer to feel them both. Indeed, acting as a whole is so lively and full of life, I would say that this is one of the most fun viewing experiences I've ever had. Much credit goes to Ma in his portrayal of the mysterious Sword Yin. His excessive personality of a disappointed swordsman, prone to defeating evil, leads to some great moments of humor and the traditional HK drama. Magnificent score, magnificent cinematography with stunning colors and insane action films courtesy of Ching Siu Tung complete this wonderful film. Find a copy anywhere. 10/10
