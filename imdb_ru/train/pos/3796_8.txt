Jim Mackay shot one of the best films that you will see throughout the year. The quiet simplicity of this film draws you from the first frame and never lets go. There is not a single false note in the whole film. Not alone. Everything is working. A manual camera is never distracting and should always be what it should be. Three young ladies whose lives we follow are always real. There is not a single blow when viewers are reminded that we are looking at actresses playing a role. just real girls trying to find themselves. The political agenda, hidden or not, is not. This film is inherently, and although only a few viewers are likely to see it, it deserves much wider distribution. Hugh Hefnerâ€™s special hat for giving cinematographers the grant money needed to make this important film. I can't wait to see what Mr. McKay is doing next.
