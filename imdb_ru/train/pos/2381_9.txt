“Classical War of the Worlds” by Timothy Heins is a very fascinating film that obviously tries its best to recreate the classic book of H.G. Wells. Mr. Hines succeeds. I and those who watched his movie with me appreciated the fact that it was not the standard, predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year, for example. Spielberg’s version with Tom Cruise, with only the slightest resemblance to a book. Obviously, everyone is looking for different things in the film. Those who consider themselves “lovers” look only at criticizing everything they can. Others evaluate the film on more important grounds, such as entertainment, so most people never agree with the "critics". We liked the fact that Mr. Haynes devoted himself to being faithful to the classic novel of G. Wells, and we found it very interesting. This made it easy to lose sight of what the “critics” consider to be their shortcomings.
