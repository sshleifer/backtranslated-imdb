This film is not for everyone. You are either smart enough to get "this" or not. Sci-fi fans who don't take themselves too seriously will definitely enjoy this movie. I recommend this movie to those who appreciate parodies and parodies. Anyone I recommended this movie liked. If you like Monty Python or Mel Brooks films, you will probably like this one. Voice characteristics are made in a mocking way, and one-liners fly quickly and violently.
