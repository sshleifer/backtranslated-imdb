How could you say that Peaches, with their complex narration concerning a multitude of problems, is a “little television idea” that I cannot do. In addition, I can recall many films that have a "little television idea." Your obvious dislike for the television industry (“Sue Smith couldn’t rise above her television background”) is confusing. All the more, that you have a great time, working on television. If we could all be as talented as Miss Smith (no, I'm not a friend or relative) - “Bride of Christ”, awarded the AFI award, “Roads from Kurein”, etc. Everything is done for TV. If you think about other “small television ideas” such as “Against the wind”, “Lines of the body”, “Firing”, “Scales of justice”, “Blue murder”, “Water under the bridge”, etc., D., I I think Peaches is a good entertaining film that interested me, as well as most of my friends, from beginning to end. This is far from flawless, but I think this is one of the best Australian films I've seen in the past couple of years. Who knows, with a few more views (which you can think of so much about), it might just be a classic, such as "The Year My Voice Broke", "The Play of Devil". I really liked this movie much more than Flips and Three Dollars. These films, I think, had their moments - surreal, atmospheric, realistic and relevant to important contemporary issues, but as far as pure entertainment for Mr. and Mrs. the average viewer and me, it was very ordinary, if not boring. When I go to the cinema, I always realize the reaction of the audience to the movie (through the reaction of the cinema and occasional conversations in the lobby and toilet). Some came out because Peaches shook their heads, some negatively criticized, but many seemed to like it.
