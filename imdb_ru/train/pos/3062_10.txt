I saw this movie a few months ago by cable and it was fantastic. William H. Macy is one of my favorite actors, and his performance was simply amazing. He makes you take care of his character, even when he is clearly doing something wrong, and Neva Campbell gives an idea, which, no doubt, is the best I've seen this year for an actress. She is fantastic, like a wild young woman who is wise beyond her age. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is just as creepy as Macy's father, and John Ritter is good as a psycho stuck in the middle of everything. <br /> <br /> I would like it to be in the theater, because I feel that this is a film that should be watched by a wider audience. It's a shame, because a hell of a lot better than most new films coming into the theater right now. <br /> <br />
