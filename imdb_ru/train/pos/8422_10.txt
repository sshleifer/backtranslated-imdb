An additional is called upon to play a general in a film about the Russian revolution. However, it is not an ordinary extra. This is Serguis Alexander, the former commander of the Russian army, who now has to go through the same scene in which he experienced professional and personal tragedy to satisfy the director who was once a revolutionary in Russia and was humiliated by Alexander. Now is the time for this broken man to finally "win" his penultimate battle. This is one powerful film with the meticulous leadership of Von Sternberg, giving the greatest irony in the character of Alexander in all possible ways. Jennings earned his Oscar for his role with a very thrilling performance, playing the general at his peak and in his deepest valley. Powell gives ominous support in the role of a director who is set up for revenge, and Brent is flawless in her role, her face and movements demonstrate the same expression as Jennings' love. All around shine. Rating, 10.
