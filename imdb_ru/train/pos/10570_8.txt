It's hard to say what comes to the first place, the charm and energy of James Cagney, or the mouth-opening surplus of three great Busby Berkeley show-boppers at the end. I tie it up with Footlight Parade, one of the funniest and fastest musicals of the early thirties. Although the film clearly belongs to Cagney, Joan Blondel immeasurably adds a good-natured storyline. <br /> <br /> What is the storyline? This is about Chester Kent (Cagney), who is producing musicals, and who is now almost out of business when the radio stations replaced them. He begins to make Prologues, live musical entertainment offered on stage before the film begins. He had the idea to make more and more of them, moving them around the country. He is a fireball and ideas, and he needs all the ideas he can get in order to continue to tirelessly produce these things. But the rival spies on him and steals his ideas; Nan Prescott (Blondel), his wise secretary, loves him, but he is too busy to notice; an office girl in black-rimmed round glasses (Ruby Keeler) wants to dance; his wife appears, saying that she did not divorce him; after all, the blonde gold digger shoved her hooks in him; his partners are cheating on him ... what the hell is next? All of this may sound like digestion, but everything happens quickly, with Cagney bouncing, pompous, walking, snapping fingers, barking orders, and sometimes - until the big last number, when he completely sang and dances - takes a step or two to show how it's done. <br /> <br /> Instead of “Let's make a show, gang,” we have “We need to build three shows in three days, so lock the doors and let's start rehearsing.” These three super prologues will have 40 choirins, impressive effects and will mean a rich contract with forty units of Kent in luxurious cinemas ... the entire Apollo cinema! Exhaustion threatens, legs hurt, but all of these unpaid chorins in scanty costumes (including Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamur; you can quickly notice Sauternes, but Lamur is more versatile) remain up to date, their hearts dance, giggle and chat and look surprisingly uncomfortable , <br /> <br /> And then the curtains come up, as each Prologue is presented in separate cinemas, one after the other on the same night, when the owner of the Apollon motorway is going to decide that night whether he will save Chester’s Skin or not. <br /> <br /> First “Honeymoon Hotel” with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in a 9-minute serial number, in which there is a lot of depraved lust, with grooms and brides (some of them may even be married), bedrooms and the beds. and doors labeled Do Not Disturb. <br /> <br /> Then we move on to the next theater and 11 minutes at the Falls, where Warner Brothers accountants are probably worried about bankruptcy. This number is too large - dozens of floating girls, trees, fountains, a huge grotto with water slides, a giant pool - you never think that there was a Depression. Berkeley pulls out all his tricks — sync, human patterns, legs and hands that do all kinds of exact things — and he does it in water, with a lot of underwater photography looking up. The girls are confident in the game. They fit, smiling with water in their eyes, and still fall into the tracks. All this should be incredibly difficult and tiring. Ruby Keeler, who has a few quick throws in the water, is the only one who looks a bit cautious. <br /> <br /> And finally, a terrific finale ... 11 minutes Kagney, dancing and singing with Keeler in "Shanghai Lil", with all kinds of bar girls and their clients, is unusual because the races are confused, Kogney and Keeler is dancing in the bar, dancing on the table, Kögni fighting. There is something like fifty or sixty marching marines roaming back and forth, with guns thrown and caught. Then ... this is true ... a human picture of the forms of Franklin Roosevelt and the NRA eagle. This may be the only Hollywood piece of music that Roosevelt has ever featured, a large federal agency and a group of sexy Chinese prostitutes. <br /> <br /> This is fun, guys. It's great! <br /> <br /> Of course, the Chester Prologues get a big deal, and Nan gets Chester. The film is full of juicy clichés that make us smile. Ruby Keeler is so charming that she genuinely stomps her hands, flying with her hands, that you want to help her with this. Joan Blondel makes us forget about many Hollywood women who may have been more beautiful, but who had much less wit and individuality. The film, however, belongs to Cagney, who captures and shakes him, and Berkeley, a man for whom too much has never been too much.
