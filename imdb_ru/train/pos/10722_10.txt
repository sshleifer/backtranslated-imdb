Spacecamp is one of the films that kids just adore, and mom and dad can also have fun watching. In the 80s I enjoyed this film, its plot and all the actors. I recently bought this film on DVD, so that when I have my children, they can have fun just like me. The plot is funny, a group of children goes on a journey that they never expected, when a robot that has achieved great results soared them into space. At first they were in ah, but when they realized that they did not have enough oxygen to make him panic again. As soon as they recovered enough oxygen from the space station, they returned to Earth as even better friends and a new-found respect for life.
