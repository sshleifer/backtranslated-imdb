This film is a Gemstone because it moves with a soft but firm resolution. <br /> <br /> I warn viewers that, although he is announced as a corporate spy thriller and Ms. Liu is present, he is moving at a deft, purposeful, but calm pace. This is NOT explosions, car chases or flying bullets. You have to be patient and instead pay attention to the details here. This is balanced, because that is the main character. The viewer should watch him and think about how this story unfolds. <br /> <br /> I will not give spoilers, because it destroys the meaning of observation. The plot is what you read from other posts: an ordinary white collar, looking for change and adventure, signs a contract to work in a spy company. Just go somewhere and secretly record and transfer data from the inside. <br /> <br /> Take it from there. <br /> <br /> This film begins with a surrealistic walk — with the background smell of corporate frustration that intertwines with typical, hidden suburban paranoia. <br /> <br /> Then he starts to accelerate. <br /> <br /> Acting in all parts is gorgeous - and yes, some acts are caricatured. But they all fit and they entertain. And the easy piano rhyme in the background is just as beautiful as the ominous theme of soft, soft keys: “In the beginning, everything is not so.” <br /> <br /> And at the end: everything is not as it seems. /> <br /> Feel comfortable and turn off the light to watch it - and turn on the sound: this film wants you to LISTEN.
