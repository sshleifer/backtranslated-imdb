This is without a doubt the best documentary ever created with an accurate and epic depiction of the Second World War from the invasion of Poland in 1939 until the end of the war in 1945. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this Documentary represents the views on both sides of the conflict, giving a very human face to the war. At the same time, the tactics and importance of the battles are not lost sight of, much work has been done to give a detailed picture of the war and, in particular, high, low and turning points in the states of the allies. Being filmed in the UK documentary, this 26-part series mainly focuses on Britain, but the contribution of Russia and America is not limited to this, but is one of such advantages of the series of such length. <br /> <br /> Another note worth mentioning is the score, the music and the feeling of a documentary film - this is turmoil, struggle and perseverance. Like the film, this series leaves the viewer no doubt about the difficulties faced by the Allies and the Germans during the war, at its climax at the end of each episode, which serves as a layer of rudeness of the Second World War. After viewing all 26 spectators, they leave extensive knowledge about the war and wonder how much we owe to members of the previous generation.
