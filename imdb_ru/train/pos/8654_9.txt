It's amazing that so many people I know have not seen this little gem. everyone whom I addressed returned with the same reaction: “WHAT A BIG MOVIE !! <br /> <br /> I never really cared about Brad Pitt (although his moves in 12 monkeys and Fight Club show improvement), but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving, gloomy and right on target. <br /> <br /> Everyone else in the film gives great performances, and the slow and thoughtful pace of the film speeds up the process. The fear of the characters continues to grow when they begin to understand what is actually happening. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps it from 10 in my book is that, compared to what it was before, the ending is too long and bloated. but this is the only flaw that I can find in this cult classic. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, try to get an abbreviated version without a director’s rating for better viewing. <br /> <br /> rating: 9
