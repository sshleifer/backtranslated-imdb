Most people who have seen this movie think that this is the best movie ever made. I do not agree, but this film is very good. Tony is a bad guy and knows that he scares and uses it to get ahead. This is about him and how he goes from washing up to a huge house and office with cocaine throughout the table. If you want a family movie, then this is not the way, but if you need bandits, revenge, and the like, then you will like it.
