While Rome is going crazy, celebrating Hitler's visit — uniform, groups, parades — two outsiders stay at home, in a large building, and finish the meeting. This is Sophia Loren, the wife of a brutal public servant and the mother of six children. This is Mastroianni, a radio speaker who was fired due to his homosexuality. They both need company and understanding, they both find it in each other. <br /> <br /> The film covers several hours. The color is faded, and everything happens to the sound track of military marches and hysterical radio broadcasters. Oddly enough, the Nazi anthem - Horst-Wessel-Lied - turns into a romantic musical theme. <br /> <br /> A beautiful film, an excellent re-creation of a special era in Italian history and a touching, sad story. Mastroianni is as good as we expected, and Sophia Loren does an excellent job with her job, very far from the usual Neapolitan person-driver of her truck driver. Do not miss it.
