I have not seen this movie! At least not completely. I saw some obsessive clips that made me gag to see it all. One sequence remains in my memory to this day. The (very convincing-looking) spacecraft revolves around the dark side of the moon. The pilot releases the flash to take a picture of the hidden surface under it. The moon flashes in visibility. .. and for a few seconds it is. Parallel lines, squares. Could this be ... then the light will go out and a brief glimpse ... of what ... has passed, and the time has come for the spacecraft to return to Earth. Wonderful. I also saw some other clips, but I would like to get a full movie.
