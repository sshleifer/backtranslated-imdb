Ruth Gordon is one of the most sympathetic killers Colombo has ever encountered. And the plot is brilliant from the very beginning. This is one of the best episodes of Colombo. Mariette Hartley and J. D. Spradlin are excellent in their supporting roles. And Peter Falk adds a little something extra in his scenes with Gordon.
