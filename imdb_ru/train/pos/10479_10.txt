This is a film that my dentist actually recommended to me, and I'm glad he did! A mixture of British humor (should I say, humor?) And the reality of a middle-aged lost widow trying to maintain her lifestyle was a scream. Add to this mix the reality of what you need to actually grow a pot (those plants under the bushes were NOT going to do it without the TLC that they received), and this is a really fun but touching film. I laugh every time when I see in the imagination of all visitors to the bar, sitting on their sun loungers in sunglasses, during the countdown of the light! Maybe this is just my blood of Mendocino County, but the British definitely got it right !! 10/10
