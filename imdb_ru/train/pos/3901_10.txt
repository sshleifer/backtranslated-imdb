This video is rocking! Eddie is one of the funniest comics I've ever seen. Not only does he have a class, he makes some of the funniest observations on history and culture I've ever seen. Eddie is the most original and smartest comic book I have seen in a VERY long time. Tell all these intercessors to step off the stage and allow this “leader” to rule!
