I saw this movie as a child at the Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a rather creepy movie, though not as good as a horror hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it is different from what I remember, because the DVD I bought has several scenes in which the actors speak French and / or Italian, and the subtitles are not provided. Other actors then respond in English to what has been said. Kind of weird. Also, on the DVD box, the names of some of the actors are written differently than on IMDb. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film is different in that the character Elsie takes off her clothes and gives a nude figure. filmed in one scene and in another - Julia tries to get Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to deal with her, pushing her onto the bed and kissing while Steele resists. This scene existed in the television version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there are additional frames that could be included in the updated ultra-release? It seems sad that some of these old low-budget classic works have been divided into pieces and sold in all kinds of edited versions. Where are the master tapes and all unused frames? <br /> <br /> Besides the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is taken to the Castle, the rest of the film is pretty good. There are not so many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia slapped him in the face) is good. The terrible atmosphere and strange, exotic and seductive image of Barbara Steele make the film much better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele was not in this film, it would be a big zero. She makes a movie ten!
