After I grew up on the sandy streets of Detroit, Michigan, and made friends who went to New York balls, I plunged into the lifestyle of a member of the House. I entered the House of Thieves. We adapted the same rules as most homes, but we were professional scammers who spurred and committed credit card fraud in order to get the incredible jewelry and clothes we wanted. I even learned to confess checks and driver's licenses and cash them in more than seventeen states, until the jealous queen called me in the secret service and I did not go to federal prison. But I learned a lot from these queens in this film, and I strongly recommend that you watch it yourself. You can even read about how I grew up in houses here in Detroit, and about the criminal activity we were engaged in. My book “Identification Schemes” is available on Amazon dot com or Identity Schemes dot com. But believe me, this is much better than Paris is burning, because this is 2005.
