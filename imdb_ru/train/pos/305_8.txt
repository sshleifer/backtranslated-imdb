Screwball comedy about romantic inconsistencies in New York. Peter Bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture - he respects them - but Audrey Hepburn (naturally) puts him a step above the rest because, after all, she is Princess Bogdanovich, probably fell in love with a movie 30 years ago in her loving close-ups, falls right into the sheets between her and Ben Gazzar's wonderfully hard-boiled / soft-boiled and allows her room to sparkle everywhere. The love ties made during the film are quick and fun, although I am tired of the John Ritter television style. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and the down-to-earth, down-to-earth sensual Patti Hansen are all an exciting sight. But this is really Valentine Hepburn, and it absolutely shines. *** from ****
