Gloomy scanner, Minority Report, Blade Runner, Sin City and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow ?? If you are a fan of any of these, then it is worth a try. <br /> <br /> The French Renaissance animation project took seven years to save money, and tonight I finally saw it in a private show of the Stockholm International Film Festival. My spontaneous reaction is awe; my further reflection - “yes, carefully”, and with a more careful analysis, unfortunately, a deafening “me” sounds. This is a magnificent triumph of science fiction on the surface, but scratch it or even poke it a bit, and its unnecessarily complex plot becomes clearly obvious, as are flat characters. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is obvious that the people from the Onyx films did something amazing with the above-mentioned surface. The visual effects are amazing. They used real-time motion capture built into the keyframe animation, with sharp dark black and bright white contrasts and a heavily shaded rotoscopic background. For those of you who don't understand “technical jargon,” the film looks like a fully animated Sin City. Its smooth, transparent, dark and stylized pattern is complemented by a bright bright lightning. This is a vision. Yet great merit is also associated with clear sound effects that take the form of droning futuristic weapons, tense music, heavy rain drops and shattered glass fragments. This is a wet dream of all techies ... <br /> <br /> The film is approaching a terribly lit, gloomy, future Paris, in which a large corporation called Avalon began to intertwine in the life of citizens with supervision (I think flowing transparent screens from minority report) and genetic engineering. The latter leads to the mysterious abduction of a young explorer Ilona (voiced by the cute Romola Garay). Go to our hard-boiled cop on the suspension and the main character Karas (Daniel Craig) ?? a person who takes the law into his own hands ?? who is in charge of finding and returning Ilona. In this case, Ilona’s sister helps him, with which he also begins an affair. If I may say so, this is a very half love story. <br /> <br /> World Renaissance is wonderful. Directed by Christian Volkmann, he tries his best to melt the theme of noir, and as a result city jungles appear, filled with cranes, rats, femme fatales and lonely detectives who hide in the shadows of hot slums. The problem is that the creators, of course, felt the need to have extremely clear and clearly defined archetypes in history, otherwise the film would be “too surreal” for the main audience because of its gloomy animation format. From this it follows that we have a lot of cliché characters, such as evil laughing villains, nasty crime bosses and cool chicks who blow the smoke at every opportunity. This throws noir in our eyes, and this is not necessary. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the dialogue is a bit contrived. It seems that each line exists for the sole reason to advance the plot. There is nothing fatal in this, because the plot is as complex as it begins, that it needs some clear direction. Daniel Craig helps here, bringing a nonsense attitude to his tough police character. At some point in the Renaissance, he was seen in a bright car chase, which, of course, is one of the most exciting and exciting movie scenes. Unfortunately, the novelty of science fiction visual effects has ceased to exist after this car chase, and Renassaince can benefit from what will be a little shorter. Overall, a very interesting, but flawed, futuristic comic book experience. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
