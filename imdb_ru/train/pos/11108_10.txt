Well ... easy my favorite TV shows. Call me a walking postal clich√©, but include violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs, etc. in the show. And you already score points in my book. Combine all this with an acting game that surpasses everything you have ever seen on a small screen, add a direction that is suitable for vintage cinema, and most of all an essay that blows the mind (and a few brains for a long time), and you get yourself a show that will be quite difficult to compete with. <br /> <br /> First of all, there are two actors: James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano and Edie Falco as his wife Carmela ... as for Gandolfini, he approaches the role in such a way that words cannot express You have not seen him as Tony, but see it now! <br /> <br /> I can continue to tell about each character of the show, psychological brilliance, the capture of the scene, etc., but you cannot stop me, so all I can say is that this is the only a show with Seinfeld that I can watch again and again from beginning to end and end up enjoying it even More.
