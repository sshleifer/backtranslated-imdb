This is not a movie that John Wayne is famous for. He plays a diplomat, a man who achieves a goal with words and beliefs, not physical actions. The film moves with calm realism through its seemingly uninteresting story. <br /> <br /> For an open-minded, patient, and thoughtful, this film is a rich depiction of an intriguing part of the story. <br /> <br /> There are two intertwining stories. The big story is about internal, isolationist Japan and external, expansionist America that collides when their interests conflict. A small, human story tells about a barbarian outsider (Wayne) and the initial hostility of a civilized geisha and does not like to turn to mutual respect and love. Human history is a reflection of the great history of two peoples. <br /> <br /> The film is very well made, and all the actors play their part well. The two main roles are played to perfection. John Wayne is excellent in the role of Townsend Harris, he successfully combines power and negotiations in relations with the Japanese. Eiko Ando is also gorgeous, like a geisha by name, charming and adorable. The interaction between her character and John Wayne is especially well portrayed. This is how these two people would behave (as they are depicted in the film). <br /> <br /> The script is very well written. He lacks all the pomp. and is a realistic depiction of how the events depicted could occur. Characters are real people, not consciously “great” figures from history. In addition, the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety. Indeed, the clash between traditionalist and traditionally powerful isolationist Japan and a growing, again powerful nation from across the ocean is very well expressed in a single exchange between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron. Wayne complains that the shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they disembark in Japan, and that passing ships cannot even enter the port for water. The Baron replies that Japan simply wants to be left alone. Wayne's character replies that Japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international transportation, and that if everything continues, as before, the nation will be seen as nothing more than a gang of robbers flooding important roads. A very real exposition of how each of the two countries saw itself in the right, and the other in the wrong. The resulting clash between two complacent peoples with conflicting interests has been reflected throughout history. This is a continuous theme that resonates with the present and the future. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and the image of Japan in the mid-19th century. Before rapid growth towards industrialization, which was to follow at the end of the century, it was excellent. Visual pleasure and insightful understanding of the ancient civilization of Japan. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to everyone, be it a John Wayne fan or not, to watch this movie if you have a chance. Just know that this is not an action movie. This is a representation of an interesting place and time in history, and a slowly simmering love story that (to their surprise) begins to dominate the personal lives of the two main characters. Watch this film in essence, without prejudice, allow yourself to immerse yourself in its history, and you will get complete pleasure. <br /> <br /> In general, a great movie.
