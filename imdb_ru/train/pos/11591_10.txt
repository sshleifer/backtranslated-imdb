I also searched for this film for a long time, and how great it would be to find it on DVD ... <br /> <br /> I saw this film when I was about 6 years old, in the Netherlands. And it really impressed me. It was featured in front of the Walt Disney Jungle Book! <br /> <br /> What I remember about this film is fragmented. I remember that an Indian boy was friends with an eagle. It really impressed me. For some reason, he was kicked out of his village (the reason for this was not understood). When other boys threw stones at him, he climbed onto a rock and jumped. At this time, he turned into an eagle and flew away with his friend-eagle. Like an eagle, he still wore his turquoise necklace. <br /> <br /> CB
