If this film proves only one thing, this is what Keaton always was, was and always will be comic in the depths of his soul, even when he dodges bullets, goes to the electric chair and gets the wrong end of the information line in prison. <br /> <br /> But Johnny Danger continues to prove even more. In the 80s, the boys of ZAZ (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) were the pinnacle in the world of genre parodies. But there were several candidates for the throne. This time, Amy (“Fast Times in Regiment High”), Heckerling tries his hand, behind the script is an amazing number of television writers (go and check). <br /> <br /> This reckless joke, filmed in the films of the 1930s, devoted to the police and the gags, throws out almost every cliche for the loop and even adds a few cliches that were not there once. <br /> And not only is Keton's always reliable at hand, like Johnny from the title, but also such funny guys and dolls as Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunn, DeVito, Walston and almost all the other actors in Hollywood, who happened to be in close proximity. You will be surprised at how many faces you will recognize. I know that was. <br /> <br /> What about jokes? Well, when they start, they go at you quickly and violently, like a machine gun. At first there are too many of them to be counted, crowning them with the crazy dark song Weird Al Yankovic. But you have to watch out for when they will reboot. And they have to reboot too often. <br /> <br /> Everyone tries, they seem to be fun, and I laughed a lot. In the end, however, there was enough time to think that some scenes could have been funnier - usually this is not the best thing to think about after watching a comedy. <br /> <br /> But for a slow night when there is nothing good on TV, take a look at "Johnny" and be ready for a serious laugh, "Danger." <br /> <br /> Eight stars. Check out "Johnny Dangerous" ... don't be a "bastiga."
