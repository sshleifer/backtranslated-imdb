This is a cute story about an obsession with guilt feelings. <br /> <br /> Matisse during a lonely night walk through Riga (?) Drives past a woman from the wrong side of the bridge railing. He passes by without a word. Only a splash of water, accompanied by a cry for help, makes him act. And then - too little and too late. <br /> <br /> The film tells about his attempts to learn more about the woman. On a troll from local bars, he finds her wallet. He gathers more and more of her life together. His “look” changes as his obsession grows. He has to fix everything. In an amazingly withdrawn dialogue with the “ex-bastard guy,” he makes Alexei face the guilt feelings that both of them have. <br /> <br /> Ghost long batons, rough soundtrack, emphasizing the feeling of guilt, barking dogs. Footsteps. A wonderful film noir with a wonderful twist. Good indie final.
