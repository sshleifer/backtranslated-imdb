Catscratch is the best thing from Nickeloden, including Wayne Knight. This show is not only for Maori and pi. Some people love it, and they are all Australians. At first glance, I admit that this seems a bit rude, but it affects you a lot. In addition, to correct what one of the other critics said, In_Correct (Tv.com) does not say: “Does this mean that you are homo now?” He says: “Does this mean that you are homo, ay?” This is his phrase in the show. Mr Blick, I think the funniest of all, is the Pugh Vieu Theater. <br /> <br /> First, I admit that the early episode was a little good. But after a while the episodes became great! And as soon as the series found it surreal, stupid ... Nickelodeon cancels it! <br /> <br /> I know that Nick is meant for children, but from time to time a brilliant show appears that teenagers might like. and adults. These shows include the animated series "Mr. Bean", "Charlie Brown", "Pelswick", "Modern Life Roco" (from time to time) and "Invader Zim". All of this must have been considered too good, with the exception of CatDog, because Nick felt the need to cancel them. <br /> <br /> I like the famous final episode where Gordon fights with a duck. <Br /> <br /> I would also like to see a DVD with a lot of audio comments and backstage documents, including the final episode. <br /> <br /> But of course, I definitely would like to see the show return to the air. Wake up, Nick! <br /> <br /> I would like to have a list with all the jokes somewhere on the Internet. That would be great.
