After Jeremy Brett became Sherlock Holmes, no actor should ever show such vanity to imagine that he could come close to the image of Mr. Brett "one of the most interesting characters in literature." Jeremy Brett - Sherlock Holmes, and, in my opinion, the other can not be. I have to admit that the great actor Basil Rathbone is in second place, but still second. One could argue that the scripts of Mr. Rathbone are inferior to the absolutely high-class films that Mr. Brett has provided, and I would agree with that. However, when all is said and done, Jeremy Brett will always and forever remain the only actor who truly "becomes" Sherlock Holmes. The book should be closed on this topic, and we, the public, should enjoy the unique speeches of Mr. Brett. <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
