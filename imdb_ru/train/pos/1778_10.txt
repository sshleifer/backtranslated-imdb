I just want to say that I am so glad that someone has finally spilled the beans on this film. Bravo "Spaz", Bravo! This film is a funny film farce. Especially for student film! I just want to thank Spazz for taking the absurd amount of time to find such a rare picture, and then COMMENT ON THIS! Most people I know have no such time, especially because few will stop reading it. Glory to you, sir! In any case, the film follows a thin storyline, which, at least, is incredible and just silly. I understand the idea of ​​creating Charlie's Angels satire, but why hire such horrible actresses! In addition, what kind of director himself acts, writes, produces, and also edits the pictures! Choose one job and put all your love into it, man! This is such a shame, because I heard that he made a good movie about a toothbrush-killer. Again, thanks to Spazz for taking the curtain in this film, people like you are a rare find.
