Lots and lots of information to digest, and if you saw Zizek, you know his pace. <br /> <br /> Also, if you have not seen most of the films or at least some of the other films of the same directors mentioned in this document, you will be somewhat lost. <br /> <br /> And the list of movies is long. The director includes Hitchcock (Psycho, Vertigo, Birds), Lynch (Lost Highway, Mallholland Falls, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and Chat (Coppola). <br /> <br /> There are some Segway movies such as Star Wars: Espisode III, Matrix ... but I suspect this is a decoy. Of course, иižek is never boring, but if you don’t buy (or don’t mind) psychoanalytic analytics, you’ll be annoyed indefinitely. <br /> <br /> But you don’t have to be, because setting, clips, the way that a movie alternates with these clips, Zizek items are never boring.
