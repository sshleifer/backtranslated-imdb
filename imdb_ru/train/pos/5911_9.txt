Remember Ralph Bakshi? The guy who was the animator at Terrytoons, then at Paramount Cartoon Studios, then he directed Fritz the Cat 1 & 2 and Heavy Traffic? Well, this is Kunskin. And it is actually very good. Racist but good The film takes place in "Harlem Nights" (no, yes, it was a working title.), But with a twist that becomes the flashlight of the Disney film, "The Song of the South." <br /> <br /> This is about Sampson (Barry). White) and the Preacher (Charles Gordon) rush to help his friend Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison, but they are stopped by a checkpoint and as a result of an exchange of fire with the police. While waiting for them, Randy reluctantly listens to the runaway Pappi (Skatman Krothers) when he starts to tell Randy the story of "the three guys I knew, just like you and your friends." The story of Pappy is told in an animation on the background of background photos and videos. <br /> <br /> Brother Rabbit (voice of Thomas), Brother Bear (voice of White) and Preacher Fox (voice of Gordon) decided to get together and leave their southern settings after the bank has mortgaged their house and sold it to the person who turns him in the brothel. Arriving at Harlem, Rabbit, Bear and Fox discover that this is not all that he had in mind. They meet a con man named Simple Savior, a fake revolutionary leader who claims to be Black Jesus’s cousin and gives his followers “the power to kill whites.” In a vivid stage performance in his “church,” the Savior played out the cruel treatment of black oppression symbols represented by John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon before asking his congregations for “donations.” <br /> <Rabbit first goes against Madigan, a violently racist and homophobic white policeman and mafia man who demonstrates his contempt for African Americans in various ways, including not bathing before an expected meeting with them (he thinks that they are not worth it ). When Madigan learns that Rabbit gets paid, he and his colleagues, Ruby and Bobby, go to a nightclub called "Cotton Tail". <br /> <br /> A black stripper distracts him while the LSD sugar cube falls into his drink. Madigan, under the influence of his spiky drink, then maneuvers in a sexual relationship with stereotypically effeminate gay, and then puts on clothes that women represent a typically racist archetype decorated with something racist, and finally pushes the back of the club, where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. <br /> <br /> Then, having recovered from his delirium from drugs, he fires a pistol at random and was shot by the police after he shot one of them. <br /> <br /> Rabbit, bear, fox and opponent’s boxer run out of the box when it explodes. The living story ends with Randy and Pappy running away when various white policemen shoot at them, but they manage to figure it out. <br /> <br /> This film was controversial at the time of the release and was re-edited by the director several times under the name Street Fight, which is obvious, since Street Fight is a 2005 documentary on racism on the streets. In fact, this film has the same theme as the documentary. <br /> <br /> This led Bryanston Pictures, the distributor of this film and the original Tobe Hopper classic, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to go bankrupt. Because Paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film, but because of racism, Bryanston took over the production of Bakshi. <br /> <br /> Despite the odds, it was worth it. The animation was awesome at the time, the plot makes sense, and in fact it’s also funny. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: 9/10
