It is beyond my understanding that so much rubbish from Norway was remastered for a DVD release, and still gems like this one don't get a chance to regain their past glory. I give it a 7, not because it's very good, but because it is one of the few SciFi films made for Norwegian television. This film is nothing more than a historical film, which in many respects foreshadows the first film about aliens. And my word, Blindpassasjer was the first! Ridley Scott or someone on the team saw a mini-series? However, it is unlikely the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar. Well, the budget in the Norwegian film is much lower, but, considering this, this is a really well-done work from the desert era of the Norwegian film industry, which, by the way, lasted until the 90s.
