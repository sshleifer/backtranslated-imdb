The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell is a really good movie. He plays well the cast, including Richard Krennu and RG Armstrong. The music is creepy and gives this devilish cold! I liked the effects on the dog, and I think that the creature itself looked very cool with horns, like a toad on the neck, and acted very viscous! If you like horror movies and you have not seen The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell and you can find and buy this rare film because it is a good film and I do not think you will be disappointed!
