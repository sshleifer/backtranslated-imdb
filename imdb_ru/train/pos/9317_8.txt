I saw how this film was criticized with a statement: “If you can overcome moralizing ...” It is overlooked. Moralizer in the conscience of the beholder, as it were. It is a decent film with a standard murder puzzle, but with a distinct twist that appears halfway through. The resolution makes the viewer think: “What would I do in this position?” And I have to believe that this is exactly what the director intended. To this end, to fully entertain the audience, the film is successful. I also like the fact that violence is never on stage, but just off-screen. We know what just happened; he simply does not serve in front of us, and then rubbed into our faces, as it would today with modern clothes of blood and blood. In addition, the violence is not in this. The point is the moral dilemma of the main character, which is cleverly, albeit anxiously, solved.
