Saving Grace is a good movie with a heart in the right place. Grace was recently widowed and realizes that her late husband has left her a lot of debt. She can lose her beloved home and sees no other way out of her suffering, except to start growing marijuana. She lives in a beautiful village where most viewers would like to live, and all the villagers are wonderful people that most viewers would like to have as neighbors. There is only one mistake in this picture, and this is how it depicts the influence of marijuana on the user. Obviously, none of the actors or authors of this film have ever really smoked this thing. How residents behave after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly ridiculous. It is in these scenes that the wit is replaced by the English farce, and that is a pity in the film, which is nevertheless very pleasant.
