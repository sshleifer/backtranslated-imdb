All Dog's Go to Heaven is an animated kids movie like no other. Gambling, drunkenness, death, weapons and hell are all noticeable on the plot, and although children will get very little from this, adults will puzzle over why this film was created to feel like a gangster movie. The actual film is by no means overt, it is just a strange combination to create a children's film. <br /> <br /> Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) - a dog-player who owns half a casino with his partner Carface (Vic Taybak). After getting drunk (The Dog ... got drunk ... in the children's film. It sounds weird.) Charlie is deceived and killed by Carfax. Being in heaven, he finds a way to return to Earth, but he will no longer be allowed in heaven. He is still returning to Earth and is meeting his old friend Ichi (House of Deloise) and plans to recoup Carfax. Meanwhile, in Carfax, there is a little orphan girl that Ann Marie is holding captive because of her amazing ability to talk to all kinds of animals, which helps predict races. Charlie and Icci release her and try to help her find a family, at the same time learning a lot about herself. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the few non-Disney that will appeal to both children and adults. Children will enjoy funny characters and lively animation, while adults will enjoy a pleasant, enjoyable storyline and more than normally developed characters. This holds back what is musical. This is usually good, but the music here is really awful. They, as a rule, jump, sound almost without advertising, practically without instrumental support. In fact, this is probably the worst songs I've ever heard in an animated film, but fortunately, the rest of the film is strong enough not to fall apart due to bad notes. <br /> <br /> The ending of this film works, but I honestly hate it. It's sad, but happy, but rather sad than happy, and makes the film feel that it needs to be continued. Considering how bad the sequel was, I would like the final to not justify the continuation, and it would end with a good, super happy ending. This is one of the few films that I think about, but I do it. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good family film, with strange themes added to it, but, nevertheless, it is good entertainment. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** out ****. 85 minutes G.
