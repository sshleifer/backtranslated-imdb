At 35, Groove Tube is very much like modern television! Specialized niche networks (nude sports), TV shows about drug dealers called “Dealers” (ala weeds, and even up to 1978 Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke), strange beer commercials (Butz Beer, no less fancy than Bud Bowls), Koko's dirty children's clown (shades of Pee Wee Herman), even Chevy Chase playing a humorous joke (a strong vocal duet for hairdressers) a year before his debut in 1975 on Saturday Night Live. And thanks to the infamous opening sequence that brought Groove Tube the initial X rating, I still can't hear Curtis Mayfield's Move On Up without thinking about naked hippie dancing hitchhikers. ---- Similar films in the style of a sketch, see TunnelVision. , The film "Fried in Kentucky," "Amazon's Mood Women", "Monty Python Beyond the Edge", "Dynamite Chicken" and "Everything You Know Is Wrong in the Theater of Fire Signs."
