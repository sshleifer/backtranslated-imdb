After watching many Greek films, I feel very suspicious of most of them. But after watching, I felt surprised. Movies are great without much effort. You cannot argue that the script is so good, or the picture is beautiful or something technical. This is a true story, and it takes place in Greek rural areas in places forgotten by God. The film is like a blow to the stomach, and I would very much like everything to be wrong. This clearly speaks of the xenophobia of the Greek people (ignorance) to something else. The problem with this guy is not that he is a former convict. The problem is that he is not one of these people. He’s different, and they don’t want them (which is why everything he does turns into a boomerang). It also speaks about the apathy of people, because there are some people who are against the hunt for the king, but they do not dare to express their opinion. In the end, you can clearly see the hypocrisy of a society that is religious and tries to behave as God says, but at the same time behaves so unfairly to the king. This shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or their beliefs in accordance with the established system. In the end, you can get a positive lesson from this very bad story, meaning that you can understand and become part of this society only if you want to be one of them. If you want to stay different and even lonely, you are lost (and this is not far from reality). I think it’s tragic that the story is real, and that should be a call for all. No comment for the main actor, because he has already received an award, and I think his game was great. A small comment for Hatsisavvasa (played by a policeman), he is like a dinosaur, he played many roles, and I’m sure that this role was very easy for him, but he plays it so great that you can’t refuse him great bravo I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a good Greek film.
