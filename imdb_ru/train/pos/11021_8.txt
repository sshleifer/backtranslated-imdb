After the success of Die Hard and his sequels, it is not surprising that in the 1990s an abundance of Hard Hard on a ..... films revealed the wrong guy, not the right place, not the right concept. This is what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on the mountain, just in time to save Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot' in Stallone's career. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is one big dream of the rot lover, especially for those who are experts in mountaineering, ski jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting. On the whole, it is full of excuses to reject the film as one swollen pile of junk. Stallone even managed to get around the horse! However, if you forget all the nonsense, in fact it is a very attractive and undoubtedly entertaining romp that provides as much thrill, and unintentionally, a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> You have to love John Lithgows sneery anger, his tick on each box of a group of villains and, best of all, the constant pursuer and unhappy agent “defector” Rex Lynn in the role of Travers. <br /> <br /> He may have been Henry in “The Portrait of a Serial Killer” “but Michael Rucker is notable for the terribly worthy performance of Hal, he insists on constantly screaming from a painful distrust of his captors,“ that man never hurts anyone. ”The character grins when the girl drops to her death. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning the former actor of "Burning London" Craig Fairbruss as the bad guy from Britain who plays the role of flirting, using Hal as Human Football, yes, you can't not enjoy this bit, Hal is needed there was a good kick. <br /> <br /> So forget better. Judgment, who is not indifferent to "this will never happen," lower your acting expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy! And if you are looking for Qaulen, he is the one who wears the helicopter.
