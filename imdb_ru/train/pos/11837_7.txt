This is a wonderful film in many ways. Everyone in my family liked that. The animation is excellent and easily demonstrates that there are many producers who create films that are visually brilliant, like everything that comes from Disney's studio. <br /> <br /> The difference from normal Disney fares is that this Dreamworks movie does not have some wise side impact to ease comedy. And there are no sudden moments when characters break into a song. I am sure that the scene at the beginning of the film does not appear in the Disney film: the birth of the Spirit. But it is tasteful and not at all offensive. The "Spirit" was a beautiful breath of fresh air. Do not get me wrong. I have loved Disney for many years and will continue to do so. <br /> <br /> “Spirit” is another example of excellent animation. As soon as it was over, my children wanted to see it again. I had the same feeling. I fully recommend it.
