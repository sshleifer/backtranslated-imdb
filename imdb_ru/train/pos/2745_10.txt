I have seen a lot of films, but “In Cold Blood” stands alone in class. It is superior in every department. The fact that there were several big stars in it helps to turn it around when you pay more attention to the characters and their history, and not to the name on the tent. Blake and Wilson turn into star performances of a murderous duet. The fact that most films are shot in real places where the crime was committed, even inside the house, adds an extra cold. Black and white photography darkens the mood, and the photo is gorgeous. There are many outstanding cinematic works, but if I could only vote for one to head the list, it would most likely be "In Cold Blood".
