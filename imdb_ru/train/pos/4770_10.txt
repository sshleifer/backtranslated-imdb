The only show I watched with 90210! Why did they stop it? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel part of it all! The minimum that they have to do is release it on DVD! <br /> <br /> I checked these shows, but nothing came close. The cast had incredible chemistry, and I was looking forward to each episode with a lot of anticipation. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake pulling this show. If anyone has any information as to where I can get the North Shore DVD, please place a few lines here. Thank! Aloha!
