I found this movie charming. I thought the characters were designed since I watched, I took care of these people. This is a historical play, which, I believe, took place during the depression. A single mother, known as a city hermit (she has grounds for this), places the ad “Husband” in a newspaper. Christopher Reeve plays a former con man who arrives in the city in search of work. He sees the ad, and he comes out to see her. She hires him. I did have some chuckles as their relationship developed, because it was easy for me to put myself in their place. Everything went as a matter of fact. He needs a job so he does not want to upset her. And she needs his help, but she does not want him to take over. They dance around the fact that they really need each other. Things are starting to heat up until ...... a big bang. I will not spoil it by telling you what is happening. But the resolution point is absolutely wonderful. I believe that the story was very believable at the time when it happens. I think this is one of the best stories about relationships. Maybe the younger generation will not “understand”, but if you are over 40, I think you will like it. And if you liked Christopher Rive in “Somewhere in Time,” you will also like him in that.
