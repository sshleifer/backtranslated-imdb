When I first saw this movie, I was with my father. He advised me to watch this movie because he was one of his favorites. After watching the movie, he immediately became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The river flows It is about two brothers, each of whom goes his own way. Norman MacLean (Craig Schaeffer) is the eldest of two brothers, and he is on the way to education. Paul McLean (Brad Pitt) is a rebellious younger brother who travels along a path full of obstacles. The film follows these characters as each of them follows their own path. <br /> <br /> This film has no flaws. You will be entertained all the way to the end. The game, the direction and the script are all perfect. Two things that are exceptional are cinema and evaluation. Both that and another captures you into the world that Robert Redford creates for you. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that should be a classic. This is definitely in my book. If you have not seen this film, be sure to watch it as soon as possible, because it will stay with you forever.
