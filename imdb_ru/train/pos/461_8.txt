The fact that this film has many wonderful entertainment qualities, I think, deserves more respect than it was given on imdb. <br /> <br /> This is your main “who did this?” thriller with sex and murder, but it makes you guess until the very end. I like these films, and I certainly think they are in line with the standard. <br /> <br /> I should have watched them more than once, so I’ll give 8 points on imdb.
