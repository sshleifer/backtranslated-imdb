You'd better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start watching it later, you'll be confused about what happens to Clark's life. <br /> <br /> However, this is a turn; Clark is stuck in an alternate reality. Lana is devoted to him. Lex lost most of his legs and ended up in a wheelchair due to an accident on the bridge when he leaned away to miss Clark in the pilot of the series. Martha is married to Lionel. About the only constant is his most loyal friend Chloe, who still believes in who he is. And, oh yeah, he doesn't have super powers. He is in a psychiatric hospital in order to plunge into a world of fantasy, where he has the strength, and he is mocked for believing in it. In addition to Chloe, there is one mysterious figure who believes in Clark: a black man who in alternative reality is also a resident of the institution who believes he is from Mars. <br /> <br /> Clark must remain true to what he believes is real reality, and not the brainwashing psychiatrist of the institution, who is in fact the fourth to escape from the Ghost Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode is just awesome and shocking. Plus, it provides a new twist from the usual type of episode "Smallville".
