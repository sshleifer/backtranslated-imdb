I saw Maslin Beach a couple of times - both on free air in Brisbane. I will not go into details whether it is good, bad or not, because others have considered this well and truly. <br /> <br /> I will say that this is so Australian. Only in Australia can we have a film about the relationship between people who spend a day as naked as their birthday, and watch it on free commercial television. <br /> <br /> I have a friend from the USA who is constantly surprised that we put on our free TV compared to her home country. Sex, City and Huff are just too examples. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that our government is trying to turn us into the 51st state of the USA, it's nice to know that at least some things remain truly Australian
