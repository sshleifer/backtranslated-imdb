I'm a big fan of the Beatles. My favorite Beatle is Paul, and my least favorite is John. I already knew a lot about the Beatles music and the truth about disintegration, as well as about such things as the John Lennon family and the Wings Wings group. I was curious to see how this film would reflect the relationship between John and Paul many years after breaking up. <br /> <br /> This film did not disappoint me. Although the story itself is an invention, many of the references used by the two musicians were very accurate. They included how Yoko Ono will always be with John, wherever he is, the song Wings "Silly Love Songs" became the number one hit this year and the concert on the roof of Apple Studios with the music from the album "Let It Be". br /> <br /> Actors played well for John and Paul. Accents might use maybe a little more work, but they seemed to act like I was reading two former Beatles who usually behaved like that. I also liked the dialogue between them, which was basically what the whole movie was. <br /> <br /> The end at first disappointed me, but the more you think about it, the more you will appreciate it, especially since it was like everything went in real life. They also show a fantastic scene from Saturday Night Live, in which the Beatles are offered $ 3,000 to perform on the show. (compared to the 220 million dollars they were offered) Overall, I was not disappointed with this film. It really gives you a better understanding of why the Beatles broke up and why they never came back together.
