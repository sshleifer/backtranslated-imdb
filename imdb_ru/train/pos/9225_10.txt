The beauty of Bo Derek and the revolutionary direction of John Derek make this film useful. <br /> <br /> Bo, looking more gorgeous than ever, is the newly widowed woman who is visited by her “dead” husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Bo must reach for the body of a young man so that her husband’s ghost can turn from ghost into bodily life. Can she find a suitable candidate? What would she do with him so that Tony could do her job? <br /> <br /> With Bo’s attributes, John’s unique leadership, Quinn’s presence in the film and, thanks to John, a very exotic look at the entire film, this film is enjoyable to watch.
