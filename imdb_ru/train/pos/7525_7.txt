Betty Page was a symbol of the repressed 1950s, when she represented sexual freedom, which was still a decade, but in the hope and dream of many teenagers and young people. Gretchen Maul does an excellent job portraying scandalous Betty, who was a girl from a small town with acting ambitions and a great body. Her acting career has not gone away, but her body has led her to the pinnacle of fame in the admittedly peripheral field. A picture taken in black and white with interruptions when it comes out of the world of exploitation in New York, this film for TV (HBO) has good performance and a very believable cast. The problem is that he is emotionally rather flat. It is difficult to form an attachment to a character, since Betty is portrayed as someone rather superficial and naive, considering the business in which she was. Selfish government investigations spend a lot of time on the screen, which slows the film to an end. But it is definitely worth looking at the history of that time and see the tough government repression that characterized the fifties. 7/10
