This is the best movie ever made to fight AIDS. This is a documentary about two men who live and die from this disease. The film is beautiful, heartbreaking, fun and incredibly touching. First of all, this is an amazing true love story. Before watching this movie, be sure to prepare a few scarves - you'll need them. Extraordinary.
