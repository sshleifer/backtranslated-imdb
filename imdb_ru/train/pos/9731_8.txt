Sydney Young (Pegg) moves from England to New York to work for Sharpe's popular magazine in the hope of living the lifestyle of his dream, but he is struggling to make an indelible impression. <br /> <br /> Based on Toby Young’s book about survival in American business, this comedic drama has received mixed reviews. How to lose friends, marked as inconsistently ridiculous, but with the charm of the actors, it seemed that escaping fish from the pond makes you laugh at another cultural comedy, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This 2008 film works because of its actors and a simple but sharp story. We start in the past and then in the present and move forward to see how Young made his mark in one of the best American magazines. <br /> <br /> Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is too cute for words. Whether it’s hitting a zombie with a cricket bat or demonstrating its intimate character of the law, the English actor brings charm and lightness to every scene. Here, when the scripts are good, but far from his own standards, he brings a lot of energy into the picture, and he alone is worth watching. His “Babe 3” antics are unforgivable, just breathtaking things, like his excessive dance, but he copes with it perfectly. <br /> <br /> Bridges and Anderson succeed in portraying stereotypical magazine bosses in which Dunst fits nicely for tangled love interest. Megan Fox, who stole Transformers, reminds everyone that she can play here with the ridiculous hyperbole of a stereotypical movie star. The fact that her character Sophie Miles plays the main role in the picture of Mother Teresa is as ridiculous as the antics of her character in the pool. To emphasize the point, there is a dog, and Pegg completes it in a true British-style comedy, with a slight twist. <br /> <br /> While in the British film there is an adaptation of the American way of life for Yang when he tries to fit in, and we can see different approaches to storytelling. Young wants the bottom of the dirty contrasted with American professionalism. The inclusion of modern boulevard stars will soon make this film obsolete, but the concept of operating movie stars gives this advantage. <br /> <br /> The first picture of Weide is not perfect. There are omissions in concentration, because the plot becomes too soapy with an awkward and obvious turn, and there are too many characters that may be needed. Physical comedy can also be exaggerated. Recall that the blockbusters on DVD are some of the best you've ever seen, and they lasted for almost half an hour. <br /> <br /> In this comedy drama, Simon Pegg is again in vibrant form and with the team. approach to storytelling and sharp comedy is worth a look.
