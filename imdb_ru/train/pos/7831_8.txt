The German medieval saga Fritz Lang continues in Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (1924). Crimhilda (Margaret Sean) wants revenge for her murdered husband, Siegfried. Her brother is too weak to bring murdered Hagen to justice. King of the Huns (Rudolf Klein-Rogge). She gives birth to a child and invites her brothers to a party. Etzel and the other Huns must kill Hagen, but his brothers protect him. We see a huge battle of life and death begins, and it sets fire to the whole place. In the end, Hagen is dead, like Crimhild. These films are dedicated to great themes, such as revenge and undying love. Of course, later we saw some of the best films shot on these topics, but this was one of the first.
