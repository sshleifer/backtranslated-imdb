“Jake Speed” is a wonderful movie with a beautiful message. Of course, he has his drawbacks. Sometimes it's a little slow. He introduces his villain too far into history. This action occurs at the heartbeat of the cochlea. He has the cast of the Z-class (although I have always admired the work of Karen Kopins, with whom Sandra Bullock looks attractive). <br /> <br /> But despite all this, "Jake Speed" really inspires thanks to the charming script of Wayne Crawford (who plays the main role) and Andrew Lane. <br /> <br /> inspiring? Because he says to me: "Hey, why not try to be a good person." a world where bad things happen to good people. Jake is more than a scout. He is more than a knight in shining armor. Jake Speed ​​is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty, evil and evil world. <br /> <br /> That is why Jake Speed ​​really had to become a hit. It has a great message that needed to be brought to Hollywood and then and to the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Imagine a film industry that really pushes itself to portray good and decent people. I’m not saying that we should watch Waltons in every movie theater in a movie theater, but it would be nice if more films like Jake Speed ​​got a chance. (The “Due to the South” telecast about Canadian Mount is a good comparison of what can be done to brighten up American entertainment.) <br /> <br /> Of course, Jake Speed ​​has violence, blood and weapons, but a common the message is this: if you try to be a good person, you will every time defeat the forces of evil. 10/14/99
