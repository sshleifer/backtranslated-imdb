This film was a brilliant concept. It was original, cleverly written, and very attractive for those of us who are not really a "conformist" film collector. Do not misunderstand me - there are wonderful films that have a wide appeal, but when you go to watching a movie based on “everyone else is watching it,” you know that you are either a teenager or you have no opinion. It had a fine, subtle humor — even though most people probably only looked at the obvious. The actors portrayed their characters with aplomb, and I thought that in this film there was a lot more “personal” personality. It has attractiveness for both children and adults. It is especially pleasant to find a good movie that is not filled with sexual links and narcotic hints! An excellent film that cannot be overlooked on the basis of public consumption. This one must buy.
