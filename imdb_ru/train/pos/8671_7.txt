Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> Latest PPV 2006 <br /> <br /> Smackdown brand. <br /> <br /> Match results ahead ******** <br /> We start the show with the match Inferno. Kane vs. MVP. It was a good match. Nothing about fighting here. It was about visual effects. Overall it was not bad. There were some close places where Kane came too close to the fire, but in the end, Kane won, pushing the MVP back into the fire. <br /> <br /> Excellent knife. Let's continue. <br /> <br /> Teddy Long announces a new match for the team title: London and Kendrick will defend against: Regal and Taylor, The Hardyz and MNM IN LADDER MATCH !!!! Let's move! <br /> <br /> Match two: A fatal game in four directions. It was a complete slaughter. Judging by three of the four teams here, you can expect chaos. The spots were awesome. Total spot festival. One day Jeff went after the Poetry in the Movement, and London moved, and Jeff got on the stairs! Shortly thereafter, Jeff is sitting on the top rope with two ladders nearby, since the CMA was going to kill Jeff, Matt saves, and Jeff blows the swing to Joey Mercury! Mercury hurts. His eye quickly closes and opens in a hard way. Mercury dropped out of the match, and Nitro is still there. He is going to fight alone for titles! Then Regal and Taylor grabbed London and set him face-to-face on the stairs! Jeff climbs the stairs and Nitro in a deadly place, rushes through the stairs to nail Jeff! Awesome! In the end, London and Kendrick retain the names of the tag commands. What a match !!! <br /> <br /> This was crazy. I can not understand why WWE has not announced this so far. Buyrate will increase to huge. I am sure that the value of play will be good. <br /> <br /> Mercury had a nose and cuts in the eye. He is now in hospital. Get well, baby. <br /> <br /> Nothing else exceeds this. <br /> <br /> Next: Miz vs the Boogeyman. (Ugh) It was nothing. Will the boogeyman ever fight? Miz sucks too. After a mad crowd, it kills their dead. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit vs. Chavo. It was a strong match. I enjoyed it. Chavo hit the killer superplex at one point! Benoit got into EIGHT German Suplexes! Benoit wins the shooter. Good things. <br /> <br /> Helms vs. Young Heavy Weight. It was a good match. Unfortunately, stupid fans didn't care about that. WHAT FOR? Helms and Jan are very talented and fought well. I agree with JBL. He ran to the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate it or get out. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kennedy vs. The Undertaker-Last Trip. There is not much here. It was a slug, with rare exceptions. Kennedy at one moment threw Tucker from the top of the stage onto the floor. The stain was fine. The reaction was disappointing. The final spot was Kennedy, scored by Tucker's tombs on the hearse, and won the match. Unreal. Kennedy needed this victory. They are both hardworking. Yet Kennedy needed this victory. The Undertaker was supposed to lose. Creative screwed up again. <br /> <br /> Next stupid diva. I like women. Not this. At least Torrey wasn't here. It is refreshing. Judging by the crowd, Leila was supposed to win. WWE wanted Ashley. Consider it your break in the bathroom. Further. <br /> <br /> Main event: Sina and Batista vs. Finlay and Booker T. This was also no coincidence. The focus was on Sina against Finlay and Batista against Booker. Batista and Booker cannot work well together. Finley is trying to make Sina look good. The finish was failed. Finlay hit Batista on the knee with a shot from a chair, and Batista did not sell the blow and ended the match. Lame. Not the main caliber at all. <br /> <br /> Overall, Armageddon would score less, but the main match here was FUTURE. It was worth enough money right there. Several others were solid. <br /> <br /> Last word: a good PPV with a lifeguard. Smackdown is a good show, just not convincing enough. Smackdown should stop letting Seine follow her. Let Smackdown stand on your two legs. This show proves that Smackdown can.
