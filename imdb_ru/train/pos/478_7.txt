I am rather surprised that not a single reviewer has yet commented on a rather elementary mistake in chess in the game of Luzhin as white against an unnamed opponent just before the final. Despite using Jonathan Spillman as a chess consultant, Luzhin wins the game with an illegal move. In the interval between quick strikes and back to the board, it is easy to see that after Luzhin's combination, which ended with the queen's sacrifice, his rook on d1 is still held by the black rook on c1 against his king in the corner at h1. Thus, he could not play the intended marriage move Rd1-d8, which would be illegal, but he showed it to the enthusiastic applause of the audience.
