This is supposed to be one of the best films that will be released in Hong Kong in a long time, I was looking forward to getting this film in hand, just looking at the title. The many fantastic actors on this show, and I was particularly impressed with Sam Leeâ€™s incredibly believable insane behavior and Edison's depiction of the killing machine that completely changed his usual idol image. I definitely recommend to those who are looking for a stylish and exciting movie. However, I must warn you that this is also a no less depressing film, since every character in the film is in some kind of dead end and in its own trouble and it is difficult for him to breathe. Makes you think about what life really is.
