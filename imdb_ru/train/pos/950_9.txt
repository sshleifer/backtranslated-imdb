The stage and the actors make this television film the best performance of Dickens's classic tale for me. George S. Scott is very believable, like the rest of the cast. His Scrooge oozes with an abomination to the very end of the film. Then his character changes to the one who has truly repented. A 19th-century English city chosen for scenery creates an atmosphere appropriate for Dickens and adds credibility to this film. This is a movie that I watch every Christmas along with a real Grinch and "It's a beautiful life."
