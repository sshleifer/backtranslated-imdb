With the exception of the awkward scene, this refreshing fairy-tale fantasy has an amusing and delightful shock of adult cynical wit that fascinates its audience, as well as a soundtrack that powerfully drives this fabulous epic. With the exception of one of the scenes of Robert DeNiro, which does not look smooth and out of sync with the tone of the rest of the film, this juicy romantic tale has a magnificent historical feeling, strong magic and a delicate balance between serious Adventure scenes and light spiritual humor. In the renewed PRINCESS BRIDE tradition, this modern presentation of magic and love is captivating. Eight out of ten stars.
