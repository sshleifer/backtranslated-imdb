If the creators of this film made any attempt to present the reality to the plot, it would be just another waste of time, money and creative effort. Fortunately, throwing all the vestiges of reality into the wind, they created a comedic miracle. Who could have missed a film in which an alien pilot conducts the entire film, acting like Jack Nicholson, complete with a Lakers t-shirt. Do not reject this film as trash.
