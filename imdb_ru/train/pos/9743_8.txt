For the first time we watched this film at the festival of new Argentinean films in 2000 at Walter Reade. Although we liked it, we did not think it was unusual. Looking at it a second time, we saw a different meaning in this view of life in Buenos Aires. <br /> <br /> The film takes place on one of the darkest days of Argentina, when the DeLaRua administration ended its activities. The country was in turmoil after the economy, which flourished in the early 1990s, in an artificial climate created by President Menin. It was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen, and people began to live in a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The story begins just as Santamarina, a bank employee, is fired due to the collapse of the economy. Instead of receiving sympathy from his wife, she locks him out of the apartment, and he, for all practical purposes, becomes a homeless person. He takes to the streets, trying to make ends meet. <br /> <br /> Another story introduces us to a young Jew, Ariel, who gives interviews to work in a Spanish company. It is almost a miracle that he gets a job. His father, Simon, owns a small restaurant in the Jewish quarter "El Once" in the city center. The situation gets worse and worse when Ariel's mother dies suddenly. Only Estela, a young woman who is in love with Ariel, comes to the rescue of her father and son. <br /> <br /> Santamarina, a pure man, is forced to take a shower when he can. He chooses the ladies' room at one of the metro stations. When a servant Elsa finds him naked, she becomes furious, but comes to her senses when she understands the unfortunate circumstances of this man who has seen better times. They become romantically involved, and Santamarina finds a baby in one of her street garbage trips. Elsa, being surprised, wants to do the right thing. But Santamarina convinces her that the meaning of an innocent life in their lives will be strengthened by their love. <br /> <br /> Ariel, who met with the magnificent Laura at work, begins a violent and difficult sexual relationship with his beautiful partner. a worker who is unknown to him is involved in a lesbian affair. Ariel, who takes the sensation of photographing weddings and other occasions, has a passion for Laura, but he understands what Estela sacrificed to help her father, and still loves him. <br /> <br /> Daniel Burman, whose “El Abrazo” Partido, we thought was excellent, worked wonders with this film. Things are put in the right perspective after the second viewing lately, and we have to apologize for not understanding this the first time. In any case, the second time the nuances of the on-screen play, written by Mr. Berman and Emiliano Torres, make more sense because they reflect the turmoil that the country was experiencing in those dark days. <br /> <br /> Daniel Hendler, who plays Ariel, collaborated with Mr. Boorman to amazing results. He is not a “pretty movie star,” but he is handsome. This actor projects a great sincerity in his work. Enrique Pineiro is another great surprise. His Santamarina is disarming. Despite all the bad things that fell on him, he maintains a rosy attitude towards everyone he meets. Stephanie Sandrelli, an interesting Italian actress, makes a great contribution to the film with her Elsa. Hector Alterio, one of the best Argentine actors, plays the small part of Simon. Magnificent Chiara Koselli is seen as Laura, and Melina Petrielli as noble Estela. <br /> <br /> “Esperando al mesias” proves that Daniel Boorman is a voice that has to be reckoned with in Argentine cinema.
