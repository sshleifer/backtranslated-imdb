I was so surprised when I saw this film so underestimated ... I understand why some of you do not like this film. His pace is slow, characteristic of Japanese films. However, if you are passionate about a movie like me, you will find that this is not a problem at all. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is the best comedy I've ever seen. "Should we dance?" often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. This is very different from Hollywood, such as Austin Powers or Scary Movies, in which a gag is guaranteed every couple of minutes. Rather, it is a carefree movie that makes you feel good. <br /> <br /> I like the movie because it makes me feel “real.” The plot is simple but enjoyable. I was so glad to see that Sugiyama (the main role) found the meaning of life in dancing. Before I watched the movie, I was a little depressed because of the hard school work. I felt lost. However, this film made me think about the bright side of life. I figured I was in the same boat as Sugiyama; if he could find himself in his hobby, why couldn't I? It reminded me of “exploring my own future” and finding happiness in my daily life. <br /> <br /> It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers. While some of you may find the dance scenes not as perfect as you expect, I like it, because I feel that the characters are really “alive”, learning to dance as the movie goes. > In general, this film inspires optimism and joy. Like a comedy, she does an excellent job. It definitely deserves 10 stars. <br /> <br /> And yes, Aoki is funny :-D
