I pulled some old musicals out of my garage, and this is another one of my favorites. It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli. He won two Oscars for the best picture of 1951 and the best script. The story of an American artist in Paris who is trying to make it big. Nina Foch is a sophisticated hostess and is very interested in helping him, but soon discovers that she loves a guy. Meanwhile, Gene Kelly falls in love with a beautiful maid, Leslie Caron. His main dance partner, and I must say that they are fantastic together on the floor and the rest. The famous French singer Georges Guietary also sings. So if you like good flowing dances and funny scenes filled with Oscar Levant's clever piano fingers, George Gershwinâ€™s songs will live forever in this colorful treasure. 8/10
