I watched this film in 1975 at Birmingham South College, when it was shown in conjunction with Red Balloon. Both films are similar in their fabulous quality. Most of the film tells how the fish happily swims in their bowl, and its new owner, a little boy, at school. The cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl, and begins to carefully pursue his "prey". The boy begins to go home from school, and the viewer wonders if he will arrive in time to save his friend-fish. The fish becomes agitated by the presence of the cat and finally jumps out of the bowl! The cat quickly approaches the fish, gently takes it by the paws and returns it to the bowl. The boy happily returns to his fish, but no wiser. <br /> <br /> The end is striking in its irony and technical complexity. It is hard to imagine how a director could have accomplished a technical feat as far back as 1959 - this seems to be more cunning for 2003. <br /> <br /> If you can find it, look - you will not be disappointed! And if you * find * let me know so that I can also get a copy!
