I saw this movie 12 years ago on TNT. It was Suzanne York's birthday, and they showed this film as a double film with Tom Jones (1963). Since then, I have not seen this movie on TV. I became interested in watching this movie because one of the stars is very funny and talented Jim Dale, like the sailor Lust. I believe Dale is now making the story of the Harry Potter books about Keisett, but in any case he is quite funny. This is a fast-paced comedy. This is not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures should familiarize themselves with its film collection and consider the possibility of restoring and releasing this film on DVD. Christopher Plummer is hilarious, like Lord Fopington, Jan Bannen is also quite funny, like the Rumble Sailor. This is an indecent comedy, a film that no one else sees, with great production value. *** 1/2 stars from ****
