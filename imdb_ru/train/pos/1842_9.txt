Series 2 is a great start! I don’t think you needed to watch series 1 to understand what was going on, but, like in any series, it’s nice to feel some sense of the characters and take care of what happens to them. And this show makes you think so! These 4 30-year-old women seem to lead a glamorous and exciting life, but the premise is believable and realistic. So the turns that occur due to their love and sex life are interesting to watch, but you also know that these are problems that happen with real women. We are talking about decisions that we make as women, and how we are sometimes led in certain ways in our life, and not consciously make this choice!
