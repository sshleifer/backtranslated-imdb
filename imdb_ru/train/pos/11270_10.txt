Make no mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is the most gorgeous Jane, and will never be another gorgeous. She is visually amazing. In addition, in order to make a good film, you need more than a beautiful woman. This is a great movie. He possesses not only the classic aura of Tarzan, but also a sense of the ongoing saga. We become associated with two white hunters who are looking for ivory, one in love with Jane and the other in a crook whose character may be one of the most specific and best studied in cinema history. And it is these characteristics that make this a great action film that stands out as a classic. There is an uncomfortable racism that is depicted. However, Africans are depicted as individuals, and as a result, the two even become more heroic than white hunters, and stand out as such. In fact, the one who is not named, causes the audience more sympathy than any other character. The finale is also one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. The great attack of the lion has never been duplicated, and the horror is well connected with the reactions of the characters to a greater extent than modern films about the bloody flu with a graphic image. If I missed something, it’s because I don’t want to stain the picture for those who haven’t seen it. But that's all you could want in a movie.
