Tressa's vocal performance was outstanding! Tressa played the role of a singer, and Richard was at the club. When she first appeared on the stage and began to riff and flaunt her stuff, it made my soul tremble. Her voice is platinum. She needs to make a disk. She has more fans than she understands. I liked her performance with a stop in five heartbeats, which she also starred in the role of Leon when she was younger. How a little girl can have such a big voice. She is really amazing. Good voice Good Good Good Good Voice Voice Voice Excellent voice Fantastic voice, trembling in the back, tears, raising your spirits, return you to the voice of the day. Tressa, if you read this commit, take my advice and start recording a CD. If not only because of the love of singing, but also for your fans. I believe you can do it. Look at these other single-studio singers hits, lol.
