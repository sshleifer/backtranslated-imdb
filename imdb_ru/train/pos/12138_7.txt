Several features of this film immediately date it. The sound is quite piercing, and you can see how much progress was made in reproducing sound in the following years. The language of the dialogue is rather strange and unnatural, and the acting is still reminiscent of his transition from stage techniques. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis always gives strong results in all his films, as in this early period. her very successful career. However, I feel that in some way, the Cockney accent does not match the facial expression. I think this is Cockney's supposed accent, which doesn't sound believable to me. <br /> <br /> Somerset Mohan loves to delve into human relationships with tremendous drama that will appeal to all movie lovers. As with the many roles of her characters, Bette Davis can move from a beautiful, seductive woman to a viper, full of fiery hatred. Leslie Howard perfectly played the role of a closed English artist, who has a dull leg, desperately looking for a partner and making a bad choice in the cunning little waitress. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the young doctor meets his true love on a busy street. They cross the movement, completely ignoring the multitude of screams and whistles screaming at them. Perhaps this scene should be funny, but I find it quite funny in this, otherwise, very serious movie. It's probably a good idea to send you home with a smile on your face. In the end, as far as we can see (and hope so), this is a happy ending.
