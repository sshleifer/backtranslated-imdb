Saw this film in August at the 27th annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this is the first public show. FILM BIG !!! Derek Luke is great as Antwone Fisher. This young actor has a very bright future. The real Antwone Fisher did a great job of writing the film, and Denzelâ€™s management is focused on money. I see this weekend opening. You will not be disappointed.
