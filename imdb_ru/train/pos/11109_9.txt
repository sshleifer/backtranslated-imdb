The soprano stands out as an airtight, dynamic exploration of American life and how American experience is shaped and determined by money. Placing history in the underworld, David Chase removes all obstacles to grumbling, low ground and outright deconstruction of the postmodern era. <br /> <br /> Each character represents the edge of the American industry. Tony Soprano is an example of hard work, torn between family debt and the need to keep your “business” on an even keel. The rapprochement of these two things is an imperative that makes history move forward. The characters of Christopher, Paulie and Bobby reflect loyal - but self-serving subordinates who are present at every enterprise, who are trusted by necessity and not by merit. With the character of Ralph, Joe Pantoliano writes a brilliant interpretation of a charismatic psychopath, a twisted businessman who thrives from violence, and is tragically outweighed by his stunning earning ability. And Dominic Chianese is the main symbol of the outdated old guard, which maintains power through established relationships and the need for disobedient people to reject guilt. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Sopranos is abrasive and sometimes worrisome, it earned its place as the main television drama. <br /> <br /> PS The Shield will be a good companion to the Chase series, another violent drama that makes even the ugliest characters interesting.
