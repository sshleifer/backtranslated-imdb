Rob Roy - an underrated epos about passion and action! Liam Neeson is an outstanding performer of the role of Rob Roy MacGregor, one of the best in his career. Jessica Lange is flawless like his wife Mary. They have the most passion and chemistry that I saw in a pair of screens. John Hurt gives his best snotty performance aristocrat. Tim Roth portrays one of the great villains on the screen. His rape Mary is disgusting and painful. He is a really great bastard in this movie. The final bout between Rob and Cunningham is one of the best sword fights ever. The script and points are scored, and Michael Cato-Jones's direction is flawless. 10 out of 10.
