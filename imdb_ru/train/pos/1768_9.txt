I haven't laughed at the movie for a long time. I had to go to the preview, and was excited because I could not wait to see it. I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout most of the film. All the audience shared my laugh and clapped and screamed for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Glory to Steve Carrell (of whom I have already been a fan). In this film, he proves his tremendous talent for comedy. He has a style that I have not seen before. And Katherine Keener is superb as always. Thank God there was no cameo from Will Ferrell (I love him, but I saw him too much this summer). <br /> <br /> There were episodes of comic genius in this film. Partly thanks to Carrell, and partly thanks to the writing (also Carrell). The growing scene and the date with the “obvious problem” were absolutely hysterical. <br /> <br /> I’ll definitely watch “The 40 Year Old Virgin” when she comes out. My advice: watch it with a huge laugh and an incredibly enjoyable movie.
