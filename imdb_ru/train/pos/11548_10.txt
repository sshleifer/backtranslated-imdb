Based on the play by Neil Simons, The Odd Couple tells the story of Felix Unger's best friends (Jack Lemmon) and Oscar Madison (Walter Mattau), who eventually shared the massive Oscar notebook after Felix tried to kill himself. <br /> <He had a big fight with his wife because of his obsessive hobbies and strange phobias, and he sends her a suicide telegram. She calls Oscar and tells him what happened. Felix appears at Oscar during his weekly poker game with his friends. Winnie (John Fielder) Murray, a policeman (Herbert Edelman), Roy (David Scheiner) and Speed ​​(Larry Haynes). After some tantrum split, the parties agree that Felix will remain with Oscar. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film tells how these two are such completely different characters. And also about whether Oscar will be able to withstand the truly strange and unique habits and purity of Felix, and whether Felix will be able to endure Oscar with such a sloppy and spontaneous attitude towards everything. Indeed, the film is about two complete opposites living together, about joys, ups, downs and the need for a gift that is friendship. With a great game, an intelligent and very funny script and great Monica Evans and Carol Shelley in the role of the British Dove sisters, who are invited by Oscar on a double date. <br /> <br /> This movie will surely make you laugh, every line is priceless, and Jack and Walter are fantastic with great chemistry. They also turned into a successful and equally funny series with Jack Klugman. Oscar and Tony Randall are like Felix.
