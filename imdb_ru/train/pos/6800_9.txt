Although “Labyrinth” is a derivative, it still remains the main event of the mid-six-year show. Finally, the story allows Welling to show how he grew up as an actor. It is not easy to play a character who embodies “truth, justice, and the American way” on a weekly basis with very small variations. His speech, allowing him to show how to react, if he / she finds out that everything he knew could be a lie, was quite plausible. <br /> <br /> Welling was a great fit for this occasion. <br /> As always, Michael Rosenbaum, like Lex with disabilities, performed just like Kristen Kreuk as too sweet to believe Lana. Allison Mack, the omnipresent Chloe, was also rated as a slightly "mediocre" version. <br /> <br /> The use of annoying hum in the background added tone to the party and made for an attractive drama.
