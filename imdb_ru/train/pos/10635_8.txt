I appreciated photography, textures, colors, and often, in contrast to one comment, lighting. What I lacked was a coherent storyline. I found that it is often fragmented, poorly edited, and sometimes difficult to understand. My version was 110 minutes, IMDb shows one at 125m. Perhaps the cuts and subtitles didn't help. I welcome any films that go beyond the Hollywood form, but that disappointed me. Miss Guillen was bright and all the performances were fine, I just wanted a little more dialogue. If someone would like to see another film that has similarities with it, try Kite Winslet's Ugly Kinki.
