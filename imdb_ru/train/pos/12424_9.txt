I always wanted David Dukhovny to take up the movie business, and finally, he did, and he made me proud. This film justified what I hoped for. Dukhovni played his character very well, he managed to remain consistent with something new, instead of playing Agent Molder, to which we are accustomed. Therefore, I give him an additional rating for his role, also because I could not see anyone else playing this particular character. David was great, but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hatton. A great performance that you never get tired of throughout the entire movie, because it never ceases to amaze you. He has weaknesses and strengths, which makes the story even more believable. I also liked the story very much, it added a good deal to the plot, and I had some very catchy quotes that I still use all the time. This film also had an amazing score. I recommend this for those who love drama and not against blood.
