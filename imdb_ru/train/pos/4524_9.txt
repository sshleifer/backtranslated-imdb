This is a very rare example of a film about transvestitism (about heterosexuals). The film examines the topic of taboo, so that even a wide audience, not knowing at all about transvestitism, will strongly sympathize with his main character. Adrian Pasdar is very believable as Gerald / Geraldine and should not be forgotten for this brilliant game. Directed by Christopher Monger very sensitive to such a complex issue, excellent, packed in a good story. Not a big film, not a “feature film”, but a small, beautiful film!
