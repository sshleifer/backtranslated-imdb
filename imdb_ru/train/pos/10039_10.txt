Titanic is a classic. I was very surprised that this movie didn’t have a solid score, generally in the IMDb user rating. Maybe it's just awesome - not paying tribute to Titanic in our time, but when it was first done, it was really something. When the movie came out, people flocked to the theaters. When it appeared on the video, my sister and I watched it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say that we were obsessed and for a good reason. Some scenes of disaster were hard to forget, for example, a frozen child or a guy who committed suicide after killing someone in an unruly crowd. Many people died on this ship, and to convey this in the film with the spontaneity and emotions that he needed was a difficult task, which James Cameron approached. And let's not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whether their relationship was a figment of someone's imagination, it was beautiful. They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They are damn sure that Romeo and Juliet are running after their money. "I will never let go, Jack." “Titanic” is a great movie, right down to the point. This is a powerful story, told by a brilliant game, great cinematography, beautiful music and a team, full of diligent and dedicated employees. It really is amazing when someone says that they hate this film.
