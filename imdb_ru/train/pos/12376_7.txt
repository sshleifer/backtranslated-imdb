"The Sentinel" (1977) - the film "Star Crazy Mad World", so impressive that it looks almost like "Crazy, mad, crazy world", however, is a rather creepy movie with relatively unknown actress Christina Raines. In this film, she plays the model Alison Parker, who moves to the brown stone of Brooklyn Heights, which (and I don't think I give too much on this late date) is very close to the gates of hell. And as a tenant in this building, she, to put it mildly, suffers from much worse conditions than the leaking plumbing and occasional water mistake! Indeed, the scene in which Alison meets her noisy neighbor upstairs is really awful, and she certainly should send icy water that flows through the spine of most viewers. Despite many critics 'complaints about Raines' acting skills, I thought she was just fine, more than skillfully kept herself in scenes with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The picture is based on a really creepy conclusion, and although some plot points remain unexplained, I was more than pleased. As stated in the DVD Delirium book, “any film with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles in the role of topless lesbian cannibals in bathing suits cannot be bad!” By the way, yesterday I went to 10 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights to look at Sentinel House. Yes, it is still there, and although deprived of its heavy layer of ivy and not having a blind priest / nun in the window on the top floor, it looks about the same as in this picture. If this house really stands at the entrance to hell, as I understand it, hell is ... Brooklyn Royal Highway. But we, New Yorkers, have known this for a long time!
