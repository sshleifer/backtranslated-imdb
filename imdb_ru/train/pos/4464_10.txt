Incredibly ARTISTIC, NOBODY CAN MAKE THEM NOW, I THINK. It seems to be the perfect biggest and greatest musical ever created to listen to beautiful songs. why can't you do something like that now? The Americans were the best, and for that I absolutely show my loyalty to you with this film. There are words to describe the perfection of this film. suddenly my heart sings, what makes the sunset? I easily fall in love, jealousy ... and the scene with Tom and Jerry. the greatest without reserve. if you do not know that your eyes are not open, my friends, you must see and appreciate it ... wake up!
