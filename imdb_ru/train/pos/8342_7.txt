A pretty good romantic comedy in which I don’t think I’ve ever seen how Meg looks prettier. All the players did a good job supporting this lively romp. Of course, in the real world, no brilliant mathematician would even glance at some fat monkey, but that is why I like romantic comedies ... you can just completely forget the reality and have a good time. Good film. Damn, Meg - baby, eh?
