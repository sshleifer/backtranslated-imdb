Christopher Smith is a clear horror fan, and this is clearly stated in his debut horror film, Creep. Creep, although a bit unsure of the information, proves that it is worthy of a real bloody classic. Slightly less glossy than recent American horrors (remake of Amityville Horror, remake of the House of Wax). This dark and horrible story follows Kate (Frank Poten) through a maze of underground tunnels and abandoned railways, while she and a number of others along the way try to escape from the killer. Although some bad reviews have outlined this film, I sincerely believe that with a limited budget and for British production from first director Smith, that “Creep” really lives up to its name. This provides a fast pace of bloodshed, more or less from the very beginning, sometimes too quickly, because in some areas the story is heterogeneous, but with the ideal location and the best character response at the end I have ever seen, Creep offers some scenes that cause nightmares.
