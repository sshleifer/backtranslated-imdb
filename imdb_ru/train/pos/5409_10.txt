I love this movie so much! The animation is great (for the Pokemon movie), the cgi looks so cool. I love the music in the movie. So great that they preserved Japanese music. <br /> <br /> As for the story, that's great. He has a wonderful feeling of friendship. Chelebi is a very cute and powerful pokemon. Ash is really great in this movie, and I love his friendship with Sam. The only thing I didn’t like was Suykune’s appearance, he just suddenly shows up, helps Ash and leaves a little. They could make his role in the film a little more. <br /> <br /> But overall, awesome movie! Can't wait to have the USA version on DVD!
