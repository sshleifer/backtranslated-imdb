I finally sat down and saw this movie all the way, and I must say, I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses - it's not just that she * can * play, but also that she chooses the roles that suit her best, more meaningful and important than it seems at first sight. I read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some terrible feminist, as they thought in advance, but I certainly do not agree. Diana is a feminist. She watches her dreams and believes in herself despite what almost everyone around her thinks (with the exception of her caring brother Tini and her coach and manager, Hector, who turns out to be more of a father than her real parent), and this is what the Word "feminism" is all about. It's nice to see films like this show the true side of feminism - that they are not a bunch of losers, but that they have dreams and they can do anything. Diana is true to herself, still falling prey to love, and she has a more realistic, complex relationship with Adrian, and not just something magical. Girlfight is a true taste of reality, and he brought me faith in my perception of people. Thank you, Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - A very important film that is important not only for young women, but also for all who want to move far ahead in their lives.
