The painting “The Bride” depicts a realistic and touching portrait of how Japanese men should have looked like they were brought to Hawaii at the beginning of the 19th century to work in the fields of sugarcane. Most of them were planning to return home, but only a few were able to do it. Equally touchingly depicted is the fate of Japanese women, some of whom are only fifteen or sixteen years old, who were sent as promised brides to men whom they knew only from photographs that were often outdated by 10 or 15 years, or were from some other young human, They also worked a lot in the fields, fighting homesickness and preserving their dignity. <br /> <br /> Director Hatta portrays the courage and perseverance of a single bride struggling to survive in a foreign country and in an alien society under immense physical coercion, ultimately inspiring and uplifting - the story of moral and cultural survival. Picture Bride has the grandeur and grandeur of character and landscape coverage that captures the enchanting beauty as well as the harsh harshness of colonial Hawaii. This is a film that is emotionally, intellectually and artistically useful.
