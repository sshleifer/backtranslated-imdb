These days, Spielberg's "The Purple Purple" is mainly remembered for nominating him for eleven Oscars and winning zilch. Even more alarming, Spielberg himself was not even nominated for the best director. Needless to say, the filmmakers deserved more recognition than they were given. <br /> <br /> The story concerns the trials and tribulations of Seli Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African American woman who was first dominated by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband. The film covers several years and focuses mainly on the relationship with the women around her. He is told from a definitely feminine point of view, but you don’t need to fear that it is a “sugar click”. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting, sometimes animated with humor, although the struggle of the central character is of paramount importance. Some may not appreciate the change in tone by the end of the film, but I don’t mind, although such content in a smaller film would probably make me roll my eyes. <br /> <br /> The film received three Academy Award nominations for Whoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress). I think Goldberg and Winfrey certainly deserved, and Danny Glover was unreasonably tense. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, Spielberg did not receive the nomination “Best Director” for his efforts. Such an omission breeds faith, since Spielberg’s direction is first-class. I'm not particularly crazy about Quincy Jones, but he is not below average anyway. <br /> <br /> In the end, the story is satisfactory, well-told by the master cinematographer from Pulitzer Prize material. Try it, and you will probably be as puzzled as I am about how this can be so badly addressed on the night of the Oscars.
