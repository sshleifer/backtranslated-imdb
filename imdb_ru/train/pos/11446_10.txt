Right at this moment I watch this film a second time (on TV), and the second time I got into it, when it was shown for an hour already (I think I saw 2 more minutes this time) This film is really impressive How Goldsworthy looks at nature, changes nature as you yourself would never have thought, really amazing. This whole film makes you feel warm when it plays with the outside world with such love. Or just seeing his hands covered in dirt and with broken nails, it just touches you.
