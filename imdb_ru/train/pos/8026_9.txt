Throughout the film, you might think that this film is only for children. Well, it’s mainly aimed at them, but it’s also quite rounded, with jokes that also appeal to adults in the audience. This time, the Muppet brigade is trying to get on Broadway, due to the difficult conditions that prevent them from producing it, which causes them to split. But Kermit will not stop, and his determination will not take long to wait until, after the conclusion of the transaction, he is hit by a car and sent to amnesia! <br /> <br /> This is part of the old star cars of the 40s with musicals, which are in fact the theme of the musical, only here there is the usual variety of zenicism and wonderful moments thrown into the pot. hysterically funny moments (Louise's boomerang fish; demonstration of the Gonso water, a whisper campaign, among many others), but also with a big heart. The authors of the Muppet are not shy of agreements, on the contrary, they perceive them to such an extent that it is almost nice to see such a story “let's make a show” where through the crowd they think that the characters will meet their dream. <br /> <br /> Although not as original in scope as the film Muppets, it has many memorable and memorable songs, great places throughout Manhattan, and even some intonations of interspecies dating (and marriage)! Cameos include Lisa Minnelli (“frog?”), Elliot Gould (as a cop), Brooke Shields (suggested by a rat), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines, and Joan Rivers. So get ready to sing along or just laugh a lot and romantic (yes romantic) times with one of the best films of Muppet.
