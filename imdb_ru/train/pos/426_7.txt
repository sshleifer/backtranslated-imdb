Scrolling through this film on Fox on a lazy Friday night, I can't think of a better way to spend a lazy Friday night than putting my two cents. Especially when you consider the lack of user comments. Doesn't every film, good or bad, deserve more than four comments? And this film is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> The first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like “April Love” is to recall the era with which it appeared, in this case, the end of the fifties. The films were then pretty much a happy medium. The cinemas were devoid of tragedy, while the screens were filled with Technicolor widescreen films to distract people from the gray highlights of the wicked environment in a box called television. I do not know how many people were torn off the boob tube to see this one, but I managed to get my attention for 97 minutes. <br /> <br /> Teenager Idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover, a young teenager. They were sent to live with their aunt Henrietta (Janet Nolan) and Uncle Jed (Arthur O'Connell) into the country after they were put on probation for carjacking. It seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son (Jed Junior), so Uncle Jed seems to have lost interest in life. Aunt Henrietta hopes that Nick, who is on the farm, will somehow bring Jed out of his despondency. Storylines like them, Jed and Nick, of course, don't care too much about each other. Jed then meets with neighbors Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones) Templeton. Jed immediately falls in love with Fran, and, of course, I do not need to say that Liz falls in love with Jed. Then there is the matter with Uncle Jed's horse, a trotter who went berserk and would not allow anyone to deal with him after the death of Jed Junior. You could probably fill in everything that happens from now on, on your own, seeing how it happens. no real surprises. It does not matter, however, you will still have fun. <br /> <br /> As soon as you are done with the image of a creaky, pure Pat Boone, supposedly a bad boy, you will not have problems with the rest of the film. Given this, Boone does demonstrate surprisingly good results, like Nick. Of course, the role does not require much depth, but still it’s a job well done when you least expect it. Like Jed, Arthur O'Connell is the perfect choice for this role. In the beginning he is out of reach and cold, but when he slowly heats up to Nick, we see that he is a really pretty good guy. Jeanette Nolan is very funny, like Henrietta, who constantly plays the role of intermediary between Jed and Nick. Shirley Jones takes a break from Rogers and Hammerstein and gets several opportunities to decorate us with his singing talents. Like Liz, she is gorgeous in appearance, gorgeous to listen to and quite amusing at times. Dolores Michaels as Fran, which is a little wilder, is equally interesting. <br /> <br /> The best thing about “April Love” is that there is not some kind of mean character on the screen. , Not one real villain in all this. It's damn nice to everyone that you can't not enjoy the movie. I sincerely find it quite refreshing, sort of like forgetting about your problems and enjoying a summer outing with friends. Think of this as an old Andy Griffith show with musical numbers, a bit of a big plot and a widescreen Technicolor. The songs are a mixed bag, the best of which is the title song April Love. Another thing I really liked was that they didn’t use blue backgrounds during the racing sequences, and because of that they were a bit more interesting and exciting. In fact, you will find the entire film beautifully photographed, and it was nice to see that they did not save in this department. Chemistry between Jones and Boone is good. Best of all, the way hostility is portrayed between Nick and Jed, as each attempt somehow earns the respect of others. <br /> <br /> This movie will never be confused with great cinema. However, sometimes instead of going to Disneyland, you just need to have a good time in the park, and this is what April Love is. <br /> <br /> My rating: B + <br /> <br />
