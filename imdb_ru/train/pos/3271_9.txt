I have always been a big fan of this film, first, you saw the cast, the acting is great and helps this film move very well. Cybill Shepard received excellent reviews about her role, and they were well deserved. The beginning of this film begins in the past, when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill), whose perfect marriage completely stops when her husband Louis dies unexpectedly. Fortunately, Lowes gets a second chance at life when he agrees to be “recycled” back to earth, like newborn Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex continues to live his new life, forgetting his past life, while Corinne tries to get along with her. But fate crosses Alex's path 23 years later, when he meets daughter Corinne Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and suddenly is flooded with many unwanted memories (this is where the most interesting begins and awkward situations arise.) The music is gorgeous, and the scene is hearty and very sweet. You will not be disappointed if you give him a chance, most likely you will like it. Very funny and cute!
