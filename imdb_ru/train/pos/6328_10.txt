So nice to see how one great work of art turns into another without distortion and contrivances. I did not know how such an unusual work of literature can be recreated as a film that is worth seeing. If you liked Bulgakovâ€™s book, you would obviously be afraid that some kind of erroneous interpretation would be made more for the sake of an art film project than to actually bring the deeper meaning of the story to the screen. There are several examples of this with the Master and Margarita. No matter how complicated and far-fetched the story, the film does not miss anything. The creator of the film reads the work of Bulgakov as if the conductor orchestra reads the score - without a missing note. Why can't we find such talent here in the USA? So now my favorite book and movie have the same title.
