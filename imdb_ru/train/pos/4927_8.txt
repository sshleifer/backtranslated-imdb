Just a comment on the accents of New Orleans ... <br /> <br /> The previous reviewer noted the following: “This film may have been filmed in New York or another northern large city, because it presents us with speaking characters more like “Broklynese” than perhaps the southern accent that can be heard in this part of the country. ” There was also another comment about this from an English reviewer. <br /> <br /> Many people in New Orleans, in fact, sound "Broklin." I never found out why. (This is mentioned in John F. Kennedy Thule's “Confederation of Boobies.”) I always appreciate the films taking place in New Orleans that include this detail, like this one. Too often, this is just a Hollywood version of the standard southern accent.
