In a word - great. This is a movie. Go and see. Director Ron Howard ... I mean, director Ron Howard did a fantastic job, as usual. Incredible attention to detail, vibrant colors and scenery, an exciting Whoville atmosphere, an amazing variety of costumes Wait, that's not all - the story is also very good. There is clearly a message that will be learned from it by thoughtful viewers. Jim Carrey is top notch. He is probably the best Grinch. The girl, Taylor Momsen, is very good. I am sure that she has a great future. The dog is cool. In general, this is a very high-quality Christmas tale. If you like fairy tales, this is for you. If you like Christmas, it is for you. <br /> <br /> Read other reviews here ... Get a life. Every time it hurts me to see people who ... well ... whose hearts were two sizes smaller.
