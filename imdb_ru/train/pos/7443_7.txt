An old saying goes: "If you think you have a problem, visit the hospital." This has been updated in recent years to "If you think you have a problem, watch a television talk show ... especially Jerry Springer!" This film is one of those so bad, it's good! That's why I gave him a seven - everything is fine, but not great. This is a great way to spend 95 minutes, just like a daily talk show is advertised as “The Hour of Your Life You Will Never Return!” All familiar topics here ... unfaithful husbands / guys, the wildest audience on television, women showing Jerry and so on. D. Shocker watched Molly Hagan, who usually plays cute characters ("Seinfeld" and "Hermann's Head") playing trailer-trailer and Jamie Pressly ("My name is Earl") as her equally wicked daughter, providing sexual services almost every man with whom they came in contact. Men (including a full-time producer) were presented as typical talkers who deserved what they got. I do not want to spoil everything or disclose, but the film plays like a daily show. Here, in Phoenix, he shows up for two hours every morning, and after that everything else seems pale. Again, I give this movie seven ... it's good, but not great. Jerry Springer is best taken in small doses for one hour.
