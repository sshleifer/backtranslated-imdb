SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry are a classic cartoon with a flawless idea, and almost every short short is a gem. Although I must say that this is definitely the worst shorts compared to other classic Tom and Jerry shorts, you can't hate this cartoon. Of course, it’s understandable that this is one of the worst of the first episodes with Tom and Jerry, and I can say that I agree, but the fact is that all the episodes with Tom and Jerry are great, but some are simply better than others. Well, it would fit into "others." <br /> <br /> Here is the plot of Fraidy Cat. Tom listens to the old scary radio program and is easily frightened. Jerry notices how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is. He creates terrible dilemmas for Tom, and Tom gets scared by his mind and his life. Then Jerry puts the sheet on the vacuum cleaner and controls it, giving the impression that the vacuum is a ghost. Tom finds out that Jerry has done all this and is following him. Then Tom accidentally bites the maid. However, in the end, Jerry ends up getting frightened after seeing his reflection in a cup of flour. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not the best option for Tom and Jerry, but it’s still a fun and entertaining part of the time. I want more such cartoons. The blindness and gags in this, making Tom and Jerry famous, are just as good as always in this short film, but it seemed that there was something missing in it. It was slower than most Tom and Jerry shorts. In any case, this is a good short film that doesn’t quite fit some other cartoons about Tom and Jerry, but is still good. <br /> <br /> 7/10
