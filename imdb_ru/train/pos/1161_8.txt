It was an extremely low budget (in some scenes, it looks like they were recorded using a home video recorder). However, he has a good storyline and is easy to follow. Eight years after her desperate father was shot, Amanda was released from the psychiatric ward with the help of her doctor, with whom she secretly began an affair. The doctor ends up renting her house and buying her a car. But during the first 20 minutes of the film, Amanda kills him and buries him in the backyard. Then she sees that her neighbor Richard looks at him and stops at nothing until she gets him. She behaves innocently, but after another neighbor Buzz learns that Amanda killed this doctor and tried to kill Richards' wife Laurie (after Amanda and he got him in the jacuzzi). Then she stops behaving so innocently and kills Buzz, and then tries to kill Richard, whom she supposedly loves and cares. And you have to rent a movie to find out if Amanda dies or not. In general, a good movie reminds me a lot of my life, you know that everyone falls in love with a neighbor and does not stop at nothing until he separates him.
