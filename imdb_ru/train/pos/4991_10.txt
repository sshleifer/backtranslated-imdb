It's a shame that this film is so hard to get in the USA. I found this through a rare video dealer, and it was definitely worth it. This is without a doubt the best film made in the pre-coding era, and the best film of the 1930s. The masterful director Frank Borzazh made great films about the Depression, and with the help of the MALE CASTLE he created a fairy tale among the difficulties of the era. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have excellent chemistry between them, and they help make this movie a wonderful novel. Trine Young is sweet and hopeful, while Bill Tracy is rude and closed. The dynamics between the characters creates one of the most difficult, but in the end, fruitful relationship in the film. <br /> <br /> THE MEN'S LOCK is the softest pre-code film I've ever seen. Borzaghe uses vague and dreamy technique to transform the squatter village, where Bill and Trina live in the palace. The difficulties of Depression are never ignored, in fact they are an integral part of the film. But since Borzage sees the film as a soft-focus fairy tale, the love between the characters makes the situation less harsh. This makes the film warm and affectionate. <br /> <br /> THE MEN'S LOCK is the crowning achievement of the pre-coding era. If more people could see it.
