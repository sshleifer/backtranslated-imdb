Never heard of this movie, saw it on DVD. A great movie, a great example of a movie in which every cast made it work. No typical Hollywood film is exaggerated with the same old actors. I shot all the performances in this film. Memories of my own military experience after the Vietnam War. He was focused on the people who were sent to fight. As depicted characters who had fears and emotions, even if some volunteered for service. They were also ordinary people, some were simply not meant for military life, I remember a few of my experiences - to put it mildly, I could not adapt to military life - but I will never forget them - I had to stay connected. I highly recommend it and then think about those serving in Afghanistan today. Basic training is a trip, note that these instructor sergeants are not morning people, and maybe they need a “sensitivity training” HA! HA! HA!
