I saw it as a previous viewer by chance, I already watched it twice. I really liked it, no stupid thoughts, just good fun entertainment, good songs, good characters and just a nice movie. I highly recommend those of us who just love to watch movies and not analyze them. Great fun for the whole family. I didn’t know that Rosie Alvarez was played by Vanessa Williams, she’s great and very hot. Songs such as One Boy and One last Kiss are really nice to listen to and listen to Jason Alexander - the exact opposite of his character in Pretty Woman and very good. Tyne Daly is still remembered by Cagney and Lacey, and her voice and accent still hold memories. In general, I just loved it and will search to buy it if it is available.
