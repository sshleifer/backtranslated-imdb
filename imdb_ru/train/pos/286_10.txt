I read a lot of commits when it was in theaters, and they were all bad ... I think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these movies. If you are not the person who enjoyed Walton or Little House ... You will neither understand nor enjoy these films ... <br /> <br /> Now about love that was left with joy ... I knew that he is the bad news of the beginning of the movie .... I wish he was showing more of the end, and did not let you just think about it. This film is directly related to Jeff ... this is 6 years later, so you know that he will be interested in girls. <br /> <br /> I want to say that I liked all 4 films so far. ... did not go crazy over the books ... I can not wait for the next movie. The way Clark talks will always help you. I would really like Jan Jones to appear ... Maybe a family reunion or something like that.
