Personally, this is one of my favorites for all time! No, I'm not 10 .. I'm 30! I have an old, original VHS of this, which I bought from a rental store. I watched it countless times. <br /> <br /> Although it is a fun movie for children, it is an intriguing movie for adults. I once saw this movie while I was .. not sober. my eyes opened to what I had never noticed before. I saw that morality is strongly encouraged, both openly and somewhat subconsciously ... I would like to recall everything that I noticed, in particular, but since then a lot of time has passed. Rest assured, there are many things that are mentioned throughout the movie. if you have the opportunity to watch it .. not sober .. do so, you will not be disappointed .. in fact, you will probably feel pretty happy and warm. wonderful!
