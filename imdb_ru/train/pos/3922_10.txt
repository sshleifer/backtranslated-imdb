Carmen is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Itâ€™s hard to say whose performance is better: Antonio Hades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are great. They dance their souls. This is a beautiful story about the inseparability of life and myth; myth penetrates everyday life. Dance becomes life, and all life is danced. Real people at the same time live their lives and become someone else, playing the role of old lovers. The magic goes on.
