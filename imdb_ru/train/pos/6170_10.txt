I saw this film at the Taos Film Festival last year and was just stunned. It is a rich, warm affair that came out on the screen, beautifully played and well directed. More than anything, he reminded me of David Lin's films, both in his ability to cope with a complex story and his ability to create powerful scenes that affect you on several different levels. The best movie I've seen in recent years.
