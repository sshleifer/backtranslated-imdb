If you are not affiliated with the world of Gundam, this is a good place to start. If you burned in Star Wars or Star Trek, here’s an exciting, realistic science fiction series that you can dive into. It’s not the simplistic story about the robot that “saves the world in a giant” that you could expect, but rather the complex, emotionally convincing drama about space war, in which the line between the “good” and “bad” guys is definitely not different. <br /> <br /> Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of Al Izuruha, a young, naive boy living in a neutral space colony. He spends his days dreaming about mobile suits and playing war with his friends. During this series, Al became friends with the “enemy” soldier Bernie Wiseman. In the end, little Al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the necessary suffering and sacrifices. <br /> <br /> I liked this OAV series with its cool fur designs, including history and cute characters. I recommend this series to anyone who loves the realistic SF anime, or those who consider the anime to be just silly or sexual entertainment.
