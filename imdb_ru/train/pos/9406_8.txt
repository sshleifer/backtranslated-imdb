Other commentators described in detail the story, as well as social parables and comments (or better) that I could, but I would like to join my admiration for this little gem of the film. He keeps very well more than 50 years later in each category - script, acting, photography, set design, sound design ... it's really a kind of classic. This was my first acquaintance with the “young” Alec Guinness, and from the first shots it is clear what made him so special as to end up with a knighthood. <br /> <br /> I only rate it as “8,” because this is, in fact, a rather light parable that explores human nature, but does not really distort it; and because at the end the plot takes an easy way out, instead of actually resolving the conflict between the inventor and the factory workers and the industrialists who pursue him throughout the city. In addition, a couple of minutes of reflection reveals the main flaw in the logic of the scenario - wear and tear is almost never the determining factor when buying new clothes (especially fashionable clothes); children grow up, people change sizes, gain and lose weight, they constantly walk in fashion and as long as the looms are woven. And if it were nothing else, the manufacturer would have made a fortune by providing indestructible material for military uniforms (especially BDU). <br /> <br /> Still, this is a great movie. If you have a chance to see it on the channel of a classic film, you should.
