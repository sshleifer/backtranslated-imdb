It was a great movie with a good story. My children (10, 7, 5 and 4) loved this film, including me. The music was also fantastic. No, the horses do not speak, but instead the story is told by the Spirit. And to hear the story told from the point of view of the horse, if the look was funny. <br /> <br /> I think the name speaks for itself, "spirit." This film really gives you a sense of family and home and friends. I have to say that my 4-year-old boy and 5-year-old girl were really touched by this film, and even got carried away with it, they laughed so hard, and in the end they cheered up. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the “Spirit” in your family and lift your spirits with this soul story. Your kids will love this. I think you too.
