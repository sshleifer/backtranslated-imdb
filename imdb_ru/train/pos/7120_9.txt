Most of the war films made in the USA during World War II were very interesting to watch, but they suffered from serious gaps in realism because they were produced more for propaganda value in order to cheer up at home than anything else. I do not knock on these films, as many of them are still very watchable. However, due to the fact that they so often lack realism, they are deprived of the opportunity to be really great films. An excellent example was the John Garfield Air Force film, in which the B-17 almost alone destroys half of the Japanese Air Force! Nevertheless, Pride Of The Marines is a long-awaited departure, which received high marks for portraying the true story quite accurately. When I first saw this film, I thought it was NOT a true story, because it seemed too unbelievable to be true. However, after further research, I discovered that this is actually quite true for the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the Medal of Honor. This is one case where real life seemed too unbelievable to be true!
