Even long-time Shirley fans may be surprised by “Now and Forever.” Was the film shot at Paramount Studios ?? not with the twentieth century Shirley Fox parent company ?? in 1934, before Fox Darryl Zanuck producer perfected Shirley's successful formula (cute songs, cold hearts for her to melt, young couples for her to play cupid, happy endings) So “Now and forever” falls in the category of Shirley cars without a standard Shirley story. This is an embarrassing position for any movie, but this impressive, talented cast makes it work. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper and star Carol Lombard are funny, irresponsible scammers Jerry and Tony Day. The only thing that this devoted but unsuccessful duet seems to hate more than being together is separation. When they suddenly come under the care of Jerry Penny's little daughter (Shirley Temple), is that Tony? and not a penny, as many believe ?? who convinces Jerry to abandon his criminal career. But Jerry flounders in his workplace and trying desperately to prove that he can provide for his new family, he soon returns to theft and dishonesty. In the standard device, Shirley Penny tries to melt the heart of crunchy jerk Felix Evans, the victim of one of Jerry's minuses, but her attempt failed because Evans, as it turns out, is a fraud and he blackmails Jerry to help him steal the gems. The ensuing drama, firefights, death and sadness make this film very unusual for Little Miss Sunshine. There is no happy ending, no dancing, there is only one sequence of songs (a nice number “The world owes me life”). <br /> <br /> But that doesn’t mean that Shirley fans should avoid the Now and Forever. ” Rather, this deviation from the usual story of Shirley makes her more interesting and memorable than many of her other films. But be careful: you should avoid the color version of this film and watch it in black and white if you can. The color is bright, sharp and unreal, and in many scenes Shirley's famous curls are actually red, not light. Clap!
