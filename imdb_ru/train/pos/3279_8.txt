I'm glad it is available on DVD now. This film is a great example of the triumph of content and style over flashing lights with empty heads and constant loud noises. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you have a short amount of attention or you lack the ingenuity and imagination to interact with a literary story, you will not like this movie. The reasons for this are quite simple, but, unfortunately, are rarely achieved: Matthew Jacobs did a fantastic job of successfully transferring the story of Catherine Storr of Mariannaâ€™s Dreams into the script. An unenviable task that anyone who has seen the movie from the book will probably recognize. <br /> <br /> The casting is great, allowing director Bernard Rose to use actors as is rarely seen now; they indulge in acting skills! I know, I know that the actors are doing their job and acting, instead of foolishly robbing the camera lens, and a kaleidoscope of car chases, explosions and shootouts around them is indeed a rare pleasure, but in fact it happens in this film. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the final reason that this film is for a creative thinker, and not for a bulldog reader - besides a solid script, direction and action, it relies on the atmosphere, suspense and hidden horror. If this can be categorized as horror, then the presentation of The Paper House is more like Sophocles than Tobe Hooper. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you like a lot of loud sounds, explosions, constant noise, cuts and bright flashing colors, you'd better watch Transformers, but if you like a disturbing story that unfolds through skillful and evocative use telling stories without offending your intellect, forcibly feeding you with cacophonous nonsense, then it might just be the thing.
