I read a lot of comments on this site criticizing The Blob for being stupid and / or amiable. The film was accused of an amateur game and weak special effects. What would you expect from a group of people whose only experience was in producing low-cost locally-produced (Valley Forge PA) Christian Shorts. Let me tell these overly critical reviewers that this film was never perceived as serious. This fact should be evident from inappropriate music themes, full of silly lyrics, played in the opening credits. For what it was supposed to be, this film is excellent. I have seen several recent attempts at an ultra-low budget, one of which was the Blair Witch project, which has absolutely no entertainment value or intellectual thought behind their plot. BWP was pure excrement. Blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well written and informative. The scene where the old man encounters a meteorite and pokes the mass contained inside with a stick was perfectly done and really creepy. The scene in the doctor's office, in which Blob was slowly moving under a blanket on a gurney while he was consuming the old man, was a cinematic masterpiece of horror. The bottom line is that I love this movie. I urge everyone to take $ 120,000, blown up to today's dollar value, and make the film somewhere as interesting and or as successful as Blob. It is simply impossible to do. TERM! <br /> <br /> Thanks for taking the time to read this review.
