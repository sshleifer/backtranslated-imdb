Does anyone know what it was for 2 sports cars? I think Robert Stack may have been Masseratti. Roca Hudson’s character told his father that he is getting a job in Iraq, isn’t it timely? I had Dorty Malone in my slap bank for most of my life, maybe it was a movie that impressed me. Lauren Bacall did have some chops in this film and probably beat Malone, but the role of Malones had a more sensational effect, so she won an Oscar for best minor role. Was the role of Lauren the main role? The character of the old man Hadley was probably a fairly common picture of the magnates of his era, in which he was an ordinary guy who succeeded in a growing industry, but in creating the whole city, he forgot his children for his wife to raise them. Over time, as a widow, he realized that this was all he really had, and they were spoiled rotten, looking for attention, so instead of trying to communicate with his children, he blew his head off. Ancient morality tale. But seriously, what were these sports cars?
