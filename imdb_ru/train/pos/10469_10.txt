I remember seeing promo for this show before it appeared in 1993. I was then 8 years old, and now, at the age of 22, I find it strange to see the beginning and end of this cult show and look back at it. All the 90s it suddenly seems so far away that a great decade. In any case, I watched MonsterVision all the time, since I'm a big fan of monster films and horror films. It was like the version of the Chiller Theater of the 90s. If MST3K can get a DVD, why not Joe Bobâ€™s show, at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. Many of Joe's comments and information about the films were just fun. Most of the films shown on the show were class B or C, but there were a lot of A house films as well as Hammer films from England that are top-notch, as well as many of them with the stately stop engine of Ray Harrihausen. Many were strange films that you would not see anywhere else, like Japanese science fiction films, except, of course, Godzilla, which is familiar to almost everyone and independent films, such as Metal Storm and Motel Hell. I think that with the new Decade of film conservation and more independent filmmakers, MonsterVision will be a good show for IFC, since they already have a hit with an IFC show. I am sure that this show will be resumed for reasons of nostalgia, I think we will have to wait and see. Until then, "This is Great Television"!
