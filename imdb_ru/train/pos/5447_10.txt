Personal rules of taste when it comes to films like this precious little gem. Back in the eighties, early eighties, I discovered this film, like many released at that time, "Night Patrol", "Bad Manners" or even "The King of Brotherhood", artwork and stains on the back of the covers, seduced and teasing you. <br /> <br /> Of course, at that age, the films I already mentioned, as well as such things as “Worms” and many others, struck the imagination, and, fortunately, many years later I still remember some with love, and some with contempt, many films that help me maintain a love for a genre like parodies or plastic. <br /> <br /> Shot after many years after the huge success of Animal House and seeing how it sank over the years, I now know that this film will not overshadow the box office mentioned above and will not remain in memory, as during the holidays in the National Lamphun. <br /> <br /> Honestly, not everything that carried the national Lampoon logo was a wild success, but “Class Reunion” remains one of my favorite films of all time, with instantly recognizable characters such as alienated Bob Spinnaker, played Gerrit Graham is perfect, so good in Charles Band's “Terrorvidev,” still living in the past glories of his youth. Or how about a bold and bold turn of Stephen Furst when the lazy drunk sex of high school students went crazy with Hubert Downes. <br /> <br /> Sweet as. What makes me think. As I said, personal taste does not stand. People can be so cruel, so they will never get any awards and can not be compared with their peers in the world of comedy. It has some virtues. Being one of the earlier scenarios written by John Hughes, which later became one of my favorite works “Strange Science”, as well as the beautiful title of the theme performed by the great Gary USA Bonds. <br /> <br /> What else can I say, this is a film that is waiting to be discovered, again and again.
