Geniuses William Cameron Menzies and HG Wells create this extraordinary film with expectations, ambitions and scales that are difficult to find today. They predict a second world war and a method of attacking the UK, as well as the fact that a space race will follow the war. They change the time; In the film, war and space exploration are much longer, but there are so many qualitatively correct things that it is amazing. We even see a helicopter (a movie older than them). <br /> <br /> Unforgettable giant planes and futuristic meritocracy of scholars who seem to be Romans wearing bubble helmets: if you see through these funny costumes, you can appreciate the modern architecture of the masters of the 30s, the Well vision in a rationalistic society, interesting thoughts about the nature of power and John Kabbalah as the archetype of an adventurous and inventive person who chooses to shape reality, rather than being shaped by it. <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 out of 10. Inspiring, like this last monologue of John Cabala.
