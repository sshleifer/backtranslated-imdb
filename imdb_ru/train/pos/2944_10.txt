These are the hands of the greatest show ever. I saw a lot of concerts, was on the show and watched Comic View from Bet, but I never saw anyone who could compare with the skills of Murphy in this show. The impressions are excellent, the parody is excellent, and the time is perfect. You can even say that the crowd has really entered. When he did Raw a few years later, it was really good, but this is # 1 in my book. Also shows that at one time, especially in the early and mid eighties, Murphy was funny. My favorite part of the show is when he recounts a family barbecue and "Ice cream !!! Mmmmmmm !! Ice cream is coming !!!!" Another great part is where his mom is like Clint Eastwood.
