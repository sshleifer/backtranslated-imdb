Since the title is written in English, and IMDb lists the main language of this show as English, I will focus on reviewing the English version of Gundam Wing (2000), presented in the Bandai set released on DVD. My real review for the entire series is in the IMDb article "Shin kidô senki Gundam W" (1995). <br /> <br /> Very little has changed with regard to the plot, the script and the characteristics of its adaptation to the English language and it really depends on your taste to choose which language to watch this show. Purists may stick to the Japanese language as much as they like, but for a more “realistic” experience, I recommend the English composition, since all the characters, except Heero Yuy, are not Japanese. . (Most of them are in fact Caucasians with a pair of non-Japanese Asians.) On the one hand, the characters of the characters are more “directly” than in the Japanese version. The contrast between the characters is stronger due to some - or performances, but a very good acting group. <br /> <br /> Wing Gundam pilot Hero Yu is a highly skilled soldier who suppresses his emotions, but slowly realizes the value of his humanity. Voiced by Mark Hildrett, who’s non-returnable supply can be criticized as “bad behavior,” but it fits very well with Hiro’s personality. <br /> <br /> Maxwell's duo from the Gundam of Deathscythe, always cheerful in the face of death, gets a crash course to appreciate the value of life and friends. He is arguably the best character on the show, masterfully played by Scott McNeil. He may seem too old for his age, but Duo's English voice easily identifies his annoying nasal Japanese. <br /> <br /> Troy, the pilot of Heavyarms, is a lost lonely soul, whose sole purpose so far has been to fight; despite his inner desire to connect with people around him, he only knows how to kill, not to be friends. Kirvi Morrow plays a dark but realistic role in the role of Troy Burton. <br /> <br /> The winner of Quatre Rebarba Winner is voiced by Brad Sueyl, who has no problems showing the caring nature of the character and destroying his innocence, experiencing horrors. war and death first hand. The great advantage is that Quatre no longer looks like a girl (and yes, it is voiced by an actress in the Japanese version), and a kind-hearted, typical 15-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> The impulsive but determined Wufei Chang, voiced by Ted Cole, may seem a bit excessive, but it contrasts sharply with the more muted roles of Heero and Trowa. <br /> <br /> Relena Darlian sounds older in English, voiced by Lisa Ann Bailey. This may not correspond to her young personification at the beginning of the series, but as her character becomes more mature in history, her voice follows her example and ultimately fits very well with the character's development. <br /> <br /> Zechs Merquise to be one of the most radically changed voices compared to the Japanese version. Both voices show different sides of the same character. His Japanese voice is arrogant, authoritative and respectful, in accordance with its high status and charismatic character. His English voice, Brian Drummond, is more restrained, sounds more insidious and “like a snake,” emphasizing Zeh’s secretive character with regard to his hidden plans and firm faith in his ideals. <br /> <br /> OZ members are a mixed bag indeed. Treiz Kushrenada, voiced by David Kay, gets a more realistic and practical presentation compared to his Japanese style of speech. However, Lady Un does not convey her split personality as contrastingly as in the Japanese version, and Lukrencia Noin simply sounds ......... most of the time is boring. The pilots and military leaders of cannon meat guns also have nothing to talk about. <br /> <br /> I would appreciate it if they took the time to give different characters different accents reflecting their ethnic background. The voices of Maganak Corporation, as a rule, did not inspire, but could have been more interesting if they had been given Middle Eastern accents. The members of the Romerfeller Foundation would also sound better with some cool European accent, reflecting their noble status. <br /> <br /> Despite the overwhelming actions of third-party characters, the main cast succeeds in carrying the show, and this results in a generally less excessive and more realistic performance of the Gundam Wing script. Very faithful to the original Japanese script, keeping all the main thoughts provoking ideas and topics about politics, war, and human nature. Unfortunately, it also retains the flaws of the original Japanese writing.
