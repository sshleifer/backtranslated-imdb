I think that many viewers have completely missed the fact that this is obviously a parody of Western films. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad film - it’s a clever tongue in your cheeks about westerns. I do not believe that this film for a moment, took himself seriously. <br /> <br /> What makes this film even more unique is the fact that it has four strong, beautiful women at its center, two of whom are black, one Asian and one Mexican / Latino. <br /> <br /> These are not ordinary western women - they are cool - they can quickly draw and shoot straight. <br /> <br /> They are so cruel that even the bartender trembles when he pours his whiskey. <br /> <br /> The plot that promotes this story is typical of westerns - in the spirit of "you shot my brother - so I" I'll get you! Only in this west, the woman’s sister was shot dead, and she longs for revenge on the gang that did this. <br /> <br /> So she leaves and searches her old comrades from the days of bank robbery. <br /> <br /> One of them, Maria, is not really very interested in taking revenge for her sister Rachel, but she is motivated by the fact that gold and jewels are hidden in the city where they are going. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of scenes that do not quite make sense, they do not interfere so much, they can be ignored, but I wonder why they were there. So the film could be a little tougher, but overall this is a well-made film that could not find an audience that would understand what it is. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the villainous movie was that of the “heroines” one was clearly direct, the other sexual orientations were never revealed. <br /> <br /> 7 stars
