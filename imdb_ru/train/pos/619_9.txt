I expected this film to be worthy and perhaps cliche, but I was completely wrong! Charlie Cox (I have never heard of him so far) played an incredibly good leading man; he was so serious and romantic that me and my friend who watched the movie with me completely fell in love with him. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes, whom I loved before (LOVED her in Romeo and Juliet), made me enjoy her even more. Her game was fantastic, I could not even say that she was American. The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox was very good, the cast was completely flawless. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally well played; De Niro, like this funny pirate ... priceless, priceless. I laughed so hard at the scene where Septimus appears on the ship ... Oh my God, wow. Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I liked her as a fragile mom in Varnish for hair. But she had the right amount of melodrama and silly comments throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In general, it was funny (but not a slap in the face!), romantic, special effects were not exactly frequent, but when they were, they were great; Cameos Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also in a good position. <br /> <br /> I fully recommend this film to anyone who loves fantasy movies such as Princess Bride or even Lord of the Rings. It kept my interest all the time, and I will buy a DVD when it comes out!
