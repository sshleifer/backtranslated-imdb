This is a normal adaptation, but not as good as the TV version. The actors are usually fine, but I found Jeremy Northam quite wet, like Mr. Knightley, especially compared to Mark Strong in the television version. Gwyneth Paltrow is fine, and her English accent is pretty good, but again, I preferred Emma Kate Beckinsale. Tony Collett, Juliet Stevenson and Sophie Thompson have great performances. <br /> <br /> The script often sounds too much to laugh, the book is a comedy, but there are too many jokes, and the plot of Frank Churchill is almost completely absent. <br /> <br /> My biggest criticism is the scenery. This is too magnificent. England has never been like that. It looks like a chocolate box. Only Americans could do that. <br /> <br /> Despite this criticism, I liked this film, but I would recommend a television adaptation.
