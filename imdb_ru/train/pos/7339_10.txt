Since I heard about the version of “The Lord of the Rings” by Ralph Bakshi, I was surprised: what the hell is the animation of the “rotoscope”? !!! Well ... I finally found out ... I saw this film about three years ago, without having any idea who Ralph Bakshi was ... And I liked it ... very ... Very good storyline ... there is even a small character development that is great for a cartoon ... See if you get bored with modern animation .... Don't get me wrong ... I don't say it's just a good cartoon ... It's also a pretty good movie. ..
