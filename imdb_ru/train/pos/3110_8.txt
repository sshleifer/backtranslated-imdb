The third and last part of the Born trilogy (spirit) is a bit absent in the plot section, but covers it with extensive action scenes! In particular, Twi takes a lot of time and makes this movie better. <br /> <br /> The director and the star (Damon) themselves agreed that it was difficult to find the plot for the last part, because the end of the second film was quite ... advanced in the plot. How did they get around it? This time the action scenes, but they also did something else that I cannot reveal, because it will be a spoiler. But if you watch a movie, you will notice it! Oddly enough, I read that this adaptation of the Bourne books is the least accurate of all three films ... if it means something to you: o)
