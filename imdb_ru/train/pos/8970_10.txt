I explored this film a bit and found a website that claims it was an internal joke about the world of gays and lesbians after World War II. With the exception of Stuart and Novak, sorcerers and witches represented this alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten, who wrote the play, was apparently gay and is well acquainted with this Greenwich village. I thought it was ironic because I first saw Bella, the Book and the Candle in the theater when I was in the 5th or 6th grade, just because my parents took me. It was difficult for me to find a film that didn’t have horses, machine guns, or alien monsters, and I planned to get bored. But I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart was hugging Kim Novak on the roof of the Flatiron building and throwing off his hat while the camera was following him, fluttering on the ground. When the glorious love theme of George Dunning became famous, I suddenly felt what it was like to fall in love. The first excitement of romantic / sexual love left me stunned when I left the theater. I’m sure that I’m not the only teenage boy who was seduced by Kim Novak’s astounding direct gaze. The irony is that for many of us, the gay parable was the beginning of heterosexual puberty. I am now over fifty, and yesterday I watched the movie again, and the same feelings began to stir as I watched this hat land fifty years later. ,,
