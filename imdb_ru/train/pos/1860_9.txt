I went to Anton Fisher, not knowing what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. Derek Luke's acting work was outstanding, and the storyline was excellent. Of course, Denzel Washington did an excellent job with his role as an actor and director. It makes you realize that people with mental problems can be helped, and this film is an excellent example of this. Do not miss it.
