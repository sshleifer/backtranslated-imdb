A bit slow (something like the Sofia Coppola film), but still a very exciting film about the disclosure of sexuality by three teenage girls. The magic of the film lies in its ability to bring back many memories of what it was like to be of the same age. Confusion and insecurity are portrayed very simply, but so true to life. The music is beautiful, and the game is amazing. The camera also works beautifully. I highly recommend this for those who are not afraid to look back on this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires. I would also say that this is a great film for young people experiencing this period. So many films have been made about youth, but this truly reflects the true essence of the discovery of the adult world of romance and its complexities.
