The film has a great written genre story. It shows all the usual components of Colombo; The way Lieutenant Colombo approaches his suspect and communicates with him, as the mystery unravels him, the Colombo dog, a game of cat and mouse, which is gorgeous in this, and, fortunately, also some good facilitating humor, mainly with the participation of the character Colombo . This is all written, despite the fact that he does not even have a truly original concept. Colombo was hunting for a detective / author of a murder novel, more than once starred in the Colombo film. <br /> <br /> This is also an extremely well-shot film by James Frawley, who afterwards made 5 more Colombo films in the 70s and 80s. He gave the film a style and some really wonderful and memorable episodes. <br /> <br /> This is one of Colombo’s slowest films, even though he hasn’t been too long. This style and approach does not always work well for a Colombo film, but in this film it happens that, perhaps not least thanks to the acting performance of the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the Colombo films have also been filmed in a big famous star or a star from the first days of filming, since the film is its killer. In this film, the rather unknown 81-year-old Ruth Gordon starred. She has not starred in a large number of films throughout her career, but she is still known to some, mainly due to her role in "Rosemary's Baby", which also brought her an Oscar. She had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of play, although some might not like it. He earned her another 4 Oscar nominations for her entire career, before she won Rosemary's Baby in 1969. She also has excellent interaction with Peter Falk in their episodes. <br /> <br /> The film also stars a young GD Spradlin. I say “young” because I only know him from his latest work in his entire career, despite the fact that he was already 57 years old during this production in Colombo. He is still alive, but since 1999 he has retired. <br /> <br /> Even better than usual in the movie Colombo. <br /> <br /> 8/10
