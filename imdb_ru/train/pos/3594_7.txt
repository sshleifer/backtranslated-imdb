Michelle Rodriguez was created for this film when I first saw her in The Fast and the Furious. You could say she was a tough woman. With this film, she not only proved her acting, but does not show fear and is tough, as it should be in this film. She is rather a bad girl, and this is what I like about her. This film is about a restless girl, living the life of a boy and constantly getting into school and family. When she begins to be interested in how her brothers are preparing to become a boxer, she decides to follow her love of wrestling and asks her brotherâ€™s coach to train her. Despite the fact that they do not think that she has the potential, they are shown that they have proven to be wrong. <br /> <br /> I think this film was a bit slow at the end, but was well made. This shows that people can do anything, even if they do not think that you have the potential. I recommend this to be seen.
