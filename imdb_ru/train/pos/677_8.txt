**** SPOILER WARNING **** Throughout Australia, summer turned into a flood of rains and hail the size of baseball balls that caused chaos in coastal cities such as Sydney. It was in these turbulent conditions that tax attorney David Burton, Richard Chamberlain, was involved in the case as a lawyer associated with the death of a local aborigine who was found dead near a bar in Sydney. <br /> <br /> Five Aboriginal brothers arrested for Billy Corman, Atol Compton, believe that the death of a coroner's police officer determines that Billy did not die of drowning from violence, although he had bruises on his neck and shoulders. However, the court decided to prosecute five for his death, accusing them of manslaughter and not murder. <br /> <br /> David, who defends the five, does not receive any help from them in their defense, and the accused choose to remain at ease and keep what they need. happened to Billy himself and pick up what comes to them from the yard. One of Chris's accused, David Gulpili, begins to somehow invade David’s dreams, as if he wants to tell him what was really behind Billy’s death. <br /> <br /> At first, David doesn’t take his dreams about Chris seriously. that they are real when he meets him at the courthouse. Chris confirms David's dreams by showing him the strange looking black stone that David saw in his dream. Later, meeting Chris and, as it turned out, the Aboriginal shaman, Charlie (Nanjivarna Amagul), who came to his house that evening, David is told that he, like Charlie, has the spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother’s grandfather. These forces will open to him the future associated with the strange weather conditions that are flooding the Australian continent. Chris tells David that the earth is undergoing a giant cycle of purification, and the old world will soon be washed away, and the new world is ready to occupy it. <br /> <br /> David is embarrassed that both Chris and Charlie tell him, but as the rains continue to grow and the ocean waves begin to grow, he feels that something terrible is going to happen. David wants to know if this is all Aboriginal folklore or there are some scientific facts or logic behind their end of world-like revelations. <br /> <br /> By now, it is clear that both Chris and Charlie are members of the Aboriginal tribe. right in the heart of modern Sydney. That alone can distract Chris and his four friends for killing Billy. Since the Australian government will not prosecute the tribal Aborigines, leaving justice to the tribes themselves. However, Chris refuses to admit that he is a member of a local tribe, and he and his four friends are convicted of manslaughter in the death of Billy with sentences that will be handed down by the judge within a few days. <br /> <br /> Now David decided to find out what caused Chris's silence and why Billy had to die, Chris delivered to the crime scene. It is there that David learns that Billy betrayed the members of the Chris tribe, going there with Billy, who is not a member of the Aboriginal tribe of Chris. David also learned that he himself had some kind of spiritual connection with the Australian aborigines, as Charlie and his stepfather Rev. Burton, David Parslow, told him. <br /> <br /> Now the scene has been prepared for the great and final cycle of purification, which David saw in his night dreams and day visions. It comes in the form of a massive tidal wave coming out of the Pacific Ocean into the Australian coastal city of Sydney, and then flooding the entire continent.
