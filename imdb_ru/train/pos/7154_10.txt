I learned about the film “Holes” when I heard from people that this is not a typical Disney, and both children and adults are history. People let me tell you that I was not disappointed. The Holes are based on the novel by Louis Sachar and follow the adventures of Stanley Yelnats, a boy who is sent to a strange camp for juveniles in the desert. He became friends with a boy named Zero, and together they set off on an adventure that changes their lives. It was a very interesting, unique, different and funny story. I did not know what to expect when I watched it. It was interesting to see how the story develops like puzzle pieces. The boys who played juvenile delinquents were very funny, and John Voight was just jovial, like Mr. Sir. Now that I've watched a movie, I have to read a book. Most recommended!
