I used to watch this show when I was a little girl. Although I don't remember much about it, I must say that it was a pretty good show. Also, I don't think I saw every episode. However, if you ask me, it was a good show. I vaguely remember the theme of the song. Everyone was perfectly chosen, the costume design was great. The performances were also top notch. I just hope that one day the network will return this series one day so that I can see every episode. Before I finish, I would like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, although I do not think I have seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, when and if this show will ever be returned to the broadcast, I hope that you will catch it the day before it goes on the air forever.
