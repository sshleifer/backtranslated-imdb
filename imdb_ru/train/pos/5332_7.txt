In the light of bad reviews - or car accidents - I feel obsessed with turning on the gear and turning on the gear to justify myself and provide a service. I'm not sure that people have a license to say that it was so bad, almost automatically. <br /> <br /> A movie rarely has SUSPENSE. This film stood up to the unknown, this is a whole length, for me, despite any shortcomings that may be. How many films can this say? Not even a lot of big ones. Because of the simple premise, you do not know whether people will come out of a life-threatening situation that lasts the entire movie. Yes, the suspension was tight, and after a few blows the shocks did their job. This is not just a television film, but a full-length film; there is no point where he stops, deviates or becomes talkative. It would be difficult to make such a film, always on the road. Only Duel, or Speed, is what I remember. The best in them was also a constant voltage. <br /> <br /> ACT well: the judge is just as good as always, and others. <br /> <br /> SCENARIO is good. But the jury does not know whether this can be - or seems to be - a bit erroneous. That which seems unreal is not necessarily the case. Your first judgments are not always true, but I think the main actor was right to star in this film. <br /> <br /> STANDS are mostly awesome, especially for a television movie. Their only drawback can be a noticeable and, again, an apparent slow speed. But we all know how deceptively slow Grand Prix cars can look. <br /> <br /> I liked what “START” said, “inspired by the real story.” So you are not going to go, how much is this true? You only know the basics. The usual "based on real history" makes me think that basically it must be true. But maybe this is my mistake. <br /> <br /> HOW TO SAVE THEM: A good reviewer idea is to suggest a tow truck to lift the rear wheels up. Just a few centimeters. A stunt driver can do it at a speed of 100 miles per hour. It is strange that they didn’t call a car expert — or an auto electrician, or a mechanic — to find out if there was a way. <br /> <br /> I hope this review showed the opposite, that this film is a disaster. Or at least neutral. And help him become a runaway success. <br /> <br /> Image quality is a bit soft for a DVD. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They would have been startled after a child appeared, but it is strange that the idea of ​​saving life was slyly considered in a joking conversation to put it out. I think we know why. The end of the film. Suspension disbelief went to the top window with the baby.
