There was nothing wrong with Raw's first PPV at 006. But the final was really shocking for all those present and those who watched at home. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH - RIC FLAIR VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE INTERCONTINENTAL WWE CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad beginner, these two can seriously have a great match if they have more time to play a wrestling match. Fleur wins DQ after Edge hit him with his MITB portfolio. 3/10 SECOND MATCH - TRISH STRATUS VS MICKY JAMES FOR THE WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP Not bad, noting the fact that for the first time these divas met together in the ring. Mickey goes to a modified Chick Kik, but Trish dodges and nails his own Chick Kik to win in order to retain his title. 3/10 THIRD MATCH - TRIPLES H VS. BIG SHOW Seriously good, this match was really. The entire HHH match focuses on the injured hand of the Big Show, but the Big Show still resists. Later, HHH may overthrow the Big Show and win the Family Tree to win. 5/10 fourth match- Shelton Benjamin with mom against VISKER {It was a bonus match} Not so bad, everything was in order. After Viscera went down behind the judge, Benjamin's mother pulled out a purse (in which there were bricks) and hit him three times on the head. Wiszer only got up so that Benjamin grabbed his heel for a victory over a big man. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH - JERRY "KING" ATTORNEY GREGORY HELMS Bored, slow and sloppy. Both men really did not make much effort. Jerry Lawler wins after fist drop to win. 2/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH MATCH - TORRI VS Wilson VICTORIA V.S. Ashley VS. Maria v. KANDIS MICHEL IN THE FIRST STAGE OF WOMEN'S FIGHT. That was pretty funny to me. Ashley {I think} Candice leaves the last to win the first Women's Gloves match. 5/10 SEVENTH MATCH - JOHN SENA VS. Chris Masters VS. CARLITO VS. Sean Michaels VS. Kane VS. KURT ANGLE W / DAIVARI in a match for the destruction of the WWE championship. It was a cool match in the shooting game. But nothing will surpass last year’s chamber of liquidation, which was the best. The last three are Masters, Sina and Carlito. Carlito turns his back on the Masters and gets curtailed on him to destroy him. After a few seconds, Sena gets a scroll on Carlito for three accounts to win the Liquidation Chamber and retain his WWE title. But his night is not over yet. 7/10 After the match, Vince McMahon comes out and congratulates Sina on his victory. Vince McMahon states that his night is not over yet, and says that Edge takes the opportunity of Money In The Bank to challenge Sina for the title. Edge comes out with Lita, gives the bag back to Vince and goes to the ring, since the Seine has another match to go here tonight. <br /> <br /> EIGHT MATCH - JOHN SENA VS. LITA EDGE FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP {Sina, who will be played during the match with the Camera}, immediately receives Edge, and Edge nails the Spear to Sina, goes for the shelter and Sina escapes to his shock. Edge nails another Lance and covers up the shocking three, as he defeated Sinai and won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So the New Year revolution last year was better than this year, but it was still fine. The match in the EU was also good, and Edge’s shocking defeat in his capabilities at MITB is by far the most shocking at the PPV show. <br /> <br /> Overall: I will give him 7/10 and C
