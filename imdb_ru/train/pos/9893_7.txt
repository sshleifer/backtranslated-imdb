Poor, disgusting Marty (Simon Scaddamor) was terribly burned because of the brutal trick of the April Fool's Fool. Fast forward to the decade ahead, and those involved (including Caroline Monroe, known to horror fans for her turns in the films Maniac, Faceless and the Last Horror Movie) in the raffle, are excited about the upcoming 10-year reunion in high school, not knowing that disguised by the court jester, the Assassin hides in a (now closed) school and wants revenge. <br /> <br /> Chorus it to be guilty, I knew it was a bad movie. It has all the characteristics of one. And yet there is something in it that makes me watch it from time to time (preferably with a beer in hand). I’m even willing to ignore the absolutely terrible finale (which, I must say, I hate), I think I like it, because it has a funny atmosphere and pretty cool killings. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for men): Josephine Scandi and Donna Yeager are both naked to the waist. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for women): a free shot of Simon Skaddamor’s member of the film <br / > My rating: L- ingsgate B- <br /> <br /> Extras: extra quiz track; trailer for this film; and trailers for My Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dirty Dancing
