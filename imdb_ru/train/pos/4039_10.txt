Most of the complaints I heard about this film boil down to one thing: this is not Versus. Yes, the cast and crew are basically the same. Yes, Kitamura paraphrases several shots in the battle scenes that appear in the second half of the film, but the similarity ends there. Versus takes place virtually outside, demonstrating Kitamura’s ability to create an interesting B-film in natural places. For Alive, almost everything happens inside. In small confined spaces. Here, art design rushes into your face, and what kind of art design! We are treated in several very confusing and interesting spaces, and our characters are mostly limited to these spaces. Also, the key difference is that we do not get a lot of action here until the end of the film. Versus is all about action and awesome, here VERY MORE attention is paid to characters, situations and games with the mind. Because of this, “Live” film is much more interesting than “Versus”. You can't jump in and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of steep bloodshed by zombies, but you will sit glued to the screen for almost two hours, watching the interaction of several really interesting characters. <br /> <I am now delighted that I ordered the DVD, despite some skeptics. You must too! But do not forget to realize that this animal is different from Versus - it is often slow and requires some effort to extract the maximum benefit from it. I hope Media Blasters picks it up for the release of R1 DVD with subtitles!
