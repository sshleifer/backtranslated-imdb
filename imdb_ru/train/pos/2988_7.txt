The original with Barbara Stanwick is only retained by Stanwick. The plot and other performances are too disgusting, and the film itself is too outdated to be truly appreciated today. The Bette Midler version is much more interesting. This is Stella Claire, an independent, freedom-loving single woman who became pregnant and refuses to help her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) or her boyfriend (John Goodman in an undervalued performance). She brings up her daughter Jenny, who is so cute played by Trini Alvarado, and then comes to the conclusion that Jenny's father can achieve greater success for her and ultimately makes a decision that will change her life. Throughout the film a lot of laughter, tears and memorable moments, mostly between Midler and Alvarado. Marsha Mason acts as a future stepmother, Jenny, who, although she is rich, has a very good influence on her. If you like Midler, Goodman, or just good movies with lots of emotions, you'll love the STELLA version of Bette Midler.
