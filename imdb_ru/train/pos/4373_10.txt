I ask everyone who says they don't care about this movie. Some reviewers say that he doesn’t have enough actions, some say it’s too long, and so on. Do not listen to them !!! If you like “Shawshank Escape” and / or “Braveheart”, you will definitely like this movie! <br /> <br /> Acting is great! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are all excellent, and Liam Neeson does an amazing job and is a very impressive character because of his size. Cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking. This is one of the few films that I have seen in my life (along with Shoushenk), which was almost flawless: actors, directors, scriptwriters, actors, etc. !!! <br /> <br /> I was amazed that it was not. t in the top 50 or 100 watched movies. I was so passionate about this that I just registered with IMDB so that I could tell everyone about this scoop. I saw this movie about 10 times (every time with another person), and everyone enjoyed it! You have to stay awake and keep a close eye on the first 30 minutes, because in the beginning they enter quite a few characters. If you have more attention than most of these juvenile children who write movie reviews on this site, you will love this movie! Come on ... all 3 Lord of the Rings movies in the top 9 and the Matrix at # 32?!?! This should show you the age range of most reviewers here! <br /> <br /> These are the 50 best films !!!
