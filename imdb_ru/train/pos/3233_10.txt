This is the best Finnish film of the year, although Tango Kabaree is coming. The director Lampela shot a couple of years ago another good little movie called Rakastin ep√§toivoista naista (I was in love with a desperate woman). A wonderful movie on a Saturday afternoon in a small village / city. The actors may not be so beautiful or beautiful, but they act beautifully. Of course, I hope that many of them will receive a statue of YUSI (Finnish OSCAR) next spring. I think this film can do it abroad.
