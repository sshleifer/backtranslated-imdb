The first of Jim Thompson’s two adaptations, released in 1990 (the other being the more well-known GRIFTERS), AFTER DARK has all of Thompson’s hallmarks: dangerous women, a trusting game, and characters who are either not as dull as others are supposed to be or not so harmless. <br /> <br /> Jason Patrick is great as a former boxer suspended from sport for life because of an incident in the ring (directed by James Foley uses the RAGING BULL-esquire sequence to specify the background) and the little-known Rachel Ward also provides excellent performance. But Bruce Dern is the secret weapon of the film: his sweet talking uncle Bud subtly commands each of his scenes. <br /> <br /> There is almost no comic relief in this film, so watch how he prepares to be dragged into the void. ,
