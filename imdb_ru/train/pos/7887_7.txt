If you are a Freddie fan, then you might not like it. Looks like it's a fake from a series of nightmares. Not much to see here. The only reason he is holding himself is the background of Freddie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is always wonderful in Nightmare films is death scenes. But the death scenes were very shitty about it. The visual effects were great and the game was fine, but the story was excellent. In fact, the story of Freddie goes full circle in this. <br /> <br /> I read bad reviews, but I really liked it, despite many flaws: <br /> <br /> 1. A nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddy's Dead: The Last Nightmare. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. Nightmare on Elm Street 4: Sleep Lord. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 4. Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Warriors of Dreams. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. Nightmare on Elm Street 5: Dream Child. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddie's Revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend if you like the show. This was explained by Freddie, but that's all there is. Next on my list is Wes Cravens New Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
