I am very sorry that this charming and whimsical film (which I first saw shortly after it was first released in the early 50s) received such a bad reception quite recently. In my opinion, he was greatly underestimated - but perhaps he is more drawn to the European sense of humor than (for example) to the American: perhaps we in Europe can better understand and appreciate his subtleties and situations, as we are closer to some of them in real life! Special mention should be made of limited but good music - a particularly memorable and memorable song “This is a wonderful, beautiful night”, which was released separately on the HMV 78rpm record (10-inch plum label, I think!) In the fifties. I urge everyone who is interested to try, if you have such an opportunity: you can have a pleasant surprise.
