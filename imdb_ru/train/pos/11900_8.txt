And visually and musically awesome. A treat for the eyes and ears. Quintessential Victorian element of the opening episodes was completely charming, helping to create a Christmas scene that Dickens himself would be proud of. Technically, production is visually stimulating, and special effects are ingeniously and creatively achieved in a traditional setting. The dances of many leading artists are amazingly good. Photography and lighting are first-class, and the sound recording perfectly matches the overall high level of technical skills used. Great movie for the whole family at Christmas and the most exciting discovery that will stand multiple viewing.
