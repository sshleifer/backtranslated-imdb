As in Heaven (SPOILER'S WARNING) <br /> <br /> It was a great human drama that stimulated my emotions and my imagination. <br /> <br /> This is a parable about the life and death of Christ. Daniel is an excellent talented musician who is physically and mentally exhausted by his career and must quit it. When he joins the church choir as a cantor, he changes the life of the choristers, just as Jesus did for the society in the first century Palestine. They laugh, they begin to speak openly and truthfully to each other, their shortcomings are revealed, they accept each other, love each other, become a vital community. These include a mentally retarded young man (? Torah), such is their Inclusivity. <br /> <br /> Pastor Stig enjoyed prestige, imposing suffocating morals on the meeting, and this was gradually rejected by the choristers. When the Stig dismisses Daniel, an uprising occurs and the Stig is overwhelmed. Stig represents the Jewish authorities of the time when Jesus insisted on the observance of Jewish laws, which contrasted sharply with the new life thanks to the “golden rule” brought by Jesus. <br /> <br /> In one dramatic scene, someone claims that "the church has invented sin." Throughout the film, there is a contrast between moralism and life (existence). <br /> <br /> According to the story of Christ, Daniel killed Connie when he beats him, leaves him to drown in the river. The next scene, we can hardly believe it, when the body of Daniel (risen!) Is dragged into his room (tomb), wrapped in a white linen sheet (shroud!), By Three women (three women are awake at the foot of the cross). in the Gospel). <br /> <br /> Daniel is closely associated with Lena, a warm beautiful young woman who was betrayed by a man whom she loved and who is now dissolute (Jesus had a close relationship with Mary Magdalene-Lena, who was probably a high-class courtesan / prostitute). Through Lena, Daniel learns to love, what he so longed for, and now finds satisfaction. <br /> <br /> Gabriella's solo, written by Daniel, is a full life, as opposed to moral correctness. it leads to worry about sin, and also about what is right and what is wrong. <br /> <br /> The final stage shows that the choir sings / sings in harmony, like a mantra, attracts a wide audience, demonstrating harmony and interconnectedness, which is our true human destiny.
