A priest who has left his ministry meets a young man who has just been dedicated. <br /> <br /> This film is about a cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to God and faith, and a life of more earthly pleasures. In post-war France, we are also talking about the mortal aspect of the Faith itself. <br /> <br /> This may not be a film of a lifetime, but itâ€™s a sin to allow it to be forgotten. In addition, Pierre Fresnay is exalted.
