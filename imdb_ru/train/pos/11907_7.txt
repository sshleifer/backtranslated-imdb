Hitchcock believed that the audience was not really interested in the fact that it exposed the main characters to danger - only that they were in danger and had to escape. <br /> <br /> This film proves that Hitchcock was not 100% right. Police believe that Gene Simmons is guilty of a crime, while she is clearly not. Trevor Howard decides that their best course of action is to run after him. So, in the body of the film, our charismatic couple dodges trains, buses and buses - jumping over the rocks at the top of the waterfall - climbing the roofs of the shipyard. <br /> <br /> All the good exciting things - but I could not go crazy, that all this was unnecessary. They should have stayed in place. <br /> <br /> In other words, McGuffin was not strong enough.
