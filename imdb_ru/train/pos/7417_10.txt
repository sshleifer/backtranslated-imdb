This beautiful story of how the eldest son comes home and learns to love and be part of everything he left at home to leave him is painful and exciting. It shows a society that may be strange for us in the Western world, with a family sense that we lost. The story is beautiful, sad, and sometimes funny and comical. He has a sense of realism, which we seem to no longer see in our western films. <br /> <br /> This is an unusual action: in the process of the film it seems that it is not. acting but documentary of ordinary people. This is a brilliant direction and film making. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more films by this director.
