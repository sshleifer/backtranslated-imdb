Hunky Geordie Robson Green - Owen Springer, a young doctor who moves home to Manchester to be with his father. On the way, he falls in love with Anna, a woman 20 years older than her, who, as it turned out, is the wife of his new boss Richard Crane. Despite warnings from his new colleagues, Owen continues to look for Anna for herself, going so far as to sabotage Anna and deceive Richardâ€™s marriage. This is a romantic drama with many humorous shades and wit. The actors are great: Green from the "Student Prince" and "Touch of Evil" smolders on the screen like a sly but hearty Owen; Annis of the famous "Dune" is alive and well with Green; The cuisine, from "To Play The King", is the right threat, like Richard, whose comic mistakes and snobbery underline his workshop, hatred of Owen. This is the perfect love triangle, and despite the weaknesses and delusions of our three characters, you will better learn and watch them.
