This is a very good movie and I definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 minuses: - the story level has a large range. some scenes are very good and some are just boring. - many stories are not self-sufficient (if you compare them with coffee and cigarettes, where each story has its own point of view, message, zest or whatever you want to call it), but most of the stories are really good, some are excellent and in general, this is one of the best films this year for sure! <br /> <br /> annoying that I need to fill at least 10 lines, I have nothing more to say, and I donâ€™t want to start analyzing individual sequences ... <br /> <br /> well, that's all!
