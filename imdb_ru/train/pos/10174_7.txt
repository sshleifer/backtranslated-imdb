It was another message of the Second World War, so that soldiers and allies would be careful in spreading rumors. They were called “educational” cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny looking protagonist named Pvt. Snaf. <br /> <br /> We all have imagination as well as fears and is-you, and this is what happens here as Pvt. Snaf incorrectly adds two and two to what he hears, and suggests “five.” You can start a panic and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them. This includes a loss of confidence in your country and your business, as shown here in this cartoon. A good way to lose the war is to demoralize the enemy. It is still being done today. <br /> <br /> “We lost the war,” says one big nonsense at the end of this cartoon. It's amazing how some Americans still haven't learned. This cartoon can be 65 years old, but it is certainly relevant today. When I write this, there are two terrorist explosions in Europe today, and some people still believe that the “War on Terror” is just a slogan with a bumper sticker. Amazing. <br /> <br /> The author, the famous “Dr. Suess”, uses here analogies with the “juice balloon” to present the above message. With Theodore Geisel (his real name), you know that rhymes will be smart. <br /> <br /> There is nothing funny here, but this should not have been. You must understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that existed during World War II. People forget that war could easily end with the victory of the other side. It was a busy time.
