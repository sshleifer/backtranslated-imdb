79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have never done anything but great movies together. Although this is not one of the best, this is a great musical. There are some outstanding musical numbers, good support from Randolph Scott. Two notable appearances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, give unforgettable early screen shows. Bal is especially good, and blonde too. "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the best music duo numbers ever. Harriet Hilliard, better known as Harriet Nelson from Ozzy and Harriet, plays Ginger Roger's sister. The main plot is quite familiar, but with such an cast it works. Excellent artistic direction and appreciation.
