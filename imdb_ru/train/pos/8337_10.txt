Being a big fan of the genre of romantic comedy and, therefore, having seen a large number of these films, it is rarely possible to make me completely unique. In this respect, just as rarely do I choke with laughter during several scenes. The love story is a bit thin on earth, but I would say that this is probably for the best, because in this romantic comedy the emphasis is on comedy, and in any case it expands the boundaries of trust a little more than I like most rom com. Four scientists presented some of the funniest moments not only in this film, but also in any film that I've seen in a long time. I hesitated for the shortest moments before finally choosing “10” instead of “9” as a rating, because I think that too many people use it indiscriminately, and therefore the maximum rating loses some of its impact. I'm also a big fan of Meg Ryan that helps, but this is one of the few films I have seen in which I would say that it is completely clouded. She and Tim Robbins act as the main characters, but I play a second violin with the tricks of clumsy intellectuals. This is a ridiculous movie.
