Penny Prince considers the American working woman Yolanda Donlon to be the heir to a small kingdom in the triangle where France, Italy and Switzerland meet, called Lampidorra. It seems that Lampidorra have to pay bills throughout Europe, and the main occupation of the country is smuggling because of its geographical location. The American multimillionaire buys this place, but dies before he can get the title. His closest heir is Donlan. <br /> <br /> But, of course, the inheritance must pass through America, and what should Lampidorrans do? Moreover, Donlan, who has now become a princess, has banned smuggling. <br /> <br /> Enter Dirk Bogarde, who is on a trip to Switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. It seems that Lampidorrans has a kind of cheese, which they jokingly call Schmeeze. With a few irregularities on the road, Schmitz solves all problems, both financial and geopolitical and romantic, between Donlan and Bogard. <br /> <br /> How Shmiz works is a trick for the whole movie. But here's a hint. In The Return of a Lover, Jack Kruschen may have just learned the secret of Schmeze when he was invented by the VIP for Rock Hudson and his advertising agency. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Penny Princess is a delightful blend of British farce and romantic comedy. Yolande Donlon again plays a role in which Marilyn Monroe would play a role if the film were shot on this side of the pond. Dirk Bogard was well played in the role that was at the beginning of his career as a romantic heartbeat, long before anyone except him suspected that he had acting chops. <br /> <br /> This film was sadly shown at three in the morning on the TCM. But at least I found a reason to be grateful for insomnia.
