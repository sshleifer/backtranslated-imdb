I really love this game to death. Since I was 9 years old (I am now 15). He has great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions, and do not forget about the stunning forms of dragoons! I'm still waiting for a remake, a prequel, or a sequel to this exciting video game. <br /> <br /> You play as Darts, a young swordsman who can become a hero. In this adventure you encounter wonderful creatures and boss battles. On the way, you also meet friends who have their own special element. Such as Fire, Darkness, Water / Ice, Thunder / Lightning, Earth, Light and Wind. There are also items known as dragoon spirits that allow you to transform into magical creatures of legend. Dragons, wizards, creatures called wings, and evil creatures you will encounter in this adventure, filled with exciting adventures and excitement. One of my favorite games, The Legend of Dragoon!
