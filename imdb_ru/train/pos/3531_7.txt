Robert Siodmak is doing an amazing job with this black star Ella Raines, Franchott Ton and Alan Curtis. And he does this, I might add, without much help from his male actors, that is, Curtis and Ton. It's all the time Raines, a pretty, leggy actress who, for one reason or another, has never achieved the status of some of her noir colleagues. <br /> <br /> Sedmak uses sex, light, shadows and music. really great because he does this genre. Shadows, lighting effects and camera angles are effective. But the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with Elisha Cook's very sexy drum riff inspired by excited Raines. It is this scene that brings the "Phantom Lady" to a new territory. <br /> <br /> Siodmakâ€™s commitment to the material corresponds only to Raines, who shows the sincere role of a woman in love trying to save her man. Franco Ton called this. Alan Curtis did not seem upset that he could die, and did not seem happy that he survived. And he never, except for a brief moment in prison, seemed to be in love with Raines. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about many of these films is that with the development of World War II, interest in psychiatry has increased. But often the terms were used incorrectly in films such as Obsessed, Enchanted, and The Greatest Show on Earth. Thomas Gomez calls tone paranoid - Ton probably has some paranoia associated with his disorder, but he seems closer to the psychopath. In fact, as his headaches indicate, he may have had a brain tumor pushing his brain. <br /> <br /> The Phantom Lady is not the best conspiracy, but worth seeing.
