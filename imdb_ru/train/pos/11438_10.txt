Ralph and Mumford, losers on their own land, are being deceived, turning into involuntary pawns of Sinhanomess Boch. Twice in the past is a story about them, the characters they meet, and their struggle to fix everything. This amazing film with an amazingly impressive soundtrack and great voice acting is one of the best in the business. <br /> <br /> The animation process, although similar to the South Park style, is much smoother and much more three-dimensional. If I didn't know that the animation was in this style, I would swear that it was a traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this movie in Dolby Surround or THX format, PLEASE DO IT! You really do not miss anything if you do not, but if you do, you will get much more from experience!
