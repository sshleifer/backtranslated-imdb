Classic cartoon, always pleasant and fun. It has an interesting plot full of cute characters. Road Rovers is a show worth seeing, 13 short episodes, and if you ever see it, you should do it. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. I think that Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD that contains all 13 episodes. I would definitely buy it if they did, and if they do, you should buy it as well. If you have kids who love dogs, they will love all-terrain vehicles! Road Rovers should have received more attention during the broadcast, it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was.
