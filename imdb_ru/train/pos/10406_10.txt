Abu, the thief in Baghdad, helps King Ahmed recover his kingdom from the evil sorcerer. <br /> <br /> As Europe went to war, and much of the world was on fire, the London films of Sir Alexander Korda made public this generous escape from the legends of the Arabian nights. Filled with swords and witchcraft, he gave the audience in 1940 a short respite from the headlines. It is also a great movie in which you can play with a good game and a smart script. <br /> <br /> Konrad Wade gets the best scores, and he deserves it, playing the evil mage Jaffar. His saturnin face with piercing eyes brings to mind the terrible roles that he played with such pleasure in silent days. Here is a villain who is worth watching. Being a boyish thief, Sabu played well in this, his third film. Although he is not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in deeds and actions. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors do an excellent job. John Justin is energetic and sensitive as an unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of life in a difficult way; Sabu gets a significant part of the action (when he doesnâ€™t turn into a dog), but Justin is appropriately athletic when necessary. The beautiful June Duprez plays the endangered princess Basra, who is craved by two completely different men. Appearing late in the film, the massive Rex Ingram shakes things up like a genie with an attitude. <br /> <br /> Allan Jace uses his beautiful voice for a good advantage as a Narrator. Miles Malleson receives another eccentric role of the children's sultan Basra, who is always thinking about his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the film adaptation and dialogue). At the age of Morton, Selten portrays the benevolent king of legend. Mary Morris, later an exceptional theater actress, plays a double role as an accomplice of Jaffar and the six-armed Silver Dancer. <br /> <br /> The film was launched in Britain, but the difficulties of wartime forced Korda to move him to Southern California, which probably explains the presence of the American Ingram in the cast. The artistic direction in bright Technicolor is the most attractive, especially the fabulous architecture in blue, white and pink. <br /> <br /> *********************** <br /> <br /> Sabu was born in 1924 in Sabu Dastagir and he worked in maharajahs in the stables of Mysore, when he was discovered in the company of Korda and placed in front of the cameras. His first four films (Elephant 1937, Drum 1938, Baghdad Thief 1940, The Jungle Book 1942) were his best, and he ended up in Hollywood when they were finished. After outstanding military service in World War II, he resumed his film career, but he became infinitely limited for many years, playing ethnic roles in minor minor films, BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) is the only major exception. His latest film, Walt Disney A TIGER WALKS (1964) was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu died of a heart attack at the end of 1963, when he was only 39 years old.
