I'm a big fan of classic movies, but I just enjoy dumb movies. Many silent films do not attract my attention, but Show People is a notable exception. <br /> <br /> Marion Davis and William Haines are wonderful in this film. In particular, Davis shows a wide range, turning from a funny girl from a small town into a star, which takes itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> Show People - a film with a fast tempo and a fantastic set of cameos. some of the biggest stars of the era of silence. The film immediately caught my attention, and I really forgot that it was a silent film. (I know this doesn't make much sense, but this is what happened.) The actors are so skilled in their craft that they need only a few interactive cards. <br /> <br /> Show People is a great introduction to silent movies. This is a fast-paced, interesting film with the two best stars of the era of silence. Add to satire Hollywood and Show People should be on the "must-see" list for all fans of classic cinema.
