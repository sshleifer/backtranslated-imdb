Definitely a very good idea, the script was just fine. Perhaps it would be better. The positives are that you are not bored if you are an adventure lover, a new idea about the lost world of Atlantis. The negative points that I personally feel that this idea has much greater potential than this one. They should have ended a better adventure than this. It was not bad at all, but it would be much better if it had a little more runtime. let's say that it was boring or not very good .. Good for people who like animated adventures, such as Sinbad, for example, the Road to Eldorado. This film is also recommended for people who are looking for a cute little adventure with a very good happy ending.
