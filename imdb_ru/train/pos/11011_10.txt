A major source of money for RKO Radio, Bombardier stars Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott work as trainers in a school for bomber pilots. O'Brien and Scott argue about teaching methods, while their students vie for Ann Shirley's love. O'Brien's methods are confirmed during the bombing of Tokyo. Scott and his team are captured and tortured by the Japanese, but the mortally wounded Scott manages to set fire to a gas truck, providing an ideal target for his fellow bombers. Stylistically, Bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic war films, moments of subtle acuity (the death of trainee Eddie Albert) alternate with scenes of the ridiculous melodrama Yellow Danger (the Japanese literally hiss through their teeth, torturing helpless Americans). Although it cannot but look today, Bombardier remains an interesting propaganda work (the film is sometimes mistakenly called the debut of Robert Ryan, who has actually appeared in front of cameras since 1940. <br /> <br /> Who wants to get a copy of this film, please contact me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
