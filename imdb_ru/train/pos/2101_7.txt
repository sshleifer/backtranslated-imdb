Forget about Neo, Borne and all those unfinished modern heroes. They only look like 12-year-olds to appeal to a wide audience of geeks who want to be their heroes. Since they cannot be Rambo, McClain or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and who, nevertheless, fulfill the desires of teenagers, to see something very similar to the film. <br /> <br /> However, their “Militants” just look painful, and any girl can challenge her masculinity without question. This explains the revival of old pieces on our silver screens over the past few years. For the better (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McClain collect your strength ... there was no beard !!) <br /> <br /> I say it’s time to go to the new hero and put end of their rule. This film "Largo Winch" is far from perfect and, perhaps, sometimes too predictable, but at least Tomer Sisley played a very promising role as an action movie. And the only time he was weakened was when Melanie Thierry shaved off her beard! I rest. <br /> <br /> I didn’t know about it when I entered the theater room, but it could be a film that I had been waiting for ten years. For the first time in France after Belmondo, a film can be both well thought out and rooted in genre B, without blushing when it is performed. At the same time, all we needed to chew on was either a huge pile of dung, or something too limited to reach a wider audience ... In other words, it was Le Pacte des Loups or Dobermann ( like Dobermann, keep in mind you) ... I believe that Largo Winch has everything you need to be a popular and high-quality cinematographer. <br /> <br /> I left the theater room very satisfied and longing for more.
