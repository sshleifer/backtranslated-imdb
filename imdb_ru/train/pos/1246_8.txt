This premise may seem silly, but since the character Murphy does not take it seriously, she helps the audience immerse themselves in this mixture of mysticism and modern cruel abduction of children. A great cast, especially Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy is at the peak of his 80-year-old comedy / action movie. There are also some excellent F / X, a very surreal sequence of dreams and a rather original plot. Often overlooked in the Murphy's pantheon of Murphy, but this one is worth seeing.
