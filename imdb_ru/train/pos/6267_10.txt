I thought that the original of this film was strange and charming, and also sat on the edge of my chair, trying to figure it out. <br /> <br /> Since I already saw the original when I saw it on the Sci Fi Channel - I don’t know if this remake was intentionally done for Sci Fi - I knew it was in the first few minutes. Since I like Richard Burgi as an actor, I wanted to see how he handled it. <br /> <br /> Writers / producers, etc. The film was slightly modernized, trying to explain the plight of the "aliens." “(They could no longer reproduce their appearance and needed help) using the same pseudoscience that we had in our ears in the 90s. Perhaps it added a bit of glitter to the film, or not. <br /> <br /> This movie. Film? This production takes on a more sinister tone than the original — the original ended in confrontation between a young woman and an alien, and a sort of mutual understanding occurred, although the solution to the alien problem was not solved. <br /> <br /> I sort of remember that in this remake, the woman became quite hostile toward the Burgamians / aliens - I think it could have ended better. But the ending is just the end, and the yarn is the swollen yarn, which is the main stock of science fiction in 1958. In the 1950s, many great science fiction stories were written, and some of them were even filmed. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing thing to see, like a rainy day or something. I rate it very high, because all the remakes of the old 50s Sci Fi, this one went out well. I really enjoyed it a bit. <br /> <br /> But if someone really wants to see this story told by WELL, I offer the original version of 1958 with Tom Tyrone and Gloria Talbott, directed by Jean Fowler, Jr.
