Christine Watts (Mothie Weeks) breaks into pieces, missing her lover; she cannot overcome her love for that which is lost in the past. She hires a stranger (Douglas Davis) and gives him a list of her mistakes to correct. But time is irreversible, and sometimes the cure for pain is a tragic end. <br /> <br /> The first thing that impresses in “The Cure” is the stylish cinema, alternating black and white with color. A short and sharp script can develop a tragic and dark love story with an unexpected plot at the very end in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful, but the volume is a bit loud and related to the fact that English is not my first language, at some points I had to repeat some words that the narrator whispered. The unknown lead actress has a great job and is extremely gorgeous. I hope to be able to see her on the screen again. Last but not least, the debut of director and writer Ryan Jafri could not be better. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): not available.
