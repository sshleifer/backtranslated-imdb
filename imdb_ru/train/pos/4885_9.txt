Possible spoilers: late-appearing cameos <br /> <br /> It is rare to see so many beautiful and memorable actors of characters (more precisely, almost completely actresses) in one film. Although some of them appear only for cameos, each of them is a gem. The British make this mix of comedy and real pathos better than any of IMO, so itâ€™s not surprising that most of the actors are British. <br /> <br /> The music is excellent; no doubt much needed to be duplicated (did Leslie Caron * play bass so well? Maybe - who knew?) But Cleo Lane was unmistakably on her own - her warm, intuitive sound still turns me on like a few other jazz singers. > <br /> As an aging musician himself, not so old and, of course, not in this class, of course, it was also an encouraging film - an excellent film for those who are wondering if they passed it in their profession or avocation, which whatever it is. And of course, a big celebration of life on stage. <br /> <br /> I missed a bit of discovery, but a preliminary 9/10 - and it certainly makes us want to see it all.
