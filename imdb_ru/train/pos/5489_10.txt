A very good idea: "only a few elites (upper classes) could have access to the Internet and be able to communicate on an exclusively English-language website, such as IMDb." Some may think that the Internet is not a reality, but a point of view. in fact, put the media society and democracy at stake: you are probably right. Even if there is an internet cafe in Venezuela, most supporters of Ch√°vez will not even rent a computer for half an hour to comment on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Screw you are a fascist, a rich upper right, right, capitalist, liberal, intellectual, surprizer .. This is probably your first time using the Internet;) ..
