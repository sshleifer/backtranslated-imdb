*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> Recently, I watched this movie with my 11-year-old son and was glad to see that he was laughing in the right places and was delighted with the sequence of actions. Ron Eli is right, like Doc. Cool, calm, almost always under control (and with a random gleam in the eyes). What more can you ask for? I have never read Doc Savage’s book, so I don’t know if it’s true to the source, but I liked the light tone and recklessness. Many people compare this film with “Raiders of the Lost Ark”, which I do not consider fair. The budget difference is astounding (Raiders should have at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage does not have the extensive location work that Raiders have. Special effects are also minimal, but they come to people, the story is very funny, and the humor is just right. Sousa's music is catchy (I love this song-theme. Every time I watch a movie, I finish humming a theme for a few days). The best way to get close to this film is to just relax and enjoy. Highlights include the exciting opening sequence, where the incredible Five and Doc chase the Indian sniper over the rooftops of New York and a VERY funny fight sequence between Doc and Captain Moray. Not so good a villain who sleeps in a giant crib (really!). Overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day. I give it 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... thanks God, he's here!
