I saw this show when it premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. I liked the idea of ​​the film when two men got together and asked a director from each country to make a film about the 911 year. These directors never met until the project was completed, and they saw how it all looked together. ATTENTION: SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the works were very powerful, and some were contradictory. If you are an American, then you may not like it, since some works may be recognized as anti-American. However, I know a few Americans who liked this show. The best I found was from India. It was about the fact that a Muslim family living in the States had 2 sons, and one of them went missing. The Americans gave them a cold shoulder and automatically assumed that it was associated with a terrorist bombardment. He so well reflects the despair of mom and the humiliation of these accusations that it causes tears in her eyes. In the end, we see that her son died, trying to save many victims from the collapse of the towers. It was a true story, and that is what made it so real. There were many emotional and strong pieces, and the African work was one of the best. It was fun, but as powerful as the others. We must watch out for everyone, and I hope America will ban it, and let it play in their country.
