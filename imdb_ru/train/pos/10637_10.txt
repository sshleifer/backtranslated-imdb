Harem Suare is the best movie I saw in 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Sensibly filmed and stunningly portrayed, Harem Suare is a bold film about interracial romance that is such a taboo in Hollywood. Women of all shapes, sizes and colors inhabit the film. Cut off from the outside world, women entertain each other, telling stories about intrigue, rivalry and jealousy in their ranks.
