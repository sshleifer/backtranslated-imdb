I had to see this gem twice to really appreciate it all. When a widowed father of two children interrupts the sleep of his two sons with a shocking revelation, they are torn between faith in him and not. As the horrific events of this story unfold, we will learn a lot about the father, his two sons, and their fates. With a shocking turn for a shocking turn, this film never takes into account the calm in the plot. Bill Paxton plays the father, but his eldest son Fenton performed by Matthew O'Leary and his youngest son Adam performed by Jeremy Sumpter are the most prominent thrillers I've ever seen, and you want to watch him several times evaluate every complex aspect of the plot. I give this movie 9/10.
