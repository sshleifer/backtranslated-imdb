Just two comments .... SEVEN years ago? This is hardly proof of the film’s unceasing traction! As already mentioned, the low budget status of the telegrams 13 GANTRY ROW is a mitigating factor in its limited attractiveness. Having said this, however, the thing is not without virtues — not as entertainment, nor as a terrible walk as such. <br /> <br /> True, the plot in its most basic part is a remake of the Amityville Horror - just a lot of horrors. More intrigue! Gibney might have made a more dignified impression if, in Halifax, she had played an investigation into several seemingly unrelated killings with the “house” as the main suspect. The scenario is better than average and production is generally high. It simply does not attract the viewer, especially at key moments. <br /> <br /> Raising the DVD last week for just $ 3.95 in my regular video store, I can't be jealous of the cost. $ 10.95 will be an acceptable price for the film. Just do not wait for fireworks!
