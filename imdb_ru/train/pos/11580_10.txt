According to another reviewer, “The War of Hannah” is an outstanding film about an outstanding man, Hannah “Anniko” Senesh, who will become a Jewish Jean d'Arc. Unfortunately, I do not agree with the opinion that Miss Detmers as a leader is too beautiful to be perceived as a resistance fighter. In truth, her performance is not constrained by her beauty, but makes her even more severe in horror of sadistic cruelty as a resistor she faces. The performance of Maruschka Detmers is bold, sharp, sincere or understandable, and absolutely believable. In other words for me "In the zone". from the initial credits. If you want to find out about someone else’s suffering for what they believe in and be entertained impressively, then try Hannah’s War against Marushka Detmers. My hat is also taken off with Ellen Burstyn, as Hanna's mother, a very famous and famous actress who could try to get away with the film. The fact that this is a team work, perhaps, two actresses, but not in the situation of "All about Eve."
