This is a very scary and, for the most part, well thought out drama. I am very impressed with the film not only for the plot and great game, but also for the fact that such a unique film was made. Most films involving a spy or war are filled with Brit's tricky talk or a mighty battle, but not this one. This is not about a war of this kind, but about a war between a man and his life situation, an American spy in Germany, posing as a supporter of evil that no one will ever forget. When the war is over, Campell thinks that he will return home as a hero, but his true heroic position must remain a state secret. Returning to America, Campell meets both Nazi supporters and Nazi haters, creating interesting conflicts both inside and outside the country. Nolte is more than coping with the role, and quite corresponds to the plot of what he asks.
