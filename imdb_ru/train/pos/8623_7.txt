DER TODESKING is not one of my favorite Jörg Buttgereit films, but it’s still an interesting film about suicide, its causes and consequences. Those who seek bloodshed or exploitation in the style of NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM films are likely to be disappointed. DER TODESKING is definitely an art-house film, so there’s no need to apply those who need linear, explainable narrations ... <br /> <br /> The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there is an “episode” for every day of the week, which revolves around a strange chain letter, which obviously makes people commit suicide, interspersed with scenes of a slowly decomposing corpse ... <br /> <br /> There are several very well-made and thought-provoking scenes, including a person talking about “problems” with his wife, and a concert re not (which, unfortunately, has lost some of its "power" to me, because I was too busy laughing like band SCORPIONS on stage ...). But seriously - it is sometimes beautiful (the scene that shows the different angles of this huge bridge is especially effective - especially if you understand the meaning of the scene, and the fact that the screen shows the names of people who actually committed suicide by jumping from the bridge ... ), sometimes confusing, sometimes stupid (she is a ridiculous SS ridiculous), sometimes heartbreaking (I found the scene of a guy talking to a girl in the park about his wife especially effective) a film that is more of an “experience” than just entertainment as intended for m of these “feature films”. However, I did not find DER TODESKING as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM, and would probably put it on a relatively equal position with NEKROMANTIK 2 from the point of view of my personal “pleasure level”. Definitely worth a look at any Buttgereit fan or “feature film”. If you're digging this type of movie - check out SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - in my opinion, the BEST art house / horror movie I've seen. 7/10 for DER TODESKING
