The pilot is very well done. It tells how characters are linked in future episodes. I don't think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show. This shows the remarkable creativity of the writers. Although not everything was settled because it was the very first episode, many events that would occur in future seasons were shown in the pilot. An example would be the future relationship of Ross and Rachels. Despite the fact that the nervousness of the first episode appeared, it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding choice of actors. <br /> <br /> Bravo. <br /> <br /> A great start to the unsurpassed comedy!
