Well, let's face it. This is a terrible movie. The plot (as it is) is terrible, the acting is worse. But the film was shot for one and only one reason, like all those terrible Mario Lanzi films ... just to hear the voice of the star, in this case Pavarotti in his prime. Well, maybe the Lanza films were also an excuse for him to attack women, but this film is about Luciano hearing. This one is worth watching a movie. The big opera star, stuck on itself, faces its fears, finds humility and love along the way, and also throws many hits. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that on some levels I am biased, I am Italian I am a big fan of Pavarotti (is there anything about Pavarotti that is not big, including his fans?). And when I first saw this film, I came out myself, first seeing the height and depth of life opportunities and falling in love. So, no matter how terrible this film is, a beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe life and love again. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is trite and terrible. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and the voice is what it's all about. Therefore, I highly appreciate this film in the hope that those who have never heard Pavarotti before will listen, watch and enjoy a new level of music and love, especially since he left. Like Italian food you have never tasted before, try it! You may be pleasantly surprised as a lover of Luciano or Pavarotti's supposed look.
