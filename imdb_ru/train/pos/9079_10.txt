This show will be successful because it attracts all adults, no matter where they are in their relationship. As a 26-year-old man, I sympathize with Patrick Warburton's character: he loves his wife, but he assumes that she knows it. I also like his monotonous delivery; never gets too excited or too low. Good character ensemble. It will be a good addition to the composition on Monday evening. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know what David Spade will be in his role. He is best enjoyed in small doses. He also seems a bit old to still be engaged in trolling among women. <br /> <br /> I liked the pilot, and I look forward to seeing how the series will evolve.
