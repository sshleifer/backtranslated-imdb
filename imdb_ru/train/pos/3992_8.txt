Although the title of the film contains the word “Mother,” the first thing that comes to mind is the love of a mother for her children. <br /> <br /> However, Mother tells a different story. <br /> <br /> A mother does not discuss the love between a mother and her child or how she sacrifices herself for her child. Here, Notting-Hill director Roger Michell tells us how mother’s love for a man about half her age hurts the people around her. <br /> <br /> Before Daniel Craig plays the role of James Bond, he plays Darren here, a man who helps repair the house of his mother’s son, and also sleeps with his daughter. Ann Reed, who was a familiar figure in the series, takes on the difficult role of the main character, May. <br /> <br /> The story begins with May handling the sudden loss of her husband Toots on a family visit to her son Bobby. While she is friends with Darren, the master who makes repairs at Bobby's house, she was shocked to learn that her daughter Paula was sleeping with Darren. At the same time, May cope with life after the death of Toots. Fearing that Harry and Paula do not want her, May begins to find that her life goes astray until she spends her day with Darren. <br /> <br /> Darren was friendly and friendly with May, and May soon finds some affection. on darren. Instead of treating him like a friend, she treated a man who was about twice as old, with a couple's love. Later, May found the sexual pleasure of Darren, where he gave her pleasure, which she could never find anyone else. And this is the beginning of a catastrophe that could lead to the disintegration of the family. <br /> <br /> A mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she had never had in her life and comforts on someone who is near her. This can be said from May, when he bought Darren tea snacks to satisfy the sexual needs of a man who is younger than her, and this ultimately gave her more than she expected. <br /> <br /> Ann Reed made a breakthrough for her. The role of May, as she was primarily known for her role in the series. Since there were not many films in her career, Mother attracted the attention of the critic. Daniel Craig, on the other hand, played a similar role in his film career, for example, Silvia (2003) and Enduring Love (2004). If his repeated role of James Bond fails, the reviewers must not forget that he played better in small productions over the years of his film career, and Mother is one of them. <br /> <br /> A mother may not be loved by everyone, but this is definitely not an ordinary morning show with tea and cakes accompanied by butter and jam.
