So this may not be the award-winning typical film “Film of the Year” (aside from the great soundtrack, which I think has won several awards), but this is really a great film about “The Child” (Prince / O (make your choice) and around him the events that live in Minneapolis, play his music. The music is absolutely gorgeous, in my opinion, you MUST have this soundtrack, it is truly a classic that sums up the sounds of the eighties and feels great in fashion. again and again, especially if you like Prince / O (which I do), of course.
