A good picture is worth all the words. This film has the most poetic scene ever dreamed of people with Down Syndrome. And I will not spoil it by telling you. You yourself want to see it. <br /> <br /> Pascual Duken is a terrific actor. I did not need to understand a single word that he said in order to understand its meaning. <br /> <br /> The film has its magic. After seeing it, I understood better that we attach too much importance to achievements, and not to the people we love. Passion and simplicity is all we need.
