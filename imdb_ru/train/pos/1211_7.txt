I grew up in this film, and I remember how my brother and I played in the backyard and pretended that we were in Care of Ourself. Now, after many years, I watch a movie with my daughter and see how she enjoys it. If you are a parent and have not watched this movie with your children, then you should just hold them in your arms and watch how they are delighted with caring bears and caring! The songs, especially "Forever Young", are very sweet and memorable. Parents, I highly recommend this film to all children so that they can learn how nice it is to take care of others! When it comes to all the rubbish that is shown on TV, you can raise your children to have the right attitude to live with such films.
