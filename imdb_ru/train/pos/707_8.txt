Must be honest and say that I have not seen many independent films, but I thought that this one was very well made. Direction and cinematography were attractive, without being distracted. The corners, settings and lighting used successfully created the nightmare world in which the main character was caught. Many obsessive and memorable images from the film are remembered long after everything is finished (always a sign of a good director).
