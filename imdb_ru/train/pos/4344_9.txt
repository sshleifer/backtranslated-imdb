The film reaches the depth of tension between the son and the father. <br /> <br /> Brilliant dialogue, beautiful scenery and a great game are a great way to present a bow that continues to peel off layers. <Br /> <br /> The main problems of education, communication and masculinity are investigated indirectly. <br /> <br /> It's funny when the curtain is pushed aside, the masks slipped a bit and the truths are revealed. <br /> <br /> All this takes place in a road trip format. The backdrop is rural New York in early autumn when the trees change color. BLIMEY!
