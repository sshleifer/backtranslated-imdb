The quality of production, the cast, the premise, the authentic locale of New England (Waterbury, Connecticut?) And John Williams ’luxury points should have resulted in 3-4 star collectors. Unfortunately, all we received was a tolerable 2-star “decent” film, mostly memorable for what he was trying to do ......... bring the mainstream art-house style. The language of a small town and the history of ordinary people is a genre in itself, and, if it is well-made, will satisfy most adults. Jane Fonda could not hide her intelligence enough to make her character believable. I wondered why she did not work as a doctoral student at Yale, instead of working on a dead-end factory job at Waterbury. The character of Robert DiNiro was too far-fetched. Illiterate, handsome loser who turns out, with a little help from Jane's character, the 1990 version of Henry Ford or Thomas Edison. <br /> <br /> This genre was more successfully processed by the Fool Nobody in the mid-90s and this year (2003) “About Schmidt.” I would like the mainstream studios to try more material for teens and would reserve a couple of screens in multicomplexes for this effort. <br /> <br /> I will give him a pro rating.
