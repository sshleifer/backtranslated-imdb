After my Finnish experience a little over a week, I would say that this film very accurately reflects the nature of Finnish society. I am especially familiar with the phenomenon of “young couples with a child who has serious problems,” since I witnessed the same thing when I was in Finland. Relationships and problems of people, the fragility of the institution of marriage, the culture of alcohol consumption, unemployment and the rising problem of money - all this is very well formulated, without any subjectivity or exaggeration. <br /> <br /> In a film that is not necessarily easy to understand and relate to each other, but the overall picture is nonetheless useful. Not every short story is fascinating or deep, but, as mentioned above, the overall picture does not cease to deliver a sense of “real life” and captivate the viewer. I think in a calm moment: what happens in the lives of all these people on the street? Well, this is what happens. Such films are good to feed your creative power. It would be safe to assume that this film can relate to life in many countries, but it especially reflects Finland as it is, and damn well. <br /> <br /> One comment about acting: I’m a fan of Finnish Cinema, I’ve never seen any of these actors in any other film, but I found the action in this function next door to be perfect. Perhaps not a masterpiece, but a very good attempt by the whole team. I will follow the future releases of the director and actors. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
