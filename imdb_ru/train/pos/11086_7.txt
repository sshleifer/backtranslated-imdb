I saw this film when I was small - it was called Ice Fox. I was completely hurt by this! It follows a cute little fox family around. It was a great start, and I remember being very attached to little foxes. I also remember how my mother took me out of the theater when I was hysterical. I will not tell you what happened, but let's just say that it ends badly for all foxes. I'm used to natural films like Disney, where animals DO NOT die. Oh man. This movie made me cry for hours. It was a good movie ... I think - I was very small, and, in truth, - all I remember is to be happy for the fox, and then see how one of them died. Rent it if you can, but donâ€™t show it to your children!
