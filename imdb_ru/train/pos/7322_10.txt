Halloween is one of those films that gives you a deep impression! This, in my opinion, is the worst movie of all time. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman of all! He was just awful! What makes Halloween so special is that there were no special effects because of which you could tell how animated it is on the computer, it was low-budget and had a one-note rating, but managed to scare Ada to people. 25 years, and this film still has the same effect as in the 78th. <br /> <br /> He’s about the boy Michael Myers, he kills his sister at the age of 6 and leaves the mental hospital many years later. , Dr. Sam Loomis pursues him and will do everything to bring him back, as he describes Michael as "... pure evil. The blackest eyes, the eyes of the devil. " Michael, however, is on the assignment to kill his second sister Laurie, played by the new Jamie Lee Curtis. She has to look after the children on Halloween, while her friends are having parties and, of course, we know the rules, they get them! But Laurie may have a chance, since she is a virgin. ; D <br /> <br /> Halloween pays tribute to Psycho, we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curice, daughter of Janet Lee. Halloween is an absolutely awesome movie that breaks boundaries and forces you to lock doors, open windows and turn off the lights! “They'll get you! They will get you! ” Halloween is the best horror movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
