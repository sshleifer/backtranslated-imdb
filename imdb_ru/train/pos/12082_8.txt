Having watched this film strictly by rating of reviewers, I was pleasantly surprised. Although he is clearly low-budget, he has signs of clever ingenuity. For example, when Julia wakes up in a strange house and looks out the window, I find that I think that her sense of isolation will be enhanced by an external shot focused on her face, and then moving back to turn on the house and its isolated location. And lo and behold! The next scene was exactly the last shot of the house, standing alone on a cliff at the water's edge. There are other examples of how an intelligent director can elevate his film to the level of a very pleasant thriller. Experienced viewers will certainly notice them, but must be sure that they will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> With regard to ideas, George Macreedi is his usual creepy person, barely maintaining his composure, albeit implying a capacity for rampant violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as a working girl who is not going to give up without a fight. But Dame Mae Vitti, oh, boy, she even made me doubt my own eyes and believe that she could get away with her evil plans. <br /> <br /> This is a real diamond in the fire and cannot be missed.
