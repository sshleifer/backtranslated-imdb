Incredibly intriguing and fascinating, I could not turn away when I began to look. I am usually one of the harshest critics, but for me this film was just brilliant, strange, no matter how it sounded, I could almost smell the air and feel the texture of the locations. <br /> <br /> From the cinematic plot, I thought that there was a lot of light and texture. From the orange glow of summer light to the couch wrapped in plastic, they all had a distinct atmosphere of realism. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of the character, I thought that Victor Vargas was almost a glue, the story was very inspiring, each of the other family members who had a more complete origin simply caused more intrigue for the main character. <br /> <br /> He also knew someone like his grandmother, and at the end of this situation, I can say that the situation was particularly realistic. Awkwardness, accent, cooking and even comments have become so authentic for me. <br /> <br /> I think this film worked for me because I started watching it without expectations and found that it was completely immersed and brought back memories of teenage emotions that are worth seeing.
