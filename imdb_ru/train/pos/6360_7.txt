I just read the lead commentary on this film, which is on the first page of the voting results and is interrupted. <br /> <br /> Why can't some people take a film for what it should? be. <br /> <br /> This film is supposed to be frivolous, funny, family comedy, things that make children laugh, and things for adults, and that is what this film does. /> <br /> I laughed at this movie, I thought Carey played great, and the whole movie (if you look at Christmas) really gives you a bit of a festive mood. <br /> << fun !!
