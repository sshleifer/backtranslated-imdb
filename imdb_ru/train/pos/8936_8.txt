After "Beau travail" everyone was waiting for Claire Denis to make another masterpiece, which never appeared. Now it has. Denis makes a qualitative leap in this film, an orgy of great cinematography, elliptical editing and deliberate obscuring of narrative events that seem strange and behave even more strangely. There is a nominal plot (partly derived from the book by Jean-Luc Nancy of the same name) about a mature man who needs a heart transplant, and about who is looking for a Tahitian son whom he abandoned a long time ago; but basically this is a study of the idea of ​​an invasion of personal and cultural. It takes a couple of views to fully understand, and he has problems getting closer to the end, but he is still more advanced and exciting than anything I've seen this year. Skip this at your own risk.
