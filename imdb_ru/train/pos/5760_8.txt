My roommate booked it online a while ago, and I finally found the time to watch it. This is gross. It is damp. It's pretty silly ... but it's also very fun. I mean, it was the funniest thing that we've seen in such a movie since "City Of The Walking Dead" a long time ago. It was like in the old Drive-In Theater! You could say that the guy who made this movie liked all the horrible dubbed zombie movies. It has all the cliches and tricks from those films combined into one, and it is neat because it is supposed to be that way. The coefficient of cheese is high, blood flows, and laughter rolls! The effects go from careless to good: the one in which the guy breaks in half, and the one in which the guy pushes his heart in the chest, both are excellent! The game goes from terrible to really good. There is not much plot, just lots and lots of blood. I think this model is modeled on zombie films from Italy and Spain, because they will forever remain in spectacular scenes like this film. If you like movies with “Tromy”, cheesy things of class B, then you can’t go wrong if you watch this movie. Good way to spend the night on Friday!
