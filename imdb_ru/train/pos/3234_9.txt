I thought it was a very smart movie. I was very pleased with this and really could not ask for more. I actually own the film because I did not return it to someone ... What should I do, but I really want to save it because of how I liked it. In addition, the fact that I do not have too many foreign films, and this is the first. Now I personally love Finnish things, which definitely added to the way I liked it. But overall worth seeing. However, if you are not generally trying to understand Finnish or read some subtitles, then this film is not for you. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for sure.
