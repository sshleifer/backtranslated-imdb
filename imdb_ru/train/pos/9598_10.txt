I tracked the trip two years ago on the Internet - now I saw the movie !! What a ride! And what a trip to finally meet Darius Weems! Such a brave, wise, cheerful and talented spirit! And what a crew! To listen to how Darius laughs from being in the water in Panama City, to see his trepidation from being close to alligators in Louisiana, surprise in his eyes as he flew in a balloon, the excitement of rafting through some rapids, arguing to eat a spoonful of wasabi and a phone calls home, and as always - boys will be boys. This film should be watched by everyone - both young and old. Darius and his mother are examples of strength and courage. And the crew members are evidence of the heart of the younger generation. They got Darius a new wheelchair; they documented accessibility issues; they took Darius on the journey of his life; and they touched many, many lives. By raising awareness of DMD and encouraging research funding, this film will help achieve the ultimate goal of Darius Goes West - medication for DMD.
