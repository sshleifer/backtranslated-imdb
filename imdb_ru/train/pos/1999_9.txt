Oliver! musical is my favorite. Music, characters, history. Everything just seems perfect. In this episode of a timeless, classic novel reversed by a musical, director Carol Reed embodies a Broadway hit on a movie screen. <br /> <br /> Moving from a musical to a musical is not an easy one. You must have the right voices, the right set, the right script and the right game. All signs indicate yes for this game. Looks like it was written for the screen! <br /> <br /> Our story takes place in gay old England, where a boy named Oliver manages to get out of the orphanage. He sneaks across the country to London, where he meets with a group of juvenile delinquents led by Dodger, a clever talking fast pickpocket. The leader of this gang is Fagin, an elderly man who sells all the stolen goods. <br /> <br /> But all is not well in the city of London when Bill Sykes, played by Oliver Reed and his loving girlfriend Nancy, got confused with Oliver, Fagin and his young troops, and the law. This is followed by a wonderful story of love, affection and great musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Whether you like musicals or not, listen to these melodies and you will hum them all day. Oliver! it is a triumph on the stage and beyond and is a timeless work of art.
