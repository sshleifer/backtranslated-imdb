I saw this movie. This film is the best in accordance with today's needs. Marriage dowry is the main problem now. In the formulation of this problem, this film is the best. In this film, Indian values ​​are very well laid out. Modern youth must understand this problem. Girls less. And because of this dowry problem, the girls committed suicide. If this problem persists, then the day when there are no girls is just around the corner. So, keep in mind, this statement, today's youth should understand that we cannot accept dowry in marriages. dowry should not be taken. And if we understand this problem, then we can see a new trend in society. This is a major change in society.
