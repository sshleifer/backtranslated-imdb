I am from Romania, I will try to speak English. All I want to say about this film is that it will be my very first number. Look at it at least 30 times and see it for years. It has all the little things that I like about the movies, it makes me crying very touchingly. Shows a lot of distorted love things and questions about love and reality, as well as true things that matter to different people. It so happens that for me it is most important of all, love, the soul of man, he is an inner being, and this I see in this film. Perhaps for me it is much more than just a movie, in my opinion, proof that it can really exist and that you benefit most from every moment when you live with your soulmate. From reality to science fiction far, but ... what if. What if all capitalism disappears and the economy collapses, falls? We would all be concerned about other issues, and I think that on your deathbed you remember more than wealth, not adventure, not the countries you visited, and the people who remember you. But true friends, your true love and the hope that after your death everything will be damn perfect, and people will be kind and care about them more. SEE THIS MOVIE, and it will probably guide you through your whole life, as it did with me :) Greetings from Romania
