this film is a masterpiece, a story about a young woman during the war, and it really happens, not quite like a film, but this is a great story, I was impressed by this film, acting and history, where I like the film, because it’s true It gives me the feeling that I was there, and I feel sorry for the director, who is played by Marushka Detmers, because he wants to end his life here in this way. I recommend everyone to watch this movie, especially the young and those who learn something from this movie. This film can be compared with the film “The Soldier of Orange” or with any real story that happened in World War II.
