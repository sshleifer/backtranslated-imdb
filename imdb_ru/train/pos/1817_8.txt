All Dogs Go to Heaven plays in a dog crime. The film is a delight for children with a comic and dark, but satisfying and happy ending of the plot with lots of songs and dances. This shows the outcast Charlie, a canine criminal who is killed, but returned from the dead. He meets a homeless human girl who looks at him, and through this relationship he understands the meaning of life and self-sacrifice. This is a cute animation that I really liked as a child. I highly recommend this film to children. I'm not sure how adults will react to this. (I tried to watch it a few years ago on VHS, but these recordings don't last long, do they?)
