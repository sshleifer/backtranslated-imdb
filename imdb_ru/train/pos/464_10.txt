I fell in love with Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves, and then became even more fascinated by her scope and skill in Hilary and Jackie. Now comes this stunning image of a rich girl who rejects breeding and the convention in favor of the motherhood of the tortured soul of the child's man, clearly in need of motherhood. Her eyes are the mirror of his soul - and how tender and beautiful they are. <br /> <br /> Those who take things literally will find the poetic and allegorical leadership of Marlene Gorris quite disappointing. Romantics who are ready to go with amazing kinetic energy - this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded.
