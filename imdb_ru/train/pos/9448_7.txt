It was undoubtedly the most disturbing film I have ever seen. The first part of the film, albeit strange, has an easy and fun quality. The journey begins on such a calm note, in detail and emphasizing the beauty of the hills of the Appalachians. But this is a delusion outside of faith. Obvious social problems (inbreeding) and the deformities of the villagers are only the first disturbing aspects of the film. I can still hear Bobby moaning in pain, and I shudder at the thought. Lewis's leg made me flinch. Nonetheless, although the film was generally very disturbing and disturbing, he raised some interesting questions. When is it moral or right to take the life of another person? What morals can make us do or not do in some cases? And is dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? Whatever conclusions are drawn from the film, this is an achievement in itself (despite some aspects that were frighteningly real and terrible).
