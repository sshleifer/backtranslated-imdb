The film concerns Philip (Leslie Howard), he is a serious, but with disabilities medical student. He mortally falls in love with a heartless, predatory waitress named Mildred (Bette Davis). She leaves him talking with others (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny). In the meantime, he is tied up with a romance with other fiancés (Kay Johnson, Francis Dee), but she is returning to a mutually destructive affair. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the best and first of many versions of the films of the novel by Somerset Maugham. Bette Davis as a fierce Cockney waitress who won another great interpretation with a charming and glowing job, is completely hypnotic in her story of captivity, which goes from beginning to end. Davis raised fame with her work. Her role as a tough and rough imperious woman will be repeated several times in acting. Leslie Howard, being essentially a good and decent student, slightly destroyed, gives an excellent and melancholic role. He was a terrific actor (Gone With the Wind), except for the producer and the writer, and was killed in a plane crash during World War II. Both will play again in the “Purified Forest” (1936). The atmosphere of the film thoughtfully recreated in the studio RKO (Radio Picture Inc) is completely convincing. Redone in 1946 by Edmund Goulding with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henrade; and in 1964 by Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Lawrence Harvey. The movie will appeal to fans of classic cinema. Rating: very good, but a bit dated.
