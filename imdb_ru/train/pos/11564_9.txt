I have seen this film many times, and I like all the bad teachers who want to give it ten out of ten, but I feel that this will be unfair to other good films. However, I think this is one of those rare gems: the perfect comedy. This I would risk one of the greatest comic films of all time. Mattau and Lemmon are perfectly matched and do not match. The script is so sharp that you need to stop the bleeding. The story is well known and has already been described in other comments. The two main characters give extraordinary performances, the girls are great, and the situations are funny. Not a single curse is seen (note that Hollywood, you do not need to swear to be ridiculous, you must be witty), and the transition from scene to film happens without problems. They no longer make them like this. Timeless
