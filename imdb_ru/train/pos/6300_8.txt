I like this movie. I thought it would be easy to watch and easy to forget. I ran out after watching it to buy a DVD, but this is not easy to forget! <br /> <br /> The script is great and the casting can not be more perfect. Each character has its own moment, and I laughed a lot during the whole movie, the comedy time was on top. <br /> <br />
