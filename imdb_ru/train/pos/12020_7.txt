Last Hard Men finds James Coburn outlawed by fulfilling a long sentence, freed from the chain gang. Whether he and his friends go to the Mexican border from prison and to safety. No, not because Coburn has a mission. To kill the peace officer who brought him and in the process killed his woman. <br /> <br /> This peace officer is Charlton Heston, who is now retired, and he knows what is behind Coburn. As he explains this to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn hid in a shack and was involved in a confrontation similar to Wako. His Indian woman was killed by a hail of bullets. This is not what he is proud of; she was a casualty of the hunt for people. <br /> <br /> So that we donâ€™t feel sorry for Koburn, he lets us know that he is actually an evil person. Heston is his usual steadfast hero, but the acting awards in The Last Tough Man go to James Coburn. It takes everyone else off the screen when it's on. <br /> <br /> Koburnu had the brilliant idea to make sure that Heston tracked him down by abducting Hershey and taking her to an Indian reservation where white authorities could not touch him. He knows that Heston must do it personally. <br /> <br /> The Koburn gang includes Morgan Poll, Talmus Rasulala, John Quad, Larry Wilcox and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum, who is his son-in-law. <br /> <br /> The last strong man is one nasty and cruel Western. Andrew McLaughlin led him, and I think this is probably a project originally intended for Sam Pekingpou. This, of course, shows his great influence on the liberal use of slow motion to increase violence. Of which a lot. <br /> <br /> For your favorite movie, The Last Strong Men is your last movie.
