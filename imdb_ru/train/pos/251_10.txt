"If Ned Kelly was born later, he probably would have won the Victoria Cross in Gallipolli." Such was the courage of Ned. <br /> <br /> In Australia and especially in the country of Victoria, the name Ned Kelly can be said and immediately recognized. In Greta, he is still a hero, the life of the Blood of Jerilderie depends on tourism, which he created, but in Mansfield they still have not forgotten that the three policemen whom he "killed" were from there. <br /> <Many of the buildings that he visited in his life still stand. From the old prison of Melbourne, where he was hanged, to the post, which he kept in Gerilderi. The camera in which he was once kept in Greta is put on display in Benella, and you can visit the site of the Ann Jones Hotel, the station, and even logs, where he was captured in Glenrovan. <br /> <br /> All evidence of the filmâ€™s events (with the exception of his love interest) can be found all over Victoria, in police records and even in Sesh, who was awarded Ned for saving Dick Shelton from drowning. None of this is wrong, and what was excluded would further justify the actions of Neds. The horse that Ned "stole" was actually stolen by Wild Wright (the man with whom Ned puts in a box after he was released from prison). Ned was already in prison when the horse was stolen, so he could not steal it. <br /> <br /> The letter from Gerildier is larger than previously stated. This is not self-justification, this is Ned's biography, a sketch of what he stood for and whom he defended. So read it, watch the movie, and then decide what is behind Ned.
