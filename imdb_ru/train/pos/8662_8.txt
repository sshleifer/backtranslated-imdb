I really liked it. In fact, if I see it again (and plan), I will just love it. I will repeat to other reviewers, saying that this film really grows on you when you watch. It begins slowly, but the path in envelopes is very natural and has a mood. You just fall into it. <br /> <br /> I really liked the summer atmosphere of the film, and I thought that the film as a whole was very touching. The characters have a strong element of realism, and the film very slowly and gently weaves a spell when you engage in various interactions between them and want to know how this will ultimately work out and what ways the characters will choose. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m very surprised that there are less than a dozen comments on this matter - there are obscure television films that have more comments than Rich In Love. <br /> <br /> One thing I will do is say, I missed the final, which drives me crazy, and I have to watch it again to see it. This is a film that may not be for everyone, but I feel that it is greatly underestimated (even some of my favorite cinema-purist fans, who have seen almost all the films that are there, have not seen it), and it seems even do not have much of the bulletin board, but I really liked it, and all those who love family dramas, warm in decor, atmosphere and unhurried languid pace, may be worth a look at this. It is especially noteworthy that this is happening in South Carolina, so for those (like me) who love the south, and the films that take place there, this is a pearl. I will add my voice to a few comments and recommend this little-known film.
