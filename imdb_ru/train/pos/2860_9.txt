It ran from 1959-1973. This is more than its durability, which speaks volumes for this series. In addition, he experienced changes in fashion and taste of the 50s, psychedelic 60s and remained popular in the 70s. <br /> <br /> I remember repetitions of this series. It was a successful combination of all his elements from the stories, actors and productions that made him exceptional. Lorna Green had his character in this series. His conversion was through generations. All family members could enjoy it. He balanced morality with violence, humor with seriousness. The animated series was created as a result of this as a result of its impact. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated, and many will not know its meaning.
