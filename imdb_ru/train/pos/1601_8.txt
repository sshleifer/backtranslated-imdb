This is a fairly simple, not very active, but very charming movie. There were moments when I could understand why Cher won an Oscar for Best Actress, but there were other moments when I wondered why Glenn Close didn’t win for Fatal Attraction. In any case, Oscar and the Golden Globe win, and BAFTA-nominated Sher plays Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with a low-paid job that Mr. Johnny Cammari (Danny Aiello) just asked to marry him. He promises her that he will return in a month, as his mother is ill, so she wants the wedding to have as much of his family as possible. The only problem is that when she finds Brother Johnny without hands, Ronnie (nominated for Golden Globe by Nicholas Cage), they start a relationship, and there the love continues on this moon scene (hence the name). In addition, Oscar in the lead role nominated Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe, winning Olympia Dukakis as Roses Castorini and John Mahoney in the role of Perry. It ends without a wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronnie were happy together. He received an Oscar for Best Essay, A Screenplay Written Directly to the Screen, and was nominated for Best Director by Norman Juson (Into the Heat of the Night) and Best Picture. He was nominated for a BAFTA Award for “Best Score” for Dick Hyman and “Best” The original script, and he was nominated for a Golden Globe for best comedy / musical and best script. It was number 96 for 100 years, 100 quotes (“Enough with it!”), It was number 17 for 100 years, 100 passions, and it was number 41 for 100 years, 100 laughter. Fine!
