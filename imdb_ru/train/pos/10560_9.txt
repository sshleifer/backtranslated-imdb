Jimmy Cagney is constantly chasing your eyes in this story of a director who vigorously fights against upcoming “talking” films. <br /> <br /> This story of love, deception, women and dancing is presented in such a way that, as a viewer, you never feel like a boring moment. The direction of the crowd scenes in the rehearsal halls was extremely well done. This story has never been lost in this insane pace. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the material presented here are outdated, but it doesn’t matter, because when you look at it in 1933, it’s incredible to watch it next to many other TV shows that were released at that time. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Cagney is a spectacle for the sore eyes in this film, never losing composure as an eternally working producer of announcements made for movie theaters in the form of splash screens. So he tries to save his ass from leaving the business; he was a producer on Broadway before he started it. Nan, Joan Blondell, is great because she is neglected by love interest, she gives such a harsh presentation that is so unusual for films of that time, it is so great to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a change. <br /> <br /> The only problem I encountered in the film is the huge performances at the end. They were magnificent in themselves, beautifully set and wonderfully created, but they simply did not fit into the story. The only link they have to the main story is that Cagney had to make 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract, and this is what he did. It was hard for me to believe that this is what the girls rehearsed during the entire film, and that these sets could fit in the cinema. Thus, "Sitting in the backyard" was much more suitable for the story. <br /> <br /> Staging at the end seemed to stop this frantic story and it was not good. I was tired of watching the first musical episode, and then I realized that two more were being prepared. These episodes also caused a lot of noise from the audience. <br /> <br /> In general, a great movie with a sour ending. <br /> <br /> 9/10
