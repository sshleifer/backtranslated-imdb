I was attracted to this film at the moment when I saw his preview on the night of Oscar. When I read about Kay Pollak, I was hooked. We Americans are suckers for returning a child. <br /> <br /> I understand that this film was a huge draw in Sweden. As a very provincial American, I can only guess the reason. Perhaps this is because of the provocative joke that Lenaâ€™s character makes at the beginning of the film, and other social comments, but perhaps this is because of the main message, which, I believe, has the same appeal in all rich societies. <br /> <br /> The message of this film for me is the same as the film Titanic. Life is short, and as far as we know, that's all we have. It can be picked up at any time. So isn't it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind walls that separate us from other people, because we are so afraid of being injured? Breaking the walls is painful, but on the other side of these disgusting walls lies a feeling of vitality. Feeling alive is worth the risk. Give and receive. So start living NOW. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize this film for its lack of characterization and other flaws. I say that you are all sophisticated. Pull yourself together, this is a parable, a fable for rich Western people who are financially rich, but whose souls are in extreme poverty. <br /> <br /> So join a choir or group, or help build housing or distribute food to those less fortunate than you. Spread joy and make the world a better place as you go out and communicate with your neighbor. Writing a check is not enough. By the way, we are a social appearance. Even the most humble of your fellows can influence you in ways you never thought possible. <br /> <br /> Stormy individualism has its place, but it is overvalued.
