“Straight Story” is a really beautiful film about an elderly man named Alvin Straight, who rides a lawnmower across the country to visit his alienated, dying brother. But this is only the main synapse ... this film is about much more. This was the last role of Richard Farnworth before his death, and she will definitely remember him. He is a stubborn old man, not much different from many old men, whom we probably know. <br /> <br /> “Straight story” is a film that everyone should watch at least once in their life. It will reach down and touch some part of you, at least if you have a heart, it will happen.
