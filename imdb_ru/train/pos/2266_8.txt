It takes some time to get used to the slogans of Nick Nolte in Nebraska before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright. As soon as you pass the bar, it turns into a fascinating story about a man who loses everything, trying to do good. <br /> <br /> American Nolte moves to Germany, marries a famous actress and is satisfied with success in all respects, until the war begins. He is visited by a cheerful American, John Goodman, who convinces him to accept the post of anti-Semitic radio broadcaster for the Nazis. Nolte has no politics, but he thinks that it is not easy - to write a role that is almost impossible, and then play it yourself. Another American secret agent modifies Nolth's radio scripts — inserting a cough, sneezing there — that will serve as a code for transmitting intelligence to the allies. But there is a catch. No one will know about the real role of Nolte as an American agent, except for Goodman, Donovan and Roosevelt himself. If it is ever revealed, the Americans will be denied recognition. <br /> <br /> Nolte rushes forward, and his wicked shows are very popular in Germany. His adorable wife, Cheryl Lee, knows nothing about what is happening, and she doesn’t care. Nolte and Lee live in what he repeatedly calls the "nation of two." The war ends and disaster begins. He is captured by the Americans, who are bitter because of his betrayal. He is beaten and left in the mud. He was saved by Goodman, his “fairy-fairy,” who sends him to an anonymous existence in Greenwich Village and sends him some money from time to time. <br /> <br /> By 1960, he managed to develop friendship with his neighbor, the artist Alan Arkin, who also lost his family and claims that they now belong to a secret fraternity. But for some reason his location and his personality are leaking out, and he is more or less accepted by a group of ancient Aryan racists, led by a dentist and a priest. Its facade and mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations. Needlessly beaten by an ex-soldier. But - miraculously - his beloved wife returns to him by the ancient Aryans. Another catch: it later turns out that it was not his wife, but rather her younger sister who had loved him since adolescence. <br /> <br /> In the end, he publishes his memoirs in an Israeli prison in 1967 before a court of law. crimes against humanity. This is not a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Nolte can talk, but not see who is above the camera in prison. This is Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann seems pleasant enough. He advises Nolte that it is a bad habit of typing for fifteen hours in a row. “It is important to relax. You must learn to relax. ” Nolte laughs loudly and shouts: “That's how I got here.” The film is filled with such irony. At some point in his spontaneous conversations, Arkin tells him that "despite everything, I still think that people are good at heart." I don’t know if the film was a commercial success, but if it weren’t, it could have torpedoed it for a younger audience of viewers who may have never heard of Anne Frank, let alone that supposedly final Statement in her diary. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this is a film for adults and for adult patients. The story moves slowly, there is very little violence in it, no pursuit of a car, no exchange of fire, and people do not seem to be subjected to manic speech pressure. Much of this is likely to elude viewers who do not open themselves to his conscious approach. Nolte calls the military relationship between him and his wife "a nation of two." This is a fairly compact phrase. There is no doubt that someone can come up with a simple definition, but it takes a little concentration to understand its emotional meaning. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a man who loses everything - his ability to write, his personality, his wife (twice), his only friend, his country, his self-esteem. At some point, he stops walking along a crowded street in New York, and just stands there before dark when a curious policeman leads him. The reason he stopped was because he simply had nowhere to go. Vonnegut describes much more than depression. I do not want to sound condescending, but this is a feeling that is difficult to understand in my youth. Teenagers may think that they know that they are holding Nolte in this one place, but this does require maturity and a lively feeling of finiteness that only maturity can bring. <br /> <br /> Remember how Robert Frost said that the house is the place that when you go there, should they take you? Well, no place will take Nolte.
