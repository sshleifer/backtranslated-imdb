Wow, I liked this movie. He may not have had the funding and advertising that Hollywood blockbusters get past, but this doubles the emotional hit. The plot revolves around this one family from Utah, and it is the connections between people in the family that provide the film with its blow. The main character (Giovanni Ribisi) plays his part very well, he never leaves you to believe that he plays all his senses. Although his brother (Elias Koteas) stole the show for me. When the two were in scenes together, they limited their lines from each other, giving fantastic performances. Great cast, great movie.
