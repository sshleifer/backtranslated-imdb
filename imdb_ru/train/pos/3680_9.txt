Paris, je t'aime (2006) - a film consisting of 18 segments. You can do the math - 18 segments in 120 minutes means that each director had seven minutes to tell her or his stories. The film is based on the premise that you can really tell a story in such a short time. The room is working. Almost all segments are powerful, complete and satisfying. Each of them represents its own aspect of the Parisian experience, and almost every director draws outstanding performances from a group of great and almost great actors. <br /> <br /> There were so many vivid images in this film that it’s hard to choose one or two favorites. Probably the most memorable for me were Juliette Binoche as the grieving mother in the Place de Victoires segment, Gene Rowlands as the older beauty in Quartier Latin, Catalina Sandino Moreno as the maid in the Loin du 16ème segment and Margo Martindale as a postman from Colorado who learned to speak French, so she can visit Paris (segment 14ème Arrondissement). <br /> <br /> One should especially mention Gulliver Heck, probably the meanest boy who ever chased an American tourist at a Paris metro station (Tuileries segment). <br /> <br /> This is an outstanding film. My wife and I decided to rent it in a few months so that we could catch some of the subtleties that we probably missed. However, Paris was photographed so beautifully that I would advise you to try to see it on the big screen. In any case, do not miss!
