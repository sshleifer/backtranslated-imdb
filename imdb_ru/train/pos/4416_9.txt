Harvey Keital's best performance in the new century. A very beautifully photographed, beautiful shot of Cuba's pre-Castro. The story revolves around the nephew of a local petty crime boss who develops friendship with an American with Hollywood connections. This is indeed the moment when the boy realizes the fact that a small circle of people whom he knows actually lives in a much larger, much more complex world that he does not yet understand. clear In general, a truly professional work that fits well with the traditions of Latin American cinema. The only drawback is the decision to shoot in synchronous English, not in Spanish - probably to improve sales in the United States. Unfortunately, this makes the film a little less convincing. But if you can see behind this, you will find a spiritual journey to another world. Featured.
