Being an impressionable youth when I first saw the Gundam Wing series, after re-watching the series I reiterated my belief that this series was not only beautifully animated, but also the plot, the gundam design, the character design and the depth of the character were masterfully executed. At first, they looked like a kind of group of boys, but the stylish appeal of the characters can in part be attributed simply to great art, and individuals create clear and cute differences between the characters. Consequently, it is extremely easy to become attached to any particular character. I personally liked Hiro because of his persistent personality. Although I may be biased due to the sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing solves the deeper issues of war and life in general (how can we achieve peace?), While ensuring battles in big robot suits . which is at least excellent.
