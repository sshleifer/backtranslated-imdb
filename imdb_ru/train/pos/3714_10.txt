First, I did not know what to expect when I started the video. <br /> <br /> Every time someone returns a genre of a cult-type movie and adapts it to the present, something is incomprehensibly lost in translation. <br /> This is not the point. This film is just beginning on the right track. This is partly familiar territory, but it can also surpass it. Crocsilla scene anyone? This is a must see, and just try to keep calm. This film takes some of the old fun cult classic films and managed to blend them smoothly with modern production. Nice to see someone fill the need in this market. Very well done. <br /> <br />
