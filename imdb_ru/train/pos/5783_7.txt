I read Kerching reviews on IMDb, and, frankly, I have not seen any positive reviews so far. I really like Kerch. Kerch talks about a teenager named Taj Lewis. To earn £ 1,000,000 for his mother, he creates a website called rudeboy. The site offers a lot of interesting things, if only Taj and his 2 friends - Danny and Seymour can prevent Taj from exposing. I find this show quite funny, and I like to watch it. The action is OK, but it could definitely be better, the characters are funny, especially Danny Spooner, Taej's friend, his stupidity makes him funny. and another friend Taj Seymour. Also Carlton, the owner of a cafe called "Cold." We never see him, we only hear him. Taya Omar's younger brother and his older sister Missy are also funny. And best friend Missy Kariša. As many times as Tazha is almost exposed, almost. Like comedy, the drama in Kerch, such as the love life and the loss of loved ones, makes this program great.
