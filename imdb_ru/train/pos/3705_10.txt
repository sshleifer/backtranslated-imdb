I don't understand the low 5.7 rating on this movie. This is a delight for people who love a strong plot and dark atmosphere. The tone is reminiscent of "Midnight in the garden of good and evil," up to the scene of action (savanna). The game is strong, and I was struck by the credibility of Kenneth Brann's southern accent. Famke Jansen is gorgeous, Robert Duval is effective in a small part, and Embeth Davitz is a BOMB. Her is also a very full nude scene. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly standard, but effectively executed.
