The choice of Sylvester Stallone as the main character of Renny Harlin deserves praise, since Stallone is the type of tough and rude person who previously gave the necessary daring and versatile aura to the characters of Rocky Balbao and Rambo. But comparing the Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is a contrived idea. <br /> <br /> The excellently created opening scene introduces the audience with trepidation, tension and intrigue, which will absorb them in the subsequent bloody and dangerous meeting with the criminals. Robbery and high-altitude transfer of cash in suitcases from one plane to another - this is something that had not previously been filmed. <br /> <br /> The biting coldness of the snowy Alps and the unfolding deception and betrayal among the antagonist forces make them tremble with trepidation. The forces of amazing adventures and ruthless murders bring the drama to the end. <br /> <br /> Good films are not made every year, and people do not have enough eyes to watch from time to time. In addition to dirty language / language, which provides brazen excitement during certain scenes, the film can be viewed as a film that will not disappear because of its attractive appeal, even watching it after so many years.
