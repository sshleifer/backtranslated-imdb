I first saw the Thief in childhood, which makes me almost as old as Genie. Like any child, I was delighted with the imagination, ingenuity and energy of the film. A few years later, I realized how much satire and script wit I missed when I first viewed it. I have never missed an opportunity to watch it over the past years. In addition to the script, the production goes beyond the fantasy genre. This is Korda, the narrator at his best. When you see the Thief in childhood, you know that you had a great time. When you see a Thief as an adult, you know that you saw a masterpiece. It is as eternal as the story to which it relates. Amazing job. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
