It does not seem that this film managed to please many people. First, not many, it seems, saw it in the first place (I just stumbled upon it by chance), and then, judging by the reviews and rating, of those who didn’t like it very much. <br /> <br /> Well, I did. I usually tolerate Gere for his looks and his charisma, and although I did not consider him a great actor, I know that he can go crazy pretty well (I liked his Mr. Jones). But in this performance everything is different. He is not good at it, and he is not charming. His character is completely different from everything I've seen from him until this moment - old, ugly, broken, resolute. And Gere, in that for me is still his best performance, copes well with his task. I think this is a sign of how well an actor does his job, if you can't imagine someone else doing it instead - think that Hopkins is Hannibal Lecter, or Washington - like Alonzo on the day of training. That's how good it is here, Gere. <br /> <br /> I was fine with the other actors too. I think I would not shoot the Danes in this role, mainly because I think she is too good for that. But she actually does an excellent job, holding herself with Gere in great shape, which is no small feat. Strickland easily performs the best acting support, in part, which requires her considerable range. I really think she owns a key scene with Gere and Danes, and this is a great achievement. <br /> <br /> So what about the rest of the movie, other than the great acting? This story is perhaps not very surprising, some of its aspects are 8 mm, but it adds the storyline “Veteran breakthroughs in a beginner” to who-dunnit, as well as (as Silence of the Lambs) adds a sense of urgency, trying to save the girl and the upcoming retired Gere character. All this is a background for the development of the two main characters, as they help each other to get comfortable in their new life positions. It's a lot to achieve in 100 minutes, but everything is done well, and we ultimately take care of the characters and what happens to them. <br /> <br /> Direction and photography were adequate. I could do without modern music and video cameras of movements and cutting, but then I’m an old moron, and it really wasn’t that bad, in fact I think it helped with the atmosphere of the film, which, as you might guess, by and large not happy. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
