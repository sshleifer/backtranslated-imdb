unlike the person listed above, I felt that this film was really funny, especially in scenes where there is a lot of confusion. I do not want to give the plot and storyline to people who have not yet watched it, but I will say that Pares Raval does not have such an extensive role as in the previous Priyadarshan films, for example, Gera Fery and Hungam. Paresh Rawal plays an amazing role in the small role he was given, John Abraham copes equally well, Akshay Kumar proved that he is not less in this film than in Vakta and in almost all of his films after Andaaz. Despite the fact that all three heroines in this film debuted, they did a pretty good job, especially Nargis, who looks very nice and hot. I would say that if you liked Hunama or Gera Feri, you just need to watch this movie.
