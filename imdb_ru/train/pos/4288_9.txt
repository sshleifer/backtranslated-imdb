Rain or shine outside, you enter the cinema. It makes you happy. (If not, go straight ahead.) The lights go out. You calm down with an ice cream bar. Moving pictures start to flicker on the screen. You feel satisfied. In the dark you have returned to the beginning of time. Sit by the fire ... look at the modern version of the flickering fire 24 times a second and share the joy of discovering the unknown turns and turns of the script with the rest of your clan / viewers. <br /> <br /> Those who are not satisfied with themselves should not write comments. (Long live romantic comedies ...)
