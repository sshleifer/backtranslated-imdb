Japanese animators have unique freedom with animation, so they can usually go out with movies like that, which ultimately end up on anime fans' hard drives and on student floors, but are almost completely ignored outside of their country of origin. Feline Soup is one of those films that, from the point of view of the West, is supposed to be tested on drugs or analyzed in depth. In fact, this is just a detailed surreal travel. <br /> <br /> There is no real dialogue that makes it easy to transfer to other interested parties who are not interested in such things as subtitles. The cat and his half-dead (mentally retarded) sister travel in different landscapes of imagination and communication. Is there a general theme of water or lack thereof (perhaps due to the fact that the cat sinks at the beginning? Perhaps because of the name?). There is an interesting variety of Genesis. There is a pig that eats itself. Elephant out of the water. And this is great, compelling, exciting and fun - provided that you donâ€™t watch for drugs that cannot experience anything visually unique without comparing it to an acidic ride. In the end, the film shuts down, adding another compelling self-reflective level to the process. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
