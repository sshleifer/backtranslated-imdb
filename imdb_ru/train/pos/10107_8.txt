“Ard Sathya” is one of the best films ever made in Indian cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, this is the most successful parallel cinema with a hard hit, which also turned out to be a commercial success. Even today, Ard Sathya inspires all the leading directors of India. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the real life of the Mumbai police in the 70s. Unlike any police in other cities in India, the Mumbai police system involves a completely different system. Govind Nihalani creates very practical costs based on the real life of the Mumbai police officer. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Anand Velankar, a young hot policeman from a poor family. families. His father is a sharp police constable. Anand himself suffers from his father’s ideologies and incidents of atrocities committed by his father against his mother. Anand's approach to immediate action against crime is an inert desire to satisfy his work. Here the film takes place on the plot, in which Anand's constant efforts in the fight against crime are trampled by his elders. This leads to frustration, as he cannot achieve the desired job satisfaction. Due to frustration, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in detention centers and bars, which also turns him into an alcoholic. <br /> <br /> The spirit within it is still alive, as it constantly struggles with the system. He knows about the Metro system, where the police and politicians are inertly connected at the far end. His compromise on unethical practices is negative. Finally he was suspended from work. <br /> <br /> The Direction is a masterpiece and a solid core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand bursts into the house of the gangster Rama Shetty from the underworld to arrest him, followed by a short conversation that is fantastic. In many scenes in the film there are exciting moments. <br /> <br /> The practical approach of the scenario is the main blow. Alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage, deceptions are all part and parcel of the Mumbai police even today. These aspects are considered brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Finally, the films belong to the “One Man” show, where Om Puri portrays Ananda Velankar, who absolutely brilliantly relives all his emotions.
