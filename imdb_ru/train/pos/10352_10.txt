Religious fanaticism is rampant everywhere. Australia is not immune from this. <br /> <br /> Dingo kidnapped the child, and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having “killed” her own child. I do not want to spoil your story, but you need to know the basics, before kneeling to understand what made this woman end up in prison. <br /> <br /> Buy or rent a movie and find out how deeply rooted human hatred of those who are different continues to flourish around the globe. <br /> <br /> This is a very moving film with a terrific cast of actors. <br /> <br /> Both Meryl Streep (with her famous Australian accent) and Sam Neal, whose accent is his native pronunciation, are outstanding. Those who have minor roles are also pretty good. <br /> <br /> You will remember this film for many years. <br /> <br /> Watch it!
