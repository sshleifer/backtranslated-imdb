As an aging rocker, this film mentions Heep and Quo - my two favorite bands in history - but with an incredible cast of actors (all) and a fantastic storyline - I just like this creative genius. I canâ€™t recommend it more highly - and Mick Jones added so much (the leading foreign singer Foreigner along with the greatest rock singer of all time - Lou Gram) - I watched this magnificent work more than 10 times - Bill Nighy - what voice - Jimmy Neil - talent trickles out of each pore - then Astrid .... and Karen ..... what else can an aging rocker ask for !! 10/10 is a bloody diamond. <br /> <br /> Alastair, Perth, West Oz, originally from Windsor, England.
