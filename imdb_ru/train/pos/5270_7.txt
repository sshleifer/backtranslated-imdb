This movie can be really bad, but it's a lot of fun. Bad behavior and bad leadership reinforce the hysteria of the film. The twins are very funny in their roles in Konanesk. If you go to this film, waiting for the first Conan or Excalibur, then you will hate it. If you watch it in a good mood and take it as good, silly fun, you will have a good time. Look at the scene where they are trying to hang the brothers, this is the funniest scene in the movie. I wish Mystery Science Theater 3000 did it !!
