SPOILERS This is an exciting movie about scammers. But who is cheating here? When does a hunter turn into prey? This dark, dark movie is slow and seductive. It draws you to itself and pulls you down the garden path, known to everyone as soon as you think you are safe. <br /> <br /> He has an exciting scenario, with a good game (at least from the leads). I did not notice the background music, but it never rattled, so it must have been done correctly. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that I liked this film, because I usually do not go into this genre, but this one sucked me and kept it on a hook to the end.
