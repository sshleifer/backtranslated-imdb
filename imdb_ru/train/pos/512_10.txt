"Stairway to Heaven" - an outstanding invention of film production, which probably will never be repeated. I rate him as “The Wizard of Oz” and “The Queen of Africa”, although this is a completely different type of film than the “Queen of Africa”. “Stairway to Heaven” is a psychodrama that uses the concepts of performance and technical effects that, as far as I know, are absolutely unique. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a combination of black-and-white and color material - as in “Oz”, but the contrast value goes far beyond the simple, but beautiful effect achieved in “Oz”. In “Ladder”, the goal and effect of contrast can only be described as powerful. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant aspect of “Ladder” is the concept of “time” and how it is used here. How could anyone think of a better way to make time stand still ?? literally? And then - the Ladder itself! <br /> <br /> If you have a fantasy, you will agree with me. “Stairway to Heaven” is a real gem.
