I just watched it after my mother brought him from America for me, was afraid to watch it after all the negative comments here, but I have to say, yes, the acting is stupid, some effects are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But you have to remember that it was supposed to be 1898, not 2005, and for such a small budget I thought it was not bad. I liked this version much more than the version of Spielberg, which I saw last week. <br /> <br /> I read the book many times and found that almost all the time I say “aah, yes, it's in a book,” another version almost did not exist in this book. <br /> <br /> So well done, at least to try to make a true version.
