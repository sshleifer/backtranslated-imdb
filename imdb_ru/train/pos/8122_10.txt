I never saw this movie until I bought a cassette last year. I was delighted and entertained. It contains all the elements of what I love to see in science fiction, in a book or on screen. There are social comments, speculations and a good story. <br /> <br /> There is something creepy and funny when I look at the “distant future” of the 60s and 70s of 1936. <br /> <br /> I think this is a must see, and not just for science fiction.
