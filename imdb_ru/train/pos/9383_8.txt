From the directors of the films "The Last Seduction" and "Kill Me Again" comes another movie in noir style. John Dahl created a niche for himself, making films on the theme of adultery, blackmailing in the early 90s. Although I did not have a special opinion regarding the last seduction. But now Mr. Dahl is resorting to the management of television shows. It's a shame, because the man had talent. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS ** This is a pretty impressive film that revolves around a wandering cage), which goes to Wyoming to work. However, he is not lucky and becomes erroneous for a Texas hit man who owns the bar of JT Walsh. He was given the task of killing his wife (Boyle). But Cage decides to split up after receiving the prepayment, without doing so. On the way out of town, he accidentally hit a guy on the way, which he then took to the local hospital. At this point, Cage coincidentally meets Walsh, who is also the local sheriff. After that, Cage escapes from his clutches, but meets with the real killer Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> John Dahl is the co-author and director of this film. Therefore, this suggests that the project can be decent when the director expresses his thoughts on the screen. The direction of a good standard, but while watching the movie, I felt that I felt in a television movie. There were too many close shots. However, this does not keep the film from a pleasant experience. The film had a good pace, and the structure was beautiful. Dahl wrote the script with a good duration. <br /> <br /> Cage realistically portrayed the role of a vagabond, although I found his performance somewhat restrained. His facial expressions were high. Lara Flynn Boyle was hot and coped well with her role as a femme fatale. Her hairstyle was far away and could make any guy kneel. Hopper played his part well. But I feel that he was mistaken for this role. He did not convince me that he has the qualities of a killer. The role was not written for its individuality. <br /> <br /> When you watch one of them, youâ€™ll see deja vu from previous films such as Hot Spot and Perfect Kill. Due to the fact that some areas are the same. In general, if you are a fan of noir films, then this one is for you. Worth recommending. 7/10
