Excellent film, realistic picture of modern Finland, touching and deep. One of the best Finnish films ever made. Amazingly captures the daily life in the central Finnish town, the desires and weaknesses of people, joy and sadness. The bright sun of early autumn creates a cool atmosphere for this conscious inspection of people in the welfare society. Lampela is truly one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. It shows that you can make exciting movies without machine guns and bloodshed. His next film, Aila, is also worth seeing, although the story of cleaning up women who are fighting for their work is not as universal as the fate of Jocky.
