No rubbish - no, not even near rubbish. Not original? This is the last thing to say about “2.4 children.” Predictable? of course not! Although it was a somewhat unusual series for the BBC, it was fun, funny and witty. I especially liked Belinda Lang and John Picard - who, I think, played great. Gary Olsen was also very good, like all the other actors. I never knew why this could be read before I read today about the death of Gary Olsen at a relatively young age. I would really like them to do more comedies of this type, much more than them (and would show them here in Israel).
