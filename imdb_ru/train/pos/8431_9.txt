] Did not see this movie? Not even heard of this movie? This will not surprise me. One of the few truly “independent” films created in the last ten years, not a single studio believed in the picture, and it was never chosen for wide distribution. Independent company Kino Films gave BOESMAN AND LENA a very limited circulation with little or no promotion, and most major film critics did not even bother to look at it. I think that a film based on one action, one staged play about apartheid and its influence on two people, never had a chance in today's market - and this is a loss of an intellectual movie buff. <br /> <br /> For the record, both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserved the Oscar nomination (as well as the filmmaker), but the film received such a small fanfare that I can't even blame the academy for that. It is a complex, thought-provoking, and heartbreaking film, and in fact it requires the audience to meet it on its own terms. Taking this into account, this is definitely not a movie for meaningless entertainment. Directed by John Berry wisely does not try to dress up a play by Athol Fugard. Of course, we have been given several turning memories and some exciting scenes, but in general the film “BOSMAN AND LENA” remains a story about two people living in inhuman conditions. <br /> <br /> their basic human rights, Besman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett), no one else to attack except for each other. The third character joins them for a while (Willie John, a stunning largely dumb role), but the film’s focus never deviates from the main characters and who they have become. Bassett and Glover give bold performances, like a broken couple, performances that are simply impossible to improve. BOESMAN and LENA vigorously and violently stimulate, both intellectually and emotionally, deserve to be re-opened for home video. Hands down, the best film of the year 2000.
