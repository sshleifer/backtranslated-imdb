This film began slowly, then gained momentum to the middle. However, the fact that the film lasted more than two nights broke this impulse at its peak. The second part really became interesting, but then it was replaced with just a pathetic ending. Do you play football in the yard? Can it really become more juicy and dirty? Now I hear plans for a similar movie based on the 70s. I will not make much effort to tune in to this if it is something like the "60s."
