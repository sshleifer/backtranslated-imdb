This film was very interesting. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive is that Brian Adams writes all the songs in French. The score is also impressive and dramatic. <br /> <br /> The film is made from a mixture of traditional animation in combination with images created on a computer. The result is really amazing. I watch this film at least once a week with my children, and we never get tired of it. The story is convincing and well told. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t understand anyone who would rate this movie below 7th.
