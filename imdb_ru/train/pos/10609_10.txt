I saw this movie last night by cable, and this is unusual. What I like most about this is that he is restrained and restrained, but deeply soulful. Henry Thomas’s performance (he played the child in E.T.) is masterfully slurred (he must be a man of a few words). David Streittern is a wonderful crazy villain. And miraculously (considering that we are talking about a Hollywood piece here), the child acts as the main character, but whoever does not play or does not have lines, but rather simply is (and shines) It is interesting to note that Thomas’s mysterious relationship . The alien was the core of this film; while his connection is w. the child serves as the core of the Good Child. <br /> <br /> Then there is music - oh, what music !! The tunes of Gillian Welch are beautiful, and the whole score is great country-hill music. <br /> <br /> This film is surprisingly atmospheric. I recommend it very much.
