It is very tricky for all 60s to watch a movie. The humor is rather mild, but he grew up on me a lot more than I expected. The cast is first class and they seem to have a wonderful time. Ustinov wanders through the film, mumbling quite funny things under his breath, and all this is very irrelevant; I'll buy the movie as soon as it is released on DVD. The plot is such that Ustinov as a waste was released from prison, posing as a computer prodigy and appropriating money to an American company with an office in London. Maggie Smith is his secretary for a while, and watching her being fired from a variety of jobs is part of the fun. Bob Newhart is his usual imperturbable personality, and Karl Malden is entertained as a stupid and sloppy manager in the London office. The ending is ridiculous and very cynical.
