The film with outstanding brilliance and a sharp and unusual love story, “The Protection of Luzhin” demonstrates an intense attraction between eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character. <br /> <br /> This gives John Turturro something that is probably his best role to date (thank God, they didn't give her to Ralph Fiennes to kill her.) Similarly, Emily Watson demonstrates the richness of her experience (from her outstanding stage experience). To get to the tortured chess master (Turturro), her character must show intelligence, as well as the love of a woman. Watson does not depict sexual beauty, but makes her attractive, which captivates. <br /> <br /> At the chance meeting of Natalia (Watson) and Luzhin, she accidentally prevents him from losing a chess piece that fell into a hole in his clothes - a specially created figure that, as we will see later in the film, became his symbol hopes and aspirations. Later, as their love story developed, she subtly compared dances to chess (Luzhin learned to dance, but never with a partner); she encourages him to lead her "bold, brilliant movements" and at the same time allows him to relax enough to continue to play at his best (and also to realize himself as her lover). <br /> <br /> This is the story of a woman who inspires a man for his greatest achievement and thus finds her deepest satisfaction, emotional and intellectual (or we want to believe so much - of course, for a certain time, Natalia is rather a woman freed than someone who is preparing to become a stereotypical wife and mother). <br /> <br /> Italian sets are awesome. The complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them bring pleasure to the intellectual viewer, but the film is sufficiently accessible to make it a popular mainstream hit, and this is quite deserved. Chess is just a photogenic background for the development of an emotional and emotional film, although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince the chess player that the characters exist. Despite the tragedy of an outstanding author of a classic author, the final outcome, however, is surprisingly inspiring.
