I wonder how the course of research can proceed. I started by viewing the article about Christo "The Gate" in Central Park. The article said that Masles had been a Christo cinematographer for many years. Hmmm ... Then I looked at their work. I believe that one of them passed away, but the other still shoots Christo and Jean-Claude at the stage of their creation. Gray gardens sounded very interesting. Boulder CO's Video Station is the place to look for things that are unclear or unusual, and of course they were available. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women living in the past, and oh, what a glorious past it was. Edith was safe, was born in Bouvier, married well, had some wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was over forty. Her daughter Edie was a debutante, a model and had many beauties. She was never married, and at some point when she was over thirty, she came home to get better. She seems to have some kind of nervous breakdown. Worry about things. This is just a shadow of the world in which they live, because Jackie O. came and decorated the place so that her aunt and cousin were not evicted. This is a 28 room mansion that is worn and frayed. But in the film you will notice fresh paint on the walls. If you look closely at the newspaper clippings, you will see that it was a very messy mess. Edie's outfits came up very cleverly and creatively. The viewer has the impression that Edith likes to be naked, but she is not in the film. Edith was really very beautiful, and you can see the shadow of her beauty when she sings "Tea for Two." Edie was also beautiful in her time and quite attractive at 56 years old. It was a good movie, though not for everyone. When the cat urinates on the portrait of Edith, she declares: "At least someone does what he wants"!
