War is hell. But this documentary about World War II is paradise. <br /> <br /> This series not only captures the spirit, almost exhausts the view of the Second World War, but is also a poetic masterpiece that Lawrence Olivier clearly and beautifully told. /> <br /> This documentary series defines the genre. Without a doubt, it is very long, but you will enjoy all of them and will want to come back again and again. (I have a TV show on DVD, and I probably watch the show three times a year). <br /> <br /> Truly, this is a flawless movie. Besides Olivier, the best part of the series is to listen to how veterans tell their stories; whether itâ€™s a real battle or a pig search for a butcher, so that they have something for dinner. <br /> <br /> I'll go see it right now (again, my ... 11th time).
