If you are the person who is looking for a realistic film or a film with a strong and believable plot, then this film is NOT for you. No, you will hate it. However, for those who love sweet, slightly funny comedies, then you will enjoy your time watching this little movie. <br /> <br /> Tony Randall works for the IRS, and he investigates a very good farmer who never understood that he needed to file a tax return. No matter how hard he tried to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, everyone in the family is happy to have company. They adore him and treat him as one of the family members ... and plan to tie him to their daughter Debbie Reynolds. This is really about the whole plot. But the film receives high marks for a fun script and a decent game. Very cute little souvenir of the late 1950s.
