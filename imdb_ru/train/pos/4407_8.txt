For those who commented on the “Patriot” as accurate (who mostly satanized the British), it was interesting to watch this film. By all accounts, this was the bloodiest war the Americans had ever participated in, and they were the only nationality present. Therefore, it was very nice to see something similar to historical accuracy coming from the other side of the Atlantic, which did not portray America as martyrs or saviors. In general, although the fact that this film brought home was the real horrors of any conflict, and how any actions performed during the war give rise to only the worst actions, often ending in innocent suffering. It was not a movie in which you encouraged someone, but you regretted and hated everyone.
