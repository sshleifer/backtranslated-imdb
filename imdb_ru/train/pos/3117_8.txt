I'll start by being very pleased with this climax of the Born trilogy. Please, oh, please do not destroy it by doing a sequel years later or a prequel. Just leave it alone. Right ... move on. How talented and versatile is Matt Damon ... it seems he just had to play Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the first two Born films, you will not be disappointed with the third installment. He sticks to what works and adds a little more. I was very pleased to see how well all the information that we receive in Identity and Excellence is combined in the Ultimatum to finally draw a complete picture of Jason Born’s hectic past. The sequence of actions is developing rapidly and keeps you on the edge of your place. Fighting between the Born and the assassins is always fun to watch. I've always been a fan of films about CIA agents and how the CIA collects their Intel, and this film is right on this street, which makes it even more exciting for me. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without viewing the two previous issues. You will still enjoy the movie, but I would recommend that you see them first. This would allow you to fully understand Jason Bourne’s character and become attached and become part of his world. This allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure what is better than the first two, but personally I think that the Ultimatum MAYBE have an advantage when comparing a trilogy.
