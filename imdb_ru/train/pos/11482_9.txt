This film is essentially filmed on a manual camera by actors. In a sense, in another form, the killer video diary is full due to the Columbine-style attack. Although this film does not answer all the important questions, it gives you an idea of ​​how easy it would be to get away with it. Through the film, they show you how the actors illegally shortened shotguns, made homemade bombs, and came up with a plan of action for Zero Day. The actors (if you can call them that) were great, they obviously borrowed their own lives from them, but at no stage did I find that they really were acting (something that Tom Cruise should try). The use of CCTV and the 911 operator at the end was brilliant, but I'm not sure if we need the latest scene. In general, although a really good film on a very complex topic.
