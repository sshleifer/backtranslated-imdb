I just watched this movie again and was alarmed by the number of cynics who reject it simply as New Age dad. An excellent film that takes its time to develop, it goes all the time to go over the edge, but never does, and in the end it is meditative, and more truthful than most films that people see in its “coincidences”. I was angry that films like The Prince of Tides and Bugsy (although I liked the latter) were nominated for the best picture of the year (not to mention that Silence of the Lambs won!) was completely ignored. except one nomination for the best script. After repeating it, I think the story supports my initial reaction!
