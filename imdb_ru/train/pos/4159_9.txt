Anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silent forever after watching this movie. This is a wonderful film that tells about Tetsuro's desire to avenge the death of his mother, but also in the process. Traveling by train is Tetsuro's journey from childhood to adulthood. The music and visual styles of the film are a bit out of date (we can say that this is a 70s film), and the animation is only slightly better than in the middle episode of Star Jackets. But the story and the characters are so strong that it really doesn't matter. Be sure to look for any fan of animation!
