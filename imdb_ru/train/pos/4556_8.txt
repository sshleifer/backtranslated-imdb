I watched this movie in the joy of the Shire. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is one of the best films of all time. It is an eternal value, you can extract so much from it that it is amazing. There are details that move, are fun and simply awesome. <br /> <br /> All aspects are noticeable, the picture of the story is perfect, every detail is 100% authentic, even small Irish details have been revealed. <br /> <br /> Using low and high beats gives you two great looks at Christie (watch this). <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis plays incredible. I have never seen an actor do this, ever. This is really awesome. <br /> <br /> And it’s so cool to watch, it flows so well that it’s probably the closest thing you can get in real life. I like it. <br /> <br /> If you didn’t see it, you should see it. Do not hesitate, there is something for everyone.
