Directed by Sydney Lumet made several masterpieces, such as "Network", "Dog Day" or "Serpik." But he was not too lucky with his latest works. Gloria (1999) was pitiful, and “Find me guilty” was an interesting but unsuccessful experiment. Now Lumet brings her best film of the last decades and, in my opinion, a real masterpiece: "Before the devil knows that you are dead." I think this film is like Lumet's revival. There is a great story in this film, which, deeply He has many layers. Also, I think the ending of the movie is perfect. The performances are brilliant. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as usual, brings a great performance, and he is without a doubt one of the best actors of our day. Ethan Hawke He is also a great actor, but he is underestimated from my point of view. His role here is great. The rest of the cast is also excellent (especially the great Albert Finney), but these two actors bring monumental performances that, unfortunately, were ignored by the pitiful Oscar. The film has a good level of intensity, partly Thank you for the performances and, in particular, thanks to the magnificent script. Before Devil knows you are dead, this is a real masterpiece with the perfect direction, a great script and great performances. We need more such films.
