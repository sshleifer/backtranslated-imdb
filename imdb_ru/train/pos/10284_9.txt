"United States Kiss My Ass" <br /> <br /> House of Games is the directorial debut of playwright David Mamet, an effective and sometimes amazing psychological thriller. Star Lindsay Crouse as the best-selling psychiatrist Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the player who made one of his patients think about suicide. At the same time, she leaves the safety and comfort of her usual life and goes to the "city center" to visit a place with a low standard of living, the House of Games. <br /> <br /> Player Mike (superbly played by Joe Mantegna) turns out to be somewhat sharp and moving. He offers the character Crows a deal, if he wants to sit with him for a game, a game with a lot of money in the back room, he will cancel the debts of the patients. There comes a card game, and soon the psychiatrist and the player begin to get acquainted (gain the trust of others), and start a fascinating relationship. What makes the House of Games an interesting and inalienable idea for any movie fan is the constant guessing of who controls the situation: a psychiatrist or a crook, or this famous person with a bluff David Mamet. > <br /> In the House of Games, the direction is boring and in most cases even and boring, but in every David Mamet film, history is central to the whole process, not to the direction. In the House of Games, this shines through partly due to the excellent performances of the two main characters (spectacular and distracting), but basically, as is the case with most of Mame's works, this is a dialogue that captures you and slowly draws you into the film. Nobody in the House of Games speaks what they mean and conversations become a battleground and a war of words. All bluffs and double bluffs that resemble natural poker games. This is a hot topic throughout the film, which is used at the right moment to achieve tremendous tension. The House of the Games can also be viewed as a “class war” movie. With Lindsay Crouse, we have a middle, well-educated psychiatrist, and Joe Mantegna is the exact opposite; the American working class makes a living from an “honest” crime. <br /> <br /> The film seduces. Mantegna seduces a viewer who is very similar to Crows, and the end result ultimately satisfies American cinema. And the finale of the film is definitely something that everyone can see and see, it’s awesome. <br /> <br /> Extremely pleasant impression of the film, which is worth repeated viewing. 9/10
