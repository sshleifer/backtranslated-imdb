I really liked this movie. The acting role of the adult actors was great, although I found the main child a bit tense. But he felt very good because he was a new talent. Humor is very sublime and not the same as most Hollywood comedic fans. That is, Nutty Professor. If you have short attention span and are accustomed to typical Hollywood things, you probably donâ€™t like it, because the pace is a little slower. I took it to Blu-ray, and I must say that the image quality is top notch. Probably one of the best-looking Blu-ray I've seen so far. The additions were great too. They deleted quite a lot, but this is probably good, since most of the deleted scenes really didn't add anything.
