I think Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best sequels, as if not the best of the three Lion King films! In the film, Timon and Pumba tell us where they come from and have difficulty in dealing with others, for example, Timon has trouble digging tunnels with other merkats! Timon and Pumba go in search of their dream place, find him and soon find him, as well as Simba, whom they pick up, but soon they have to choose between their dream place or help Simba to meet his evil uncleâ€™s scar and declare his right as King. pride of a lion. Rock! Filled with great new characters like Ma Timona (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Max, because he was very funny and was voiced by funny comedian Jerry Stiller, the father of Ben Stiller. Disney was smart to play Stiller in that role! Filled with wonderful characters, animation, history and music, Lion King 1 1/2 is, in my opinion, the best of all sequels and better than Pride Simba, although I confess I really liked it too! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great continuation of Disney that the whole family can enjoy! He has a good story and is very funny! 10 out of 10!
