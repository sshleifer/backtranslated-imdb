A woman who hates cats (Alice Krieg) and her son (Brian Krause) moved to a small town and must deal with a mean teacher (Glenn Shadix), their incestuous relationships, a sweet girl (Madhen Amick) and one hell of a big secret. <br /> <br /> Well, technically, this is a "bad movie." But who cares? It's so fun! <br /> <br /> There are some incredible things (including corn), people worry about cat cats, there are bad one-liners, too much cheese to cope with! <br /> <br /> So yes. You will like it. Lot. He will not touch, touch, frighten or in any way excite, but he will entertain you and laugh!
