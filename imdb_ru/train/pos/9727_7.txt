Simon Pegg plays a rude and often uncontrolled journalist who is brought from England to work in a major American magazine. Of course, his winning ways create all sorts of complications. A funny fact based on the comedy starring Kristen Dunst (looks pretty adult), Danny Houston and Jeff Bridges. This works primarily because we like Simon Pegg, despite his bad behavior. We fully understand why Kristen Dunst continues to talk to him, despite his frequent failures. I liked the movie. It's not all and the end of everything, but it was a good way to end the evening sitting on the couch and watching movies. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
