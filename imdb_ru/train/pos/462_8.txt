“The protection of Luzhin” is, in the foreground, a story about a unique chess scientist (Turturro) who becomes absorbed in the game, and in the background - memories of his youthful life and the forces that created the man he became. The factor of good and evil is in the forms of his love interest (Watson) and the former "mentor" (Wilson), respectively, and you have a mournful drama permeated with shrill and delicately humorous moments mixed with the rich scenic beauty of Italian Como and the intensity of the high chess game. An excellent film for those who star in historical dramas, the euphemistic metaphor of the author’s game of chess for orgasmic delight is a sign of the thin wit of the film.
