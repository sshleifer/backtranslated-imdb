A wonderful film, especially if you love horses, movies of the Second World War and the harsh Hungarian plateau. A story of courage, compassion and devotion that transcends generations. Spectacularity in horsepower is as great as that of the main characters in his own training. <br /> <br /> I'll buy this film and watch it again. This is a family movie, and I highly recommend it. Good movie "Family night." Although there are some scenes of violence, it was the Nazi occupation of Hungary. The locals were very interested in how they defended their positions even before the death of a Nazi officer who had his own personal reasons to pursue Brady. Ominously beautiful movie.
