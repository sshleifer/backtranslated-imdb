One of the best, if not the best rock and roll movie. And this is not just mindless fun. There really were a lot of smart jokes. Of course, I love the Ramones. But with all the themes of "anarchy" and "I hate high school," the film does not take itself seriously, and that's great. <br /> <br /> I first saw the film in the Spring of 1980, and I saw it recently recently. Since I went to high school in the late 1970s, this has caused me nostalgia. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film does not take itself seriously and is not pretentious, like other teen rates of the seventies, eighties and nineties. And speaking of, it is not very dirty or disgusting either. Only PG rating. This is a rarity for a movie in this category. Magnificent iconic classics and a truly incredible time capsule.
