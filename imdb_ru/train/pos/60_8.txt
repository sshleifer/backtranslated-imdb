The Home Room, as Zero Day and Elephant, was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings. But unlike the other two films, Home Room focuses on two survivors (not shooters or those killed) after the shooting. This makes it less convenient and useful, because it takes little effort to ask questions that are not answered. <br /> <br /> Don't give up on this little movie for the first 20 minutes, it should up to the real story, but plays like a rejected episode of "Blues Hill Street." He is lame, but tolerates, at least, he selects a length sufficient for the film to be classified as a feature. I recommend skipping it completely and just running ahead to the hospital scenes - there is nothing here that you cannot take from the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Like many good little movies, this was Paul F. Ryan’s creatively personal showing of being both a writer and a director. Although this arrangement does not guarantee a good movie, it is usually a good sign, because it will mean a certain unity of design and performance, which often lacks large budget dramatic functions. Since the “Home Room” script is his real strength, fortunately, the author also performed the production and assured that his vision came out on the screen. <br /> <br /> Ryan runs the risk with an ending that tests the tolerance limits of the sentimentality of the average viewer. He brings it to the very edge, but, contrary to all logic, it makes you cry and not shrink. Why is the final work some kind of combination of the spectator's need for reward at the end of this type of journey, the song (Sarah McLaughlin's “Sweet Capitulation”) in which he comes out and stunning last minute editing. <Br /> <br /> Another strong point of the film is the actors Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Eric Christensen (Dinah) starring. Although Phillips plays her standard desperate teenager, and Christensen her smart daughter from a good family, they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before. The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to Ryan. What is happening here is all about the two of them, despite the unconvincing story of a police detective who is interested in the city trying to connect Alicia with a lone gunner. If they ever cut and cut the film, this side story should be compressed. <br /> <br /> The story of two extremely scattered girls connecting and helping each other is hardly a new idea, and Ryan could easily manage this film. in cliché and predictability. But instead, in his scenario, they participate in an exciting and convincing sparring match, slowly interrupting each other and sharing moments of vulnerability, only to retreat back inside. Dinna's string “I'm dying from the inside” just rips you apart - I can't remember a single moment in any other movie that I would feel as strongly as this one. She desperately needs a connection from which Alicia resists just as desperately. Deanna only makes headway when she backs off. The viewer continues to expect a group hug, which seems to never happen. <br /> <br /> In the end, this not only causes a lot of tension, but also makes you admire both the characters and the two actresses who brought them to their senses. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
