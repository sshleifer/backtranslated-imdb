It was a great episode, one of the best in both seasons. Below is the horror for change, with a story that is much higher than the average episodes of the MoH, if there is such a thing. The manâ€™s wife nearly burned down in a tragic car accident in which he was driving. His airbag worked, but it didn't. She is burned beyond recognition (excellent makeup, by the way), and she is not given many chances to live without a complete skin graft. BUT, even in a coma, she continues to die, but returns with the help of modern technology, and when she dies within a few minutes, her ghost seems to be a very vengeful spirit. Of course, this is followed by slaughter, as well as some horrible murders, as well as some extremely sexy scenes. What else can you ask, you ask? Well, not so much, because this child has everything, and a very satirical ending, which should leave a smile on the faces of most viewers. I just really liked the direction of Rob Schmidt (Wrong turn), he has a great talent for horror. A great episode, this is the one I buy for sure.
