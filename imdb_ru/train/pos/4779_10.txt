On paper, this movie will sound incredibly boring. The idea of ​​a 75-year-old man traveling around the countryside on a mower is definitely not very attractive to him, but the real strength of the film is his charm and intelligence. Script writers will not find a better study of what makes a film work than Straight Story. <br /> <br /> A great example of this is the scene in which Alvin meets an escaped teenage girl. She is pregnant and afraid of what her parents will do if they find out. Alvin tells her a story about her children a long time ago. He made everyone take a stick and break it, which they could easily do. Then he made them tie the sticks and try to break them. "This bunch," he said, "is a family." So many other films would feel the need to continue and make sure that we knew that the person could have been broken, but together the participants were stronger. “Straight Story” understands that we are smart enough to understand this, and just leaves us to reflect on this thought and draw our own conclusions. <br /> <br /> Alvin's journey through Iowa is filled with such a refreshing non-Hollywood character. interactions. Every interaction is filled with warmth and humor, and Alvin rides so nicely on his lawn mower that we can't help but smile when he goes to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother Lyle, who suffered a stroke. And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not a destination, but a journey. This is a journey in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets - for the benefit of us too. This is a slow, simple, relaxing trip, designed to remind us of all that we have lost due to the urbanization of America. <br /> <br /> “Straight Story” is a rare live action movie in the genre of “G”. it really should not be missed. Excellent rating
