I did not expect much from this film, but I was very pleasantly surprised, as it is light, cheerful and very well watched. The central trio of killer bikers was surprisingly cute when they staggered and fooled around during their trip to Wales, where the drugs are concentrated. The humor was gentle and subtle, as, incidentally, were three characters (evidence of their sympathetic attitude towards the little elderly shopkeeper). The atmosphere of rural Wales was captured perfectly, and the soundtrack was very well chosen. Competently and carefully, with great attention to detail - I have never seen such a realistic image of an alternative culture - I felt that I was there with them. Very light to the touch and full of fun - not at all what you can expect from a movie about bikers and drugs. Admiration on all fronts, and it's hard to criticize, although I thought the last two scenes were a bit flimsy - the film should have ended when they left Wales. But in general, the unexpected treasure of the film.
