I watched this presentation on PBS in the USA when it was shown in 1988 (?). Assuming the mini-series was available on DVD, I bought the first editions of all three books last year. Since then I have been looking for TV shows on movie websites. Today I found this website. I give up the search. <br /> <br /> I would also like to buy this full - 26 episode - miniseries. After buying a DVD, I read every book and watched the episodes of this book. That is what I did with the John LeCarr “Karl” trilogy and the Landri McMurthy trilogy about the Texas Ranger. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have any suggestions for creating great books or TV shows that have become very good TV shows - or movie shows - which are now available on DVD?
