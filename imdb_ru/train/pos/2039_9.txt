First, I would like to point out that the people who criticized this film made some glaring mistakes. Anything that has a rating below 6/10 is clearly nonsense. <br /> <br /> Creep is an absolutely fantastic movie with amazing cinematic effects. The actors are very believable, the narrative provokes thought, and the horror and graphic content are extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of mystics in this movie. Many questions arise when the audience opens to a strange and strange creature that dwells in dark rat tunnels. How was Craig created and what happened to it? <br /> <br /> Fantastic film with a big cold factor. A film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be valued along with others, such as 28 Days Later, Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Death Watch. <br /> <br /> We look forward to new fiction movies !!
