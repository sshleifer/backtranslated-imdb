No other film made me feel that way before ... and I don't feel bad. For example, I do not want to get my money back or the time I was waiting to watch this movie (9 months), nor do I feel bad when I use two hours of a sunny summer day to watch this ______. The reason I say “_____” is that no matter how hard I break my brain, I just can't think of words in ANY of the seven languages ​​of this film to sum up. I have no idea what was going on all the time, and halfway through the movie I needed a break. No movie has ever done this to me before. Never in my life did I want so much cauliflower, milk and baguettes. Thank. - Ed <br /> <br /> Uh * clears throat * No words. No thoughts I do not know. I really do not know. - Cait
