Technically, I know that this is not the best TV show in history, I mean that it was captured on video, and its limitations are shown both in audio and in the visual aspect. At times, acting can also be a little awkward. But I like it. show so much. It scared the hell out of me when it first went on the air in 1988. Of course, I would be 5 years old. but I recently bought a DVD of the first 3 episodes, which, unfortunately, I heard, is now deleted. I also heard that Warner will no longer be released due to poor sales of the first DVD. In addition, the TV show did not have the same feeling as the films, in fact, I thought he had a more sinister tone. Even though the color palette looks like a nightmare on Elm Street 4 (both this film and TV shows were shot in the same year), this sounds more serious, while films are gradually becoming more and more sardonic and playful. Not bad, I like Freddie as a clown wise hacker. But I think it was the power of this show, Freddie did not appear every minute. Yutz entertains a joke before and after he kills someone. In fact, it is more like a dream, enhanced by the soft focus of the lens. I'm not sure if this was intentionally done by the creators of the show or simply with the limitations of being shot on video. I like this show, and you can't take it as a movie add-on, it can be very enjoyable. Much better than anything on TV today.
