This show is damn fun! original jokes, god and I love Eric and Kelso! Yes, I know what they say, after the 8th season it's no longer funny, because Eric and Kelso are no longer participating in the show, and Randy is a real jerk. Randy, compared to Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> You can’t take the funniest characters and change them with the look “I'm a cool guy” (Randy). In any case, it's not his fault, but the writers are trying to keep the eighth season funny, but he is still not the same as the previous seasons, but everything is in order. <br /> <br /> The 360s are awesome, the circle, Red is a real type of dad mental abuse :) and the kitten is always half the cake. Hyde tries to be cool all the time, he also has moments. The least favorite characters are Jackie and Donna. they are cool, but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> Great show. Stupid!
