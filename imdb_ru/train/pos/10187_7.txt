Well, I will be honest: it is not exactly Shoal. But you can not get Sholay every week. In fact, in this film you could see clear signatures “not without my daughter” (Sally Field, 1991). Nonetheless, like most “inspired” films, this one was inspirational, well crafted and well done. Nana Patekar, as usual, has a tendency to overdo it in his hysterics, but everyone else deserves praise. This is especially true of Dipti Naval: I saw her after a long time, but she did not lose the slightest grace. In fact, she showed herself much better than when I last saw her. Another Bollywood star that looks more beautiful with age? <br /> <br /> In general, a good watch.
