Like his previous film “In a Glass Cage”, Agusti Villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is visually even more refined than its predecessor. This is one of the most vivid and memorable pictures ever to be seen. The heightened drama, intensity and hue of violence threaten melodramatic or farce, but never enter into it. Thus, it makes an almost impossible feat: to be so excessive and, nevertheless, so painfully restrained, to be so charged and at the same time so understated, and even the finals of explosives are masterly feasts of the eye. Shameless, gorgeous and very tense ... this movie is just great!
