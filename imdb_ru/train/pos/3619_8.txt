Despite Disneyâ€™s best efforts, this is a pretty nice movie about how to pursue your dream. I was surprised that it did not seem too sentimental to me; This film played fair. Dennis Quaid was very, very good at a role that says something for a sports movie. I can't remember how many sports films had little quirks that bother me; everyone here looks from the side. This film is surprisingly good, and I predict that it will go surprisingly, since this is a film with a rating of G that does not require the viewer to stop thinking. Ebert on the contrary, this film is a success.
