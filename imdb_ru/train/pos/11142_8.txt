Just kidding <br /> <br /> In search of greener pastures in New York, John Voight is a young Optimist Cowboy (almost like Forest Gump) Joe Buck from Texas. It would not take long for the big apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions entirely, and very soon Joe will become the target of both the coldness of New Yorkers and the opponents of his street goons. Given his pure heart, he regrets one of these thugs, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), and later moves with him to his apartment wreck, and these two are literally struggling to survive. <br /> <br /> While the Midnight Comedy is labeled as drama, in my opinion, it is best described as a tragic comedy or a comedy tragedy. First of all, it is a beautiful film that stylishly captures the hippie atmosphere of the late 1960s with its compulsory dizzying cinematography at the Warhol party and combined it with ultra-urban New York. The film fills Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere in the middle, thus emphasizing his inappropriate position. We want his fight to fit in, and also just to get enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. <br /> <br /> Midnight cowboy caused tears in my eyes, as he is also rich in substance and very soulful. I believe that this film must have inspired both Forest Gamp with his frank and inappropriate lead character, and, to some extent, the films “Crocodile Dundee”, as he deals with almost the exact same kind of humor - the contrast between deft New York cosmopolitans. A very persuasive and sensationally creative film that I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
