Believe it or not, but the last case of the Inspector of the Gadget - that's what hooked me for all this. <br /> <br /> My name is Miriam, I am twelve years old, so obviously I was not there when Inspector Gadget was at the top of his career. Of course, I heard about him, but in fact I did not know him. <br /> <br /> When reading, note that I NEVER DRINKED THE ORIGINAL SERIES (I would have done so if it had appeared!). This is almost the only gadget thing I’ve ever watched (although I’m obsessed now), and I’ll focus on what I liked about it, since everyone else is so negative. For all of you pessimists, I also have some drawbacks. = P First of all, for a childish sense of humor, you might find this movie quite funny. I thought that was the case, so sue me. I also thought that the animation and character design was good, and I am also happy that there were more gadgets in it, since it is my favorite character. (I don't like Penny.) Then there was Claw (although his voice was terrible) and Madcat; I thought they were made pretty well too. The idiocy of Gadget seemed quite decent, if not a bit exaggerated (i.e., sucking his thumb on the hat. Although I would have taken a good screen shot. = P) Oh, and I liked the song that was released in the credits. Yes, I am strange. <br /> <br /> And, as in all films, there are also negatives. <br /> <br /> Talking machines? What's up with that? You can say that it was aimed at younger boys. It would not bother me so much if it were not for the fact that cars basically saved the day. I would prefer that Penny and Brain take their place. And, apparently, Gayka loved her car more than one could call natural. A bit strange, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the leader was frank for Nuts. I mean, yes, yes, he was not always the happiest of people, but he did not hate Gadget from what I read. Like the inspector, his personality was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Well, that's almost all I can say about this movie. I thought that the animation compensates for a car-oriented plot, and that it is generally pretty decent; more than movies about live action gadgets (dead, dead, dead!) at least. Maybe I’m just prejudiced, because that’s what led me to Gadget, or maybe my mind is distorted, or maybe I’m just weird, but I really liked this film, even if I'm the oldest, it is recommended behind.
