I am far from a fan of Sylvestre Stallone, and I think the only time I really appreciated his appearance was in the French film Taxi 3, whose role practically does not exist. And yet I must admit that this film was actually not so bad, although I was afraid of the worst. <br /> <br /> When Gabe (Stallone) fails to save a friend of one of his friends, and she rushes to death from the top of a mountain 4,000 feet high he cannot bring himself to continue working as a mountain ranger. For almost a year he did not put food in the supply, and then returned. Shortly after his return, they receive an emergency call from a group of tourists caught in a snowstorm. At least thatâ€™s what the Rangers think. In fact, this is a group of robbers who crashed on their plane in the mountains after their bold plan to steal suitcases full of money from a flying government plane failed. Cases are spread throughout the reserve, and they need the help of professional climbers to extract them ... <br /> <br /> This is, of course, not one of the smartest films ever, but in its genre it is a pleasant experience. one. I especially liked John Lithgow as the evil master of the mind and the leader of the gang of robbers. I know him best from the TV show "3rd Rock from the Sun", but I liked his performance in this film. In general, everything was all right with the acting, there was a lot to offer, and, of course, a few lines, but it also offered a very good decor. This film was shot in a gorgeous natural environment. I loved the snowy mountains and valleys, mountain rivers and forests ... Perhaps that is why I put this film on a higher score than the one I usually give in action films and adventure films of this kind. I give it 6.5 / 10. If you don't expect too much, this is a nice movie.
