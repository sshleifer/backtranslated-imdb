Reflecting on this film, I can think of two others that will help to look at it in perspective. One of the relatively forgotten, but covering the same geography, is the Coup de Thorson, thousands of miles away, and much larger in size, is an unforgettable Indochina. Claire Denis made a film about the great foundations of Indochina, the complex and unspoken relations between France and its colonial subjects. <br /> <br /> I was struck by the dignity of Pote, his struggle to preserve his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses. I was also amazed at the love / hate relationship between him and Amy. It is the latter that gives the film the driving force, it is he who connects this film with Indochina. <br /> <br /> No one is sure what motivates everyone, although some characters need to remember about colonialism. It is this cynical side of the story that links it to Thorshonâ€™s coup. This is a more scandalous story, perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way, but Denis gives us a memory of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships. <br /> <br /> American Black, which gives adults the French Ride at the beginning and at the end of the film, offers another interesting side of the confusion that we have in the Western world when we look at Africa. He says that when he came, he wanted to call everyone to his brother. He was returning home, but they just thought he was a little stupid. France, a character and a girl, grew up in Cameroon, but not one of them fully understands what it is, although they remember how it was. <br /> <br />
