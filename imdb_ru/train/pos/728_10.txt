The Ramones, which I consider to be the founders of modern punk rock, give their own unique sounds to the horribly perverted movie about a fan of rock music (PJ Soles), which fights with the merciless, joyless director (Mary Ravens) for the right rock. <br /> <br /> RRHS with amazing music and a soundtrack filled with incredible music. This is chock-full of violent spectacles (for example, an experiment with a mouse), a teenage spirit (probably my favorite film debut) and strange moments outside the wall (straitjacket scenes). If you're looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun at the molecular level, look no further. But if you are looking for a good, decent, dramatic epic, you may want to look a little further. <br /> <br /> "Hi everyone, I'm Riff Randall, and this is Rock and Roll School!"
