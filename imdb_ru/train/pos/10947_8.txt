Sarah Silverman’s program is very similar to Sarah’s own position. It is so excessive with prejudice that you cannot take it to heart. However, the fact is that although most people “will get it,” it does not mean that they will appreciate all of this. This is a very polarized and one-dimensional show, so if you don’t like it after 10 minutes, you can also give up. If you like it after 10 minutes, stay tuned, because each episode has so far been as good as the previous one. <br /> <br /> Like all shows, it’s not perfect. Personally, I love this program, but it has some serious flaws. Racist songs are funny, but they are aging much faster than Silverman seems to understand - the problem I’ve encountered in “Jesus is Magic.” It seems that Silverman gave herself a quota for songs for an episode that should not exist. Not to mention that, although the lyrics she writes are good, the music, well, in general, no. <br /> <br /> Another thing to keep in mind is that for some reason the fans of Monty Python, the Vertical Civilian Brigade, etc. will like this show, this is nothing but these shows. I can watch Monty Python all day, but no matter how I like this show, I can't watch more than half an hour. It becomes very fast. The replay value for this show is also low - the second time around the episode is rather funny, and the third time, in my opinion, is boring. <br /> <br /> However, the first time is very, very funny. Give him a chance.
