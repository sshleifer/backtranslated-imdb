I took it in the “Danger After Dark” box set and watched it solely because of my interest in playing Hyde and Gackt. I was expecting a banal horror film that was a huge mountain fest and with a very bad dialogue. This is exactly what it would be if it were made in America. Instead, I was intrigued by the good development of the characters and the way Sho (Gackt) developed in the film as a person. The acting skills of both stars were surprisingly good, considering that they are not professional actors, and the director did an excellent job with all this, setting it in the future, with the exception of flying cars and holographic billboards. <br /> <br /> By the way, the performance of Taro Yamamoto was very surprising. The only other film in which I saw him is The Battle for the Kingdom, where he plays Shogo Kawadu, and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of Shogo. Toshi is bright, lush and energetic, serving as a kind of comic relief with his antics. This was a big strong guy on an island who killed without thinking about it. So watch his performance, if you are familiar with the Battle Royale, you will be very surprised by it. <br /> <br /> But don’t be discounted on the back of the box because it’s not a vampire movie. This is just a vampire movie. The fact that Hyde's character is a vampire is almost a secondary fact of what really happens in the foreground, and you guys will love the last scene. This is really a moving picture in some moments, the picture is really well done. This is definitely something to pick up the next time you are in Blockbuster.
