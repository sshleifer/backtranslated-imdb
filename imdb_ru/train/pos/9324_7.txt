I have read a few reviews, and I am a little sad that most of the story seems misty. It’s easy to do because it’s not a Book, it’s a film, and you can do so many things in a film — in the USA, in Canada, or anywhere. <br /> <br /> Colm Feore does at least for recovery. “F @ g-Hag”, like me, is an excellent job not only to play gay in a “friendly neighborhood”, but also to play sick. I mean, a man really can't get much paler! However, you may never know about it from the strip near ... um, the end. <br /> <br /> If you need decrepit, there are a few SKing movies you might like. <br /> <br /> Being the daughter of a recovering alcoholic, the brother-addict {David Cubitt} was a trick for me. I'm going to pay tribute to him, he quickly grew - and believe me, this is good. And, as a novice writer, I can dig up a lot of his ideas and reviews. But I am rather a prose writer than poetic. <br /> <br /> I can easily be pleased, but I liked it. Good story, pretty well made up by Canadians, an amazing surprise. Just stuck to the “Cinema of the Week” line, having missed it because it was not so stretched, MOST appreciated. And it was pretty cleverly depicted.
