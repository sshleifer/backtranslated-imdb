Perhaps the funniest film, Behind the Scenes in Hollywood, especially when it comes to short comedy productions such as Keystone. <br /> <br /> Marion Davis should receive a medal for bravery for a role where playing poorly in front of the camera is part of the role. A lot of cameos for movie lovers.
