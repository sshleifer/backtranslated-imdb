I have to give “How to move” almost perfect rating, because the content is really great. As the previous reviewer commented, I have no idea how this movie was on the top 100 IMDB list! This is absolutely ridiculous! Other films - especially those that share a dance theme - cannot hold a candle to this in terms of combining first-class, believable acting and amazing dance procedures. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning it is very easy and surprisingly realistic to finish the main story (it’s not just about winning the competition). None of the main characters in this film is two-dimensional, and by the end of the film it is very easy to feel the emotional return from them. (And even if you don’t like to cry, you can cry a little before the captions start.) <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this film to dance lovers and, even more, for those who can appreciate the sharp and acting plot. As it is, of course, not perfect (what kind of film is it?), But it’s definitely head and shoulders above films that use pretty faces to hide an unfinished plot and / or characters that lack content. The actors and the setting in this film provide a very realistic journey, which is equally exciting due to the amazing talent of the dancers!
