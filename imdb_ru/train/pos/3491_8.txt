The cast is excellent, the acting skills are good, the plot is interesting, the development is tense, tense ... but it is difficult to squeeze all these elements into a film that lasts only 80 minutes. If more time was spent developing the plot and the plots, this would have a much better effect. Another 30 minutes of content would make this film very good, and not just good.
