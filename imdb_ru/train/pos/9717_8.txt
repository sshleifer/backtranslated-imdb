How to lose friends and alienate people is, frankly, one of the best comedies that I have seen this year with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. This is not one of those “tough-out” comedies that relies heavily on farting jokes and toilet humor, but instead moves at a friendly pace, and you will easily be tied to the unfolding narrative. Simon Pegg nails him in his coffin with his cheerful image of a fish out of water character and quickly detaches from a tripod to which he once belonged in England (the other two were Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Getting to the top of a Hollywood food chain is very difficult, as we can clearly see in the case of Pegg. His first blow to the main role was David Schwimmer's comedy “Run, fat man, run,” but she received warm reviews from critics and audiences. His second attempt is a film that received rather positive reviews from the majority, but was a failure at the box office. For example, I still have not lost faith in him, and I will still be there when he wants to make a third shot for fame. <br /> <br /> Other characters were well abandoned from Jeff Bridges to Danny Houston and Gillian Anderson. Surprisingly, Kirsten Dunst, in my opinion, showed itself well in this film as a love point of view on the character Pegg, however the spark that I saw in the interview with the vampire is still lost. She needs to find it quickly, otherwise she may suffer the consequences of what will be lost on the earth of rom-coms forever.
