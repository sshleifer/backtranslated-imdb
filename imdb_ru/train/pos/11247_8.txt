I first saw the film when it appeared on an American cable one year after its release. It blew up my little head, I was only 16 years old, and it was the first music of a new wave, which I heard, being just a stupid, classic child who grew up. The music mesmerized me, as well as the amazing looks of Hazel O'Connor and the charismatic vocal performances, and the hard but soft manager Cockney Phil Daniels just won my heart. But I think my favorite character was saxophonist Jonathan Price. He was so out of place in the group and so harmless and pitiful that he just begged for sympathy. Favorite scenes, the play, when the lights went out, and the love scene in the train. <br /> <br /> Okay, the film is not "Rose"! But it was really excellent for his limited budget and for his portrayal of Britain in the early 80s, exploding with rebellious youth looking for a way out of the unemployment benefit queue. I went to Britain only a couple of years later and found that the film very much reflects the atmosphere that I discovered when I was there. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, take a look. This is a great movie, with some great performances, and the music will amaze you. <br /> <br />
