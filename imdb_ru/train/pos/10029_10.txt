Why do people complain about this film, and not about such terrible films like The Godfather. Titanic is the greatest film of the 21st century. With great acting, directing, effects, music and everything else. This film is always shot by everyone, because one day someone said that he didnâ€™t like him anymore, so most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this film is not only the most Oscar-winning film of all time, the largest amount of money ever earned and, unfortunately, one of the most under-rated films I've ever seen. In addition, it is really the best film of all time. The only films that are close to being like all Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings trilogy or anything from the masters of Hitchcock, Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good films and directors, but none of them correspond to the masterpiece of James Cameron TITANIC.
