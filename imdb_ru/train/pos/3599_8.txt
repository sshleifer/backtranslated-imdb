This film is a real gem. The arc of the plot is determined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are responsive and clearly traced, their motives are quite plausible. The dialogue is fresh and true. The situations are unique to the characters and are not exposed or beaten at all. Until the climax, that is. Then itâ€™s as if the film has come off the rails a bit, and it has become a bit strange and incredible. But I don't want to discourage people from watching this movie. The first 3/4 of them are really wonderful. I gave him 8. There are some great performances here. Check out this movie.
