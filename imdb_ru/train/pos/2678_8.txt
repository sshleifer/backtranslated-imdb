Hey, now I can't say that I've seen all the films of Jesse (Jesus) Franco, and it seems there are a lot of them, but this is one of the best (and stranger) films I have seen. I would say that, most likely, he was in his prime in the late sixties / early seventies, and everything that recently was a little TOO KINDY for me, and I need a lot to say so. In any case, it looks like one big bad dream, where its parts seem to come true at different points. This woman is an actress or something like that, performing in some theater in Berlin, where acts of “artificial” torture are performed for a grateful audience (?!), And she seems to have trouble sleeping. The trick of what is real and what is not in this film seems to be that real things are in clear focus, and dream things are not. She seems to exist in a state of deja vu. I will not say that it makes a lot of sense, but it is rather wild, strange and interesting. Frames from Berlin make it look like a lonely and creepy place, which adds to the atmosphere. The ending is very sharp, although the film is just ending, and the tape turns black, I think there is no need to tell you that this is all over. My copy was from the Euro-Trash collection in Anchor Bay, and I say, give me more Euro-Trash, I miss this shit. But this is a good crap.
