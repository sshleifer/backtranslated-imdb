For me, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Overcoming racism, fighting for life and proving that he is not just a “cookie,” Carl Brashear is a terrific character who plays Cuba in the best light. The best performance in his life. De Niro, a living legend, gives THIS SOMETHING SOMETHING A MOVIE is always a big plus for every movie. Therefore, if you have not seen this film, I strongly recommend it to those who love courage, greatness, who are looking for inspiration. You have to watch this great drama. My vote is 9/10.
