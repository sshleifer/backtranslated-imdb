Tony Scott can make good and bad films. I personally think that he may be a little screaming and cheesy, and his work clearly suffers from the work of his rather famous brother, but this is probably his best film. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so wonderful is that Scott gives Denzel (in a burning form, better than a training day) and a revelation, like Dakota Fanning, itâ€™s time to build a relationship of true warmth and tenderness. The situation is absolutely NOT boring, although it takes time - it involves and takes us on a little journey through the characters - including an excellent role for Radha Mitchell as a mother. All this makes the action much more effective, because we are so passionate about the characters, despite all their obvious weaknesses. In this film, you are on the verge of, and in the end will not cope. <br /> <br /> Without Washington, of course, the film will be nothing. I often wonder why he seems to get so many parody roles when he is exactly as good as almost any leading person (I can only think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more screen power these days ) This film was supposed to be huge, given its status, the strength of its performance and the quality of the film. It simply says that if the studio does not return the film to the hilt, then ultimately it goes straight to the video. I would like to be able to see it on the big screen.
