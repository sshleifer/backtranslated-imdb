Man's Castle is a great example of the movie Pre-Code. It includes realistic events with really nice and imperfect characters. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, a free soul without a penny in his pocket. He makes a living doing odd jobs and traveling around a new city when he gets bored. One night, he meets Trine, a beautiful woman by any measure, who is cold and lonely. She refused to resort to prostitution, so she did not eat for several days, but they relate very well to each other and create relationships. His free spirit prompts him to leave her, so life in her is turbulent, but between them there is a real spark, even if they live in a hut by the river. <br /> <br /> Tracy is one of the great actors on the silver screen. His characters are amazing and enjoyable. We can see his thoughts on his face, making it easy to identify, even if we think that he is behaving badly. Young is great in movies with precode. Her character is very sweet, but far from perfect, which makes her even more pleasant. <br /> <br /> Elements of the pre-code include lean immersion, pre-marriage pregnancy and crime.
