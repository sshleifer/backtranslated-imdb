I rented this film because of my interest in American history, and especially the strange Mormons story. This film is trying to understand how Joseph Smith can transform his “vision” into the mainstream world religion. It first describes the problems that Mormons encountered in a settlement in Nauvoo, Illinois. This depicts the trial of Joseph Smith. During this trial, Brigham Young stands up to talk about his conversion to Mormonism and his belief in Smith’s spiritual message. Smith is then killed, and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he was chosen to lead the Mormon to a new land. Despite his serious doubts, he persistently and finally has a vision (that Utah is the place for his colony), which gives him confidence in the correctness of his leadership. Later, when crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts that he was really chosen - however, a miracle occurs that strengthens his place in history. <br /> <br /> I found the performances moving, and the story should be convincing and interesting. I would like to know if Mormons believe that this is an exact image. Polygamy is part of the story, but the reasons why this is key to SPD are not disclosed. The problem is not underlined. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that people avoid this film because of its religious themes, but it has a great cast and will interest you in everything.
