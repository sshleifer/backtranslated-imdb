I simply cannot agree with the above comment - there are many interesting and really amazing cinematic images in it, it has an unusual structure and moves well in the direction of a frightening climatic sequence, which is characterized by the effective use of silence. Moreover, he explores the strange impulse of suicide in a very frank manner, without causing any blows in what he shows, and without stopping or sensationalizing the subject. he has hints of a documentary about it, as well as a horror film and art house, and he deserves a place among the canons of "different" horror films, such as The Blair Witch Project and the original Ring (both of which he preceded and may well be unrecognized influence on). It is definitely worth seeing if you are interested in the edges of horror movies.
