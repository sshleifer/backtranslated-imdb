An unconventional historical drama, with several beautiful battle scenes. Tobey Maguire copes with his responsibilities. The script is literate and quite original, and the film is kept in favor of the characters. However, it is a bit addictive, and the last movie is too much like a TV mini-series. However, Frederick Elmes’s camera work doesn’t give rest to boring bits (and from time to time you see a frame reminding you that he worked for David Lynch). Worth seeing.
