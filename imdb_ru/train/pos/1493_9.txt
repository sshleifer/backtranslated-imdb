I thought Muhsin was beautifully written. It's not just about entertainment. There are tons of subtle messages that I think Yasmin tried to convey. And yes, it can confuse some of you (especially if you haven't watched Sepet and / or Gubra 76 times). I bet you noticed how they use characters from two films before right? It is truly ironic how the characters are related. As a powerful neighbor, this prostitute from Gubra. And the chick on the snooker court turns out to be religious and the wife of a pious man in the future. <br /> <br /> And I really love voice overs. Its raw but surprisingly fresh. For example, when they took a picture of the signboard “Rum Tumpangan Gamin”, suddenly Mukhsin’s voice came out, saying “Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim ..” (the scene when he climbed a tree). <br /> <br /> This captured the attitude of the Malaysian (and in some soft way, giggling at how sorry it is) portrayed in the character. For example, even children can be really sharp on the tongue (complete with a shrill, annoying voice) and just a bad voice in the whole movie. And how can you be so busy and talk about people when your own life is not solved. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that this film fully met my expectations, if not surpassed it. <br /> <br /> It kept me glued to the screen, I could not even take my eyes off it. Do not even make out in the cinema. Ha ha
