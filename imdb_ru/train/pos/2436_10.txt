I usually like something light and funny, so this film should not have liked me. But it captured me from the very beginning. The history of choice and family problems seems obvious, but it raises the question again and again: “What if it was my family? My choice? ”I cried and laughed when they did, because I really felt what the people involved felt. It was in places that are difficult to watch, but harder to turn away. The story is true, and life is sometimes difficult to observe! It shows what directors can do without sex, violence or special effects: a good story is a good story in itself. The best and most unpredictable stories are real. As in real life, you really do not know what will happen next, or why people do what they do!
