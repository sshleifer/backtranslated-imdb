John Carpenter's Halloween <br /> <br /> Is this the greatest horror movie of all time? no .. maybe not everyone, but for me it will always be like this. The film is simply brilliant and will always hold a special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I could not see this film until twenty years after its release, but even twenty years after so many copying cats appeared and left, the film still gave that same impact as the movie. must have done then. Before leaving for Halloween H20, my father advised me to take and rent Halloween 1 and 2 to get the full story, and after watching Halloween it became clear that he had identified and established the Slasher genre. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple: in 1963, Michael Audrey Myers coolly killed his sister Judith with a large butcher knife. Imprisoned for fifteen years, where he was treated by Dr. Sam Loomis, he escapes and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, where he begins to pursue three young girls: Laurie Strode, an innocent bookworm, Annie Brackett, sarcastic and hard talking, and Linda Van Der Shred, a lovely and sexually energetic young girl. Dr. Loomis tracks Michael here, where he enlists the support of Sheriff Lee Brackett, who is skeptical about his story about the psychotic killer. Michael ruthlessly watches the girls and begins to kill them one by one, until only sweet innocent Laurie remains, who is the main goal on Michael's list. <br /> <br /> The cast of this film was brilliant, and all the actors and actresses played at the highest level, Jamie Lee Curtis was stunning in his first role in the movie, and Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasans played an exciting role with their small role Loumis Nick Castle, who portrays Michael, did an outstanding job as a soulless and evil killer, and his movements and body movements were flawless. <br /> <br /> One of the great moments of this film is the amazing assessment made by John Carpenter himself. who created one of the most recognizable themes of horror known today. The blue lighting was creepy and effective, and one of the great moments in this film is that young Laurie is squeezing against the wall, seeing her dead friends, and Michael is materialized in the shadow behind her face before striking. Michael's mask was one of the things that caused the chills in my spine most of all. The white, impassive face worked perfectly. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so wonderful is that it is not a horrible film, unlike cheese Friday. The 13th films, in fact, there is little blood in this film, and instead it works for tension and tension. <br /> <br /> It became clear that there were films like Halloween on Friday 13 and characters like Jason Vourhies, which he just rips off Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I suggest you watch this movie at least once in your life, as it is a milestone in making films and, without a doubt, if not the biggest, then one of the greatest horror films of all times.
