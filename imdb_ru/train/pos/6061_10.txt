I liked this film so much that I watched it twice, and this is something that can be said about a documentary film. The musical accompaniment, cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning, as you would expect from an Imax production. Although it was shot for those huge Imax theaters, it looks and sounds great in my home system. In fact, it would be the perfect DVD to showcase your system. <br /> <br /> This topic is also very interesting. We are talking about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Mario because he is the best race car in history, as he is the only one who won the CART Championship, F1 Championship, Daytona 500 and Indianapolis 500. The scenario follows the path of two cars, very important for father and son. The first car is found in the hen house and turns out to be the first roadster Mario ever ridden, and we follow the restoration to brilliant perfection. The other car is Michael's new race car, and we follow him from cutting through the uniform to the end of the racing season. "Imax" provides exactly the magic that makes automotive construction interesting and exciting. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who was the owner of the team of Michael Amoretti at the time of the creation of this film, talks about the film. His jokes and wits, based on many years of experience as an owner and driver, attach great importance to staging. <br /> <br /> The main feature is the race scene. Turn up the volume here! There is something about traveling at a speed of more than 200 miles per hour and a musical score that completely draws you to the screen for unforgettable impressions. Wow <br /> <br /> The last magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This god of the world of races, Mario Andretti, is a loving father who proudly watches his son's career. They work so well together that every father and son should see this. You can tell they are a close family. I wish we all had this experience.
