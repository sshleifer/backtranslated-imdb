I checked it out as an impulse when watching a movie store and could not be more pleasantly surprised! My mother and I watched this movie together, and we really enjoyed it. This is not the typical "chick" with a sad love story and tears all over, but it definitely affects the nerve in the turn at the end. This is the end where, although unexpected and tragic, the overall effect of the film will not suffer from this. I think Reese Witherspoon was a great actress even in this film, her debut, and it is definitely worth seeing! I did not recognize many supporting actors, but they all play their important roles well. "Man on the Moon" is such a plausible story about how a young teenager first fell in love. Most women can definitely relate to everything - from Witherspoon's words, her delicate looks and not so subtle emotions (raging like a typical teenage girl). Although she plays a character confused by love, she does not look stupid and immature, which is highly regarded, given many modern films.
