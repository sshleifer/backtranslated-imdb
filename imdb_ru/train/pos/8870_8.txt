When John Singleton is on, it is * on * !! And this is one of his best films. Not as tight as Boyz n Hood, but close to it (and with most of the same stellar composition). This film was very well written, very well built and very well shot. It is not enough to criticize, and most of my complaints are superficial (for example: where did Fudge get money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive things? No mention of a rich history ... And why isn't Professor Fibbs? Have a professor? to have one ... And while we are on it, for a student engineer, moron or not, Remy is a rather stupid character - I think he will have a little more in terms of basic intelligence - he speaks and acts as a total jester). <br /> <br /> But besides this, the film was very sharp. A good array of characters and points of view; and Singleton does not take sides in the story - many characters are not sympathetic, and he well combines the scenes of "Panther" and "Suprematism" to show stupidity on both sides. <br /> <br /> Much of the cinematography was excellent; I especially liked the scene where Kirstie Swenson gets close with Taryn and Wayne, each scene really well fused together. In addition, the scenes of Malik / Deja were really well filmed. <br /> <br /> From time to time the dialogue was a bit; this film tended to become * really * preaching from time to time, and it also tends to beat the moments it made over your head, when the points would be just as clear without candor (we really didn’t need the US flag) labeled "UNLEARN", believe me, we are not morons ...). And to top it off, although * in most cases, Singleton uses melodrama quite well, sometimes it gets too crazy (for example, Deja's death, which is good until she screams out "WHY !!!", which simply destroys the whole Effect and scene). <br /> <br /> But in general, the game was on top. Fabulous performances by Omar Epps (perhaps the best I've ever seen), Kirstie Swanson (who knew that Buffy could play ??), Michael Rapaport (damn surprised me ... after “Real Romantic and Beautiful Girls”, though he was an actor with one role) and, of course, Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburn * are always * outstanding. <br /> <br /> disadvantage? Jennifer Connelly was flat; although this is not entirely her fault: her role was stereotypical and one-dimensional. Generic in the highest degree. And Tyra Banks, who had the role, was just awful. She whined and whined and whined. Another one in a long series of models that have become actresses who failed miserably (although there are some that prove the exception to this rule). <br /> <br /> Finally, the soundtrack! Blimey! An amazing soundtrack (which is definitely worth buying!), Which fits the film like a glove. There is a twin song in each scene (though the Tori Amos songs started * really * annoying me by the end ... not her best work). Liz Fair, Rage against the car, Ice Cube ... how can you go wrong? <br /> <br /> In general: a really good watch, a really strong cast, a great script, a great movie. 8/10.
