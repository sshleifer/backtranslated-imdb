It is predicted that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS. The estimated losses are greatest in sub-Saharan Africa, where 55 million additional deaths can be expected. In addition to the gloomy statistics, there are personal stories about which we rarely hear. Christophe Honore describes one of the most touching films Close to Leo, made for French television, as part of a series on youth issues. Although fictional, she is dealing with a situation that, unfortunately, is too common - the impact of a HIV diagnosis on a loving friendly family. <br /> <br /> When a twenty-year-old Leo (Pierre Minyar) tells his parents and two teenage brothers, Tristan (Rodolphe Pauly) and Pierrot (Jeremy Lippmann), that he has AIDS, the family is devastated. Because of his concern for his youth, they decided to hide information from their younger brother, 12-year-old Marcel (Yannis Lespert), but he overhears the conversation and begins to sulk and act erratically. When Leo goes to Paris for treatment, he takes Marcel with him, but the young boy confronts Leo and demands to know the truth. Leo tells him that he is sick, and Marcel is sad, but accepts. However, when he leads Marcel to meet some former gay friends, the tension between them boils on the surface, creating the ground for a fascinating conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although I was embarrassed because of the scenes in bed related to the physical contact between the brothers, I feel that the sincerity of “Close to Leo” and the brilliant speeches of Lespert and Minyar more than tipped the balance in her favor . Observation of the events unfolding from the point of view of a young boy, gives the film authenticity, which reminded me of the movie Québequa “Leolo” and “The Tube” Truffaut. Unlike some American films that dance around the throes of AIDS, "Close to Leo" speaks the harsh truth, but does it in such a way that it is gentle and surprisingly real.
