I don't think I need to tell you a story. For this has been said for many years. So I just share my feelings. I first saw Cinderella when I was five years old. Since then, I've been a good Disney kid. The animation now seems childish and old-fashioned, but now it is part of its charm. Now, in the era of musical and computer high school images, it seems that people have forgotten the genius and magical essence of early Disney films. Fortunately, I was born before that, so I met this classic. And it seems that no matter how old I am, Iâ€™m turning into that five year old who is watching him on VHS. What is the real magic of Disney.
