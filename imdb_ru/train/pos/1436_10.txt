Having worked in the center of Manhattan and often having lunch on summer days in a park near the city hall, I saw the mayor come and go. It was great to be able to step outside the city hall and see how it looks in the hall and throughout the building. Al Pacino, (Mayor John Pappas), "Gigli", 03, showed a prominent role in the whole picture, especially when he spoke in the African American church for the little boy who was killed. John Cusack (Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Runaway Juror", "03", was a faithful servant of the mayor and worshiped him in everything he tried to accomplish. Bridget Fonda (Marybeth Kogan) begins to fall in love with Kevin Calhoun and plays an excellent secondary role. Finally, but not least, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key", '01, played the Mafia boss, who had some very difficult choices at the end of the picture! Great movie with great acting and fantastic photography in New York!
