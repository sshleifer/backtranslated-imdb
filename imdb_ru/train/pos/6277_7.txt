Good action and interesting plot. After seeing the original, I must say that it was an interesting improvement and showed more of the film. A good cast ... a significant cast ... although it would be nice to see some expansion in the battle scenes, not in the background. A funny movie to watch and keep you informed all the time 7/10 is the right voice, I think!
