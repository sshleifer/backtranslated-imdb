The hood of the living dead had a lot to do, even before the captions began. First, any play "... of the living dead" calls His Holiness Mr. Romero and instantly sets a high standard to which many films cannot afford to strive. And secondly, my interlocutor for the movie said that he doubted that any city horror film would surpass the original Leprechaun in the hood. Skeptical we settled down to watch. <br /> <br /> We were rewarded with an amazingly sincere and kind film about zombies. Oh, of course, the budget is small, and, of course, friends, film directors, friends populate the cast, but the Hood of the Heroes of the Living Dead loves zombie movies. Cheap? Yeah. But when it is so cheap, you can clearly see where LOVE holds it together. <br /> <br /> Ricky works in the laboratory during the day and at night as a surrogate parent for his younger brother. He wants to move from Auckland. However, before this planned escape, his brother was shot in the car. Ricky's keen scientific mind offers an option superior to CPR or 911: injection of the experimental regenerative formula of his laboratory. Unfortunately, the little brother wakes up in an ambulance like a bloodthirsty zombie Auckland! Chaos and chaos! I think that it is more economical to eat my enemies than to take revenge at the wheel, but then again, I am not well versed in the complexities of city life. (How poor is the judge? In response to the bloody scene in which four men participated, I expressed the opinion: "A-ha! White T-shirts for everyone to show blood. Economical! I used the same technique in my low-budget horror film." Jordan replied: “No, this is a gangster dress. As a result, white T-shirts were banned in New Orleans’s bars for some time.” Oh.) <br /> <br /> Most of the movie takes place in someone’s living room, so there hangs out a lot and waits for zombies, but the characters are sympathetic, and the film is sincere - it exceeds its budget by ear. <br /> <br /> Explanation of a zombie: when a person plays God, there are zombies! Or maybe: follow the FDA approved test rules before experimenting on people! <br /> <br /> Contribute to zombie canon: This is the first zombie film that I saw with shooting from a car. As for these zombies, the infection, as usual, spreads with a bite, but rather unusually headshots do not work - these are heartbeats that kill. Zombies have impulses, the absence of which proves true death. And these zombies make pretty jaguar sounds. <br /> <br /> Free humorous story about a zombie: a mercenary named Romero. Moan. <br /> <br /> Favorite zombie: Jaguar-noisy younger brother-zombie, of course!
