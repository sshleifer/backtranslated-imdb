Not for people without a quick mind or a drop of Balkan blood in their veins. If you have none of this, you cannot understand it. And if you do not understand, you cannot enjoy it. :) For example, if you think that Picasso is the name of a car made by Citroen, maybe if you see a picture of Picasso, you just pass by it, having decided that it is rubbish by a street artist. :) So donâ€™t judge before trying to figure it out :) In the end, I think it MANDATORY for everyone with an open mind. However, my N1 remains The Shawshank Redemption! And remember, not all things can be framed. Because in this world there are things that will not suit anyone.
