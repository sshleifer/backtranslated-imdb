What a relief to learn, I do not imagine this program! summary from the taxman is excellent. I also remember that it haunted me, and not especially family viewing, I was supposed to be 10/11 at the time when I watched it. I think that for a girl at this age, the attraction was very blond hair of a pig and his constantly sad state. I remember this flute topic, although I don’t remember how it went. I think the introduction showed that he plays it - or maybe he played the flute in the program, especially when he was sad? Maybe I was destined to never know how it ended, or watch a video or hear a melody, but at least I now know that it’s not just me.
