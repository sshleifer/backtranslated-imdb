This may be the second best PPV WWE of the year after Wrestlemania, it was a good surprise! John Cena had a great match in which he upset Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy retained his IC title in a short sloppy match with the Willam Regal. Bubba and Spike Dudley won a pretty brutal fight for Benoit and Guerrero. Jamie Noble had a really good match with Kidman, which surprised me. Booker T won the Big Show in a match without rules, at some point Booker T kicked the Big Show and sent it right across the table. In WWE's stupid decision by Christian and Lance Storm, jealous anti-Americans defeated Hogan and Edge with much help from Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock had a match of the night, he was full of great star places, and RVD managed to keep his ic title through DQ, so I was glad that he kept the title. Triple H also signed a contract with Eric Bischoff and Roe, which means almost nothing. And in the main event, “Rock” became the first 7-time WWE world champion in history, defeating both Kurt Angle and the Undertaker in a triple threat game. Overall, this is probably the 2nd best PPV WWE 2002! 7/10
