This is a strange little film, and I have to agree that there is also a bizarre role in it. <br /> <br /> He follows the adventures of a young man who decides to become famous Las Vegas. The illusionist, and partly about following his dream, partly about the dreams of others and the suffering of show business. I thought the movie was charming, and it has a moment or two of real magic that makes it all worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is terrific as a wizard who has never been, and his mentoring Max makes for a funny and touching relationship. <br /> <br /> Probably not for everyone, but if you like movies about traveling, then I think you will like this one.
