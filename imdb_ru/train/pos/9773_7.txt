The plot is really terrible, the atmosphere is really depressive, unusual for such a low-budget production and, at least, for German production. A bit of Indian spirituality, a mystical thriller and a slasher, mixed together. The plot and characters are gorgeous, the scenery is very close to reality, without any studio atmosphere. It might be great, but unfortunately some things were a little disappointing, which shouldn’t have to be typical of low-budget films: <br /> <br /> 1.) The cast doesn’t sometimes exceed the average, Almost every actor is like layman. Some of them do a good or very good job, but some behave like actors of lousy German court shows! But I was very, very disappointed with the acting skills of Mathieu Carriera! His acting (in many old movies his acting was fine) was below average! But this may be the reason that today he takes part in lousy German TV shows or television series on private channels. <br /> <br /> 2.) Dialogues sometimes happen at the level of a soap opera. <br /> <br /> 3.) Because of the poor sound, it was sometimes very difficult to understand what the characters are saying. I saw it on DVD and was glad that I could rewind and listen again. This is caused by the setting (large halls like in a hospital or with an esoteric group) and sometimes strange dialects of actors! <br /> <br /> But overall, this is an interesting film; it’s worth seeing it far beyond commercial films, which are often more terrible.
