It is very rare to find an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eyed is a rare gemstone. The director-writer not only coped with the task of managing his own work, but also played the merry role of an evil roommate. The script in an interesting way considers not only the plight of the struggling writer, but also mixes so much comedy with the desert world of the writer that you cannot but surrender to Ernie as a character. Very funny stuff. Despite the tiny budget, Adam Jones manages to seriously look at the film. He does not mess around when it comes to making a good movie. I can't wait to see what he comes up with next. This guy can make people laugh and think; this is special.
