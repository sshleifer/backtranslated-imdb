Valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films. The death scenes are carefully thought out, and most of the acting is good. Marley Shelton played a major role well (much better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in "I Know ...".) David Boreanaz, who is the main reason I watched this film, had a rather small role, but he played it well. An exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. She was terrible at it. The only scene in which I was glad to see her was * SPOILER * her death scene. In general, this is a good movie to watch. You should definitely watch this before you watch Creek or I Know ... again.
