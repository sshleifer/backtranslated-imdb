Perhaps this is me and my perverted ways, or the fact that I have, as a rule, a very sick mind, but I made this film at random on one very strange evening, and, to my great surprise, I liked it. <br /> <br /> Yes, I read the synopsis on the back of the DVD box and read that it was banned for 25 years, and I decided that I was ready for anything he suggested. I was clearly deceived by seeing ... well ... everything, for short. I understand why he was banned not only for such explicit sex scenes, but also for bestiality. <br /> <br /> Of course, since he is loosely based on the classic fairy tale about beauty and the beast, my personal favorite, he tells the story of a girlâ€™s sexual awakening in a dream about the duchess pursued. whatever hell animal with a huge erection and significant ejaculation. Of course, the beast gets what it wants, and the duchess decides that she likes it, and they continue to frolic in the forest. <br /> <br /> But that's not all. Oh, that's not all! <br /> <br /> Not only do we see interdisciplinary sex, we also meet hunchbacked horses, a nanny who quarrels with a dirty slave when she does not press against the bed to get her ... uh ... Satisfaction and dreamy girl masturbating with rose petals. <br /> <br /> Creative and pleasant, but it took my father some time to talk to me again after he looked at him after I went to bed ... I was 15 years old. Words of advice when watching this movie: make sure that you are the only one who knows that you have it, and watch it with the curtains closed. It may be interesting, but I doubt that there are other porn movies like this one.
