Rock and Roll High School is likely to go down in history as the ultimate rebel film. Depicting a group of high school students using Ramones music as an inspiration to rebel against their despotic director (Mary Ravens, from "Eating Raoul" fame), the entire film is a mile per minute. This is a reason to have fun, and I'm sure you will. Bullying freshmen? Check it out. Nutty music teacher (Paul Barthel, also from "Eating Raoul" *)? Check it out. Exploding mice? Mat. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is the type of thing that makes life worth living. Even for people like me who don't know the Ramones music, this is pure pleasure. With executive producer Roger Corman and co-director Joe Dante, how can we expect anything less? It is unfortunate that director Allan Arkush later degenerated into tariffs such as Caddyshack II. <br /> <br /> Also starring PJ Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Day Young, Dick Miller (who appeared in each of the films of Joe Dante, and many of the films of Roger Korman, Don Steele and of course , â€œRamonse". A real pleasure. <br /> <br /> * It seems Bartel and the Ravens were always filmed together. They also played a major role in Hollywood Boulevard by Joe Dante and The Chopper (also with Dick Miller), in which they performed their roles from Raul's Food.
