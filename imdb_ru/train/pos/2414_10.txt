Monarch Cove was one of the best Friday night dramas featured in a long time. I ask the writer, please write a long series and transmit it live, SOON. Each person was very interesting and did a wonderful job with his stories. The plot will come true. However, the film must be continued for a long time. I would like to see the growing up of the child Bianchi and Jake and get the lead role in the film along with the new grandparents who are planning its educational future. Also, bring Katie back to your niece and help her develop a life. It was great to see how grandparents solve their problems, but the family business had to be brought back to working condition, and let's see how Jake and Bianca survive in marriage. of the year.
