Stylishly directed, picturesquely photographed and brilliantly acted ?? Crosby's interpretation seems to be perfectly correct, does Hardwick play its best role, and does Bendix also enjoy it? The call of this Yankee is universal and irresistible. <br /> <br /> Of course, songs are one of the main joys of the film. As expected, Bing is in a good voice. And although Hardwick's solo was cut, we can still hear him singing heartily when he dances with Crosby and Bendix in their famous issue of the Busy Doing Nothing. It is also nice to hear that Rhonda Fleming, who, as a singer, enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career, rarely got the opportunity to be heard in the movies. She has a beautiful voice that more than fits her gorgeous looks ?? and she really looks very attractive in her costumes Mary Kay Dodson. <br /> <br /> Directed by Tay Garnett gets the most out of his generous budget, using all the resources at his disposal to present every fairy scene as efficiently as possible. (Perhaps the eclipse looks too far-fetched, but who complained?) <br /> <br /> In short, as the trailer actually describes, entertaining delight from beginning to end.
