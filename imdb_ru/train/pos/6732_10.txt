It was the best documentary I've ever seen !! I just saw Lords of Dogtown and wanted to learn more about Stacy Peralta, and I was surprised and happy to know that this was one of his films. Great job, Stacy! I returned to work last week, I was bored, and this film appeared. Growing up in Orange County in the 80s, I was surfing on local beaches, like my father when he was a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me every weekend, I surfed, boarded, and then moved from there. This film just won me over. It was much earlier than my time, but it was amazing to see what these guys went through .. TRUE! This film is collectible.
