In fact, my voice is 7.5. In any case, the film was good, there are those funny parts in it that make it look, don't get me wrong, this is not the funniest film in the world, and it is not even original, because this is an idea that we saw before in movies, but this one has its own taste, my friend told me that this is a film for guys ... I think that not really, but who cares? There is also another film that shows us almost the same topic, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is: “On the Ground,” men, this film is very funny, watch both if you want, and I know you will agree that Mr. Rock won with his film. I would have liked that the main character of the male character was given to Ashton Kutcher, but the film is good.
