In this film, Jay Leno is shot as a policeman from Detroit, Tony Kostas and Pat Morita as a policeman from Tokyo sent to Detroit to get a stolen prototype car engine. The Japanese came to Detroit in the hope of selling it to a future car company, led by a man named Derrick Jarrid. Unfortunately for him, the people who were supposed to negotiate a deal killed him and took a prototype. The enraged Derek Jarrid tries to distance himself from Philip Madras, who led the people. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has nothing of that and he threatens Jarrid, forcing him to continue to cooperate. Meanwhile, in the same dump where the Japanese man was killed, these same people also killed Tony Costas's friend. Tony's friend watched the dump. <br /> <br /> Tony goes in search of the killer against the orders of his boss. Tony is on the robbery, while the murder should investigate this matter. While Tony investigates a crime, he encounters a Japanese policeman and mistakenly arrests him. In the end they work together on the case. They make up a strange couple, and there are some really funny parts, as well as some funny scenes, such as Pat Morita, jumping and kicking right through the windshield of a moving car, and kicking Madras in the head. But in the end, this is a nice movie about friends, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not an actor, but he is good at this role, and Pat Morita is also good. Nevertheless, they make one of the most unexpected duos of policemen in an action movie. If you liked movies with fellow buddies, cheese films from the 80s or you want to see Jay Leno as an actor, then I recommend this movie.
