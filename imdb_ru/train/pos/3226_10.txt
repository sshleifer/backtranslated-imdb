I don't remember this movie being filmed here. I only saw it when it came on the cable. The film is dedicated to the dehumanization of children in killing machines. In particular, one person, the way he is replaced and thrown (literally) into a foreign community, where he is unable to cope with who he really is and what he feels. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that many people expected it to be Rambo in space, and would be happy if it were. <br /> <br /> Of course, I am glad that this is not so - Kurt copes with the image of an emotional cripple. The scene, where he sits outside the complex, shows this, although the decision of two repetitions in slow motion detracts from the moment. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic SF movie in the sense that Bladerunner, Alien, Silent works. , Logan's Run or THX1138 were, but this, unfortunately, is the closest thing I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> He changes in the film to a believable degree, he doesn’t break Arnie one liner. He didn’t become Snake Plissken, and he doesn’t have a happy ending. <br /> <br /> That's why this film did not succeed. This did not follow the formula, and among the 18-25-year-old target American audience this is unforgivable, since this was not what they expected to see. <br /> <br /> Fear and discipline. <br /> <Always.
