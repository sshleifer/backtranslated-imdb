This film now appears on digital television at least once a month, I watched it a dozen or more times, and it never ceases to make me happy. If it were tomorrow, I would look it again. Such is the mastery that can be created by Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, two great magicians of the acting profession, who were greatly helped by the excellent supporting trio of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. Do not forget the others in minor roles. <br /> <br /> This is a simple, simply told story about a former fraudster, an attractive embezzlement, fighting and succeeding with the then “new age technology”, that is, computers, and searching for affection in the process. Even if it is a little (tongue in cheek) implausible, even incredible, the characters are not. There is no violence, no sex, no bad language, and, most importantly, no terrible method that is so common today. A real lesson for modern filmmakers on how to make a great show from virtually nothing but outstanding talent.
