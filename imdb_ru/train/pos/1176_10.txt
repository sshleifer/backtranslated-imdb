First, let me say that I didnâ€™t like the fact that The Rock won such a funny title. Then I feel that Regal should have regained his European title, Jeff Hardy is a crappy champion. Rob Van Dam held the Intercontinental title for too long, and Brock had to win it. I am pleased that Storm and Christian became the champion in tags, in my opinion, the best was the Booker T and Big Show match.
