Red Rock West is a great example of how good a movie can be with almost no budget. All you need is a smart script, good actors and a lot of atmosphere. RRW delivers all that and more. <br /> <br /> Nick Cage plays a former marine who was injured in Lebanon, who received his last $ 5 after he was denied work at the mine because of his bad knee. He plays a role in Red Rock and is mistaken for bartender Wayne (J. T. Walsh, not quite as his most formidable, but still evil) for an assassin from Texas. <br /> <br /> He pays him to kill his wife and make him look like burglary. Only when he gets there, just to check it out. She invites him to kill Wayne twice. Cage just wants to take the city to hell with his free money and leave sparring lovers. But a series of failures and failures leads to the fact that he goes to Red Rock and back, back and forth. Ultimately, this leads to a clash with Lyle from Dallas (the cheeky and sympathetic Dennis Hopper), a REAL killer from Texas, who offers help without knowing that he makes the plot more complicated. <br /> <br /> RRW has never had a big release, so most of its audience discovered this on video or cable television shows. This view may seem like a television movie, but it is more. A smooth, slow direction, a capricious score and a howling desert wind - all this would make for a great movie in theaters, but the best thing you can do these days is to watch a DVD on a large HDTV. <br /> <br /> The only weak point of the film that I can recall is the boring, fatal femme fatale of Lara Flynn Boyle with a disgusting hairstyle. Of course, I wouldnâ€™t have fallen in love with her, but if you assume that Nick Cage's character belongs to lesbian militants, then you will accept it anyway.
