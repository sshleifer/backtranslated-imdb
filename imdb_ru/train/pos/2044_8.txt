This is a good little shocker; not ideal for any imagination, but tense, competent and worried. A great example of a simple idea turned into a compelling 90-minute scenario. <br /> <br /> No bloat, long exposure or verbose stories are required for installation; Kate (Franka Pontente), a young German business woman who lives in London, is drifting, waiting for the last subway train. She wakes up to find a deserted place, but quickly comes to the realization that she is far from alone. Someone or something is next to her, and her intentions are completely malicious. <br /> <br /> In fact, she encounters several other characters in their desire to survive, including a depraved work colleague, a homeless couple, and in a cage. sewer worker, all of which add pace and content to the plot. Somewhere in the middle of the movie, there is a slightly awkward gear change when the tension thriller turns into a bloody feast, but nothing more awkward to slow down a hectic pace. For those of you with a weak temper, this is likely to be a painful trip; those of you who love a little well-executed carnal lawlessness should push all the right buttons. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is perhaps less successful than the main part of the film, but it is accented with a pleasant moment of unexpected social commentary, which gives a satisfactory conclusion. <br /> <br /> Some may feel deceived by a clear explanation of the exact nature and history of the threat that Kate and her supporters faced, but for me this was not the case. The screenwriter of the horror film should not feel obliged to dot the each me and cross every t, just like from the author of political thrillers. Here are enough clues to give you a very clear idea of ​​what caused this evil, making a detailed and final decision superfluous. Preserving a certain sense of secrecy should be welcomed and reminds us that in this film the trip will always be more important than the exact destination. <br /> <br /> As far as I understand, the budget of this film was at least minimal, and in this case our applause for this British horror should be getting louder, because in no case does the impression that the corners are cut or effects do not give. <br /> <br /> If this sounds like your movie, then it probably is. Buy a ticket and get on board.
