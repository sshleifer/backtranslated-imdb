Sad to see where Jackie Chan turned out to be. Previously, he was an insurmountable hurricane of blows, kicks and incredible stunts. Honestly, he is now over fifty, and we can expect some slowdown. But with "Rush Hour 3", where he recedes into the background to Chris Tucker (of all people!), And then there is "Kung Fu Panda", where he not only plays a purely vocal role, but his character almost has no dialogue . ... to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a tremendous understatement. <br /> <br /> There are times when the only solution is to snatch out an old dusty VHS tape and watch Jackie kick ass in a younger one. , fitter, days without Chris Tucker. <br /> <br /> Enter the Police Story. Jackie Chan plays Kar Kui, a police officer whose task is to protect a witness before a high court. He is confronted with the resistance of both the inoperative witness and numerous assassins sent by the mob to silence them. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, who cares? We do not watch Jackie Chan movies for this story. We watch them in order to see Jackie Chan perform stunning tricks and, as a rule, strikes and kicks a lot of people who are less amazing than him. <br /> <br /> And at this level, the Police Story does not do that. disappoint at all. At the end of the mall, an amazing fight takes place, ending with Jackie coming down the giant high-voltage chandelier. Seriously, if such things happened more often, no man would need to persuade them to go shopping for clothes. <br /> <br /> There is also comedy, much of which involves Kar-kui in an unintended upset in May (Maggie Cheung). His ever-suffering and forgiving girlfriend. Humor is generally rather inconclusive, but it works, so I'm not complaining. <br /> <br /> The action is not too subtle. In fact, I’m not sure that there was anything subtle about Police Story. Director Jackie Chan (yes, he also does this) clearly understands why we are watching his films, and knows that while we are waiting for the start of the next fight, the last thing we want is to look for nuance and depth and inner meaning. <br /> <br /> So, “Police Story” is an explosion. As with most of his films, the fact that Jackie actually does what you see on the screen is a cut above the competition. I mean, when Jackie Chan is really hanging out of a high-speed bus behind an umbrella, a completely new “Wow!” Factor is added to the action.
