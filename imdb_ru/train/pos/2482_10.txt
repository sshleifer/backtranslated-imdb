The actors play wonderfully, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. Itâ€™s good that Robin Williams got Osiric's comic role, otherwise it would be a bit strange to see him in such a performance. It's really great that Kenneth decided to use the most complete version of the text, this happens definitely not too often ... Thanks to this, viewers can see the whole, and not the parts chosen by the director. Also - thank God that the film is in a classic form; NO to surreal fanfare! Although "Tytus Andronicus" was still impressive, but still Hamlet is a separate story, at least this is my point of view.
