One of my favorite movies saw him for the first time when I was about 10 years old, which probably says a lot about the type of humor. Although from humor there is definitely a charm about it. Expect to see the usual Askey & Murdoch banter, so popular at one time, with lots of interesting, bizarre co-characters. A lady with a parrot, a couple should get married and got into trouble from "her", and my favorite, the station manager: "Nobody knows where it comes from ... nobody knows where it goes ..." Interestingly, the ghost train was written by Arnold Ridley of the military glory of the popes (private physician Godfrey). Watch it on a rainy Sunday afternoon after dinner and smile.
