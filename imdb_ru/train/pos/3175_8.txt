It's great how this movie pulls you forward. I had an honest laugh. I don't care that this is a low budget because this thing works for me. Honestly, my wife actually didnâ€™t do this equally, but she prefers a different type of film. However, she admitted that it was very creative and well-built, and probably all on a string. These characters, whose lives are strange and hectic, give me something that can be connected in my own world. Just keep going and be who you are. Dreams are what you make of them. After seeing this film for the second and third time, I realized that there are some hidden moments that have passed by me for the first time. What can I say, I like my fun with some complexity. I liked it anyway. Hope to see more.
