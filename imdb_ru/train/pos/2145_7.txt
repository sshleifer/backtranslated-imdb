“Will we dance?”, A frivolous film from Japan, talks about an overworked accountant and family man who is attracted to the dance studio by a beautiful woman who he sees from the train during daily trips. What he finds in the studio is dance lessons and, above all, himself. Funny, sharp and completely charming “SWD” is an award-winning film, worthy of the attention of more mature viewers. (AT)
