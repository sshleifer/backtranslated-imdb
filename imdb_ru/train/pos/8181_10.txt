Dr. Finestone is a dentist. He has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a pool. Suddenly, he discovers that his wife is engaged with a pool worker - he understands that there is a decomposition behind everything that is clean. He begins to torture his patients. ... Corbin Bernsen is great as a deranged dentist - he is absolutely believable. Much surprisingly little blood, but the scenes of dental torture are quite nasty and grotesque. Highly recommended. "Dentist 2" is also worth checking out!
