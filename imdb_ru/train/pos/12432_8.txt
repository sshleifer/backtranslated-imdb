I expected it to be the same type of choke as in the previous film “Modesty Blaise”, so I left it unattended for so long, but I was very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Far from the continuity of stupid gunfights and chasing cars and boats, it was almost a thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl becomes as tough as nails, and yet nothing can be overestimated or overly rationalized. <br /> <br /> The budget was probably really helped by the limitations: less time and effort was spent on finding more and more stupid ways for stuntmen to pretend to die, and more was on making a film worth watching. Hell, the biggest shootout is off-screen - and the scene where they hear about it is all the better for this background noise, which adds to the uncertainty - who will win? Who is dying? <br /> <br /> Alexandra Staden may not be as stunning as Monika Vitti, but few of them, and she certainly has all the ounces of class and fire that the character needs to work - and the shape of her face, her hair and her tall slim body could be raised straight from the comics. <br /> <br /> Nikolai Coaster-Waldau was the perfect choice for the bad guy Blaise, in which he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch - even enjoyable (and I doubt that I will treat many cruel, psychopathic killers as fellow travelers ). I can’t remember any of Hollywood’s “ex-waiters” who could handle this role well. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the Blaze villains always die, in the end (there are no spoilers!) really good thing, because all the girls who would have spent their time fainting from such a disgustingly beautiful and interesting piece , can now pragmatically agree on us, ordinary Joe.
