Robert Jannuki, Luca Venantini, Venantino Venantini, Alicia Moreau (two stars from CITY LIVING DEAD (I wonder what Luka is doing these days, probably a lawyer or something like that, like Bela Lugosi Jr. or David Hennessy, child from dark shadows) who wants to forget that dark shadows existed). Anyway, in the Thorn EMI video, there is no music for the opening credits ... but the music is great when it appears ... with Italian films, films are not as good as music ... my favorite scene with a boy with a robotic arm who watches for a lone stranger across the desert. The stranger says why you follow me. Tommy answers, because I want so much ... The stranger answers, which way you head Tommy speaks West, then the Alien says, well, I go to the east. So after a while walking, the theme playing in the background, the Alien raises its head and sees Tommy sitting on a stone stroking his beloved hamster ... Tommy looks up and tells the Alien What took you so long ... I like this movie .. He touches my heart. A boy with a robotic arm needs a dad, and the Alien is called to be Tommy's dad in the desert. oh yeah, they also need water. , not a ROAD WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2), but some stupid western / post-nuclear film with a boy with a robotic arm and Alien and Garbage and a few other good guys with a vile chick with an iron claw and Crazy Bull, who looks like a warrior on a road warrior. , Sunday afternoon at 57 channel (Philadelphia, PA) after the church I came home and found it. , , often . , , too often. Love it. 10/10
