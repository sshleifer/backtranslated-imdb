FATTY DRIVES THE BUS is just the funniest, most original and interesting work I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. <br /> <br /> This film does not by any means conform to Hollywood standards or even straightforward - a comedy film about a film in which Terry Hulk Hogan was shot, in terms of camera work, editing, acting, budget or something. still. <br /> <br /> Although it is a film, it’s a very original and enjoyable story, and it’s obviously made by people who like to shoot it, and the enthusiasm of all the actors and the crew really overcomes its entire budget and acting failures. <br /> <br /> This film proves that you don’t. To create a great movie you need a huge budget or decent actors, all you need is original ideas and a passion for what you do. <br /> <br /> Just the best movie ever. I don't care how you get it, rent it, order it, steal it, download it, just watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I just hope they make a DVD version.
