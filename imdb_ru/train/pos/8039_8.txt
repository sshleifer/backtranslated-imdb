Sniper gives a truly new meaning to war films. I remember movies about Vietnam or World War II, a lot of layoffs, everyone dies, Bam Bam. "Sniper" raises the war to a new level or sophistication. The film, of course, conveys all the emotions that it targets - the helplessness of the people in the jungle, hatred and possible trust between Beckett and Miller, and the rush of the moment they pull the trigger. It would seem that a low-budget film compensates for every shortcoming with actions, uncertainty and thrill, because when it comes to it, itâ€™s just one shot, one kill.
