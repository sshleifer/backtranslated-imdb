Probably one of the main examples after a tense, dramatic episode (in this case, the excellent Balance of Terror) with an easier job, Shore Leave is the first real attempt on behalf of Star Trek authors to create a more interesting part of the Sci-fi, and although the formula this record is not quite correct (the true triumph is “The problem with tribals”, in the second season), the laughter happens rather quickly, as long as the viewer is ready to take into account all the nonsense. <br /> <br /> Retreating from the traditions of the show, in this episode, the Enterprise does not perform any mission. Instead, Kirk found the perfect planet for his team to spend some time on vacation: a well-deserved break after three months of continuous work. A planet similar to Earth (a budget fact) is very attractive, but it only takes a few minutes for something strange to happen: Dr. McCoy has visions of a white rabbit that seem to come from the work of Lewis Carroll. Soon, other people begin to experience similar things: a woman meets a character similar to Don Juan, Sulu faces a samurai, and Kirk faces a double clash with the past, in the form of almost love and the guy who used to choose him at the Academy. Throw a bizarre-looking tiger, and it's easy to see why Kirk and Spock are determined to find out what happens before anyone gets hurt. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a classic: an idyllic place turns out to be far from heaven. A humorous look at the episode on this topic is quite successful, wasn’t it a dark turn of events that doesn’t fit well with the others (of course, everything works well again, the end) and the actors ’general reluctance to show the funnier side of them (most notably, , otherwise cheerful William Shatner). Still, Shore Leave deserves recognition for being another good example of how writers try something new, previously unseen: Star Trek's definition of success. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
