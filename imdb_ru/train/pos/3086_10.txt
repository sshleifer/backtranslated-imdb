Here is Italy (I write from Venice). Why canceled? The ABC was supposed to give her a chance to gather an audience. The cast (with Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erica Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I've seen lately. We need more of these shows so that viewers feel like smart personalities, and not senseless drones. I hope that ABC reconsider its decision or another station will accept it.
