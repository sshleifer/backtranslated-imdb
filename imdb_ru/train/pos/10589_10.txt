I liked Longstreet, which followed the example of Raymond Burr's successful Ironside series and was designed to give it competition. But this show was canceled after one season, because it was decided - I mistakenly believe - that Longstreet could not compete with Mr. Berr's Ironside. <br /> <br /> I can add that the pilot of this show was especially well done and very memorable. I hope that the Longstreet box set will appear. <br /> <br /> Authors should note that this story idea was only briefly explored here, and that much more can and should be done to show the play and interaction of people with disabilities on television. ,
