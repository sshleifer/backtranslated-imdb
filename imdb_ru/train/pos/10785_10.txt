I saw it when I was small, and it was excellent. Kelsey White as Lisa and Missy mice, where cute. Susan Bond in the role of Doodle and Sandra De Heidekke in the role of Snoudl, where Hilarius. Karen Betcher-Tate in the role of Profster was interesting. Berl Ross as Little Bunny Foo was funny. Gregory Donavon as Kaizo was great. What Hilarius, what Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy. What a pity that the Little Fu Fu Rabbit, who lets Missy mice on his head and then the fairy, will give the Little Fu Rabbit Fu few desires, and then he will become a madman. This story is about when Lisa, Snudl, Doodle go to the mountains of Big Rock. This show is excellent, children will enjoy this show, new words, songs and watching them play.
