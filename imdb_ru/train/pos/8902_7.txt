I would suggest that if Steve McQueen knew that he would become an icon and start Wanted: Dead Alive the same year that the film was released, or would be in the Magnificent Seven two years later, he would not have done so. But he did, and we are richer for that. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a classic camp. The horror that it should have been for driving theater. It is fun and nostalgic. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the last lines of the film were: <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Dave: At least we stopped him. Steve Andrews: Yes, as long as the Arctic stays cold. <br /> <br /> 52 years ago they never imagined that the Arctic would melt. Blob will be back soon.
