Despite the title "Bearing Sword" and the cover of the DVD (thriller / heroic, "Bearing Sword"), this film is not a superhero. <br /> <br /> (“Minor spoilers”). A swordtail, who is cursed, having a retractable sword in his hand Cool you say, but no, this is real life. If you had this power in your childhood, you could control it when, say, in the face of a madman or when your mom's boyfriend beats her up. And if you do not control it, how do you cope with being a two-time killer at the age of 12 years. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is where Sasha is when we meet him. Wander aimlessly after another murder (very similar to A Bout de Soufflé). Then he meets Kate, and the couple instantly falls in love, giving Sasha a real reason to live and try to change his lifestyle. However, his past still haunts him, in the form of two policemen. <br /> <br /> This is, in fact, a story, and there are practically no actions on the screen, although there are many if offered. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Unlike many Hollywood films about “super heroes”, we have very little background, there is no bad guy (except for the Sword), but he has a lot of heart and good character development. <br /> <br /> It’s worth checking out if you can find it.
