I watched this movie on cable, it was really funny, from the police chief on stereotypes to the stereotypical big bad guys, DJ and Leno and Mr. Mayagi from the children's karate star in this good comedy about a prototype car. I compare this film with RUSH HOUR, in which the local policeman must work with the Asian policeman to solve the case. The chase through the farmers market in downtown Detroit brings back memories. Pleasant soundtrack, good script, I give it 10/10.
