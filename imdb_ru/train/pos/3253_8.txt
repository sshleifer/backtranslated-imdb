Not a film to be taken seriously, but, nevertheless, a great little film. <br /> <br /> This is definitely NOT just fluff. The acting, IMO, is great. <br /> <br /> One of those movies that you wouldnâ€™t want to see, but it brings a smile every time it goes over the cable. Like an old friend. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth seeing if you have a chance. <br /> <br /> - - - - - - - -
