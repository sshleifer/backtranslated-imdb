This show is worth seeing. This is the best talent I have seen in a very long time. The idea of ​​the show is unique and fresh (I think that the leaders of ABC also do not use it, because it was not just another reality show). However, this show was believable with cute characters and amazing storylines. I’m probably not in the age group that they expect to enjoy the show, since I’m in my forties, but many of my friends liked it too (late 30s - mid 40s) and they crave quality shows with talented actors . I do not think that this show was given enough time to get an audience. I think that if I had more time, this show would be very good. Once again, ABC does not give a show with real potential a real chance. With so many shows, there is a chance for a chance and it's almost not worth it! They should give a quality show a real chance and time to really click and win an audience. I really loved the characters and looked forward to watching each episode. I watch episodes on ABC videos, and the show is getting better and better. Although I think they owe us another episode (number 13?). We want to see what we can! Bombard ABC with emails and letters and see if it is possible to keep this show from disappearing. It certainly worked for Jericho. Some things just need to be saved, and this show is definitely one of them. SIGN ONLINE PETITION ON ABC ON: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
