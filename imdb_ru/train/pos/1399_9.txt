This is one of the smallest episodes, when the plot really seemed like a reason to just have fun. BUT, I appreciated this carefree approach, and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level. Think about it - the crew meet with a white rabbit and Alice from Wonderland, a Bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a knight on a horse that kills McCoy, and many other seemingly strange events that simply make no sense at all until the very the end. Despite all the danger, you just can not take everything very seriously - it's just too much fun, and the whole episode seems very surreal. So on a purely unaesthetic level, this is great.
