Best animated film ever made. This film explores not only the vast world of modern animation with absolutely stunning effects, but also the branches of the human mind, soul and philosophy. This story tells about the family of cats, in which the older sister dies, the younger brother sees this and saves his body, but when she wakes up, she is left without a soul. So, two native cats go on a journey to find him. I have connected this journey with many things. The history of the world, the Bible, the cycle of life, and every time I watch it, I discover more and more hidden themes and metaphors. If you are not so interested in its physiological aspect, you still adore it. The animation is gorgeous, and the creative scenes will be tied to the screen. For example, the ocean freezing in time, God eats soup from the earth, a strange and slightly SNM paraphrase of Hansel and Gretel. In conclusion, we can say that Cat Soup is an absolute treat for everyone. <br /> <br /> PS- Not for children, including because of unreasonable violence.
