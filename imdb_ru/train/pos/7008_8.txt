BLIMEY! What movie !!!!!!!!!!! I'm not at all a fan of modern Italian filmmakers. I usually don't like drama. I'm not a super Will Will fan, even thinking that he is a very good actor ...... but this film! This is such a wonderful film with such an original script and such good leadership and such a good game ... wow ... this is amazing. This film captured my attention every minute, and I didn’t even like “Pursuit of Happiness” (perhaps also because I didn’t like the game of Will’s son, who is a very bad actor, while children usually seem to be natural actors. I saw that he was also last night on "The Day the Earth Stopped," and I confirmed my feeling that Jayden cannot act). I do not want to write spoilers, and therefore I am not talking about history, but I can say that this film tells about love, death and other feelings that I don’t like to watch in films ... but THIS FILM is such a super great film. If you have a minimum of heart, you will not regret watching it
