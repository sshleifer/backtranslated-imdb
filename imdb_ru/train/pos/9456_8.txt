Unlike many other films that cause concern, either because of their naked nuisance (“A man bites a dog”), or because of sheer violence (in most Pekingpa movies), “Liberation” is striking in its plausibility. Of course, the scene with errors is rather straightforward in its trouble, but the film’s effect stems from its slow rise and tangible sense of isolation around the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the canoe passes under the child on the bridge, which does not even recognize the men with whom he previously played music, not to mention showing any signs of human attachment to them, is one of the most sinister in a modern film. Tension steadily increases throughout the journey by canoe, and persists even after the final credits — the final makes the value of the characters' tests terrifyingly real. The credibility of the film is largely due to the play of major roles, especially Ned Beatty and John Voight as the victim and reluctant hero, respectively. Burt Reynolds has never been better either. The cultural influence of the film is demonstrated by the number of people who understand the reference to the "banjo territory" - perhaps only Geth Carter did such an effective ax work in the tourist industry of the region. I can only recall a few films that lead me to such a serious depression after they finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can come up with. Although much of this is excellent in itself, Deliverance is primarily a classic, because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique.
