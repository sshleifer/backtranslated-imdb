It is based on the scandalous play of Broadway, published by William Mastrosimone in 1982. James Rousseau, who played the attacker also in the play, is convincing as Joe. Alfre Woodard and Dia On Scarwid are great as Pat and Terry. James Avery is considered a guard. She received a Golden Globe nomination. This is not a movie that should entertain you.
