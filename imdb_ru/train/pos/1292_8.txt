He is crazy to have his own house and his own rules, as his brothers always stole his saved money, and his parents neglected his desires. One terrible day, Preston rode his bicycle; It was the same day that the villain of the story, Quigley, tried to escape from the police and accidentally drove into Prestonâ€™s car. You need to be far away from the police, Quigley hurries, checks to cover the damage to Preston's bike. The problem was: it was an empty check! Preston is a smart boy and decides to pay a high price for this check: 1 million dollars! All this money gives Preston what he always wanted, for example, a mansion with a pool, a lot of toys and even a limousine! The problems start when the FBI and Quigley want to know where the money is, what puts Preston in a difficult situation and faces many problems. <br /> <br /> This film was one of my favorites in childhood. :)
