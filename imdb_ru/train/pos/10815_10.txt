Now many will think to stay away from this movie just because of the title. If you do not have a stomach for bloody films, what do you do while reading this review? Anyway, I borrowed a video from my friend and immediately fell in love with this film. This film is filled with wonderful blood, plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b-film make up one hell of a viewing experience! If you are a lover of good quality, be sure to watch this great movie!
