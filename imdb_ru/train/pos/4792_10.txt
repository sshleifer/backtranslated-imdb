Straight Story is a multi-level study of the good and beauty of America. At one level, a slow walk in the center is good people and amber grain, at another level it is aging and remembering what is important (and actively forgetting what is not). David Lynch gives us time in this film and helps me remember that so much can be said in silence. Wonderful movie that will gently rest with me for some time.
