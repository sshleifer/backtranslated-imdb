In 1967, I visited the glider port on Lake Elsinore and flew on the yellow sailing vessel Pratt Read. Returning to Germany, the aforementioned serious videos were broadcast on television, and one fragment was devoted to flying at high altitudes in California in the early 50s. (The real pilot was Bill Ivanes, I donâ€™t know who played him in the series) It turned out that the glider in the film was the same (same N-number) as the one I flew on Elsinore Lake. Since I saw this segment, I searched for it and wondered if it was available for sale anywhere. (the other segments of this serious article concerned the place of the baker's release; the tool for finding victims of the avalanche, etc.
