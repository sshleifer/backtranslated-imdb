Do you know how Star Trek fans flocked to all Star Trek movies, even to very bad ones? What for? To see your heroes in action again. This is what I feel about Doc Savage. I'm a big fan of this character, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his team in an adventure was overwhelming. And the first 20 minutes of the film only strengthened this sense of anticipation. They then decided to extract elements from Doc's adventure series and add them to this film, which led to a somewhat scattered film. There are many promises diluted by a number of unsuccessful elections (music, elements of the “camp”, etc.). But the spirit of Doc is present, and those of us who are familiar with Doc and his team react to it. So, in my many-sided way, I try to say that this is not a bad film: it is simply not as good as it should be. And anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Bacaru Banzai, and many other characters should check out this film to just get to know the hero who inspired them all.
