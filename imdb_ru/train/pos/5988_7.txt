This 1939 film tried to capitalize on Michael Curtis's much better film, Angels with Dirty Faces. At the direction of Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how tame these children were compared to what happens to young people in the inner cities of America today. <br /> <br /> The film is worth seeing only because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed that they are well matched together. Dead-end children have large parts, since the plot focuses on them, and not on older people. <br /> <br /> It is curious that the arson was used in the same way as some bona fide hosts in recent years right here in New York. It was the quickest way to turn property around, without considering the social problems that it created. In today's climate with so many weapons there is a new reality. The young children of this story seemed simple jokers, not criminals. How times change!
