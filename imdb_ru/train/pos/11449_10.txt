This is definitely one of the most beautiful portraits of a man I have ever seen on the screen. Andy Goldsworthy is the kind of person who is on the verge of extinction. he looks at the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it is primitive in a good sense. His purity, honesty and kindness breathe distinctly while you watch him work in such simplified but full of life instant works of art. I was amazed at how patiently he created his works and how patiently he accepted their end. sometimes premature, but his Scottish sense of humor brilliantly hides his disappointments. the film is shot elegantly and contains the same stream as the art of Goldsworthy. it combines nature and art in a minimal degree, as it is in itself. The score of Fred Frit is organic enough to mix everything together without interfering with the naturalistic sound. In general, it is an excellent job in all aspects. by age it has no limits.
