A single mother (Diane Keaton) works in several jobs with a minimum wage. When she is fired, she discovers that she cannot contain her sons (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), who have asthma. Then she goes to her friend and starts selling drugs. Soon enough, she becomes addicted to the drugs she sells. Her life is crumbling, especially when her children, namely her eldest son, find out the truth and threaten to leave her. Then she struggles to redeem herself with the help of her children, but can she protect her family from the drug barons she worked for? <br /> <br /> Wow! In this movie for life, some of the best acting films I've ever seen! Diane Keaton replays a lot, and her character seems crazy, but she was extremely convincing. It is much better suited for drama than for comedy. However, the best performance in the film comes from Michael Cyter, who plays her eldest son. He is beautiful as a responsible son who is still young, but is trying to be an adult in the family. His acting was especially great in the scenes where he tells his mother about drugs. Colin Roberts, who plays the youngest son, also does an excellent job. <br /> <br /> A movie that is worth seeing, especially because he played Michael Seater and Diane Keaton!
