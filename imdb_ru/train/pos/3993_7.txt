“Mother” is a strange low-budget film, affecting at least two uncomfortable themes that are not usually studied in the movies: denial of mother’s love for her son and daughter, and passion and passion at the third age. <br /> <br /> Horrible characters: May is a disgusting old woman, and I think it is impossible to feel sympathy or grief for her. She admits that she did not love her son and her daughter. She deceived her husband twice with an intellectual. She steals her daughter's beloved man, not to protect her from a boy of no morality who does not love her, but only because she is excited by him. She tries to organize her life after losing her husband in the most terrible way, destroying her delusions of her daughter. Paula, her daughter, a frail loser, who takes her life for what it is. Her brother, Bobby, is a man who has lost his savings because of his wife, who insists that her store be a really terrible thing. Darren is an immoral dependent moron who doesn't love anyone, not even himself. <br /> <br /> Acting and directing are excellent: actresses and actors have outstanding performances, and the management is very accurate. I liked this film, but I understand that it is recommended for a very specific audience. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Recomeçar” (“Restart”)
