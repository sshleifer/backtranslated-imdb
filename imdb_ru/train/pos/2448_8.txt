Yes, this is too much, yes, this is a bit strange, and yes, Constance Marie is a real baby, and she deserves to see her again and again! Jokes and jokes may become old and repetitive after a while, but watching is still interesting. Since this is a family show, humor is muted, and the authors have included family values ​​and ideals between the jokes. <br /> <br /> George Lopez is fun. Do not take it seriously, and the show is a winner. I am sure that he did not want his character to be a serious or a model of virtue. His explosions and shouts of joy are ridiculous ... <br /> <br /> I have to say that the only big, dark, bitter spot is Benny. I hate this character ... so much so that at any time when she is turned on for more than 30 seconds, I turn off the TV so that I don’t have to hear it. There is nothing funny in her dialogue or her jokes. Being a mother, she must be the worst, and I'm just shocked and surprised that George, as a character, will be so long behind such a deplorable person. <br /> <br /> Even at any time, when I get ticked when I see Benny, I think to myself: seeing her is much better than watching the Bill Engvall show. Now there is a bad comedy series ...
