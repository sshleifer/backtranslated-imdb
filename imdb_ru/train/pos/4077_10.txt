I first saw it in the early 90s on British television, then I liked it, but I missed the chance to record it on tape, many years passed, but the film always stuck with me, and I lost the hope of seeing it again, the main thing is that stuck with me, it was the end, part of the castle of the hole really touched me, it is easy to watch, there is a great story, great music, the list goes on and on, well, I say how good it is, but everyone will take it myself as soon as they see it, yes, the animation is on a higher level and not pretty to watch, it is showing its age in very few parts, but now it has become part of the beauty, I'm so glad I came out on DVD, because it is one of my top 10 movies of all time. Buy or rent, just look, the best view is at night, alone with drinks and food, so you donâ€™t need to stop the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
