I just saw this amazing Japanese film at the 5th Annual Roger Ebert Film Festival at the Historic Virginia Theater in Champaign, Illinois. <br /> <br /> Although this film with English subtitles has ballroom dancing, its heart, the film actually shows the world outside Japan how tough family, employment (salary) and leisure structures still exist in modern Japan. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Suo Masauki [I follow the Japanese custom of presenting surname (surname) name and surname (surname)] uses a not very popular theme of ballroom dancing to show the social structure of Japan. <br /> <br /> [In addition, I will not use the names of the characters in the film, when readers of the world may not know Japanese formal names that can be confusing. I will refer to the actors <br /> <br /> by their professional acting names listed in the Internet Data Movie Base database.] <br /> <br /> He enlists the support of his real wife, professional ballet. the Kusakari Tamiyo dancer in her first and so far only film. She is a dance teacher in her father’s dance studio. However, her real ambition is to again participate in the International Dance Competition, in which she was disqualified in the past. No, I won't say why. Watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the main star of the film. A veteran of about 25 films since 1979, he performs brilliantly with a 40-year-old businessman, <br /> <br /> who has a beautiful wife, a teenage daughter, and who just bought his own house <br /> <br /> Yearning. <br /> <br /> Yet something is missing in his own inner happiness. Watch this movie to find out how he “enjoys” ballroom dancing and secretly goes to lessons <br /> <br />. Most of the dancing characters are freed from the traditional Japanese hierarchy of social structure. They are friendly, warm and welcoming. Of course, this contrasts sharply with the way Japanese society is organized, with its philosophy of “a place for each and every one in its place”. <br /> <br /> There are so many fun moments in the movie. Nearly 1,500 spectators of the theater burst into spontaneous laughter during many comedic moments. This proves that <br /> <br /> there is no foreign language in the comedy. <br /> <br /> The veteran actor Takenaka Naoto, like Watanabe Eriko, is cheerful and brilliant. These are two funny character actor. <br /> <br /> It was possible to buy and read a college textbook on the structure of life in Japan, or you can watch this wonderful movie and begin to understand how <br /> <br /> People of Japan are growing up in a rather rigid social structure . Watching the movie "Should we be Dansu?" This is a quick immersion in the further study and viewing of other Japanese films. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. This is fun, charming, makes you cry a little and will warm your heart. <br /> <br />
