“Happenstance” is the most Parisian film with a New York feel that I have seen since the days of “When visiting the cat Chakun Church.” <br /> <br /> A film from last year, released to attract the attention of Audrey Tatoo, gets the title “Amelie”, her French name is more appropriate: “Le Battement d'ailes du papillon” (“The beating of butterfly wings”) as it generalizes chaos theory as an element of control in our life. <br /> <br /> Tattoo's playfulness is less annoying here because it only occasionally flashes this dazzling smile among its unfortunate adventures, and also because it is part of a large multi-ethnic ensemble so large that it took me a long time to figure out the characters, especially due to the fact that some cute guys and older women looked the same to me, and some characters imagine what they should do, so that I was not sure whether they are doing it or not. <br /> <br /> But I liked how often coincidences are found: from immigrants to love nests, to crowded subway cars to hanging cafes. <br /> <br /> Subtitles quite annoyingly gave both sides of the dialogue: once. <br /> <br /> (originally written 8/8/2001)
