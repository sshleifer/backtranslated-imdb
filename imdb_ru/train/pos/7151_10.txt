I read Holes in 5th grade, so when I heard them making a film, I was thrilled! Of course, being busy with myself, I did not have the opportunity to watch a movie in cinemas. The holes were on the outskirts of the suburbs, but, alas, we were too busy. I was surprised to learn that all my friends saw this, and none of them invited me! They all said it was good, but I read great books that made shit movies, so I was definitely worried. <br /> <br /> Suddenly there was a great opportunity to see it. It was that week, and my parents went on a cruise, and I was left to look after the children. My sister, who is 9 years old, and I watched it and absolutely loved it! Then I took it to other people who had a nanny and their children, 9 and 4, also liked it. Even my parents loved it, and they are definitely film critics. In general, I recommend this film for anyone who understands family morality and loves a cheerful cast! This movie must be in your top 5 "to see" list !!!!
