It is impossible to believe in a film that can be made so good in 1987 and practically unknown in the west. Do not repeat other reviews here. The rating is very good and touching. Literally, this means "Dawn, please, never come" - when he comes, the beautiful ghost and lover will be forever separated from each other. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still look great. I liked Joel in the movie “The God of Gamblers” and many of Leslie’s films, including Better Tomorrow.
