I like this movie. This is a certain inspirational film. It fills you with pride. This movie is worth renting or worth buying. It should be in every home. The best movie I've seen in a long time. It will piss you off because everyone is so angry with Karl Brashir, but in the end it gets better. This is a story about a novel, drama, action movie and lots of funny lines to keep you updated. I like many quotes. I use them all the time. They help keep me on the job, what I want to do. This shows that everyone can achieve his dream, all he has to do is work for it. It's a long film, but every time I watch it, I never notice that it is as long as it is. I am so absorbed in this that it happens so quickly. I love this film. I watch it whenever I can.
