Superbly crafted characters in a variety of funny situations, full of spirit, absurdity and Serbian mentality. The film is a great comedy, pleasant, interesting, unpredictable. The best moment in the movie: heroes, then humor, history and dialogue. Humor has an “inner development”, which is rarely found in Serbian films. So, this is a consequence of the characteristics, well motivated, spontaneous and convincing. He is also sharp, smart and clear. Unfortunately, in most films humor was created (think up a joke and put it in the characters' mouth) or a comedy story, burlesque, farce. Some of the “artistic immortality” are included in this film. A little masterpiece, barely achievable.
