Fact: Stargate SG-1 is a disgusting sci-fi series. <br /> <br /> There are no facts to avoid. No matter how you try to apologize or explain this, Stargate SG-1 is still a crappy science fiction show. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG-1 really borrows and steals ideas alive. The special effects are not as impressive as they could be, and the action won't knock you off track. Or couch for that matter. <br /> <br /> But it is here that I truly believe that the Stargate SG-1 deserves all the praise he can get for every episode or stolen idea that I think you can count on. at least one stupid sci-fi film that is actually worse than a one-hour television episode. <br /> <br /> In fact, some episodes probably could have lasted 90 minutes and yet were better than most movies. <br /> <br /> And the ability to maintain this quality throughout the entire show, as well as continue and develop the storyline - this is what makes Stargate SG-1 special. <br /> <br /> I am very picky about my choice. I’m probably watching a maximum of one or two episodes, and I’m keeping to fairly high standards, which made me even more surprised when I was caught. <br /> <br /> So for those who have decided to try Stargate SG-1, another non-tasteful science fiction show is not necessary. Stick to this and you will understand what I am talking about.
