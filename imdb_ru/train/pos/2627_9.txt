Finally, Timon and Pumba in his own film ... <br /> <br /> “The Lion King 1 1/2: Akuna Matata” is a disrespect for the new version of the classic fairy tale. What classic tale do you ask? Why, of course, "The Lion King"! <br /> <br /> Yes, if there is something that Disney cannot say, it is narcissism. <br /> <br /> But this does not mean that it is not a good film. It is mainly the events of the Lion King, as Timon and Pumba say. And that is why you will have to memorize the story of the "Lion King" to see where they come from. <br /> <br /> Anyway, on one level I watched it and thought, “My God, this is so stupid ...” and on another level I had a ball. Most of the humor is predictable - I mean, when Pumba makes up two beds, big for himself and small for Timon, for the first nanosecond we all know that Timon is going to take a big one. But that does not stop him from being fun, which, IMO, is “Hakuna Matata” in a nutshell. The point is not what is happening, but how. <br /> <br /> And a warning: there are fart jokes. Seriously, did you expect anything else in the film where Pumba takes center stage? But, as vulgar jokes, they are especially good, and must satisfy even the most sophisticated connoisseur. <br /> <br /> The talent of the returning voice is great. I'm a little surprised that some of the actors were ready to return, and most of them had only two or three lines (if they were lucky). Whoopi Goldberg is especially welcome. <br /> <br /> Music is also great. From “Digga Tunnah” at the beginning to “That's all I need,” an adaptation of “Warthog Rhapsody” (a song that was cut from “The Lion King” and, frankly, greatly improved in this incarnation), music leaves me with nothing to complain about So be it. It’s rare to find characters you just want to spend time with. <br /> <br /> Am I starting to sound creepy? <br /> <br /> In any case, “The Lion King 1 1/2” is great if you have seen the “Lion King” too many times. Especially if you are thinking now: “Don't be stupid, there is no such thing as seeing the“ King Lion ”too many times!”
