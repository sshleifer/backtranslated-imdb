I have been reading Blaise's modesty for several years now, collecting the numbers of strips. After the film about the fiasco, made many years ago on the basis of the first book, “The Modesty of Blaise,” I was surprised by the result that got this good result. <br /> <br /> I got a movie not based on actions or violence. The director focused on history and psychology. How Modesty was created, based on its own history, and which aspects of her life were not influenced by childhood. I think these thoughts will give more insight to the next (I hope) film. I just loved movies the old fashioned way. <br /> <br /> However, everything was not so good, gambling was not so good. almost boring and unreal. Acting skills could also be improved. I don't think the bad guy in this film felt real, the only reason he was there was because Modesty could have someone to tell her story. In addition, they could expand the film, showing more about when it builds the “Network”, but I think it will be for the next movie. <br /> <br /> And please forgive me for my bad english
