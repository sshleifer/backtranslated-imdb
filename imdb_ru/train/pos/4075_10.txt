Laputa: a castle in the sky is a bomb. The message is as strong as its new works and more pure, fantastic and flying pirates, how can this be better! The art is absolutely amazing, and the soundtrack, which is reused after this, (I'm not sure if I heard it for the first time) and gives me the most emotional sentimental response from any movie soundtrack. Sheeta, the lead role in this film, is just awesome, and the guy, Patsu, is also an excellent role model - he lives on his own! The plot is a classic Miyazaki. I will not give it up, but the end is really great. I rate this as one of the top three Miyazaki with Nausicaa and Spirited Away. You might also want to check out Moving Castle Howl when it comes out (hopefully next year). If you like Miyazaki, check it out, as it is easily available in the USA. Enjoy, Piper A
