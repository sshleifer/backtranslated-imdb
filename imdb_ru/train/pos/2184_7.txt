Although this film was quite enjoyable, I was struck by the unexpected comedy chemistry between Basil Rathbone, as a former composer, and Oscar Levant, as his assistant. Playing a high-level, abstract artistic type (far from his more familiar roles, or formidable villains, or cold-blooded Sherlock Holmes), Rathbone's character looks like he cannot find a way out of bed without help. And this help is Starbuck, played with his usual funny humor Oscar Levant. By recruiting Crosby’s character as a ghostwriter, Rathbone introduces him to Starbuck, saying, “He thinks everything for me,” to which the Levant replies: “Ah, this is only part-time work.” Of course, it goes past (or more) Rathbone, who is too busy worrying about where his next hit song will come from. As another reviewer said, who knew that Rathbone could be so funny! It is a pity that he did not have more opportunities to show his comedic talent.
