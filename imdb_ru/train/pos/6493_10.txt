I remember watching it in childhood in the UK, hypnotized by the story and narration of Lawrence Olivier. We wouldn't talk about anything else at school the next day. I guess the ratings for the first show were huge. It's just the best and most complete documentary series, despite the fact that they had to cut the story down to the bones, which they managed to capture so much. What is interesting is that the battles for Britain and North Africa were crucial, but widely recognized by the Americans as such. The series reflects the rivalry between Mountbatten and American generals, the suffering of the German troops on the Eastern Front, and the cruel treatment of Japanese prisoners of war by American troops. Images of the Holocaust forced me, a non-Jewish European, to forever feel guilty for treating the Jewish people. I do not know why it is not number one in the IMDb ranking. Perhaps they show their bias against documentaries. Spoiler - we will win.
