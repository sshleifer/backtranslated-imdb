A family is two families that crave each otherâ€™s blood. <br /> <br /> Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) - a don from the underworld, working from Bangkok. He has a family in India. One day, by mistake, he kills Shekhara (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Sahai, he also has a family (brother, wife, and parents). Arian (Aryaman), brother of Shekhara, wants to avenge the death of his brother. For the same reason, he kidnaps the Viren Sahai family. <br /> <br /> The film has one turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the film belongs to him completely, where instead of his dialogues the expression has a greater meaning. Akshey's tiny role also put him on a par with Amitabh. I did not understand what Bhumika Chavala does in this film. <br /> <br /> There were several weak points in the script; Like; Amitabh was declared the most wanted criminal in the city, but still he walks around the city with impunity. The kidnapping of his family also seems vague. How can a family of such a big don have no protection?
