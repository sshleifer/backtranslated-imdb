I really liked this episode. Seeing Flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow and Aquaman (although all he did was swim), my eyes widened. To see how most of the founders of the Justice League are trying to knock down Lex Luthor, I waited. It sounds a bit off topic, but holding a live Justice League show would definitely give me a reason to give up everything I usually do during the week just to watch one episode. This is the thrill I got from watching this episode. I would like them to make this episode a little longer, for example, a two-hour special offer, because I felt that one hour of the Justice League was not enough. Now, before I tire you (if I donâ€™t already have with my rambling), I just want to say Smallville is cool again. He seemed to have lost touch when the series began to focus on Lana. But I am sure that the authors will simply fall into this hole. :( So enjoy this episode. Who knows when another good one will come out. Catch it again this Thursday, February 22, if you missed the first show.
