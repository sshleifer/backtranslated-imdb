This is the only film by David Zucker, which does not deceive anything first of its kind. The funniest 98s movie with Roxbury Night is over. But I didn’t think that there is something funny in Mary, so it doesn’t count, except that he and Frank. Do not listen to critics, especially Roger Ebert, he does not know fun entertainment, just look at his reviews. In any case, you will see that you will not be disappointed.
