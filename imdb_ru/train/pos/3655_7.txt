De Sica is becoming one of my favorite directors, but this one was a hit and a loser for me. The grinning idiot youth becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a desert area outside of Milan. This is a detailed and sparkling story about innocent poor masses, full of evil capitalists and carefree police forces, but gradually it turns into a fairy tale fantasy, as the Toto miracle boy develops unlimited superheroes. I had it here with Toto forever smiling after 10 minutes, and when magic took over, I was left in the dust. There were so many wonderfully organized cadres, so many good characters among the settlers that I kept thinking that it was a waste, the film was no more serious with his material. The combination of neo-realism and fantasy appears more like an experiment like “see what we can do and mother”, than as a fully developed piece / art.
