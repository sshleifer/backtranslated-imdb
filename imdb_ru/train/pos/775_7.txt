Strange but impressive love story. Personally, I have never come across such a story in real life. But I can imagine that there is. <br /> <br /> This is a story that promises to be “sick” from the title. But after I looked at it, I didn’t have the feeling of a “disease”, which I’d ​​probably have with regard to the rules of society. This is something beautiful in this film ... something spectacular ... which I cannot contradict using any moral or social rules. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship begins, develops, and finally ends. You feel the moment when this love flourishes, the first whispers, touches. You feel connected. And I do not think for a minute that this is immoral. You even hope that it won't break at the end ... it can't break ... it's not right. You feel the pain of finally breaking a deer ... <br /> <br /> But I also need to add negative to this comment ... I don’t know if the story is not anyway * showed * to the feeling that these relationships are sick only in form, not in content. You do not have a common history, but only fragments. When the film began, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu was already in place. So, I have no idea about the nature of the relationship. You feel only tension between them ... the struggle between the need for love and the desire to break this relationship. I think this line from Kiki to Sandu says everything: “I want to stop ... and if you love me, you will do as I ask you.” <br /> <br /> This film is likely to raise some questions about what love is and what should be moral ... and where is the line between them. I do not know whether the idea of ​​this film is "love conquers all ... even social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful ... no matter how or where." But, in my opinion, this film is already enjoying success for the simple reason that makes you think ...
