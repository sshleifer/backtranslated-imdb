I love this show. I watch all the replays every day, although I have seen them all 6 times each. <br /> <br /> This is about two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jenny Garth), who live in New York York. Holly moves to live with Val when their dad is transferred to Japan. Val has the perfect life, she has a boyfriend and a lovely apartment on the Upper East Side. <br /> <br /> The show basically shows all the problems that Val and Holly face. the main problem is guys, but also being responsible and other life choices. <br /> <br /> Holly is 16 years old and she is absolutely free, and Val is the complete opposite. She is organized, should have a plan for anything. <br /> <br /> Other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren and Tina.
