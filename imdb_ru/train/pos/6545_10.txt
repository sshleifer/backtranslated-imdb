I really liked this movie. Most of the reviews were bad, but most critics believe that the film should be like a drama of ideas. There is a bit of drama in this movie, but everything else is just fun and very entertaining. Forget that Julia Roberts is a beautiful woman, Emma Roberts is a beautiful young woman, and there is something more for her. Emma was so much fun watching Nancy Drew. Nice to see a new face. I believe that she will go far. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew may not rely on books, but the story is still good. There is also a good mix of other character actors and support actors, such as Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Lee Cook and Chris Kattan - not credited I am surprised that Disney did not release this film. Some people may not like this film because there is no sex, violence or swearing in it. This is a good family movie, which is rarely seen today. So take your family, watch this movie and judge for yourself how good it is. I can not wait to continue.
