My personal opinion is that you cannot separate this film from its political / historical background, as many American reviewers do. This is not about growing up on Main Street, USA. It is about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between East and West. Just as the guys are torn between Esther and everyone else, but Esther is torn between "Comrade Joe" and the guys. In certain situations, shame is lost in front of an audience that has never lived with Tito. I feel that the film is underestimated, and it’s a pity we lost the director. Such films make freedom more important. This is not just “another Eastern European film about coming of age” ... this is a sensitive image of teenagers walking a fine line that can ultimately lead them to real freedom.
