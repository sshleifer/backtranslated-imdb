Although I'm not a big fan of musicals, I like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films, because they are very funny. Of course, they may be a bit formal, but even if you KNOW what happens, they are still very pleasant to watch. However, despite this, I was a little disappointed in this walk. This is partly because this film does not have a great cast, as you saw in TOP HAT or SHALL WE DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Bloor, the film seems to be a bit lacking - especially in the “fun” department. The stupid antics of these minor actors have given charm to other films that you simply won’t get with LAST FLEET. In addition, unlike the ordinary character played by Aster, this character is rather a jerk - his fat head gives Roger trouble again and again. And as a result, it's much more difficult to love him or see how they get together at the end of the film. In addition, although the music is written by Irwin Berlin, the songs don't seem so memorable. In fact, none of the songs was so special, and I can't remember any of them, even though I just watched the movie. Although it is still a cute and worthy film, it simply lacks the brilliance and magic of some of their other films. Good, but far from perfect.
