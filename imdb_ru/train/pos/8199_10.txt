After what was considered the official trilogy of Dirty Harry with the Enforcer (1976), to be the last chapter in the series. Dirty Harry is back, older, dirtier and rougher than ever since the original 1971 classics. <br /> <br /> Dirty Harry has murdered a psychopathic killer, rebel policemen and Vietnam veteran terrorists in the past. But now he is pursuing a new killer, a murderer who wants to pay by shooting his attackers. <br /> <br /> Sudden exposure gives Dirty Harry a new meaning and a darker tone. Callahan is involved in a new murder case, which is being returned to a woman (played by Sondra Locke), who was brutally raped with her sister, who remained injured. Ten years later, she longs for revenge, shooting assailants. At the same time, despite the fact that Callahan is on the verge of trouble on the part of his superiors, after he provoked the Mafia boss to have a heart attack, from which the mob also hunts him. Thus, to allow the heat to subside in the city, Harry must rest in the seaside city, but at the same time the victim of rape is also in the city, hunting the attackers one by one. Harry is investigating and finds that the killings are very similar, as he lives on the tracks of the killer. <br /> <br /> The sudden impact, in my opinion, should be one of the top 10 films about revenge, as well as the second best film “Dirty Harry”, much better than Enforcer and Dead Pool combined. Sudden Strike has what the original “Dirty Harry” had, a dark tone with entertainment value. <br /> <br /> So you got lucky, punk?
