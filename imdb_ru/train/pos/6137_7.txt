What a great gem it is! This is an unusual story that is interesting to watch. Yes, he has singing, but it is very beautifully written in history and very melodious for hearing. It was so nice to watch; I enjoyed it from start to finish! <br /> <br /> The film takes place in England during the Second World War. This is a witch apprentice who is looking for the missing part of the spell she needs. She uses her coarse “magic” to transport her and her three children under her guardianship to various places in order to find her. They are joined by her distance learning teacher, who is surprised to learn that the lessons from his school really work! <br /> <br /> At first, special effects may seem a bit outdated, but once you get used to them, they become part of the charm of this film. In fact, the film won an Oscar for these effects! <br /> <br /> The film is innocent and funny, and it's hard not to like melodious songs. Characters are amazingly fun to watch. I think anyone at any age can find something that they like about this movie.
