What can I say about this film, which has not yet been said? Well, frankly, in many ways it looks very fake, like some punches and kicks. like Charlie Sheen, although it was real, I don't know. I am sure that if this were so, they would have kicked her hard. however, scenes with pinching and hot oil look very realistic. and the last needle in the eye scene is made amazingly and probably the only thing in the film that ever shocked me.
