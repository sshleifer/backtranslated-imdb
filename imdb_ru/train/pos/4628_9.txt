One of the best parts of Sundance is watching movies that you probably miss. If you're not a true art-house devotee, you probably won't catch a lot of documentaries. Only a few get any recognizable distribution. Fortunately, in recent years, Sundance has strengthened its commitment to documentaries. <br /> <br /> “Shakespeare Behind the Bars” is a powerful documentary about the dramatic film crew at the Luther Lackett Correctional Facility in Lagrange, Kentucky. Each year a group of prisoners presents a Shakespeare play. Directed by Hank Rogerson and his team follow the troupe, as the roles are chosen independently, interpreted, rehearsed and ultimately performed. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with exciting revelations for those of us who have not been subjected to the prison environment. Despite the labels by which we know them (convicted, criminal, murderer, etc.), We soon began to appreciate respect these people as thinking people. By happy coincidence, the play chosen for the year of filming was “The Tempest,” which focused on forgiveness and redemption. All actors are faced with the relevance of the play for their lives, finding patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of drama. <br /> <br /> For a documentary film such as a book, the best that can be, we hope that we will experience something that will change our lives. Shakespeare behind bars was a personal revelation to me. "Oh brave new world in which there are such creatures."
