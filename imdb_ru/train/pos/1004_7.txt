After a brief prologue showing how a masked man pursues and then cuts his throat to a senior gentleman on the deserted city street of the Australian turn of the century, we meet Julie (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam) when they go hunting for a house. They manage to get a loan for a repairman on the posh street of Sydney, but it turns out that physical condition is not the only problem of their new home. Perhaps he is being pursued. <br /> <br /> 13 Gantry Row combines an unforgettable, albeit somewhat mediocre story with good and average Catherine Millar's leadership in a shocker just above average. <br /> <br /> The biggest drawbacks It would seem, partly because of the budget, but not fully justify this obstacle. The most important problem occurs at the beginning of the film. The opening "thriller scene" contains a bit of humorous editing. Freeze frames and series of photos are used to hide the fact that there are not so many actions here. The suspension should be created from the production, not the fancy fix-it-in-mix techniques. Scene, location, lighting, fog, etc. They create a great atmosphere, but the camera must slowly follow the killer and the victim, traversing back and forth from one to another while we track down the street, showing their growing closeness. Tracking and reduction should be slow. The attack should have been longer, clearer and better blocked. In its current form, the scene has a strong sense of “for television” and at the same time it is low-budget. <br /> <br /> After this scene we move to the present, and the course of the film is greatly improved. This story is in many ways similar to Amityville's Horror (1979), although the budget requires a much more subtle approach. Millar and screenwriter Tony Morpett effectively create many tricky creepy scenarios, often dramatic in nature, rather than special effects-oriented, such as a mysterious man who arrives to pick up old iron plates that were fancifully attached to the inner wall. <br /> <br /> For some horror fans, the first part of the film may be a bit heavy for a realistic drama. At least the first half hour of the film is mainly about Julie and Peter, who are trying to arrange financing at home, and then try to get settled. But Morpett writes a good, intelligent dialogue. The material is made quite well that it is often as intense as the more traditional aspects of the thriller that arise later - especially if you have gone through similar tests trying to buy your own home. <br /> <br /> As soon as they get everything settled, and everything starts to become more and more strange, although special effects often leave much to be desired, ideas are good. The performances help create tension. There is no abundance of deaths and destruction in the film - more nightmares about home repairs. But neither the one nor the other threat is really that. <br /> <br /> The point is in human relations. There are a number of symbolic arcs that are very interesting. The house exists more as a metaphor and catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it spoiled and possibly destroy it. The fact that he is in a posh area, and that the relationship between two successful yuppies, show that these problems affect not only those who may blame some external grief, such as problems with money or health. Peter's character develops from an aspiring corporate employee with a “normal” working friendship to a person with great despair when he becomes disruptive, plotting to achieve something more liberated and meaningful. At the same time, we will find out how small these professional friendships can be. Julie is experiencing an almost literal nervous breakdown, but ultimately gains liberation when she frees herself from failed romantic relationships. <br /> <br /> Although the 13th Gantry Row never goes beyond the awkwardness created for television, as a television movie It's pretty good, with remarkable ambitions. Anyone who loves haunted home movies, psychological or horror / thriller films with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty of fun. Of course, it’s not worth spending $ 30 on a DVD (this was the price that my local PBS station requested a copy of the film after they showed it (including shipping and processing)), but it’s worth renting and it’s definitely worth watching for free.
