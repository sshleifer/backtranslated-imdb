What a wonderful movie! The concept of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is sticky. The finale is not just suitable, it is more inspiring. <br /> <br /> But I am intrigued by the characters. It is a pity that we never see the relationship of Achilles and Athens more developed, except for a couple of kisses and fear of Athens for the security of Achilles. Their romance is very pleasant. <br /> <br />
