As many people know, Mexican cinema was very poor after the so-called Golden Age of Mexican cinema, fortunately in the late 90s and the beginning of the 21st century, such great films as La Ley de Herodes, Bajo California, Amores Perros, Y Tu Appeared Mamá También and, of course, El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Ecriba. El Coronel ..., a wonderful film telling the classic story of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, eliminating the elements of magical realism and replacing them with a harsh reality that lived in Mexico, not only by people like the colonel who are waiting for their retirement, but more than half of Mexico’s population live in complete poverty. The film characters satirically represent the classic characters of the Mexican society, such as the nationalist colonel, the cold and even the ambitious priest, the hypocrite, but at the same time the faithful companion, the tolerant and patient wife, the hidden homosexual, etc. A film that you definitely need to watch, if you want to know more about Mexican society, and especially if you want to watch a great movie, one of the best directors of Mexico
