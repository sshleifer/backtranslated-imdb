The best sly fighter. This is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters, solid performances and stylish guidance by Renny Harlins. Stallone is rarely so interesting in his action movies, and he, of course, plays a role in terms of action movies. It was one of the best militants of the year and one of the most exciting and exciting 90s, classics of a certain genre. As a Stallone fan, I remember this with fond memories. Many excellent actions and tricks in its original form. Fans of action appreciate this film because it has all the distinctive features that make a good Akiton movie. The film looks great and is supported by Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****
