Very good western. It was the first time writer Richard Wilson made a film, and it was the first film for Samuel Goldwyn Junior as a producer. It's nice to see a very young and pretty Angie Dickinson as a saloon girl. Robert Mitchum arrives in this city, where criminals predominate, and is hired as a city tamer, but people are worried that he will go too far, as well as about the harm he does to the cityâ€™s business. In the story of "Warlock", which was filmed in 1959, there are some similarities. This film keeps a very fast and exciting pace, it really keeps you on the edge.
