A brilliant Russian emigrant is developing the Stanislavsky system to win on the contract bridge, which makes him and his beautiful wife the beloved of America “GRAND SLAM”. <br /> <br /> Something that could have been another silly soap opera of excellent production value and an excellent game in the status of a very pleasant little comedy. A few unexpected touches are added to attract the viewer's attention — the way the principle of playing is represented as faces on a deck of cards; introduction to the plot of a mad acrobat for no other reason than to enjoy a small amount of madness; and a way to show the diversity of Americans of different types when they listen to the broadcast of the final game. <br /> <br /> Paul Lucas and Loretta Young are great in the role of those in love with “The Bridge” - Lucas the Courteous and refined, and Miss Young is passionately loving and beautiful (even if the script makes her drag out a cigarette too much). They are interesting to watch, even if their behavior is not always the most plausible or convincing. <br /> <br /> Frank McHugh gives you one more good job as a relentlessly cheerful ghost writer who adores Miss Young. Delightful Glenda Farrell avoids her usual character-sorcerer in the small role of McHugh's ugly friend. Roscoe Karns talks about chatter as a cheeky radio host. Miniature Ferdinand Gottschalk is great as an expert on the snobbish bridge. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers recognize Dewey Robinson as the militant patron of a nightclub; Emma Dunn as a weeping sister reporter; Paul Porkasi as the owner of a Russian nightclub; Charles Lane as a Russian waiter; and Jimmy Conlin as a kibitzer on the final bridge game - all without accreditation. <br /> <br /> The film uses a passion for the contract bridge, which has covered the whole country since its development in the 1920s. He expects the viewer to have a basic knowledge of the intricacies of the game and will not try to explain anything to the ignorant.
