Pierce Brosnan is likely to be the only friend in the new biopic of Richard Attenborough. The rest is news to an international audience: the history of Canada and the culture of first nations. <br /> <br /> Gray Owl is an easy study of how a person was adopted in the Ojibway of northern Ontario, studying and preaching environmentalism decades before it became politically correct. The film contains a love story, a moral message and a man tortured by his past. This torture, however, does not always come to life with such a dramatic impact. <br /> <br /> However, this is a film that keeps its audience without any violence. He expresses deep respect for the indigenous people of Canada and represents them with dignity and not stereotyped. Brosnanâ€™s performance is somewhat harsh, but I suspect that this is what Lord Attenborough wanted him to do. <br /> <br /> Thanks from the proud Canadian.
