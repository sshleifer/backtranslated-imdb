Yes, that is right. In fact, it's somewhere in the top 20 of my favorite movies of all time. Number 15, I think. In any case, Iâ€™m usually not the only one for the plots, but I think that the plots work better in anime and role-playing video games (for example, Final Fantasy 7) rather than in movies. But this is all. Bright pictures of planets, stars, extremely well-written script. Although it is not really for children, they can still watch it, there is no graphic blood, guts and silicone in it. But I do not think they will understand it.
