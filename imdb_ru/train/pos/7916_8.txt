Well, okay ... The horn was a little nervous, isn't it? He was a genius, while he cataloged the descents of his various characters into psychosis for several decades, but as soon as he has a bad taste, suppose that redemption (or even some good advice) can be found in the old bad Catholic Church, the crowd of alternative movies, more than you, becomes very angry. Worse, the Theresa Russell character, confronted with experience, who has nothing to explain in her frankly rationalistic worldview, is reluctant to deal with these experiences on another level - on the spiritual level. You know, the realm of the ignorant and superstitious, these kind of things that art-house movie-lovers should stand above. Oh, the horror ... So, she finds her marriage - the thought that this can be an extremely important obligation - is confirmed by the fact that it seems inconvenient, like divine intervention. People who find this idea indecent at first glance may ask themselves why they instinctively go into attack mode when they have to take the idea of ​​the spiritual dimension in their lives seriously. But they probably won't. Of course, this film has some problems, in particular, the crazy work of Talia Shir in the form of an exhausted nun, clothes in the style of the 1950s and all that. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in their last scene right from the Enchanted School of Glib's Interpretations (although Hitchcock's film avoided such accusations because of the source of wisdom, which has impeccable secular evidence as a Freudian psychoanalyst). But, unfortunately, Nicholas Roeg seems to have coped with criticism, both in order to even ask a question, and for the possible answers that this film gives.
