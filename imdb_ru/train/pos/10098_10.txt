Dominion Tank Police is without doubt one of the most amazing shows ever created, but not only in the field of animation. Although the first part (Acts 1 and 2) mainly consists of action and fun, the second part is more serious, and the second part should not be treated the same as the first part. The subtleties are really from this world, and the characteristic goes beyond brilliant. You must have an additional level of intelligence to appreciate the subtleties of the second part (Acts 3 and 4). I have some complaints though. In the first part, the Bonaparte tank literally jumps over the tank hull, and it made no sense at all. One could also doubt the credibility of Bonaparteâ€™s jump onto the wing of the helicopter, although it was cool. Buaku rules.
