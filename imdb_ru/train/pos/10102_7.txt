I have to start saying that it's been a long time since I saw it, but I saw it 5 or more times; a wonderful little noise that was clearly inspired by the musical / comedy mix of new or disappearing stars with famous musical groups. The secrets of Kay Kaiser would be a good example. <br /> <br /> It is best to show the show with Spike Jones, since he and his band play a lot of tunes and are part of the action, doing a good job of supporting. Hugh O'Brien plays the face, Buddy Hackett is rumored that Lutz Costello offered it, and thus Abbott and Costello replaced the leashes. I do not know if this was true. <br /> <br /> In general, it’s a nice movie, but it’s important that there are a lot of Spike Jones and his band in the film. It is a pity that it was not released, as I have not seen or heard about it now for two decades. Hope this is not lost
