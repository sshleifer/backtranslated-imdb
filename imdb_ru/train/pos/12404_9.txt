When I made this film, I lived Rawlins, and I was lucky to work on it. And as an extra and with Eddie Surkin on special effects. It was fun to watch all the work behind the scenes: from the animated barbed wire to the electric chair through the office warden. It was also very interesting to meet all the actors, from Viggo to Tini. In addition, the gate, which was embedded in the prison wall for the film, were and remain local residents of the Disney Gate. If someone is interested and has ever been to Rawlins, most of the film sets are still in place and can be seen on an independent tour. It was a lot of fun working with R. Harlin and with him, and wanted to be able to do it again.
