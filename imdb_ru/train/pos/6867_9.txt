I was born in 1982. Most of my childhood memories come from the end of the 80s and 90s. I first saw Groove Tube in 2001, when I was 19 years old. <br /> <br /> And it seemed fun to me. <br /> <br /> So anyone who thinks that something “outdated” may be 30 years later would be pretty funny. It's funny, even if you have no idea what the 70s looked like, and the thought of pants with buttons makes you cringe. Who can argue with a Bozo-type goat who reads adult literature? There is something to laugh at. A scam puppet show at the end is the best.
