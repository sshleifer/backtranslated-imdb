Shannon Lee, daughter of Bruce Lee, demonstrates the exciting martial arts in this exciting Hong Kong film and proves that, like her late brother Brandon, she is a real trick of the old block. You can find high-tech stunts in this fast film, and Bond filmmakers should look at them if they want to spice up the next 007 adventure, because there are many innovative things with some fresh and original work on the high content of the action "AND NOW YOU ARE DEAD". When you watch a movie with the same fast and interesting pace as this one, you start to wonder how the cinema itself managed to survive until the creation of the martial arts genre. I sincerely believe that films in general and action films in particular, simply noted the time before the first Kung Fu films debuted. Bruce Lee was the father of the modern militant, and his legitimate surviving offspring Shannon fails to bring his name here. Although there are some pleasant performances in this film (for example, Michel Wong), it is Shannon Lee, whom you will remember in earnest. Impressive performance in the role of Mandy, the highest rider. Damn, you can quit whistling her battles!
