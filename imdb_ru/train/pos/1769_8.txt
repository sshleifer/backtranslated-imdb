Just came out of a preview of this movie. It made me laugh every 30 seconds. The ending was so funny that tears rolled down my face, and I wanted me not to buy this big coke. There are definitely some lulls, but, on the whole, very interesting ones. The film gives Steve Carell a chance to prove himself after he drew the attention of Jim Carrey in the film Almighty Bruce and Will Ferrell Lead: Legend of Ron Burgendi in his films. Paul Rudd, as always, cheerful. I like that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas (such as PS). I think Seth Rogen should get more work because he is damn talented and attractive. Leslie Mann also had incredibly funny moments. I highly recommend this for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However, if you are easily offended, do not watch this movie. If you are a frantic feminist, do not watch this movie. And please, it doesn't matter that, even if you think that you are one of those “fashionable” parents, do not take your children into this film. Of course, you should let your teenagers go see this movie, just don’t watch it with them. That would make some incredibly awkward moments.
