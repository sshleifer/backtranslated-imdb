The film aims to influence the audience, and this film deprived me of speech. Superbly photographed and acting well with a dialogue that brings poetry closer, the film involves lust, hatred, murder, rape, theft and deception. It interweaves an intense web, which I could not take my eyes off the screen to the final credits. The history is swift. It takes the audience from the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War to human debris left behind. Roger Casamayor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who control the screen. Supporting players are superbly played out and give a real sense of authenticity. The sets, the lighting, the scenery and the cinematography are wonderful. I really love the photo.
