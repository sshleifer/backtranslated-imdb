"Party Girl" uses the great charm of Parker Posey. In fact, sometimes the film seems like a means in which Miss Posy is allowed to play herself, as usual in real life. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by Daisy Von Scherler Meyer, is a treat for Miss Posey fans. Mrs. von Scherler Mayer sends us on a wild journey to lower Manhattan to show us this aimless soul, whose life is devoted to entertainment in various clubs in which it always happens. This era was still more naive than the one that this region and the neighboring areas of the Meat Market have become. At least in the films there are no complaints, and we see people on earth who lead their lives in the usual way, if we can call it that. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey makes an amazing Mary. This is because of Parker Posey, we like the movie more than if another actress would have played Mary. She is a whole picture. The rest of the cast is good.
