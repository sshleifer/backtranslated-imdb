Those who love Elivra as much as I am in her duties as the hostess of the late evening will love this film - she is just awesome - her car is gorgeous, and she looks a bit like Transylvanian Dolly Parton - she is sometimes so innocent and naive - and sexy all the time - plus, more than Mae West's touch - <br /> <br /> The sets are also well made, and the comic cast is great, with Edie McClurg at her best - plus Sally Kellerman is like Patty fun. Every time I need something to eat, I will think about how Elvira crunches potato chips - <br /> <br /> You can watch this film again and again - just for fun. Now I have to get a sequel, Elvira's Haunted Hills, and see if it matches this ----
