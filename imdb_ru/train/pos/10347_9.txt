A delightful background film, juggling the comedy and detective genres of the novel and drama as quickly as Lieutenant Kenny Williams (Melvin Douglas) balances his devotion to his girl Maxine Carroll (Joan Blondel) and his duty to force as a first-class detective. <br /> <br /> This jumble may not please all viewers today, but at one time she had something to offer each member of the filmmaking family, and the resolution of a rather weary plot of “feeling against duty” is original. and refreshing, and worth the wait. <br /> <br /> “Amazing Mr. Williams” contains what should be among the most outrageous blind dates in the history of cinema, and its bright comic brightness.
