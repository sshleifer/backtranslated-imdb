Kate Beckinsale is excellent as a manipulative and yet irresistibly charming Emma in this television adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. When I read this novel, I sometimes doubted whether the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of this story: to be honest, she is so terribly complacent and cunning that you want to experience serious dislike for her. The interpretation of Kate Beckinsale, however, saves Emma from herself, so to speak: she is depicted with all her innocence and generosity of her character to the fullest, and one cannot help but give up and not love (not to mention love) her despite her less friendly qualities. Kate Beckinsale is the main, but not the only reason why this series is so amazing; Raymond Coulthard is ideally suited as Mr. Frank Churchill, expressing the personal magnetism of this character to the fullest extent (which is all the more noticeable because Evan McGregor did not cope well with his role in Emma's film adaptation in 1996), and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton , Bernard Hepton and Olivia Williams - all as they should be in their respective roles. In short, this production is a great achievement, and it can be viewed many times with increasing pleasure.
