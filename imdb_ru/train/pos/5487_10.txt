You have never seen anything like it. As soon as the coup begins, this is the most magnificent thriller you have ever seen, even if you know the result. And all this is real, because this documentary is awesome. <br /> <br /> By the time it was over, it was on my list of the top 10 movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to slobbering right-wing fanatics. Anyone I know who saw this movie will receive a 4-star rating. Even if you do not care about politics or Venezuelan politics, you will be nervous and - believe me - on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> This is a rollercoaster ride.
