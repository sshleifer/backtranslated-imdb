I liked this film, I remember, in this film there was one very well-made scene in which Riff Randall (played by PJ Soules) lies in his steaming bed saucepan, and then begins to realize that Ramones is in the room where she is sings the song "I want you to be there" ... a very, very cool thing. <br /> <br /> It was fun, energetic, unusual and cool. Yes, I admit that the final is not very successful, but it doesn’t matter, because it’s fun, it’s a very funny movie. This is sex, sweat and rock n 'rock forever. <br /> <br /> I read that Cheap Trick was a band that was originally supposed to play in this film. But I don't know if this is true or not.
