We are talking about a mad scientist who creates half a shark - half a human type of creature on an unknown island, then calls all his old business and academic friends to come and see his creation (evil laughter), but in fact he wants his shark killed them! This is followed by a lot of bad GCI, silly plot elements and children sweating in tight T-shirts. <br /> <br /> All these monster films follow a similar formula, but in this film everyone has a little humor (I guarantee that the people who did this have their tongues firmly planted on the cheek), not to mention the sexy babes. But let's mention these sexy babes - some hot babes in tight T-shirts, sweating profusely. One in her underwear at the beginning, the other at the end. Thank you, the creators of bad movies! The plot is full of nonsense, the guy sits on a jeep, slaps him right on the tree, and then invites everyone to fly away from the island by helicopter. Yes, well, how about thinking about it for a while; we will return to you. The funk is funny - either a terrible CGI, or the same comic guy in a rubber suit. A mad scientist does a pretty good job; he is angry, this is his motivation, he does not apologize. <br /> <br /> In general, if you want a silly, funny B-movie, this one has to do its job.
