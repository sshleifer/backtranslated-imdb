I saw this movie back in the 80s and I almost forgot it when I noticed that it was on TV again and watched it. I remembered that I liked this little sleeper when I first saw him, and I liked him even more during the second viewing. <br /> <br /> All the actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederick Forrest and Jason Presson (as a twelve-year-old boy who feels responsible for the accidental death of his older brother) are excellent. The film has a very genuine feeling - an understated, quiet, deeply moving story about a family suffering from grief. The dialogue is rare, but indicative, and the non-verbal action is outstanding. It seems like a simpler, village version of “Ordinary People” without a psychiatrist, but no less impressive family dynamics. <br /> <br /> A stone boy is worth it to spend time and emotional energy watching it.
