After watching the movie last night, I was left with a sense of hopelessness faced by organizations trying to solve the problem that the film portrays. The scale of prostitution seems so large that it is difficult to understand how it can be defeated without major government changes in Cambodia. <br /> <br /> In any case, after the review. <br /> <br /> Although it’s a dark movie with uncomfortable relationships in the center, it’s a very convincing movie, and I’d even say it was enjoyable. The film was well edited during the performance, and Tui Nguyen’s performance was excellent. I also felt that Ron Livingston played a very difficult role. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to understand a little why Patrick thinks that Holly should help, but perhaps the reason is simple, as he explains to Chris Penn's character. I will not explain it here - go watch a movie. <br /> <br /> This is a good, thought-provoking film with clearly good intentions. I hope he gets a wide enough release to reach a decent audience and get more support for the K-11 project.
