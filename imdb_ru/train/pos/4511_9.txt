I just released a DVD about this movie when I was on holiday in Norway, where it was released with English subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed and well played. The young man depicting the protagonist "Fritz" has a surprisingly open face, which with painful precision reflects the tragic events unfolding around him. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, we see that the father, whom Frits loves so much, has mental health problems, and this occurs when the cruel director denies attacking the boy and suggests that it was his own father. <br /> <br /> Climate scene in which Frits refuses to show any respect for the director; just standing still and repeating "Liar" when he is being brutally attacked in front of his classmates is a scene that you can hardly forget. <br /> <br /> The only weak point in the films is the rather ordinary Flower Power. a teacher who uses every trick of "friendly teacher" in the book. In addition, I am sure that you will really like this film.
