This film, recently recognized as a favorite by the audience at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005, is inspiring and exciting. The famous conductor, forced to resign due to illness, returns to the small village where he was born to become the leader of the church choir, and finally to find a performance in his music. Based on the Swedish traits of holding things inside of oneself and the insular nature of a small Swedish village, this film develops well each of its characters. Superbly directed, acting and sung, he caused tears in many eyes and smiled at everyone. Hopefully he will find distribution in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you can, look!
