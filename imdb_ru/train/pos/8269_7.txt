For some time I was intrigued by this film, partly because of the extremely high IMDb score - the average score of 9.0 with more than 300 votes gives it the highest rating among all the silent films available! How have I not heard of this movie before this site? Well, you can't always trust ratings. In fact, this is a very good film, well-preserved, if the excellent VHS program I rented is some kind of indicator - great game directors, especially William Haynes as Brown, and excellent work in Cambridge with some shots at Harvard / Yale screening a football match - but this story must have seemed chestnut even in 1926. Disgusting, selfish and charismatic guy goes to school and gets in his place, becoming at the same time a caring, selfless friend; I doubt that people in 1926 found a lot of really exciting things on the last few reels, the predictability factor is high. Nevertheless, everything starts very well, and certainly deserves to be remembered, if not praised to the skies. Maybe the previous 350 voters are mostly Harvard men ... <br /> <br /> EDIT Now there are more than 600 voters, and the score has actually risen to 9.2! Seriously guys, ballot stuffing is happening here - I can't explain to anyone why this film is better than Metropolis or General!
