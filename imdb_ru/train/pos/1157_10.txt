This is one of the best comedies! Writing this parody of soap is brilliant and catchy, well, just look at the names of the throw, and you will understand why it is so great. If you're a Kevin Kline fan, he makes (as always) a fantastic performance, and Robert Downey Jr. is perfect. If you are not laughing while watching this movie, you do not have a sense of humor.
