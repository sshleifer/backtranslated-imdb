Generally it was a good movie with a perfect ending; the action was breathtaking, and the characters did not deviate from their faces. I especially liked the plot, although you knew what was going to happen, it still gave an element of surprise throughout the film. However, I believe that until the end it could have been a little longer (perhaps extended) - it seemed to me that it was a bit hastily; as if the writer was trying to remove the bedding from the line before it started to rain. For example, what happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? As far as we know, he died in the hospital. Maybe he was the one who set it all up ?! Who knows! Maybe there will be a sequel? May be? If there is .. I can not wait to see it.
