At first glance, this film is a film about children, which parents can regret to watch along with their mostly entertained young children. The film seems and is mainly focused on children, but does not stop at this level. At first I watched this film when I was a small child, and I found it funny, interesting and heartbreaking and did not see him again for several years. I recently watched it again at the age of 18 and found it to be almost as fun, but also soulful and fascinating. This film is greatly undervalued and contains many reports about real life. This film is an inspiring quest story created for children, but epic in itself. I recommend this movie to any person of any age.
