I already loved "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" when it was released, and I still love it now, 5 years later. However, many people seem to disagree with my opinion, and this film never received much love at the time when it came out. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is excessive and fanciful, but this is for This is the same reason that this film is so charming and fun to watch. All the scenery, costumes and characters are made absolutely amazing, fascinating, and never become a real joke. This is a visually effective movie to watch. This is a very cool movie! Director Ron Howard really surprises with this funny little Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The main reason why the film works and why it is so interesting to watch is Jim Carrey as Grinch. He really carries the film with his good and funny role. He, of course, helps convincing makeup, which also won an Oscar. Of course, if you hate Jim Carrey, you should not even think about watching this movie. This film is really his film, and it makes it all work and it's so fun to watch. Other fun and memorable roles are played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch. <br /> <br /> The film has a good morale, but it’s still a little silly for me. Perhaps this is because I am Dutch, and we really do not celebrate Christmas as big and enthusiastic as in the United States or England. For me, the film was just fun and exciting, and the moral just left me pretty cold, to be honest. <br /> <br /> James Horner’s musical score is good and fun, even if it’s usual for Horner, it still works fine for the film and helps to make some of the scenes in the scene. <br /> <br /> Perfect New Year's Eve entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
