If you have at least some clue about the staging of Jane Austen, now you are repeating the same thing in each of your novels: marriage, marriage, and marriage! In my opinion, all the films made from her novels are a bit boring, but I like the characters in Austin, because they all have a certain personality and typical statements that they like to repeat, as in Emma. What makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she is very good in her lead role. In addition, the fact that each of the filmâ€™s characters seems to be thinking about nothing but finding a good partner and getting married soon makes the movie fun.
