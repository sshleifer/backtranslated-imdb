This is far, my favorite movie in the world !!!!! I enjoyed it when I was 4 years old and I still enjoy it at 16 !! This is an absolute masterpiece! No video collection can do without it !!! I enjoy every second, and the film not only has special affects, but also sends a wonderful message to young viewers, which may seem strange, but in fact the film is actually very cool! Although Michael Jackson starred in several films, people still do not see him as an actor. In fact, he is the most talented actor I know! He is so talented! He is incredible !!! MOONWALKER MUST SEE !!!!!!
