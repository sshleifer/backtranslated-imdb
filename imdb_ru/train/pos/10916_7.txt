The comic banter between William Powell and Gene Arthur is the highlight of this murder puzzle, which has one of the strangest and most incredible scenes in history. Powell is probably the most courteous detective of the 1930s, and Arthur has a unique voice, which often sounds like a series of tiny jingle bells. They are very fun to watch, so take a bold story with a crumb of salt and just enjoy its unfolding. Eric Bloor also has several comic twists in the role of the butler Powell. <br /> <br /> Powellâ€™s contract with MGM included a clause that allowed him to refuse another studio loan, but he wanted to work with Arthur again, and he liked the script, so he readily accepted the appointment. They worked together in two Paramount films of 1929, The Case of the Killing of Canaries and The Case of the Green's Killing, both in the Philo Vance series.
