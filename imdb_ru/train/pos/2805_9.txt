Wow, I can't believe I waited so long to watch this movie. I just did not bother to look. The plot has nothing that interests me. I do not know anything about football (soccer). I am one of those American fools who have no clue. I have never seen David Beckham before this movie. I decided to ignore the hype around this film during its release in America. Enough about me. <br /> <br /> In truth, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of film paradise. What a funny movie. It is full of color and plenty. Throughout the movie I had a silly smile on my face. Parminder Nagra is so cute and sweet that you can't help but cheer for her. No wonder why the American TV show E.R. grabbed her. I have a new appreciation of Indian culture. These people know how to have a good time. Wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem I encountered was deciphering British slang and dialogue through accents. I turned on the English subtitles to make sure I didn't miss anything. (This is not a criticism of the film!) Iâ€™m sure that viewers around the world have trouble understanding the ever-changing slang in American films. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect date. He has a great sports story, such as Rocky, and a strong sense of feminism that expands the capabilities of women. I watched it with my wife and sixteen-year-old niece, and we all loved it. I highly recommend it.
