I was having fun watching this movie, mainly due to Simon Pegg, who quickly became an excellent box office for comedy films. <br /> <br /> He was hired from a dead-end job in London as a dead-end media specialist from New York, Jeff Bridges, as a writer, for one of his celebrities. <br /> <br /> After paying his fees, he ends up in the highest echelons of a celebrity writing hudd (the “seventh room”), where he gets to be a minor celebrity himself. The storyline is very funny, and Gillian Anderson plays the impressive role of an auxiliary advertising agent. <br /> <br /> On the way to success, he finds the true meaning of love, and so on. <br /> <Aside from the formal plot, the film was very funny, mainly due to Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was good as a love interest. The rest of the actors played their part well. <br /> <br /> It was a good comedy worth seeing in movie theaters.
