There is no way to stand up to Zabriskie Point from a rational point of view, or to try to describe it using words and conventions that you would use for other films. This is because it is not a movie. This idea and the feeling that the filmmakers somehow turned into an object, just as ordinary as a movie. What we see is not a plot unfolding, but a sequence of events that we don’t see in films every day, but we only imagine what happens as a background that we ourselves will provide when we find out about some tragic event in the news or from friends. We see that this is our imagination of people who are an abstraction for us — we do not know anyone, but we have undoubtedly heard of them in a book, on TV, or somewhere else. So what do we see? Developments. We see people arguing, driving and inevitably running away. Only salvation from something intangible is a collective situation and cruelty, which allowed the mass of civilization to exist through laziness or ... human nature. Recruited in the late 1960s in Los Angeles, our players act against and in response to the self-suffering of a modern existence. These creatures are actually blank sheets that can display any feature we can imagine if we want. Although actions taken may be considered criminal or irresponsible, the characters themselves are not criminals. These are people seeking to return to their usual, unprocessed existence, which goes beyond the ordinary that they encounter every day. Not that they were ever happy or sad, but they achieve a kind of self-realization when they go beyond the limits of suicide in modern life and from it. They attain true life only in the natural world, although this is yet another victim of modern existence. In the end, Zabriski Point is a praise of the humanities' attachment to the natural world. Since even the most desolate parts of the earth give in to our ideas of progress, we lose our souls on the way to the death of the human spirit.
