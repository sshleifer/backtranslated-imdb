My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Compared to today's brainless film (just an action movie and a special effect and nothing new about ideas), Soilent Green is asking for something that no longer exists today: Think. <br /> <br /> Well, it will not be a big surprise on the day when people eat "cookies" that are created by the human body. With everything that happens on this planet, and to see how people are so indifferent to everyone, such a future is possible. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film will take some time, but the idea behind the film is relevant again. Rich in heaven, another in hell. Well, today we are lucky that this is television and idiocy, such as “Reality show”. <br /> <br /> TV is a good mental mind. It is a pity that human intelligence is not progressing like technology. With writing, let's stop. <br /> <br /> If you like reality shows, then this film is not for you. If you believe all politicians are the same. If you don’t like to ask yourself a question about the present and the future, never watch this movie.
