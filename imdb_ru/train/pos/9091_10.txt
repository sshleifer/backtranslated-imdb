Fabulous film. With everything you could want in a movie. Huge battle scenes and many other actions. Suspension and romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Something like an old movie scam. Fully entertaining from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Editing was fast and you wonâ€™t be bored for a second. The story is similar to the classic story of trouble in the royal court. The actors are beautiful and the scenery is great. The costumes are spectacular, and the tricks are creative. The special effects are also awesome. <br /> <br /> Gary Stretch is really impressive as an actor and gorgeous in appearance. It looks like a sure bet for Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Rhys-Davies is wonderful, as usual. He is one of the greatest actors of our time. <br /> <br /> Cindy Burbridge, the former Miss Thailand, is great for a leading lady, even with an English accent, with remarkable success. <br /> <br /> I learned that the film won many awards, and I understand why. <br /> <br /> Overall this is an amazing film Independent. Look for sure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this. And give him TEN + !!!
