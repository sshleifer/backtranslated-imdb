I just watched the movie, I was afraid that he would disappoint me. I was quite surprised at the end, though. American pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise films of all time. Yes, it will not be true if I say that I liked it the same way as the original one. Beta House along with the two previous cakes definitely lost what the first two cakes had. It will not become a classic, as the first two have already done. but damn, it's still funny with a lot of good moments, and I think it should be the first movie you choose if you want to have fun and relax after a hard dayâ€™s work or study. Beta House deserves 6/10, but I gave him 7/10 just for being another piece of cake.
