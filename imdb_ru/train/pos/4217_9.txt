It is always nice when a detective finishes a case and the criminal is brought to justice. In this case, the climax gives me even more pleasure. Seeing a smug smile wiped off Abigail Mitchell's face when she realizes that her victim left “testimony on her deathbed,” which leaves no doubt about her fault, is very nice. <br /> <br /> Please understand: while I admire Ruth Gordon's performance, her character really * really * annoys me. She is selfish and demanding. She gets her way by performing the simpler “little girl” action that confuses a woman of her age. Worse, she now declared herself a judge, jury and executioner against her dead niece's husband. <br /> <br /> When Colombo gets too close, she tries to unnerve him by manipulating him to make a cuff from a cuff before an audience of high-class ladies. He perfectly turns the tables, giving a very warm and humane speech about the realities of police work. <br /> <br /> Nothing can distract Colombo from the pursuit of justice. Abby's last appeal to his good character is rejected because he respects himself too much to not do his job well. Here is one situation you cannot extract from Mrs. Mitchell!
