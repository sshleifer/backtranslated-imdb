people claim that it is edited funny, but they had to significantly reduce it in post-production. I have Harry as a professor right now in ucsd, and, frankly, this is one of my best lessons, it's quite funny to talk about what happened in the making of the film because Harry is so animated. I initially watched "the joy of life" for another class where Harry voiced the film and started watching this film after he started the lesson. Initially, Harry did some work on the performance, and he is really sincere in creating moments that excite you, especially when you have to re-edit things until the moment comes, but this is what you see in this movie.
