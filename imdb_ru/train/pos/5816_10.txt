When I first saw this “movie”, I liked it. When I was 11 years old, I was more interested in music and dancing. When I got older, I became more interested in acting. While the first half is just a retrospective of Michael’s career (from Jackson 5 to The Bad), it was still fun to watch. The "Badder" sequence could be omitted, although the children were pretty good. “Speed ​​Demon” and “Leave Me Alone” were funny, especially when the policeman told Michael: “I need your autograph right here,” after he stopped him for dancing in the no-dance zone. But this is the “Smooth Criminal” that is icing on the cake. Joe Sands was great as a cool guy (and that hair was wild). Dancing is beautiful, as are special effects. The only thing I could do without was spiders. Any Michael fan should see this if you have not done so already. I give it 10+!
