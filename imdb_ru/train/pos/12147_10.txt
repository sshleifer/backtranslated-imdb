“Return to the 3rd Camera” is a comedy sequel to the epic “36th Shaolin Camera”, in which Gordon Liu played Shan Te, a young man who became a monk and an amazing fighter. In this sequel, Liu plays an unfortunate loser who has to learn kung-fu after beating his friends. He imitates the original Shang Te, tries all sorts of tricks to get to Shaolin Temple to learn, and ultimately gains some unique skills to fight some hooligan bosses. This is a classic frivolous story about martial arts, with the production values ​​of the Shaw brothers and the confident direction of Louis Chia Liang. The choreography is fantastic everywhere, whether it be a combat or comedy drama or a performance by Gordon Liu, like everyone else, especially a sympathetic monk, perfect for the material. The film is less epic or deep than some other works of the stars, and, of course, there are more grandiose, more brutal and exciting films of The Brothers Show. But few have such a magical blend of farce, unique workouts and struggles, with a subtle but warm tale of a worthless guy who does good. Full of bright hearted joy, it is impossible not to give it the highest score.
