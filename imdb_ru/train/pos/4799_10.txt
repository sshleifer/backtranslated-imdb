Perhaps more than many films, this one is not for everyone. For some people, the idea of ​​slowing down, reflecting and letting things happen at one time is a good description of their personal hell. For others, this approach speaks of some deep part of themselves, which, as they know, exists, of that part with which they crave contact. <br /> <br /> I believe that this is a function of where I am in my life these days, but I consider myself in the camp of the last group. I found the meditative pace of this film almost hypnotic, gently guiding me to some kind of realm, almost mythological. This is truly a travel story, a rich image of the distance that many of us have to go through if we want us to go full circle at the end of our days. <br /> <br /> As it is written in Mr. Farnsworth's submission about Alvin Straight, although I am not sure that there are words to express the exquisite balance of dazed sadness and wise innocence that he conjured for us. Knowing now that he really came to terms with his own mortality, when he was sitting on this tractor seat, I want to be able to spend time with him before his departure. I hope that he had a small glimpse of satisfaction and truth that he brought to so many people, not only for “action”, but also to share his absolute humanity with such cruel honesty. <br /> <br /> Considering the realities of production In the economy, I’m not sure that Mr. Lynch was fully given the due courage he showed that history was developing so slowly. Proponent of filmmaking, I nevertheless understand that in modern life there are several areas where the expression “time is money” is so accurately descriptive. Deep penetration into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed, and, to his credit, Mr. Lynch seems to have realized that he is not just telling a story - he invites his viewers to spend some time with their own mortality. This is not an easy task. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the power of a movie to introduce you to some precious part of yourself, you could do worse than spend a couple of hours with Direct Story. And then give yourself time for the next, just by listening to its echo in the little hours of the night.
