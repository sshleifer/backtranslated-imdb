Over the decades, many Zorro films have been made, but it is a pity that one of the best is probably one of the least seen. <br /> <br /> The Battle Legion of Zorro is a bit different from other Zorro films. First, this is a republican series of 12 chapters. And this time, Zorro does not play the best studio star, like Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas, but the actor like a worker, Reed Hadley. While Hadley does not have such a strong influence on the process as others, he does adequate work, aided by the fact that he is not the only hero here; as the name suggests, he has a fighting legion that can be addressed. <br /> <br /> Another big difference is that the setting is not California. The story takes place in central Mexico in 1824, when a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous Indian population and a group of criminals to help him in his plan to overthrow the newly created Mexican Republic. Something, Zorro, and a few followers are planning to do everything possible to stop. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, in every episode there is at least one incredibly hilarious moment, from the banal "double" bow sound effects for a ridiculous action. But overall, this is one of the best Republican TV shows of all time, and probably the best Zorro. <br /> <br /> The plot is stronger than most TV shows and never becomes incomprehensible or tortuous. action - fans of Indiana Jones films will notice MANY bits borrowed from this series.
