This is my second time for a perfect spy. I watched it 2 or 3 years ago and I liked it. I still like it. It is quite natural that it is compared with another big TV series Le Carre, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Tinker Tailor focuses on the "game" of spies; The Perfect Spy gives us another axis - what kind of a spy is this man. There are a number of topics that these films share, along with others in the genre. <br /> <br /> Ambiguity - moral, sexual, interpersonal - that creates a multidimensional space between truth and falsehood, inside and out, love versus responsibility. In a sense, these characters are most happy when they are treated the most frayed by those whom they love and respect - “stabbed in the back” in various nuances. <br /> <br /> The theme of fathers and father figures is also important. , One of the most intriguing characters of the "Perfect Spy" is Rick, the main character of Magnus, possibly the father of ersatz. Throughout history, he betrays and surrenders. The fraudster, who always manages to climb up the stairs when he is overthrown, who seems insensitive to what others think of him, asks Magnus every time they meet: “Do you love your old man?” And never: “Do you love me? " Perhaps it says somewhere else, but “The Perfect Spy” is a love story. <br /> <br /> Another topic is a malignant tumor. The essence of business is to encourage others - to set them up against their government, against their friends and like-minded people, against their values ​​and beliefs. In each of the Le Carre films that I saw, “The Spy Who Came from the Cold,” “The Looking Glass, War,” “The Spy Tailor Tailor Soldier,” “The Smiley People,” and “The Perfect Spy,” turning and turning is the basis tragedy. <br /> <br /> Finally, not so much a theme as an artistic touch - in each of these films there is usually only one pistol shot, or perhaps two shots that reinforce the plot. Violence, torture, cruelty is always just below the surface. We see their results not in the form of blood flows or damp prison cells, but in those objects to which the characters of Le Carré cling, as they are inevitably sucked into the swamp. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movies above, and you enjoy the perfect spy, a treat awaits you. I would also recommend the series Sandbagger (Yorkshire TV), the 2nd and 3rd seasons of which begin to reach the level of complexity of this kind. The IPCRESS file and funeral in Berlin are good, although they are easy. For political intrigue, try a very British coup, House of Cards and Yes, Minister / Yes, Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If only the Briton had a hand in creating the Three Kingdoms, there would be a film with intrigue and complexity.
