We so often talk about cinema sights - Kane, The Godfather, Booth de Soufflé. However, one film is too often ignored by “serious” film critics. Of course, I'm talking about the classic Doc Savage (M.o.B.) <br /> <br /> This film is not only exciting, but also seriously explores the problem of exploitation of developing countries by US imperialism. Not to mention Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> He also had the greatest soundtrack in cinema history (before, of course, Queen’s exciting work on Flash Gordon). Although this film is a rarity, this film is worth a search - it will pay for your searches ten times.
