This oddity from Roman Polanski clearly shows where his concern lay at the time when he did it. Polanski himself plays a timid man who rents a Paris apartment, where the previous tenant committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with the discovery that led her to this, to such an extent that he dresses in dredges and reproduces events as they could unfold. The film is disturbing to a certain extent, and there is an atmosphere of terrible fear in which Polanski succeeds, but it is too much like the interweaving of Rosemary Baby and Disgust, two other best Polanski films that deal with terrible events in gloomy apartments. <br /> <br /> But as for concern .... if I don’t read too much in the film, I have to believe that it was Polanca’s reaction to the feelings of persecution that he experienced in being tagged by a sexual pervert and expelled from America . I myself can not judge him anyway, but it is difficult to deny the evidence of this in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
