Like the Arabian Nights, this film plays with the conventions of storytelling to make us feel that there is a plot, a plot and another plot: it starts with what seems like a frame device for a blind man telling the story of his life, then plunges into Remembrance which takes us straight to the gift of the blind, where we discover that about half of the story is still to come. (It must be admitted that the second half does not fully correspond to the promises of the first.) Like the Arabian Nights, it tries to squeeze as much as possible of the Middle Eastern folk motifs into one work. A liberated genie, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea travel, a crowded market, an evil vizier, jewels ... I do not know why it all works, but it works. Everything is just fine. The sets are beautiful. Jun Duprez is beautiful. Rossa's score is especially beautiful. As usual, the Hungarian sounds; but somehow he manages to convince us that he is Hungarian in Persian.
