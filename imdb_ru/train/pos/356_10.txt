It turned out that it was a cool production with a low budget. The variety of characters is amazing, from gnomes with an ax to 7 foot ghouls! I enjoyed the relationship between the leaders, not too sentimental, but romantic enough to hold interest. I also enjoyed the combination of humor (which can be very easy to make a mistake, too much / not enough), which meant that it did not become too dark or too fake. It was a big step forward compared to the other efforts of Yvs, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of plot and production. They have a great site worth checking out. Can't wait for Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it must be fantastic.
