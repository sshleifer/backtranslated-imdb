Richard Brooks’s excellent 1967 film about Truman Capote’s novel “IN COLD BLOOD” is the perfect addition to Oscar Philip Seymour Hoffman’s 2005 victory in Capote. They play really well together (try them on different nights). It is unusual to find films made with a difference of 38 years, which are so well combined. These two really reinforce each other. Despite the fact that different actors play the role of the murderers of Perry Smith and Dick Hickok, these two parts go well together. Only the role of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in Brooks films is weaker, because they give him a different name than Capote. I would advise first to see CAPOTE, and then IN COLD BLOOD. It makes for a powerful experience!
