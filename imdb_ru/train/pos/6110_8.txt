Like My Cheeky Girl, this film is based on a true story published on the Internet, but this is where the similarities end. As a rule, the story of this rebellious guy named Ji-Hun (Kwon Sang Vu), who is still trying to finish high school, whose parents hire a tutor named Soo-Wan (Kim Ha Nol), a woman who comes from a poor family, but it is the same age as he. Add to this some obstacles, martial arts (gangsters always pursue Ji-Hong for revenge), a despicable, gangster love girl who stalks him, his penchant for giving up lessons, and you can usually guess the whole story. Did I mention this is a romantic comedy? There are some good battle scenes in this film, great visual humor and a lot of sperm thanks to good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Wu, which bring a lot of energy into the story. Romantic elements also work for this reason. And, I must say, I would like the girl to be more like Kim Ha Nuel, than the girl from the “Sassy Girl” (at least personally). She has a little sperm, but this is more on the sweet, sweet, kindhearted way. Most of the characters are already pretty (so we can say that he had less lift than in “My cheeky girl” - an obstacle that worked for this film in his favor), and the film is quite clever and interesting in most cases. The story seems to sag about 2/3 of the way (where it goes according to the usual standard fare, where nothing really interesting happens), but closer to the end it starts to gain momentum again. In general, a funny, cute movie. 8/10
