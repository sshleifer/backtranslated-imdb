A realistic image of a young love for a college film set, but also attractive to an older viewer like me. He had ups and downs, turns and a reason for me to shed a tear or two. We rarely see films with black urban characters that may appeal to older, not black audiences and show a more realistic image of young black adults. <br /> <br /> This film takes place on a campus and a city where two people live. meet and fall in love. In the background are various familiar friends and situations that affect them for better or for worse. Some may say a typical plot, but it was really unexpected. <br /> <br /> I discovered that I am a fan of survival in the relationship of a couple, seeing my past in their stories. Moments of deep thought and revelation came from the speeches of the actors. <br /> <br /> This is a bright film that I would recommend to those who are young at heart and in love or have ever been in love. A great movie. I will look for a copy to add to my movie collection.
