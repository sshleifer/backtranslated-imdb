Steve Carell begins playing his lead role in "The 40 Year Old Virgin", with only minor roles in films such as Enchanted, Bruce Almighty, Lead, and his work on the Daily Show. comedy that Carell really shoots. You may say that Will Ferrell influenced his "comedic air", but Carell lifts him to another level, everything he does is innocent, attractive and fun. I will not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time. <br /> <br /> A 40-year-old Virgo is two hours of continuous laughter (or 4 hours if you see it twice). like me), the great cast and great roles captivate the audience throughout the film. The script was perfect with so many wonderful lines that you want to watch the movie again to try to remember them all. The music fits perfectly with the tone of the film, and you can tell that the director knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Filled with sexual jokes, nude and many languages, this film is not for everyone, but if you liked Wedding Crashers, the presenter or any other film in this spirit, you will definitely like The 40 Year Old Virgin.
