This is one of the best films about the criminal drama of the late 1990s. He was filled with a great cast, a powerful storyline, and many of the players involved gave excellent performances. Pacino was great; he had to be assigned to something. John Cusack was also good as long as the viewer did not pay attention to his focus on luuu-siana. It may seem annoying if you do not endure this dialect. The way Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was sometimes believable, dramatic, and a bit comical. Danny Aiello was great as ever. David Paymer was great in supporting roles. Bridget Fonda was good, but not memorable. There were times when this picture mentioned so many characters, perhaps too many. To recall, you may need a second viewing: “What was Zapatti like?” After so many cross-references, you need to stop and think to simply repeat. The ending is not much sting. It was built for so long, and then was a little disappointed. It was one of the few problems with the film. Since the film was not presented as “huge, blockbuster,” the big screen hit made some forget that this film existed at all. Pacino and Aiello were great, but the lack of a movie “splash” in cinemas may not have explained any nominations. In the home market, he was semi-successful, and viewers still learn that this name exists. Made in 1996, it still stands and will remain popular for many years. <br /> <br /> So make a lemon pudding (see) and watch this movie!
