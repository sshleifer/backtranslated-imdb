This film begins with a touch of Brazil ... when, at some point, the story moves straight into the twilight zone ... nothing new, but nothing ... nothing fun! When Dave and Andrew start exploring their new medium, the film becomes really enjoyable ... bouncing their heads? well ... yes ;-) <br /> <br /> anyway ... this film was, imho, the biggest surprise at this year's FantasyFilmFest ... <br /> <br /> Like in Cube and Cypher Natalie gave this minimalist, strange, but special design that makes it difficult to find the place of history or its time ... somehow out of time ...
