The outrageous period created in the 1930s is a rotation of the classic Cliffhanger series, as well as The Raiders of the Lost Ark, only made from a small budget and much more kindly by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes are circling in the liberal Gothic nouveau style, having been ahead of Batman by two decades. Starring Ron Ely (Tarzan) in the role of a magnificent hero and the magnificent Pamela Hensley in the role of a local Latin Mona, who plays our hero in search of gold in the non-existent Latin American country of Hidalgo. The best line, our hero Monet, pressing his fist to her chin just as you expect him to be gently with her and hug her: “Mona, you're a brick!” <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler Captain Seas is blackhat with ham and cheese is an absolute delight. Expect a bit of "Raiders ...", a dash of "Batman", a bit of "Lost World", a bit of "Lost Horizons" and a lot of courtesy, and you will understand everything correctly. Beware of cult favorite Michael Berryman as an undertaker and enjoy the careful use of John Philip Souza's patriotic music. The main candidate for the DVD release is, of course, time. You can not miss the fun for the whole family. 9/10
