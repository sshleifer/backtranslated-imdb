"The Ladies Man" suffers from a widespread problem among films based on the "Saturday Night Live" scenes. In other words, a sketch that is usually done in five minutes will not be so good in ninety minutes. Although this film has its own laugh, like Tim Meadows in the role of Leon Phelps, a sex maniac straight from the 70s, and Will Ferrell in the role of a struggling obsessive husband who has sinned in Leon. So this movie is quite funny, but this is not “Wayne's World”!
