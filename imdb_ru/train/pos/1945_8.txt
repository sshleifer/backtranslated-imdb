This final episode of Voyager begins in 23 years. Voyager returned home. For the many years it took to return, the mind of the Vulcan Tuvoki was destroyed. He had a disease that they returned home too late to cure. <br /> <br /> Captain Janeway meets aliens who have time travel technology. She understands that there is a Warp Pipeline in the Delta Quadrant that could immediately bring Voyager home — if she could go back in time and notify Voyager. There is one problem. The pipeline is located deep inside the Borg Space. <br /> <br /> Jenway attends Tuvok. He is like a child. He writes, is obsessed, works on math problems, film reviews or something else, he is convinced that they are important. In the institution, Tuvok is crying, asking for "Janeway" to please, please return to him. <br /> <br /> Janeway decides to command the federation shuttle and arm it with weapons technology 20 years before Borg, hopes to go back in time and use this new technology to send Voyager to Warp Conduit. <br /> <br /> When she returns to the past and contacts Voyager, Janeway meets her youth. Two captains disagree, arguing about the plan. The real captain visits Tuvok, asking him if it’s true that he has a brain disorder. Tuvok acknowledges that this is true, but he cannot be cured by the means on the ship, so he keeps it with him. <br /> <br /> The young captain agrees with the plan of the senior captains. To increase their chances of success, the elder Jenway plans to divert the Borg with her shuttle ship. Borg actually captured Jenway and her shuttle. Queen Borg personally assimilates Captain Jenway. But Janeway expected this! Queen Borg assimilated the virus that killed her. With the dead Queen Borg, Voyager passes through the Warp Channel back into the federal space.
