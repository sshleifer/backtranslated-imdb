Perfect space fantasy film. a group of children accidentally rises into space and is forced to retreat, but do they for sure It would not be a family film if they all died. Then everything will be sad. You do not want Kate Capso, the leading lady, to give a Golden Globe performance, but, unfortunately, neither she nor Leah Thompson won. This sucks so bad. I can't say this enough, this film is so wonderful, Lea Thompson Lord, the perfect girl for this film. This film is the best for sure. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but better than in Star Wars. Star Wars are so overpriced, and the space camp is so undervalued. It should have been the other way around. <br /> <br /> excellent 10/10 - 0p, maybe 11/10. I'm not very good at math
