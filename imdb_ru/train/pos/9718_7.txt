POSSIBLE SPOILER - In a way, “how to alienate friends ...” is “the loser learns to adapt, becomes successful and learns that something else is more important,” talking about celebrities. - THE END OF A SPOILER <br /> <br /> I don’t know the original book, but this comedy gives some good moments. Although I think the ending is wrong. It was too fast and too harsh, as if something was missing. In addition, I would say that the film cannot maintain a high level. In addition, you will find a fine selection of actors and actresses with sometimes controversial acting qualities. Until now, I have never seen Pegg otherwise. However, it is a very unique type, although on the screen it can sometimes seem a bit more tedious than necessary. Fox has proven that she is capable of playing a hot star with her head in the clouds. I don’t know if it was difficult to do, but her performance was hot and much better than during Transformers (well ... maybe this is not a difficult match). Kirsten Dunst is very similar to Kirsten Dunst (again), and you might like it (like me) or it annoys you. On the other hand, you will see Anderson, who proved her acting, and Jeff Bridges (he is fine, but perhaps he could have acted a little more powerful). They all fit well enough in their character. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think this is a good comedy with celebrities, with some more or less funny excerpts, a sweet cast, but a very unexpected ending.
