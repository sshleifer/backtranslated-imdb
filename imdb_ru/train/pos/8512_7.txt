I can tell you how bad this film is. I was in the film and I have not seen it yet, but I cringe at the thought that someone is paying to see me drunk. Especially considering what we did this year. The fact is that they probably overdid it. Especially in the scene where my roommate sniffed the coke chest of a Mexican prostitute (they probably should have followed him). We came and went several times, but other than that I can't remember anything. I was MC in several scenes (from what I was told. I can tell you that everyone avoided the film crew because they want to be remembered as the guy who vomited or the girl who showed her boobs to the world which lost its virginity.) In general, the trip itself was crazy, but people behave differently when the camera is on them.
