I watched this film a second time to try to figure out why it wasn’t as successful (commercially or artistically) as it should have been, and I discovered significant artistic merit - which, perhaps, ultimately led to its commercial destruction. /> <br /> First, in this film an attempt is made to "serious" science fiction, social commentary, rather than action-adventure. There is action in this, but that is not the point. If you focus on this, you will get (as others have noted) a bad clone of "Aliens." But, again, that's not the point. <br /> <br /> The film is actually about the transformation of Todd (Kurt Russell) from person to almost car and back to person (mostly * back *). But since he is not trying to give you a typical Hollywood response in Hollywood style, Kurt Russell should do this transformation without saying a word, and mostly without broad expressions. And he really does a wonderful job — two views may be required to evaluate it. <br /> <br /> The surrounding “social logic” is imperfect, and it can never adequately explain whether Todd is able to withstand the opposing army. supposedly superior troops come from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound human essence or something else, but the film still makes an amazing showcase for Russell's talent (it is easy to underestimate).
