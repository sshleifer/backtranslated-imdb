I lost count of how many times I saw this film - I probably know the whole dialogue back to front - and yet I am drawn to it again and again. <br /> <br /> While in Hungary, young Jimmy Stewart plays a decent bachelor "Kralik", who becomes a secret admirer of the innocent "Klara" Margaret Sullavan. Kralik secretly becomes Clara's pen-pal and, during collaboration, Klara tells Kralik about the contents of his (Kralik's) letters. Obviously, Kralik is crazy about Klara - but not able to talk about his feelings while he is competing with his “pen pal." Embarrassed? Well, you will not be - this story has a sweet, almost sweet end - but we all know that this is the end we all want. <br /> <br /> Other characters worth mentioning are Frank Morgan, who plays his usual role, this time as the owner of the store “Hugo Matushek”, Felix Bressart as Pirovich, Krralik’s confidant. Joseph Shildkraut as an arrogant wandering "Wadas" - so well played that from the very beginning it is impossible not to hate him. <br /> <br /> Finally, William Tracy, who manages to please all of us with his overly confident upstart junior store “Pepi Cato”. <br /> <br /> The recently renamed “You Got Mail” with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan is not as good for me as the original - although I suspect that younger viewers I would not agree. <br /> <br /> If this film is in your area for Christmas, I suggest you pour yourself a glass of good wine, put a log on the fire and have a box with Kleenex on hand.
