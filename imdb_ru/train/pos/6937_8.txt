This exciting West spins the story of the famous rifle of the early West, which everyone, without exception, longed for James Stewart is a cowboy who won a valuable Winchester in a shootout, but lost him in a robbery. The story tells how Stuart pursued a rifle and one man in the film. The gun changes hands from time to time, as if the owner is destined to lose it due to violence. The picture has a lot of action and expectations as Stewart approaches his career. The great cast here supports Stewart, namely Stephen McNally, Dana Dourier, Millard Mitchell, John McIntyre and Jay S. Flippen, Shelley Winters, seems to be wrong here, and the purpose of her role is rather unclear. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, teenage smoothies in later years, play short but good roles.
