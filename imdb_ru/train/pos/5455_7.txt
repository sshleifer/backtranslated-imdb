The notorious pre-code film, really the film that made people insist on strict adherence to the Hays Code. Barbara Stanwick plays a young girl whose father who sells liquor has no problems with customers. When he dies in an accident, she is released into the world with the knowledge that her body can get everything she wants. She goes to New York and climbs the corporate ladder, one bed at a time. Although it is obvious that no real sex is shown, the film is quite sloppy. Unfortunately, after the initial value of the shock disappears (around the time that Stanvik drives the railroad car inspector so that she can travel for free), the film becomes a bit repetitive and boring. She herself is the only thing that holds the film worth considering. As always, she is fantastic.
