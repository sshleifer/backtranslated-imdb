Tarzan and Jane live happily in the jungle. Some men seek ivory and return Jane to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jane and intends to take her back ... even if it means killing Tarzan. <br /> <br /> This is a rarity - a continuation that is better than the original. Tarzan, the ape-man of 1932 was good, but it had some terrible special effects and a bit of a drag. It has much better effects and much more adult. There are tons of blatant racism (a black man was shot at close range - and nobody cares), but that was in 1934. There is also a lot of blood, blood and violence (for the 1934 film), and Jane made uncut prints. long snorkeling completely nude! There is also obvious sexual content, and Tarzan and Jane almost don’t wear clothes (and this is implied), they sleep together and have sex - without being married. Today, this should not worry anyone, but in 1934 it was quite extreme. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is well directed, moving very fast and full of adventure and excitement. Seeing Weissmüller in this scant lion dress is definitely a treat for the eyes, and Jane's clothes are also revealing. I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is as bad as Jane, but Weismüller is perfect as Tarzan. All the others are fine. <br /> <br /> This is the best Weymmüller - O'Hara Tarzan. WELL worth seeing, but not for kids!
