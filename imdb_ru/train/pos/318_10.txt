This is without a doubt the greatest film in history. It is almost incomprehensible even with many repetitive views in an attempt to find out what exactly is happening. The film was almost completely improvised and includes random music numbers, commercials, contests, in which everyone comes in the mail, and many other innovations. Also, what other films are shot by Martin Luther King Jr.? To decipher the film, look for a director’s book titled “I Was Curious.” Everything will become clear. This is a grandiose and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking. Triumph Now, if only someone releases a version with subtitles in color * other than * white ... white subtitles tend to blur and become invisible.
