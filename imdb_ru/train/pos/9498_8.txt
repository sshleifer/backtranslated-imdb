"Painting sees, then remembers better than you saw." So says Dick Heldar (Ronald Coleman), an artist in the film "The Light That Failed." The film is made in the old Hollywood style with Ronald Coleman in the main role and the cast with bravura, in which Ida Lupino plays in her first important role as a reliable actor Dudley Diggs. (who also played one of the main roles with Coleman in the movie "The Condemned") and a solid performance by the remarkable actor Walter Houston. <br /> <br /> The title and the opening episodes of the film largely reflect the fact that Dick loses his eyesight. He is blinded by the discharge of gunpowder, as he and his favorite baby, Maisie (Muriel Angelus), play with a gun. Later, the wound during the battle in Sudan is the catalyst for his blindness. He becomes a famous artist, but he is already blinded by ambitions, and in fact does not reach his full potential until his vision leaves him. Enter the bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino), and his self-destruction set in motion. Lupino is very strong in this role and plays very well with Coleman. Her evil pie reminds me of Bette Davis from "Human Slavery." <br /> <br /> Well functioning and well managed, this is one of my favorite Coleman melodramas.
