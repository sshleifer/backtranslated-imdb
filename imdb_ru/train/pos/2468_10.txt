I went to Hamlet because I was between jobs. I thought that 4 hours would be great, I was a Brana fan; Dead again, Henry V. I was completely stunned by the direction, acting and cinematography that the film captured. Like other reviews, 4 hours pass quickly. Bran does not play Hamlet, he is Hamlet, he was born for this. When I watch this film, I constantly try to find flaws, I looked at the nonsense and did not notice them. How he could move the camera to the hall and from the hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me. This film was shot at 70 mil. It is a pity that Colombia has not released a widescreen version of this on VHS. I have a DVD player, and I would take it on the Titanic any day. So Colombia, if you are listening, lay out this movie the way you should watch it! And I don't know what happened at the Oscars. It was supposed to be the best picture, best actor, best direction, best cinematography. What films did they watch? I felt sorry for Bran in the Oscars when he made a tribute to Shakespeare on the screen. They were supposed to pay tribute to Branah for bringing us one of the greatest films of all time.
