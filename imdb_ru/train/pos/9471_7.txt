Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, an uncle in the newspaper and dedicated a single father to three girls. At a big family meeting, Dan meets his ideal woman and finds out that she is in a relationship with her brother. <br /> <br /> What should a man do? <br /> <br /> I rather liked “Dan in real life,” but I would suggest that the success of this film will depend on whether you agree to accept Steve Carell, who plays the role relatively straightforward and restrained, instead of go through extensive comedic movements, made him so successful. If you can't accept it, do not be afraid, “Get Smart” will appear later this year, but for the record I thought it was very good. <br /> <br /> “Dan In Real Life” begins as your typical, by the way, funny family drama, but as time goes on it becomes more and more ridiculous, and Karella’s frustration in this situation increases. This is not very original (but if you only saw films with original ideas, the cinematic choice would be very scarce, wouldn’t it?) fell in love with the glowing Juliette Binoche?) - fully applied a rather insightful scenario in which there is a lot of reflection on the meaning and passion of love. <br /> <br /> I hope that Steve Carell is pushing himself and doing something interesting again.
