Mahatma was portrayed as a man who neglected his own son in this film. Do not misunderstand me, I do not blame the film; This is such a wonderful film and came out of the cinema with a lump in my throat. We need to understand the spiritual position of the Mahatma, he is a real spiritual leader. Only a fully enlightened person could break away from their loved ones. A man of this caliber gives an example of his family and followers. According to the film, he spoke with his son and tried to make him understand where he came from, but poor Harillall with such low intelligence could not understand his father. When something went wrong with Harill, Mahatma could remain calm and admit that his son was a great tragedy. <br /> <br /> If these were other parents, they would endanger their values ​​to help their son stand up. Mahatma did not do this, he is a real leader who sets an example.
