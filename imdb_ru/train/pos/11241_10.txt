I recently purchased this one of my all-time favorite DVD movies, and, as usual, while watching it all just struck me. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m a big fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack for this film just started to cry, especially the track "Will You". This is a pure nostalgic trip for me back to my youth. This is in second place compared to quadrofenia (in which Phil Daniels also played a major role). <br /> <br /> A great soundtrack and a great view of Britain in the years of Thatcherite dark 80s, in which I grew up. The ending is so sad that after a few hours after the end of the movie, I'm like a crying baby. <br /> <br /> I hope to put on this DVD because of the replay, I can watch it again and again, and never be boring, just for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Hazel, sorry to hear about your dad, honey. God bless you all. xx
