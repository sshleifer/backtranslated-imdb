I watched the Lion King more times that all my friends combined. Having a younger sister .. you know how it is. By now, I remember both the plot and the lines. After Lion King 2 came out, I was fine, well, let me see ... The second was much weaker ... Then I saw an advertisement for Lion King 1 and 1/2 ... I was fine, we We go again, After watching 1 1/2 I was like wow. All my expectations (for repetition) were broken. A truly cute and original story keeps you in its place. I noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comic moments that ROFlmao would be 100% applied here. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend watching the cartoon.
