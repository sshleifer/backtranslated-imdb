“Presque rien” is a story of two young guys who are in love during a summer holiday by the sea. I do not want to tell the plot, because this is not the most important thing in this film (but you can be sure that it is interesting and original). The best part of this movie is cinema. The visual side of Presque rien is so amazing that it deserves the highest note. It leaves you fascinated by its beauty. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it is shown unevenly, rather difficult. There is no simple chronology and no answers to all the questions posed by the film. But this is what makes Presque rien even more interesting. I recommend this film to all people for whom the artistic side of films is very important and they will not be disappointed.
