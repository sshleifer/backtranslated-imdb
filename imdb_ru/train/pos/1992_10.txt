I'm really getting old, I am in the process of watching this 40-year-old film and I am surprised that my grandchildren will be watching in 40 years, this is an old saying, but they no longer make them so .. this is not only history, this is music, acting as young , and old ... the actors seemed to be born to play their roles, young Oliver, old Fagin ... too many to mention them all, the role played by Judge Oliver, comes earlier, I have seen in other roles for many years .. sly deceiver, Ron is sullen, like Fagin, Mr. and Mrs. Bam l, the film not only won 5 Oscars, but I also received several awards "Golden Globe". If you decide to watch this movie ... Do yourself a favor, take a few, if not all children to see this masterpiece.
