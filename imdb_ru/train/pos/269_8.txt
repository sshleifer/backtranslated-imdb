I am generally a fan of television films, and it was one of the good ones. All the actors were pretty solid, and I didnâ€™t see any turns before each advertisement. For me, it was something like Medium meets CSI. <br /> <br /> Anyone else thought that under certain circumstances the daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they related in any way? I would definitely watch it or rent it if it ever comes to video. <br /> <br /> Didi was great. She was not seen in many things, and she very convincingly did her job. <br /> <br /> If you like mysterious TV movies, watch this if you have a chance.
