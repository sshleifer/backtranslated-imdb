Here is a decent horror film of the mid-70s about the gates of hell in New York, which, as it turned out, is an old brown stone. It looks like there are many Hell gates around, but, of course, this involuntary model decides that she needs a place from her boyfriend / bride, and therefore she simply chooses one that is disguised as a good and inexpensive apartment. She meets several strange neighbors and even attends a cat's birthday. After meeting with the realtor, because she hears strange sounds at night from the top floor, she learns that she and the old priest are supposedly the only tenants. Wow Then who are all these geeks? Her boyfriend (slippery lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) starts poking around and discovers that things are not at all what they seem, and not all. It has a few decent creepy scenes and the idea that squeaky old people who are her "sometimes" neighbors, different from what they seem, are quite intriguing. A bit of decent bleeding and even a parade of no ordinary people by the end make these decent watches, and although I have seen it on TV many times, the uncut DVD is, of course, much better. A good little horror movie, maybe a good companion for "Tired Offers". 8 out of 10.
