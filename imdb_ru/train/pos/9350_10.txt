let me say that I love Adam Sandler, watching how he rules me. I paid close attention to his actions. <br /> <br /> When he raises his voice, I can't help but think that Gilmore shouts happily at the golf ball, and then I look back as Adam Sandler pulls me into myself. <br /> <br /> Reign over Me is a great movie, a film that first goes slowly when you expect emotions in every scene <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle always does an excellent job and is not an exception here with some really great lines and Oscar-worthy in any film he makes <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler was amazing in many ways, not only was his most dramatic / best acting film of his career. but I can remember loud laughter in many parts of this film <br /> <br /> The cast was great also with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film, which he got is an awesome game great shots of the New York great comedy a great drama and a new-found respect for Adam Sandler, if you have ever doubted him, or a reassurance of how great Don Cheadle is
