Do not mind the soundtrack that has already been played. <br /> <br /> However, Debra Winger is always interesting, and although it was her earlier role, she is pretty good, like Sissy, the girl from the wrong side of the tracks, lived in a trailer with Bad (Travolta), but for a while, Madolin Smith as a rival will replace his city jacket. <br /> <br /> I agree with an earlier review of Scott Glenn used only for the plot, added to the mix to create uncertainty; history is predictable and contrived. <br /> <br /> In addition, although I am from the east, many of us did not like the “Saturday night of fever”, although there were moments in it, eternal stereotypes are beyond criticism. this moment. <br /> <br /> Worth a look at Debra Winger; she is still so pretty, and never had that Hollywood person that we face too many actresses today. 7/10
