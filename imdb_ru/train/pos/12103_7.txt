I have never seen Barbara Steele's movie, which I didnâ€™t like, and have always been a lover of a good haunted story (especially for such wonderful paintings as The Legend of Hell and the original versions of Ghosts). "and" House on a haunted hill "), so I had the feeling that the" Blood Castle "would be right in my alley. And boy, it was someday! This is a French-Italian co-production, although perhaps not the classic, that the first horror movie of Steele, "Black Sunday", remains to this day, however, is an extremely atmospheric, frightening record in the ghost genre. Filmed in black and white, it conveys a really creepy miasma. The film tells about a journalist who puts one lord blackwood and author by name Edgar Allen Poe that he can spend the night in Blackwood Castle on the night of All Saints' Day when the spirits of those killed in the castle recreate their fate. The viewer sees these deaths and they are mostly terrible. The film really excited the spine of the viewer, and on an uncut DVD I just watched - thanks to the wonderful guys from Synapse - even there is an amazing topless scene and a light lesbian! And Barbara is great in this film, and her otherworldly beauty takes great advantage in playing a sympathetic ghost. Her simple presence turns the ghastly ghost story into something truly memorable. No wonder she was called the "Queen of Horror."
