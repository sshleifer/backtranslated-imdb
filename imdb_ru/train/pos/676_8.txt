The “last wave” is much more than the sum of its parts. This is not just a film about the disaster, not just a study of the spirituality of the Australian Aborigines and, of course, more than just a court drama. Writer / director Peter Weir manages to bring these elements to a new level in order to create a truly effective and thought-provoking film with the same eerie atmosphere that he gave “Hanging Rock Picnic” two years earlier, which you will remember years later. . <br /> <br /> When lawyer David Burton (Chamberlain) is summoned to defend Chris Lee (Gulpilil) in connection with the death of an aborigine, for which he may or may not be directly responsible, he discovers that he is not just trying to get the truth out of Lee, but with the understanding of what he hears when it happens. As in the case of the Aboriginal faith, that there are two worlds — the everyday and the Time of Dreams, the truth exists on two completely different levels, with the consequences having more disastrous consequences than Burton could have imagined. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the reason why “Hanging Rock Picnic” is better remembered because of its timeless secrets. We follow the same path, but we have to look for answers ourselves. In The Last Wave, we can put everything together by the end of the film. However, despite all this information, we have to choose how much of this we want to believe, because the film takes us beyond our normal realities. <br /> <br /> With regard to production, Weir uses his Budget for excellent effect, gradually creating a sense of death in everything: from soft lighting to heavy rain and good use of sound. Random music is unobtrusive, never tries to be grand. Richard Chamberlain manages to express bewilderment that the audience will undoubtedly feel trying to solve the mystery. David Gulpilil perfectly portrays a man trapped between two worlds, who wants to do the right thing, but is afraid because he already knows the end. <br /> <br /> Put all these things together and you will have a great example of why David Weir has been a familiar movie name for thirty years. Highly recommended.
