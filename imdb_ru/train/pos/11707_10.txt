I remember watching this movie a long time ago, although then he had no special effects, the acting was really good. And it still has the same message today, although the technology has changed, perhaps they should do a remake of this film, it would be interesting to see a remake. I also liked the music from the film, Larry Norman was a really good songwriter at the time, although now most of Christian music is music of worship and praise. I was always curious about what happened to Patty after the show ended? She continued making more films, did she eventually get married and start a family? I would like to receive an update.
