Japanese indie film with humor and philosophy, in which the three main characters literally permeate the entire film, chasing each other due to strange circumstances and comic coincidence. As they run, we see what is happening in their minds and how they got to where they are at the moment. The act of running is a metaphor for the life of these unfortunate people. In a sense, what they are really pursuing is not what they initially pursued, but the meaning of their life and salvation from personal problems and broken dreams. Running makes them all feel really alive. The big life-changing running adventure ends when they happen to be at the center of something big, violent, and so absurd that itâ€™s funny and clever. One of my favorite films of all time is the brilliant director Sabu.
