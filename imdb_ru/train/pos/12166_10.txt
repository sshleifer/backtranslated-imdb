Very strange and convincing movie. This is a very awkward and tense person who is trying to navigate in his life as a fundraiser / seller. The director was able to catch a very nervous tone that really served the story well. Original and disturbing, and also find a lot of humor in the pain that accompanies life. On the test bench, the sequence really stands out, which makes me laugh out loud, and this is not what I do as often as I should. One of the most memorable films I've seen in a long time. I didn’t leave my mind, and I look forward to Bronstein’s future efforts. Fantastic performances around. The simple line "I really appreciate it." now landmark for me.
