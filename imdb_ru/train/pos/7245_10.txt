This is the only full-length feature film about the world of bridge. I found the first 10 minutes a little slow, but after that the film absolutely perfectly describes professional bridge players and how they make their living. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very funny. I do not think that the non-bridgist will get the charm of this film. <br /> <br /> Some dresses are really beautiful, it's a pity that the film is in black and white - I can only imagine how they look in color. The way media is portrayed is absolutely ridiculous. On earth, the bridge will never be like that. <br /> <br /> Watch it as soon as possible and tell your friends about it.
