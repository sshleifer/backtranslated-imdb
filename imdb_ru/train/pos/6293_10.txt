Buster in this episode absolutely shines, this is the only car I saw at the end of my career that allowed him to play a physical (and quiet!) Comedy that made him famous. It is still shocking when he hears his gruff voice in conversational episodes — his voice is the only thing I don't give a damn about Buster — but his ability to take a punch is unparalleled. He even repeats some of the gags used in his early double-corps with Roscoe Arbuckle. <br /> <br /> My deepest thanks go to Rod Serling for introducing this episode to us and for giving Buster the genius a complete reach. He didn’t have much time (one episode) to do it, but it is a touching tribute to Hollywood’s greatest genius.
