“Life stinks” is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. Black and white is always present in our lives. The performance of Mel Brooks, as always, is great, and with the other actors, too, everything is in order. This film has some kind of capra's taste, so it is so good. <br /> <br /> There are some unforgettable jokes, for example, when Brooks tries to make some money by dancing in the street, and all people passing by just ignore him or when he meets a funny madman who thinks Paul Getty and then argue and clap each other. <br /> <br /> If you didn’t see it, you don’t know that we missed you. <br /> <br /> This film tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this film and reality is that this film has a happy ending, but reality does not. <br /> <br /> Yes, life stinks.
