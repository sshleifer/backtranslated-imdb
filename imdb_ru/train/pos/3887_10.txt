I managed to record it from my companion, but I would like to receive the original release in a format that we can use here in the States. Eddie is really famous in this performance from San Francisco. I don't remember laughing so hard at the routine. My wife and I both enjoyed this recording and his work on Glorious, I just wanted to buy a copy and help support Eddie financially through my purchase. We need more of his show available.
