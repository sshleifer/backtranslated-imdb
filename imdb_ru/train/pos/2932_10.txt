I have seen my large share of comedic and stand-up films, but this one is so original, so fresh that it will make you wonder why you always went straight, passing it in the video store. Murphy has pretty funny jokes, but it's too funny to miss them. If every movie could be so funny. It should be called "107 minutes of the most incredible comedy." Murphy is a brilliant comedian in this film, and he will make you say: “This is the guy who made Dr. Doolittle!” just could think about those whom you could not. Please, if you have ever seen one comedy in your life, here it is, if all films could be insane.
