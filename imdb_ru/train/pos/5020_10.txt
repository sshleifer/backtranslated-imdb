This is what a film should be, trying to grasp the essence of something that is very surreal. It has this foggy overtone, which is rarely captured on film, it feels like a sequence of dreams and really takes you into a dark ghostly memory. The children were incredibly believable, and I expect something to happen from them in the future. A very natural game for such young people, I don’t know if Bill pulled it out of them or is there just so good, but it’s excellent nonetheless. Bill scored, as I understand it, for KevNeff’s comment on Mr. Paxton’s bad behavior, what can be done in this role. He played the role quite well in my opinion. It comes from the one who said that Hamlet was good (version of Ethan Hawk?). Wow ......... Do not listen to his Comments. Great click to make you feel really awkward if you want it? Cinematography also gets a rating above average.
