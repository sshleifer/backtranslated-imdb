I saw this movie when I was in Israel in the summer. my Hebrew does not speak fluently, so the subtitles were very helpful, I did not feel lost at any moment of the film. After about 5 minutes you will get used to the subtitles. <br /> <br /> This movie hit me !!!!!! It depicts the two most famous taboos in the Middle East today: homosexual relations between an Israeli and a Palestinian. This allows a person to enter both areas of the conflict simultaneously. Dilemma, emotions entailed. The culmination of the film is tragedy, when anger and rage are pushing one of the lovers on one extremist side! absolute must see !!
