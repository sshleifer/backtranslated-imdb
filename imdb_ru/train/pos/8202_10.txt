It was, without a doubt, the best of the "Dirty Harry" series. From the opening credits you get into the story of revenge, which is very striking and deeply fascinating. Sondra Locke is perfect for an injured woman eager for revenge. Eastwood has many "third-party" episodes that have nothing to do with the plot, but show Harry at its best. This film, filled with unforgettable characters in secondary roles, should become the standard for detective fighters. This is the dirty film about Harry, which is devoid of all "fluff". I can watch it again and again (well, not in one sitting), because it is a nice yarn for revenge. The pace is fast and several scenes are unforgettable. “Come on, make my day ... Do you feel lucky, punk? .... ”Classic Eastwood, as soon as Eastwood, with his tormenting, harsh expressions and whispers, in a menacing voice, can do it.
