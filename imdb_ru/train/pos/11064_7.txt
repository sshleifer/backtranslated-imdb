“I will take you there” tells about an unhappy man who loses his wife in relation to another and finds an unlikely ally on a blind date. Unlike most romantic comedies, this little indie is basically a situational comedy featuring Rogers and Sheedy with a slight emphasis on romance. A sort of trip with lots of fun and some poignant moments keeps moving, stays fresh and is a worthy observation for indie lovers.
