Two great comedians in the great movie Neil Simon on his hit. <br /> <br /> A great combination, especially when it comes to Matte and Burns. No wonder Burns won an Oscar for it; He is as sharp and cheerful as ever. And Mattau is his rival, if a bit more capricious. <br /> <br /> This is Simon's familiar territory: two old vaudeville partners reunite for a television event, but still cannot tolerate each other after all these years. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s nice to see how these two look at each other, and their joint scenes make this film an absolute delight. I myself especially enjoyed "knock, knock, knock / ENTER!" scene. And if you're a fan of Burns or Mattau, you'll like it too. <br /> <br /> Actually, you will like the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Add some sunshine to your life.
