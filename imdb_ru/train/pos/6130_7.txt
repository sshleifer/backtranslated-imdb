Surprisingly good. The acting was funny, the script was funny, the music was funny, the plot was incredibly funny. It was a fun movie to watch and give the brain a break. Parts of the plot and quotes seemed very creative to me. 7 out of 10. In fact, for what it was, it deserves 10 out of 10. You shouldn't compare this to an Arthouse film or a bloody slasher film.
