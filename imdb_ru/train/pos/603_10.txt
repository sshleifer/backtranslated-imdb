Albanis music permeates this film. From time to time it is played using original instruments (for example, a piano, but never a full orchestra), but it is often reworked using various modern ensembles (for example, guitar) and arrangements (for example, a jazz piano). Only occasionally music is the only direction of the film: in most cases the music is tuned to various dances, often flamenco, but not always. I guess there are 12 ?? 14 scenes that are not combined plot. Not all scenes reach heights for the individual viewer. In my case, about half reached the top, although the rest were in their own way very well. Those that worked for me led me to the aesthetic pleasure of goose bumps; Indeed, the final scene made me cry with joy. And in some very magical way it deeply immerses you in Spanish culture. If you do not like subtitles, do not worry. The film is almost wordless, although each scene is called the work of Albeniz. Watching this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of Saura's films are available on DVD in the United States. I mean, in particular, his version of flamenco "Carmen", an impressive work of art that is available in Europe, but not here (European DVDs will not be played on American DVD players). This is a scandal.
