My brother and I have a Pokemon 4Ever on a DVD. We watched it a couple of times and it was the best. It is a pity that the new pokemon did not say this time. I'll get used to it. <br /> <br /> The iron masked marauder was quite evil when he captured Kelebi with a dark ball. Good deed, and Sam managed to get him out of control. <br /> <br /> In the closing credits there was only one song called Cele-BRATE performed by Russell Velasquez. <br /> <br /> Pokemon 4Ever Become successful since the three previous films and people will always love this film.
