“Lost” is one of a kind ... it is so charming and full of tension, thrills and emotions at the same time. I have never seen such serials before. He is full of the thrill of the jungle and has a good script. The actors have so naturally affected life on the island that I feel lost on the island, watching him. This is a great job, told in a very clever way. The series looks like a film depicting the life of survivors lost on a desert island. I feel like watching one episode after another, and I highly recommend this series to all TV show fans. Look it up to see the magic of losing nowhere.
