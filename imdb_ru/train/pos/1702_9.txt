If you have a hard time dreaming, you can give this film a low rating. But you just need to understand that this film was not created to please everyone, <br /> <br /> just people with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> For these people the film is great! He plays in old science fiction films and radio shows that have long disappeared, most of those where the B-rating is himself. Along the lines of Spaceballs and Airplane 2, you may have to expand your imagination a bit to get the jokes, but it's worth it.
