Although written by Stephen King, an overvalued writer, if ever there was, it is actually a rather interesting B-film. Vampires, incestuous creatures who live in a candlelit house and drain the life force of virgins, great landscapes in cemeteries, heroic cats and very cute virgins. The soundtrack even has Enya music, an idea that seemed to me rather ... good. I am sure that King is disappointed with this little film, although there is a crappy dialogue and ideas in it, all of them from the real and tedious kitten King. (Although Lunatics, if I understood correctly, this is a script without any novel or story). However, these smells of sewage show that he didnâ€™t use a ghost writer after all ...
