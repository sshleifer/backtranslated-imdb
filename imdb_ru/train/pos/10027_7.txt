Of course, Titanic was a good movie when you first saw it, but you really should see it a second time, and your opinion of the movie will definitely change. The first time you watch a movie, you see the main love story and think: oh, how romantic. The second time (and I'm not the only one who thinks so) is just annoying, and you just sit and watch the movie, thinking: “When will this ship sink?” And even that is not so impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but definitely not great. Was I glad that DiCaprio did not win an Oscar for this film, I mean, in his opinion, who is Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He makes one bad movie and will not make a movie for less than $ 20 million. And then everyone is surprised that there are almost no films with him. But enough about, in my opinion, the worst character in the film. On the other hand, Kate Winslet’s performance was wonderful. I also think that the director is very talented to make a film of this magnitude. One lesson can be learned about this film: too many love stories, since directors should not try to add a dirty novel to every movie !!! Out of a possible 100%, I give this film only 71%.
