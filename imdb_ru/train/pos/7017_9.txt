You spend most of this two-hour movie, wondering: “What is the story of the main character?” <br /> <br /> Will Smith, like the reticent “Ben Thomas”, will make you guess. The last 20-25 minutes is when you find out, and it is shocking ... but you knew that something dramatic would be revealed. Before that, Smith plays mysterious, almost haunting people. You know, he has a good reason for this, but this is never explained, again, so that we continue to guess until the end. <br /> <br /> All this, including over and over again, but a touching affair with Rosario Dawkins (Emily Posa), may be some viewers will be upset or want to leave this film ... but not because The last long segment combines all the pieces of this puzzle. <br /> <br /> This is a two-hour film, not a typical action-macho game by Will Smith Smith. In fact, the most shocking aspect may be the vision of the painted, sad face of Smith throughout this story. He almost does not look like him in a few frames. Looks like he's lost and sick. Smith copes with the role, portraying a man carrying great sadness. <br /> <br /> As often happens in a good movie, this movie makes you think long after the final credits.
