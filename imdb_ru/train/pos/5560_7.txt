SPOILERS <br /> <br /> My buddy said THE FOLLOWING FILM is Cheech and Chong's best movie, and he tried his best to borrow it and BROTHERS BRETAY. In the next film there is no plot, no stimulation, in fact there is nothing that defines the film ... but this is funny. And Cheech and Chong, whatever it takes, show their heart. <br /> <br /> Well, in this short paragraph that I included in the plot, but because of these four fifths of the film, nothing happens that the story usually begins. I can only say that the cousin Chicha appeared. <br /> <br /> Was there another funny moment when Chong made Chicha drink urine twice? What about a rooster? Was that the first Pee Wee Hermann movie appearance? You would need to watch the movie yourself to enjoy it. I don't think the NEXT MOVIE has balls strong enough to make it cool, but the film has a heart, and hey, my buddy let me borrow it to get it 7.
