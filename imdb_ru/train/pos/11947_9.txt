Just well written, directed and acted ... Woody is the best of the 2000s, if not the best of the 80s !! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for his roll. The banter Scarlett Johansson with Woody proves how well she became a rounded actress. <br /> <br /> It's great not to star in a novel on screen with a leading lady. He plays the perfect clumsy mage. <br /> <br /> There have been several reviews discrediting this film. Do not let them prevent you from seeing a wonderfully made film. The people in the crowd with whom I saw it laughed so loudly in some lines that I missed the next one. If you like the 70s Woody Allen films, youâ€™ll regret missing this one. <br /> <br /> I invite you to watch this movie without prejudice, otherwise you may come out with a smile.
