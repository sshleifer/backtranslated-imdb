Ss Van Dyne must have been an astute businessman in his relationship with Hollywood. Most movie series from studio days were usually limited to one or two studios. But apparently, Van Dyne must have sold his rights to each book about Philo Vance one by one. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers and many others have released Philo Vance films. Only Tarzan seemed to have bypassed Hollywood more. <br /> <br /> MGM shot “Garden Murder Case” and starred as Edmund Low as a fashion detective. Of course, at that time, MGM had a contract with Philon on the screen, but Bill Powell was at that time engaged in Thin Man, and I think that Louis B. Meyer decided to focus him there. pretty acceptable Philo Vance. Low began quite loudly at the end of a quiet era with What Price Glory, and then with a series of films with Victor McLaglen with their Flagg and Quirt characters. But after McLaglen got his Oscar for Informer, Lowe seemed to disappear into the B. paintings market. <br /> <br /> Three separate victims are involved in the garden murder case: Douglas Walton, Jean Lockhart and Frida Insport. The ominous atmosphere around the offender gives it away, the mystery is how all the murders are actually connected and how they are committed. <br /> <br /> Although I will say it. Vance has a very big chance to expose the villain, and the last 15 minutes are worthy of Hitchcock.
