This film is undoubtedly ideal for those who rate this film as low class, because it doesn’t have a “good plot” or something like that, it’s funny if you say that Jackie Chan’s film is bad the plot, as the porn movie says is bad because it has no plot! You are watching Jackie Chan "For the battle scenes", because the action is not so much focused on a good story or something like that, if you look at how he acts in films and compare it with other American films of that era, and even later you will understand that in the Jackie Chan films there were scenes of fighting and not very good scenes, while in American films there were good stories, but crappy action films compared to what Jackie Chan did at the time. Porn looks at porn, Jackie Chan watched the action, I think you people rating is bad because there is no plot, because you think a smart film critic would appreciate a good movie, but the way I see it is a good movie This is a movie that can entertain me. Of course, the middle of the film was boring, VERY boring, but, let's say, everything else - all the action movies and stunts - pay for it all. It changed the way the American militants were created, they even had stolen scenes from this film. If you need a real man, a real artist, then watch this film and many more films about Jackie Chan, it is pure in all respects. It literally makes American films look like walks in the park, and even films TODAY. American films are so dependent on special effects, protective wires, stand-ins, and more. Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are the works of a real entertainer who just tries his best and is very talented in what he can do. masterpiece
