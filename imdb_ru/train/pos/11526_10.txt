I shot this movie at a blockbuster on a whim ... I like Alan Arkin, and the cover caught ... I read my back and immediately realized that it would be either the best or the worst movie I have ever seen ... I think I was lucky ... I laughed from start to finish ... Alan Arkin brought a wonderful character to this film. Since then I have bought a used copy for my own collection and I watch it all the time. I recommended this film to a lot of people, and they all enjoyed it just like me ... I see complaints about the menu and DVD functions ... but this does not take away from the film ... the disc was created for Blockbuster exculsivley, so they Don't let you skip the preview ... except that you shouldn't let the DVD features keep you from watching a great movie.
