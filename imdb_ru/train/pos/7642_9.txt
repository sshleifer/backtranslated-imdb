Not a very big box office, but I was pleasantly surprised at this movie <br /> <br />. James "I did something with Farrah Fawcett" Orr <br /> <br /> wrote and shot this film about an ordinary ordinary guy named Larry Burrows, who thinks his life would be <br /> <br /> Incredibly different if he hits Homeran in a key baseball game when he was 15 years old. But thanks to the mysterious and magical bartender <br /> <br /> Mike, Larry fulfills his desire, but soon realizes that his new life is not the same as he hoped. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this film really impressed me. Critics gave <br /> <br /> mixed information, and I must say that this concept is really interesting and <br /> <br /> it has proven itself well. Yes, it's a bit standard, but there are enough funny moments, drama and a great acting game to make it really good <br /> <br />. James Belushi (I think) was Oscar worthy of his role. John <br /> <br /> Lovitz is flawless, and Linda Hamilton and Rene Russo shine in their roles. Michael Caine is beautiful as a bartender. This <br /> <br /> is just a good movie with a good lesson. If you have not seen, I strongly recommend that you check
