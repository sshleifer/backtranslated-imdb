The most important thing in this film is the brilliant play of Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christie Brown, the artist and guinea fighter, who, despite her physical condition, overcame all the difficulties. As a person who has worked with cerebral palsy patients, I can assure you that their results were shockingly convincing. The enormous support Christie received from her family, low-income, working-class Dubliners, prompted him to do the impossible, and this picture depicted this support, which did not brilliantly read the book, but the dialogues were written wisely to capture the witty arrogant personality of Christy Brown, This film is for everyone, especially lovers of classic cinema.
