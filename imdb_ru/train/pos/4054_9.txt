I first saw this film in the 1980s as a baby. My dad actually recorded it from the TV. I must have watched more than 20 times before a relatively recent DVD release. <br /> <br /> I, of course, bought and watched a DVD, and was puzzled by how much the dialogue had changed. In the first version, which I still have on VHS, the mood of the film, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very gloomy. However, a new version featuring Van Der Beek et al. Is more comic. <br /> <br /> In other words, it's like watching the original American version of Akira with this dub before watching the updated version with a literal translation from Japanese. <br /> <br /> I do not complain in any way, the story and the quality of the animation are not diminished, but this raises the question of whether Miyazaki is meant for a lighter or darker narration and the theme in his film .....
