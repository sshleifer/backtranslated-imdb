The only season just showed up here in Australia and I thought it was just great! I like it! all storylines are so good! and this is a much more realistic look at teenage and family life today. yet it still maintained the strong family values ​​of keeping together and being close to each other. their problems were real and it really attracted you to the show. The show is mainly about this family called “Days” and their lives. the family consisted of Abby Day (mom), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporting daughter), Cooper Day (son-outsider) and Nathan Day (son of a genius boy). Each episode is the day of their life, in which Coopers' views are reflected on him. I loved Cooper, his understanding during the show was just great. he was definitely my favorite character. it ended so many things with which he could continue, I am really sad, the other season was not done. It was a great show, I will miss it.
