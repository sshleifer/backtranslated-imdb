A change in worldview is necessary in order to enjoy modern British films, which somehow allow them to watch on their own and in their own qualities, and not according to criteria that are evaluated by American films. A British film must do its best to be tough and difficult to do, but in the heat of the British films can surpass it in their superior competitors. <br /> <br /> This film fails not in content, but only in attaching itself to its predecessor, so allowing it to be easily seen as the work of a star and director somewhere near the end of their leashes. After a couple of decades, Gregory teaches, and this time with two girls on his mind. He teaches at his school a protest against human rights abuses. When the students he fired find insults among them, he has to deal with whether he simply says everything. <br /> <br /> This is a subversive film, in which there is no ordinary worldly character in any American film that you expect to do everything he does, but the boy is a naive person who can still put everything on the line for principles. May be. This, of course, is not a protest by numbers, although, being too warm. While the American film may seem realistic, because it is urban and sandy, this and other British films of recent years - those that do not try to compare with America in their inner feelings - are real, because British humor reveals the truth.
