A new side of the history of Victoria and Albert is brought to life by director Jean-Marc Vall√©e. The fluent thoughts of most people about Queen Victoria are the thoughts of a woman who reigned for several decades and lived in mourning. Emily Blunt is more than capable of starring, as she gives viewers a different perspective. She portrays Victoria in her youth, the ascension to the throne and in her early years. Stupid Victoria is fresh and restrained throughout the film. Her strongest scenes are with Albert (Friend of Rupert) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All the actors have proven themselves, including Miranda Richardson in what could be just a catchy role. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a story of dramatic arcs and historical "acting" moments, the story is still interesting enough to be worth seeing. There are several historical freedoms that were accepted by the script, the film tries to remain true to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and the social and royal structure of the time period. The scenography and costumes are outstanding. <br /> <br /> This film will be most appreciated by those who turn to history, historical dramas, as well as Blunt and other actors. I sincerely recommend. <br /> <br /> Rating: A
