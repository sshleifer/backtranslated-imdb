I was pleased to see that she had black hair! I have been ill for about 30 years and I have been disgusted with the two previous attempts to take down stories. <br /> <br /> I was glad that the writers updated the period by turning on the computer. don't mess it up at all. In fact, I watched the movie twice in one day, a sure sign that he was on par. This is what I do with books that I like too. <br /> <br /> I thought that all the characters were well depicted and represented the first days of Blaze's Modesty very well, which was manifested in the book and in the comic. I would also have to disagree with the comment made earlier by the reviewer about villains who should be ugly. Did he really read books? <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good movie, and I look forward to continuing.
