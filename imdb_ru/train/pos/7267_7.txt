Curley Sue is 6 years old, with an abundance of hair and a life of a tramp. She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), are trying to survive on the streets, being little scammers. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of the car in an expensive garage, and Curley will scream about the trials and the burden of the alleged victim. He was a very high-profile lawyer named Gray (Kelly Lynch), who was accordingly shocked by what she did. Fraudsters not only earn money, but also spend the night in Gray's chic apartment. Even then, Gray feels that she owes them more, so the three of them are holding on to the spell. Gray knows only the law on profitable business and knows nothing about life. Who can teach her better than Bill and Curly, these experienced experts on life realities? But all good things must come to an end, and for a lawyer and a couple of scammers there is no life. Or is there? This is a cute and funny movie about the unexpected. Curly is, of course, as interesting as Shirley Temple, but, of course, much sharper. Belushi gives a rare touching speech, because his loser is depressed, and Lynch is bright, as haughty, but soft to the touch lawyer. John Hughes, as a writer and director, once again shows us his magic touch, as the script is lively and unpredictable. Just see how Curley and Bill take Gray out for the night without money, and look at the funny results. Do you crave happy ends, long promised and finally delivered, with a few uncertain moments in between? This is your movie to order.
