This film was not so much advertised here in Greece, although it had good actors, a great script and a pretty good picture, it was not the so-called blockbuster film in my country. The film itself is very powerful, it is about the difficult time that the newcomer had to go through when he returns to his native village after being released from prison for 5 years (drugs). The end is rather sad ... Mourikis is trying to keep up with his role, and he copes with it quite well ... Lambropoul is magnificent and looks very strange, and, of course, Khatzisavas is again close to supremacy ... 7 out of 10, because very few Greek films can make such an impression!
