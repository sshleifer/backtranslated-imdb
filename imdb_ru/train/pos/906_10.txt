VIVA in my book 2006 BEST MOVIE! PERIOD !! In my book, this is one of the 100 best films ever made in Bollywood. It is sad that this film has not so many reviews and not so much popularity. <br /> <br /> VIVAH is the real achievement of a director who does it again. After HAHK and Maine Pyar Kiya Sooraj once again held a brilliant VIVAH. <br /> <br /> These are the simplest and cutest films I've seen this year. After watching “Don 2,” which was “CRAP,” and then “Dhoom 2,” which even beat Don in that regard, I finally saw a film that is so close to my heart and my culture. <br /> <br /> I don’t know why Bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture that we have and making Hollywood shit remake movies like Dhoom 2 and don. <br /> <br /> This story is beautiful and in many ways linked to the Indian wedding system, of which I would also like to be a part. Our system, which teaches us to obey the elders, to follow them and, of course, to obey their thoughts, is so brilliantly shown in this film! Of course, there is no power in choosing your life partner, and this should be a short meeting between the couple and solve it, as brilliantly shown in this film. <br /> <br /> Returning to the film ..... VIVAH is a story about the journey between the beautiful period of engagement and marriage. Phase where the guy meets the girl! .... Both understand each other. Both will try to assess whether they can love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and various kinds that occur during marriages. <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is great in the film ....... Shahid is fine ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are awesome !! The songs are brilliant. ! I especially like HAMARI SHAADI MAIN HAFTE REH GYE CHAAR and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ...... <br /> <br /> In general, you MUST SEE everyone who still believes in Indian culture and traditions, and I certainly believe! <br /> <br /> Go watch this movie ...... I just need to say one word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS !.
