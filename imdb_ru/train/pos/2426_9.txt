“Once in a lifetime” is a very good film. However, this is not good for everyone, due to the widespread use of vulgar language and violence in some situations. The film manages to joke anecdotally and believably "life" in areas of New York where problems with drugs are important. This image, in turn, is used as a decoration for the most thoughtful and tense drama, supported by powerful dialogues (however, it was difficult for me to understand some of them, because English is not my native language. It's normal in the video). Sometimes there is a small replay, but I think it fits well with the overall orientation Fishburn gave the film, which gives more thought than just a good exercise in style, especially in time / action management. The characters, although not simple, are easy to communicate with, and the actors do an excellent job with them. By the way, I really liked the soundtrack (B. Marsalis). If you're not too prudish, you should watch this movie one, two, three times. I rated the movie 9/10.
