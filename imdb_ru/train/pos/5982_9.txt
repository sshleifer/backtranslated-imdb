One of my favorite movies. It has everything - a stunning soundtrack, courtesy of Eddie Clarke, the former Motorhead, a lot of action, lots of laughter, a completely ridiculous storyline and the most remarkable stereotypes of the 80s as characters. Eddie, dressed up nice guy who just wants to be left alone to be different, Leslie (almost as wet as they appear), Newc (burning stones), Mom Eddie (pathetic), Roger (geek) and Ozzy as a preacher (surely Does it exist in America?). Then there are boys (rich, evil and stupid) and girls (empty, vain and stupid). What more can you ask for? <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, there is Sammy Kerr, a rock star, an amalgam of every tough 80s rocker you can think of. How about this guitar? Then there is the scene where Sammy pulls the old lady through the TV screen and smashes her. What does Roger do? Why, vacuum it like a good nerd. My favorite scene is when Tim Haney gets a long-awaited reward from Sammy using a wet thumb in a traffic jam - magic! <br /> <br /> If you were in rock music of the 80s or just like funny movies like me, then check it out. It is available on DVD and is very cheap, so (fool) treat yourself.
