When I first watched the movie, I thought it was boring, because nothing happens, but when all the scary things start to happen, like, for example, when the church dies and comes back to life, and Gage and his mother die, and The idiot must bring them back to life, although he now warns and ignores Judah. This is not the best work of Stephen King. I thought his best work was radiant. I don't think that the people who watch this movie and comment on how awful it is are wrong, because all they think is what they think. as if this person can do a better job in making a horror movie. I mean, the villain is evil, and the way he kills Judah is brilliant to turn the most innocent and unsuspecting character into one of the killers — that's cool. People who didn’t like the film are stupid, because all this is a scary movie and nothing. do not expect something from the film that it is not. this still in the general area was not so good. I still recommend people to watch a movie
