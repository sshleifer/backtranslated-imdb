I can proudly say that I own an uncut copy of this selected Crown International 70s comedy cheese on DVD. This is really a stupid and pleasant non-essential film with a pleasant, fresh and light atmosphere of the 70s. He tries to make a sincere thought that true love and friendship is more important in life than a cool set of wheels and a quick tail piece. Of course, this is, in fact, a frank youthful fantasy image - the main young hero Bobby Hamilton receives girls, the respect of his friends and the chance to show a local hooligan-rider on a van - but this is too stupid and good-natured to hate. Stuart Goetz, as our clumsy main character, makes a deservedly extravagant leadership, Deborah White, as the main object of Goetz's love, is a certain cutie, Connie Lisa Marie is also very juicy as a beautiful blonde beauty, and a mocking beef pie Neanderthal Stephan Oliver (60 years old) ) wonderfully hated as a brutal dugan hicks. Prehistory Danny DeVito, in particular, is an absolute rebellion in the role of the furious host of Andy Goetz, a pretty, ill-mannered scoundrel who wears very ugly Hawaiian shirts and suffers from serious gambling. I especially like the scene in which two thugs brutally beat Danny - one holds his hands behind his back and the other works on Danny's torso! And the sly hit song Sammy Jones hit song will bounce around your skull for at least a week. In short, this is a cool retro 70s!
