Mary Pickford (“Born on the Fourth of July” in the image of Angela Moore) - “Little American” (of French origin); She falls in love with Jack Holt (as Carl von Austreim), who moved to America with his German father and American mother. The French-American Raymond Hatton (like Count Jules de Destin from Fighting Fate) fell in love with Miss Pickford. The triangle of love trio eventually ends up in France, when the Great War (World War I, looking back) greatly complicates their lives. <br /> <br /> For the most part entertaining, albeit propaganda, the film by Cecil B. Demil. Torpedoing and sinking a ship with Pickford reminds of the Titanic. The intrigue of war becomes dramatic as Pickford slowly becomes a secret spy for France, while the Germans occupy her ancestral home. Of course, the German lover Holt arrives. It was hard to believe that they had known each other for so long when he was approaching rape, but it was dark; and previous events made them believe in each other's death. The film is TOO in its symbolism. By the way, Pickford was a Canadian, although few could deny that she was not “Little American,” despite everything. <br /> <br /> The pleasure of “extras” who later became big stars include Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - especially watching Mr. Novarro demonstrate the “star” quality during one of the most memorable episodes of the film: Pickford and the wounded soldiers greet each other when they take him on a stretcher. Novarro even makes Mary Pickford write him a letter; Obviously, he has a future in pictures. In addition, the future is associated with Ben Alexander, who plays the boy "Bobby"; he becomes a reliable child actor and grows up to become Jack Webb's partner in Dragnet. <br /> <br /> ******* Little American (7/12/17) Cecil B.
