Saw this movie twice in community shows and really loved it. I work in the Jane Finch community and I feel that the film has really absorbed some of the essence and flavor of the community - firmness, determination, abundance, creativity, in your appearance with a bit of despair. Writing, dialogue and acting are strong, and I really got involved in the story of a young woman, Raya, who is fighting to achieve her goals and not losing herself in the process. Great dance episodes, and not only the bodies move smoothly and with electricity, but the camera moves with great smoothness and intelligence. All characters are multidimensional - none of them is good or bad, and female characters are superbly strong. This is a film with a strong pounding heart, in which the irresistible spirit of youth, hip-hop and communities like Jane Finch is glorified.
