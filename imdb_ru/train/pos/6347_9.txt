How “Grinch Stole Christmas” instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from the very first viewing. Now, eight views later, he still has the same effect on me as the first time I saw him. <br /> <br /> Screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. The Seaman from the film Who Framed Roger Glory to the Rabbit did a fantastic job of adapting the story of the Grinch to the screen. The direction of Ron Howard enlivened the story, and the typically energetic performance of Jim Carrey, when Grinch steals the show. <br /> <br /> Some movie detractors claim that this does not correspond to the spirit or principles of the original story. After reading the original story, I must say that I cannot agree. The film tells the same thing about Christmas and its true meaning as in the original story. Indeed, this reinforces the influence of history, making it more personal, showing us how and why Grinch became who he was. <br /> <br /> * Soft spoilers * (They may not have spoiled the movie for you ... but if you haven’t seen it yet, and you’re one of those who don’t want to know ANYTHING about the story before you do it see, you should skip the next two paragraphs.) <br /> <br /> I think that almost everyone can relate to the terrible events of Grinch at school. I think that all of us, at one time or another, were unpopular in school, which were always chosen. I know that I was ... and that is why I personally felt such sympathy for Grinch and what he went through. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Lou, who is naive, thinking that no one can be so bad, was a heart-rending heart. When everyone else turned away from the Grinch because of fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou decided to become his friend. If everyone could have such an attitude. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the only thing that could make the film a little better is to soften the humor and content of adults even more. This was already quite restrained, but any of this adult humor (as, for example, when Grinch bumped into Marta May Kayvie’s cleavage) simply does not fit into a story like this. <br /> <br /> This is good for him. a way to become a Christmas classic, taking a deservedly deserved place next to the book and the cartoon of Chuck Jones, as a must-see place for each Christmas season.
