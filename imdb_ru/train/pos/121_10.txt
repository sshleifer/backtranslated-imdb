Critics should review what they classify as a quality film. I think that critics have seen too many action movies and have given way to the style of the Matrix films. Europe is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film. Lars von Trier shows that old filming styles can create amazing movies and create drama and tension. The effect of the rear projection, which he uses during the film, awakens and strengthens the characters and the focus of the conversation they lead. Other effects that he uses, such as color and black and white in one scene, are very similar to Hitchcock, and the girl in the red coat attracts attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene. The comment is great and has a hypnotic effect, again retaining the focus on the central characters of the scene and actions. <br /> <br /> I could talk more about the effects, but I think you will all agree that they insist the film in its category, and really strengthen the drama of the film. A film that you can buy if you donâ€™t have one yet, and see if you have it. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Don't miss this noir feature film from one of the great directors.
