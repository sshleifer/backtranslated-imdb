This is one of the best films of 2002. Maybe this is not the best film, but it looks better than anyone else; the director Sam Samdez, who debuted in American Beauty, also plays well. <br /> <br /> This tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), who was seen by his son (Tyler Hechlin) in one of his works. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks that everything will be fine, but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) substitutes both his father and Michael, which leads to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Lee) and the second son. Michael believes that Rooney is responsible, and Rooney must choose for himself and sends the killer Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected person in the organization, he is trying to win friends who can help him, including Mafia boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). <br /> <br /> In a sense, “The Road to Death” is a standard gangster movie. but it's so well done that you barely see it. This film is good at its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in cinema. All these elements are able to surprise and create tension, although the result is well defined. The fact that Hechlin is not an annoying child, and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act, of course, helps. <br /> <br /> On the basis of comics, this film is much better than you expect, and although it has its drawbacks, this refers to the best films in the genre. Sometimes things happen when you realize that you've seen it many times before, but for some reason it also seems fresh at the same time. The scenes between adult Hanks and baby Hechlin are helping in this area. Watch this movie, which will look familiar from time to time, but is completely new in many areas.
