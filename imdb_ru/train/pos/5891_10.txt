ITALIAN is an amazingly perfect movie for its time. Stunningly filmed, with lighting effects that are truly sublime, this is an early gem that clearly shows that REGINALD BARKER is a pioneer director of the same level as D.W. GRIFFYT and MORIS TURNER. Itâ€™s hard to understand how Thomas Ince controlled production, but this film still has exceptional power. The simple story of an Italian immigrant fighting to preserve his family in New York is very touching. The themes of social injustice, revenge and forgiveness are fully relevant today. The use of close-ups is outstanding, and the powerful work of GEORGE BEBAN is electrified. We need a really good print transferred to DVD so that we can truly appreciate this early film masterpiece.
