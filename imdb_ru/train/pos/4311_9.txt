This work is not so much about the character of Steve Martin as Davis, but about Klein (Mac) and Glover (Simon), as well as Klein and McDonnell (Claire), but the dialogue inserted through Davis ponders contemplative, almost poetic existentialism in his best manifestations, He is witty, intelligent and thoughtful, both in dialogue and in content. Screenwriters deserve an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The performances are light, relaxed and natural; exactly what you expect from the actors "A List". Martin contributes to the presentation that leads to his recent Saleswoman, helping you get through life, love, and the pursuit of wisdom, if not to happiness. Kline - a straight-line costume - is a conformist of the film, and therefore his work is fresh and refreshing. <br /> <br /> This work concerns life in all aspects. It creates true emotional attachments to its characters and gives you hope that Humanity is not doomed, after all, no matter what you believe in, deep down. <br /> <br /> Overall? It's amazing, with a short moment or two, and a simple natural dialogue that attracts you, helping your audience get great pleasure from this work. It is definitely worth your while, although it may not be the best choice for Friday / Saturday night entertainment. <br /> <br /> I really liked the intelligence of this exhibition. This is not typical and was an unexpected surprise. Another surprising surprise was the honesty shown here. Couples and friends have detailed conversations that sound and sound completely honest and (again) natural. I was very impressed with this work and will soon add it to the DVD collection. <br /> <br /> She estimates 9.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Monster :.
