As a person who has never played sports, it seems to me that it would be difficult for me to get into football (or, as we Americans, inexplicably, call it football) on the subject of "Bend It Like Beckham". But I have to say that it was a great movie! Anglo-Indian Jasminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her girlfriend WASP Juliet Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football (yes, I will say it in British - and abroad) and just love football player David Beckham. But the traditional Sikh parents of Jasminder disapprove (her mother offers a really broken description of football at the beginning of the film). Well, maybe it was a kind of cliché in that sense, but you have to love this movie! And if, like me, you go to this film without knowing the definition of “bending” in football ... do not worry, the film explains this (I also have never heard of David Beckham before this film). And we all know that Keira Knightley has achieved great success: a few months after BILB went to the States, she starred in the equally cool Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.
