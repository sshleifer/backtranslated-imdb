The featherweight plot and the dubious characteristics make no difference when watching a movie is as fun as this one. Live action and exciting tricks - for their day - give this film a real lightning. And there is some real comedy from torn chemistry between two leads. Quinn is also a good villain, although his role is completely clouded. <br /> <br /> But do not be fooled by the tough role of Maureen O'Hara, this is a sexist like any Hollywood movie of this era. You could forgive this because of the time in which it was done, but it is still difficult to pass. For all the heroism and terribly adult situations behind the scenes, this is still a little more than a good teenage time.
