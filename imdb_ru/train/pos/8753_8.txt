I saw this film in the theater, and was very impressed with it. On the other hand, it was then that Claire Danes was a good actress, and not the stupid, arrogant Hollywood bitch that she is today. In any case, this film really seemed to me one of the most raw, realistic, beautiful films about friendship. How far will you really go for your best friend? I was moved to tears at the end, and still cry when I watch it now (I have it). I remember, as soon as I left the theater, I called my best friend and sobbed her how much I loved her. This is a great movie to watch with your best girlfriend. However, be prepared for an almost definite conversation when she turns to you and asks if you will do something similar for her ...
