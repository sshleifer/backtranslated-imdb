This is one of the best animated family films of all time. Moreover, almost all serious competitors to this title came from the same creative thinking of Hiyao Miyazaki and his studio Ghibli. In particular, other great films include My Neighbor Totoro and Kikki Delivery Service. Spirited Away is not bad, but too creepy for a typical family fare - better for teens and adults. The only thing that distinguishes Laputo: the castle in the sky from other Miyazaki films is that itâ€™s a lot more stressful adventures. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so good? Because this is a complete package: the animation is very well done, and the plot is really exciting and exciting. <br /> <br /> Most Japanese animes are original, but decidedly dark, cynical or cruel; and the animation itself is often dried, stylized and juvenile. None of these problems plague Castle in the Sky. He has the imagination to burn, and the characters are well traced if the versions of realistic people are slightly exaggerated. (None of those posers wearing cloaks) There are many adventures, but no blood and no blood. Animation is smoothed, detailed and compiled in a cinematic ally - not a lot of flat frames. The background is wonderful. <br /> <br /> The dubbing in the dubbed English version is first-class, especially in two main roles: Pasco (James van der Beek) and Sheet (Anna Paquin). The sound engineer is great too. Use your studio sound if you have one. <br /> <br /> One aspect that I particularly liked was that most of the story remained unexplained. Laputa was once settled, and now abandoned. What for? We will never know. We know as much as we need to know, and then we just have to accept the rest, which is easy to do, because the invented world is fully realized. Indeed, it will be fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most minor characters, who are mostly one-dimensional characters (for example, a rough general, a stupid chum, a strange old miner, etc.). up to 60 years!
