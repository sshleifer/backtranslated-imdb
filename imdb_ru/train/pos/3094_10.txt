This is the best and most original show in recent years. The more I watch it, the more I fall in love with it. The cast is great, the writing is great. I personally like every character. Nevertheless, there is a favorite character for everyone, as there is a good combination of personalities and experience, as in real life. I believe that ABC did a disservice to the authors, actors, and potential audience of this show to cancel it so quickly and not enough to advertise it, or give it a real chance to get followers. Now I watch so few shows that most TVs are terrible. This show, in my opinion, was right there with my favorite Anatomy of the Gray and Brothers and Sisters. In fact, I think that the same “Brothers and Sisters” audience would love this show if they even knew about it. Why always losing shows get so much extra time, and winning shows with great potential are always discarded immediately. I'm so sick of reality shows, I don’t watch any of them. It was so great to get a new idea for the show, and then hire some great actors, this show had many promises. The recent episode was the best, since everyone started to really understand their roles and make the show so real. Please watch this show on ABC video and let ABC know that you want to return this show. PLEASE SIGN ONLINE PETITION ON ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
