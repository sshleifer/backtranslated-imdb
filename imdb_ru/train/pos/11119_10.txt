There are so many reasons why I appreciate the soprano so highly, and one of his main triumphs is the creation of characters and actors. Each character unfolds more and more of each series. In addition, each series has an array of different "small temporary characters", as well as the main one. A good example of a character (which was only in three episodes) that you can feel is the obsessive player David, who was brilliantly played by Robert Patrick. Every little detail creates the perfect series. The show revolves around Mafia boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), who is trying to balance his criminal life with the role of the father of two children. The show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and images, and this makes it so believable. While Tony manages things with Capo Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant), his nephew Christopher (Michael Imperoli) is looking for a promotion. Each episode also tells about another family of Tony, which includes his children and the wife of Carmela Soprano (Edie Falco). In addition to these problems, his uncle Junior soprano (Dominic Chianese) is trying to get the most out of Tonyâ€™s business, despite being under house arrest. All actions are powerful and complex characters, but those who stand out most are; James Gandolfini, who is the "Tony Soprano." Also Michael Imperoli, who plays Christopher, representing the young (20-30) generation in crime. If David Chase had not created this masterpiece, modern television dramas of this magnitude might not have existed, such as Wire and Dexter. So the Soprano is definitely the godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp fiction
