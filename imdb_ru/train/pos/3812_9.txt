This is a real eye candy. World consisting of floating islands and flying ancient cities. Huge monsters, whose preferred method of attack is to throw cathedrals at their opponents ... Who can resist this? An ancient prophecy, a group of losing heroes and a cute princess in search of her hero ... sounds familiar ...? Yes, we heard this song before. But you will forget about it, looking at breathtaking landscapes. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun to watch while it lasts. But after leaving the cinema you will have a little more history. <br /> <br /> What is behind the 30-year terms? What drove a horse crazy? Who built all these fabulous monuments, castles and cities ... and why are they falling apart? And besides this one group of farmers, where are the people? In fact, this picture looks so intriguing, but it is not the Lord of the Rings.
