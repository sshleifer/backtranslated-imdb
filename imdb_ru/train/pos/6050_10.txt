Finally! A decent British comedy that is not focused on some robbers of banal bullying and has not left the television series. John Ywei's film is a psychoactive story of discovery dressed in biker gear. The three main characters are gentle fools with a penchant for failure, and each of them is at a turning point in his life, giving a sensitive, emotional trio of supporting stories to sew a wild comedy. The chemistry between the three amigos is palpable and creates a touching conversation with a cheerful dialogue and some classic comedic moments. It is felt that this is part of Withnail and I, partly an American werewolf in London and partly squared (but only because of the bicycle groupings and Phil Daniels). In fact, the cute rogue Phil Daniels reminds you of Danny, the merchant of Withnail, and me, with his scientific approach and scientific commitment to drugs. This is a great movie, especially for those who have played around with psychoactive substances in the past, and will talk about many moments of the movie. The personal favorite is the glitzy scene at the Welsh corner store, buying snacks, stumbling over mushrooms. This tender comedy will warm your hearts and make you laugh out loud. And you do not need to ride bikes or even love them to enjoy it. But it will add to this if you do. Brilliant.
