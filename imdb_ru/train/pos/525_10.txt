Immediately after the end of World War II, Powell & Pressburger was asked to come up with something to try to heal the gap between the UK and the US. At that time, there were many comments like "Overpayment, for sex here too." Somehow they came up with this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie ever. He has it all. Romance, poetry, emotions, religion, drama and very quirky. <br /> <br /> I can't explain exactly why, but he pushes all the right buttons, and although I’ve seen it a hundred times (yes, really) I’m still guaranteed to cry in many moments everywhere. <br /> <br /> Was it a great game, great scenery, an inspirational script? Who knows. But * DO * watch this, and you will understand what I mean.
