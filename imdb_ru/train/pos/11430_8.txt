Unfortunately, due to the tendency of American viewers to avoid subtitles, this film has not received the distribution and attention that it deserves. His subtle themes of belonging, identity, race, and especially how colonialism harms all parties, go beyond the obvious dramatic tension, nostalgic memories of the protagonist’s childhood and the exotics of her relationship with the “householder” of her parents, perhaps the only “real” person "she knows. We will not even look at her mother’s relationship with this elegant man. There! I hope I gave you enough hook to accept it, whether you speak French or as subtitles or not. I urge you to be as brave, strong and conscious as La P'tite.
