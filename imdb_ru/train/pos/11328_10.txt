This movie is great. If you like to watch B-class movies, that is. This is a classic slasher film about the college of the 80s, in which one song sounds throughout the entire soundtrack. A terrible movie, but itâ€™s worth hiring to laugh or just see how old people run out of the cabinets with knives. It seems funny if you ask me.
