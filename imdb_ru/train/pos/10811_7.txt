This film takes you to another time when there was a different pace in everyday life. We understand how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young people to battle. A very touching look at the past and a reminder that the victims of war do not occur only at the front. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, many of us have never had to deal with what our great-grandparents or grandparents experienced, or their parents, went through during the war. This film, I think, a small thank you. Peter Outerbridge is remarkably similar to the young Peter O'Toole, and Russell Crowe is absolutely charming and as Australian as he can be. Definitely worth listening to as he reads High Flight, and makes you wonder what he can achieve with Shakespeare.
