It's a bit of a mystery to the lynch artsy crowd. They tend to write it off on something like a meaningless, rude, sideline project of Lynch. This is how Lynch lets gas pass between his real works of cinema. Well, it may be a fart, but this is one of those intriguing fartings from which you will catch a breath and you are embarrassed to admit that they like it. <br /> <br /> Dumland is driven away from this art. What can you do with aspects of modern life, but laugh at it. If you took it seriously, you would go crazy. You cling to it, smell it, taste it, feel its agony, its foolish nonsense, and then express it in any environment that you choose. This is called art, and art is not stupid. But this is Dumland.
