I watched the movie before I read the book by Michelle Magorian, and I liked both. The film, more than a book, made me come close to tears several times. This film touches the deepest moments of the human soul and never lets go. I urge as many people as possible to see this masterpiece as soon as possible and as soon as possible. I give him ten stars.
