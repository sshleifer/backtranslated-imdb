Since the saint of the Godfather was a mafia from the executive suite, this series is a complex story about the mafia from the point of view of a working man. If you have never watched this show, you will have a long pleasure. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never useless and necessary to counterpose Tony Soprano, the gangster of a thinking person, to the reality of the life in which he was born, and, frankly speaking, would never leave, even knowing how so much companions finished. Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist, then beat the man to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage, and, dismembering and getting rid of the body with his nephew, take a break, sit down and watch TV while eating peanuts. Grease the oil from the can and give this nephew advice about his upcoming marriage, as if they had just finished Sunday afternoon watching the NFL football. Even Carmella, his wife, when she is given a chance of going out, discovers that she really prefers life with Tony and the benefits that accompany her, and looks at him differently on his negligence, rather than on life. If you followed all this, you know how it ends. If you have not done so, believe me, you have never seen a television show end like this.
