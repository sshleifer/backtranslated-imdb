I have a lot of time on all Colombo films, but this one, in particular, was very well written, and the solution at the end is very effective. However, my main memory of this is the opening of the scene in the middle of the film, between Colombo and the murderer (I apologize if I did not remember exactly every detail of this). This is the most striking image of Colombo that I have ever seen: inside view of the darkness of the closet where the victim was killed, and into the room outside, lit by daylight. Colombo is sitting in a high-backed chair opposite the doorway (and us), looking at the cupboard and almost in silhouette due to the contrast in the light. There is no sound. The camera slowly leaves the room and rises to it. He is deep in meditation, gently puffing on a cigar, puffs of smoke from a cigar are slowly turning up, thinking. Then the dialogue begins. Superb.
