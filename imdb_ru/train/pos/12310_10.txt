Just read the original story written by Pu in the 18th century. Amazingly, the film describes the original spirit very well, although the plot has been greatly modified. The language of the film, rhythm, special effect - all from Hollywood, but still there is the Chinese core. It's amazing how Hark Tsui managed to unite them together. The result is pure beauty.
