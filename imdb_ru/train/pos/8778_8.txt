James Corbett, the world heavyweight champion from 1892 to 1897, turned out to be Errol Flynn's favorite role. Perhaps because he should not have wielded a sword or be in the west. He was tired of fraudsters and said in his autobiography that he felt that he was being mistreated in westerns, and he could not understand why people loved him in them. This is a pleasant film, but it is unlikely he tells the real story of James J. Corbett. <br /> <br /> As portrayed, Corbett was the first scientific boxer to win the heavyweight, a man who used brains and more speed than brute force to win. He defeated John L. Sullivan and lost to Bob Fitzsimmons a heavy crown. He was also an obsessive womanizer, and in many ways it looked like the person who depicted him. Of course, this was not shown on the screen. The character played by Alexis Smith, the banker's daughter who falls in love with him, has no basis in reality. In fact, Corbett was twice married and was blatantly unfaithful to both wives. <br /> <br /> In addition, after he lost his title and after the events of this film were completed, he experienced a great personal tragedy. His father was depressed, probably because of finances, because he lost, betting on his son to beat Bob Fitzsimmons, shot his mother and then turned the gun on himself. Murder / suicide is unlikely to coincide with the happy clan, led by Alan Hale. <br /> <br /> One thing that I liked about Gentleman Jim. Ward Bond gained a career in his life by playing John L. Sullivan. Directed by Raul Walsh, he got a great presentation from Bond as a noisy but attractive Sullivan. Even with some of the bad Sullivan moments that don't get on the screen, such as rabid racism, Bond's image is the typical John L. and the best thing about Gentleman Jim. <br /> <br /> Speaking of racism, one thing had to be explained by the fact that Sullivan while the champion refused because of the race to meet with Peter Jackson, who was black and from Australia and probably the best heavyweight of his time. I say, probably because as a challenger, Corbett met him and fought him for 61 rounds before a draw. This battle, more than any other, has created a demand for the Sullivan-Corbett title match. Of course, when Corbett was a champion, he refused to give Jackson a title shot. Perhaps he did not want another 61st marathon with someone who might have been better that day. <br /> <br /> Gentleman Jim is not the story of Jim Corbett, this is a film about Errol Flynn playing the role of James J. Corbett But Corbett, if he were alive in 1942, would undoubtedly love the film and love the image of Flynn in his life. This is the way he would like to be remembered.
