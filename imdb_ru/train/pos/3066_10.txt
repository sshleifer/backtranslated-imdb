Everyone either loves or hates this film. I go with love. It shot so well and acted so well. Beautiful. This film is for people who appreciate well-made filmmaking. If you're not a fan of well-made films, of course, you would hate it. But if you like the apex of acting, photography, history and development, look no further here.
