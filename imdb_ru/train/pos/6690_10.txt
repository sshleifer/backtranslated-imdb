Mystery Men is one of those films that is funnier over time. There is a naive innocence and “grace” to the characters. This has become part of our family “culture”, and we often quote characters. This is my favorite movie in the last two years. My children are 13 and 11 years old, and all three of us love this film. Great acting and comedy. We also love the Galaxy Quest and Monty Python movies. Well, we are not talking intellectually here, just a family connection!
