“Welcome to Collingwood” offers some of the most fun conversations lately. Watching this comedy, directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Rousseau, reminded us of maybe another movie that we saw in the past, but since we missed the opening credits, we had to wait until the end to understand what what we were reminded of was the 1958 Italian film “Big Deal in the Street of Madonna,” directed by Mario Monicelli. <br /> <br /> The brothers Rousseau assembled a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film. Everything connected with William Macy, Louis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, the late Michael Jeter, cannot be bad. Since this is an ensemble, all the characters get the opportunity to prove themselves. <br /> <br /> The film presents a group of insane, potentially safe crackers from hell. No one would have thought that these people could do work similar to the one they undertake. Everything that can go wrong, and what's more, is that they have succeeded in this. George Clooney looks like the main safe burglar, who also portrays himself imitating a rabbi, only to be confused with a priest by gang members leaving Kossimo’s funeral. <br /> <br /> The best way to enjoy a film is to sit back and relax, and let all these little scammers do their work. Let their funny lines make you laugh, because anyone can see that this gang is doomed from beginning to end!
