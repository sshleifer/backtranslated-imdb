This is a very well made movie. Acting, script and camera work are first-class. The music is also good, although this is basically the beginning of the film, when it's still quite fun. There are no superstars in the cast, although several people will be familiar. The whole cast is doing a great job with the script. <br /> <br /> But this is difficult to observe, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for inciting the Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly dividing them into two countries. From this point of view, there are some advantages, but it is also true that no one forced the Hindus and Muslims in the region to mock each other, as they did during the separation. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the contradictions between religions and were smart enough to use them for their own purposes. <br /> <br /> As a result, in this situation there is a lot of cruelty and inhumanity, and it is very unpleasant to remember and see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black and white case. On both sides there is meanness and nobility, as well as hope for changes in the younger generation. <br /> <br /> In the end, redemption occurs when Puro has to make difficult choices between men. who ruined her life, but also truly loved her and her family, who renounced her and then came to look for her. But by this moment she has no choice that will not cause her much pain. <br /> <br /> This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their own serious shortcomings, and also that both can be worthy and caring people, the reality of separation makes this awareness even more painful, since there can never be real reconciliation across the border between India and Pakistan. In this sense, he looks like “Mr. and Mrs. Ayer.” <br /> <br /> In the end, we were delighted to see the film, although the resolution was heartbreaking. If the United Kingdom and the United States could deal with their history of racism with such frankness, they would certainly be better off.
