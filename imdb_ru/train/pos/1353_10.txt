The cast of the actors is different, and now they have chosen a different approach: we have the street smart team “Networth” against. Magna’s supposed professional team, but, man, if you think that a smart street team will have problems, you’ll be right. While the Magna team struggled from time to time, the street team simply fell apart week after week. <br /> <br /> First, some things that need to be repeated, because “Pupil 3” first continues the same absurd mentality (from Trump) and the game from this series: if you are a good project manager, but you lose, the team will turn you on , and you get fired, despite the fact that your teammates are often the ones who do half the ass. It is simply absurd that a game show that claims to hire the best candidate actually “weeds out” the best, while the incapable candidates strike each other until one of them stays and this person becomes the best. lol <br /> <br /> Anyone this season we have seen a total of curses, stabs in the back and even offensive gay stereotypes when teams try to campaign. <br /> <br /> The list of victims at the moment Tara Dowdell, Audrey Evans, Danny Kastner. These three - the only thing that, I think, was unfairly dismissed by Trump, the rest of it really happened, because they only provoked conflict, anger and suffering. It's amazing how one candidate Audrey Evans told how she was fired from her job and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a game, this is a “Pupil” where manipulation, shots in the back and the always popular mentality of the rules “all come together in a project manager”. <br /> <br /> It was an exciting trip, however, candidates are given a wide range of tasks from photo shoots to mini-golf course construction, new apartment construction. <br /> <br /> However, this is still a “Pupil”, although all you can do is just laugh all the time until madness and chaos accumulate until you are lucky. this is a winner.
