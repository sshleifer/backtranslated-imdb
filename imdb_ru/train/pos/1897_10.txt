Again, it seems to me completely illogical, at least to me, that “Arthur” deserves only 6.4 out of 10 possible. Steve Gordon's one-of-a-kind masterpiece is a completely “unlikely”, if not entirely “impossible,” blend of wildly heterogeneous elements. The fact that he managed to make alcoholism friendly, and not tragic, is in itself amazing. The fact that he gave Dudley Moore his best role, and any other cinematic element in this document, his optimal influence, including the score, seems to me open and glaring. I challenge ANYONE to sit in this film and not laugh out loud. But, apparently, almost a third of his audience did so well. Well, for example, I found and found the efforts of Gordon both ridiculous and sweet, and the likeness of great-aunt Geraldine Fitzgerald and the murderous potential father-in-law of Stephen Elliott the absolute gems of secondary characters. Even the black chauffeur managed to avoid patronage, and the deceased, snuffy Sir John Gilgud was right when he accepted his fee, but he was wrong in fulfilling his role. “Arthur” doesn’t make an effort to “underestimate” or rationalize, the scourge of “alcoholism” (hey, if I’m not drunk, these are other drugs of choice, including methamphetamine, and addiction is just symptoms, not goals ) just watches in his own mocking manner.
