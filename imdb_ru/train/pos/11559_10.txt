The odd pair is a comic gem. One of the funniest scenarios ever created for celluloid - only Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski surpass it! Lemmon and Mattau are best friends: an obsessively obsessive Felix and a sloppy, irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife has already left him, because it is impossible to live with him because of his irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife leaves him at the beginning of the film, and after an unsuccessful suicide attempt, he moves with his poker friend Oscar. That's when the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The whole script is gorgeous and filled with brilliant one-liners. You are probably already familiar with "F.U." joke, but it still works brilliantly because of Mattau's comic time. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to clear his bosom at a diner, and when Dove's sisters are fascinated by the very courteous Mattau, and Lemmon is completely beyond his element. This requires re-viewing!
