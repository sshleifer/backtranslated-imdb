Before Kujo was Lucky the Devil. In 1978, on the night of Halloween, the premiere of the film “Devil Dog, Hell Dog” took place. The story of how the family got a new puppy (from a farmer who, as it turned out, was selling fruit and vegetables next door), because their dog Skipper was killed. Accident? Everyone loves a new dog, but there is something strange about it. <br /> <br /> Soon, father Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, First Blood) begins to notice. His wife Betty (Yvette Mime, “Where the Boys Are”, Jackson County Jail, “The Snow Beast”) distinguishes his children Charlie and Bonnie (Hayk Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vurazh and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Nanny and Professor, Hi Larry Tuff-Turf) also changed. Does the dog have anything to do with it? He is determined to find out and do everything possible to save his family. <br /> <br /> This film is great because in it Ike and Kim play a darker side of themselves than what we saw in those witch movies. This is one of the many horror films made for television in the 1970s that were really scary for a horror movie made for television. The music was creepy, and even the finale, which I won’t say, made you think. <br /> <br /> Ken Kercheval (Cliff Barnes from Dallas) and R.G. also starred in this film. Armstrong (who could not stay away from the devil films, remember "Race with the Devil"?) <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
