This western is made differently than most others. Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell comes to Wyoming to work for Rip Thorne at his ranch. How it is presented makes for the most interesting piece of Americana. I would prefer to see it on the big screen, not on the film, but it's worth seeing how life has returned to the real West. Cinematography is excellent. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell stand out in this film.
