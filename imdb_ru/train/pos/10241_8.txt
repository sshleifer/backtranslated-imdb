I try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, but I was stunned when I saw a rating of 5.4 for one of my favorite childhood children. At 17, this doesn’t surprise me so much, but as a family movie, it’s a sweet and kind movie. Children will love this, and they will not pay attention to the shortcomings, and adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the film’s subconscious message. None of the films was preached in any way, in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness. I admit, however, that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes, such as the death of Scriveys (which still makes me angry), can be a bit scary. But the animation is much higher than average with nice colors and good character animation. The music of James Horner is very beautiful, and the song shown is catchy, catchy and fun. I really liked the characters, Louis is probably the deepest of them, but dinosaurs were at least attractive. Martin Short’s clown was both cheerful and decisive when he said to Skrivaysu: “I'm leaving!” Me in stitches. My favorite Screweyes, though, is an effective villain who is cunning, and I suppose clever. Although, if anything, I would like the film to be in the part where it explains how he lost his sight and why he is afraid of the crows, because in this way he could be more advanced in terms of depth. The script, although not worthy of Oscar, has its funny and heartbreaking parts and should entertain children and adults. The voice acting for me was what the film did. John Goodman, Martin Short, Ray Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Erdley Smith all showed solid results, but Kenneth Mars should be especially mentioned because he was great in the role of Scrivies and almost unrecognizable. In general, this is a good movie. Honestly, I do not get a rating. Of course, this film is not perfect, and it is not as good as a film about dinosaurs, for example, “Earth to Time”, but it is fun. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
