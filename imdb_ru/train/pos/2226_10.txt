I am surprised at the low IMDb rating of this movie. With all due respect, his low rating reflects the IQ level of those who rated him so badly. They would prefer to watch a movie with cheap sensations, a big budget and lots of blood. <br /> <br /> The first misconception of people is that this is a horror movie. This is not the case, and the film does not mislead you that he is alone. This is a psychological thriller. This is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie. Reel.com review is a great example of how I feel about this movie. All other negative reviews do not make much sense. It's almost as if trying to make an original film for a change - very rare these days - is something bad and not worth it. <br /> <br /> I’ll show a few spoilers for idiots who said it was boring and didn’t make much sense. Martha was brainwashed and experimented on herself to be a caring mother, while she really was an evil Nazi who killed without warning. All this is in the pudding, and the fact that when we first view, we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster throughout the film, shows the direction and writing of the film. <br /> <br /> I definitely feel that this film should be at least rated in the range of 6 points only for originality. I recommend this film to people on the other end of the IQ scale, that is, to smart people, because this film is clearly being cut by those who would prefer to watch “Freak's Nightmare” or <br /> <br /> Glory to acting skills also. For such a low-budget film, you are surprised that this film did not make it to your local cinema with great directing, screenplay and acting skills. Please do not be fooled by IMDb rating. This movie is worth it. I actually recommend buying a movie, since the first viewing on the rental will not be fair.
