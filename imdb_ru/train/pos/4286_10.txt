I saw this film (its English name is "Who Sings There?") In 1980 at the Montreal International Film Festival. Then he won a rave ... and disappeared. A terrible shame. It's great. Sublime, funny, sad and extremely funny. The script is a work of art. 19 years have passed, and I have only seen a few comedies (or any other genre, for that matter), which can match its originality.
