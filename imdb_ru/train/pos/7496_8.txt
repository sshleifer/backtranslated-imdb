<br /> <br /> I disagree with the comments of other reviewers for the simple reason that it is a SECRET FILM, and not a supernatural! This is not the only film that has a seemingly "supernatural" explanation ("vampires"), but it turns out to be very random. <br /> <br /> Other films that come to mind are Edgar Wallace's “Until Dawn”. and the (better known) Vampire Mark. <br /> <br /> The film makes a WONDERFUL job of creating a very “creepy atmosphere” similar to DRACULA when Renfield encounters a count on the stairs of his castle or in “VAMPIRA MARK” when two people look through the windows of the castle ruins and see how the "corpse" plays the organ, and the moon descends using the wings! VERY surreal! <br /> <br /> If someone likes these (often silent) atmospheric touches, THIS movie is OBLIGED! <br /> <br /> Norm Vogel
