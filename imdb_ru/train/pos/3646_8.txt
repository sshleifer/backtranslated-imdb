Walt Disney's “Newcomer” is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former low-league PR person who made one of the most amazing returns in the history of sports, completing a nearly 10-year retirement and debuting in the Major Leagues in 1999 at the age of 35. /> <br /> The film opens with a brief overview of Morris's childhood, which included a series of moves - his father was a military man. And even when his family stayed forever in crazy football from Texas, Morris' passion for baseball remained strong. <br /> <br /> The childhood segment then jumps forward by about 23 years to adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid), who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School (in real life, it was Reagan County High School in Big Lake, Texas). It is mentioned that he tried to make a career as a baseball player, but it did not work. <br /> <br /> The Morris team struggles, and he lectures them on how to part with their dreams. They turn the table over to him, telling him that he should try himself in the Major League team. Several times when he trains them in practice, they are surprised at the speed with which he throws. Morris seems unconvincing, but agrees to a deal with his players, in which, if they win the district, he will try to play in the High League team. <br /> <br /> Big Lake really wins the county and, sticking to its end of the bargain, Morris visits the Tampa Bay Devil Rays to try. Phenomenally, he throws 98 miles per hour - faster than he threw during his minor league career and outstanding speed, even for a Major League pitcher. After another attempt with the team, Morris is offered a contract with the rays of the devil. <br /> <br /> This leaves him with a difficult decision - to stay in his comfortable life or to fulfill his Major League dream again, going through a minor league - make little money and spend months away from home. And the decision is even more painful than during his first stay in the little league, because he now has a wife and three children. <br /> <br /> Morris signs a contract with Devil Rays, starts at AA level and quickly rises to AAA Level, one level lower than Major League Baseball. But as the season comes to an end, the chances that it will be “called out” are becoming less and less. <br /> <br /> For the most part I love this movie. There are a lot of great performances and nice characters, and it's easy to find yourself really appealing to Morris. In addition, the film perfectly copes with the image of professional baseball at the level of the highest, and in the highest league. And most importantly, he teaches a timeless message about how to hold tight to your dreams, even if they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve. <br /> <br /> However, the film has some flaws. Although generally accurate, he exaggerates and even manufactures several things. Check out http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples. In addition, with the exception of one scene in which he prays with his players, the film completely ignores Morris's Christian faith. But given the eagerness of Disney's left wing, this is not surprising. <br /> <br /> Presumably, a lot of exaggeration / fiction was made to make the story more dramatic. However, the 20-minute documentary on Morris, which is included on the DVD, contains some information that makes his story more dramatic, but is excluded from the film. <br /> <br /> For example, from birth until his family settled in Texas forever when he was 12 years old, Morris moved 14 times. And his initial career in the major leagues ended after four operations, as a result of which he lost half of the muscles in his left (inclined) shoulder, which made his acceleration of 98 miles per hour even more inexplicable. <br /> <br /> In order to fully appreciate and understand the story of Jim Morris, it is good not only to watch "Beginner", but also to watch a documentary on DVD, check out the aforementioned reference to the inaccuracies of the film and maybe also read Morris's biography, also entitled "Newbie". I have not read the book, but I hope for one of these days. <br /> <br /> But in general, “Novice” is a very good depiction of a wonderful story and a powerful testimony to the power of dreams. and the triumph of the common man. 8/10
