I am very sorry for people who go to the movies with a notebook and a pencil to write down the flaws and keep records about how bad the movie is. I feel the same contempt for people who go to the cinema and cannot stop reality and / or allow themselves to enjoy 90 minutes from their boring or busy life! Get GRIP people. ECGTB is a very interesting movie. If you take films seriously, this is NOT for you. If you expect the movie to resemble a book in any way, this is not for you. But if you like the sheer joy of Priscilla, the queen of the desert, or “what the hell am I watching” Moulin Rouge. Or comedy "The sweetest", and then allow yourself to escape in the "Shepherds". It has some really funny parts. Cheerful really. He also has really good music, fame kd.lang. In addition, I mentioned that he has 90 minutes of Uma Thurman ..... should I say more?
