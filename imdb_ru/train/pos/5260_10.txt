Yes, it may be stupid and may not seem as funny as many big-budget comedies, but this film is really fun if you really watch it. Tim Meadows always seemed funny to me with the Saturday Night show. Whenever he did this character in the show, I laughed. So after I saw that it would play at Comedy Central one evening, I decided to check it out. Overall, I was very impressed with this film because it was not meant to win an Oscar or become a comedy of the year, but it really entertained the fans of Saturday Night Live, who love Ladies Man. This film also contains several quotes that can be read for years to come.
