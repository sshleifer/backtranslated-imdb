Popular radio narrator Gabriel Nobody (Robin Williams, meager and speaking in quiet hypnotic tones) meets and befriends a fourteen-year-old boy from Wisconsin named Pete Logand (Rory Culkin), who wrote a book detailing the sexual abuse of his parents. In addition, Pete has AIDS, and this makes Gabriel even more, because his partner Jess (Bobby Cannavale, well) has experienced HIV himself. <br /> <br /> He also meets Peteâ€™s guardian, a woman named Donna (Tony Collett, great!), and when Gabriel decides to meet and talk to both of them personally, he goes to Wisconsin, he discovers some secrets that he was (naturally) not ready to find. <br /> <br /> Based on real events that happened to Armistead Mopin (who wrote the script with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner, this film moves much faster (90 minutes, maybe a few minutes longer), than one might think a film of this genre would work. This is good because it makes the action and storyline lean and clear. Bad, because it leaves a variety of holes in the plot and does not sew up any of the hole holes or background. I would prefer not to go into details, except to say that if you are not familiar with the works of Mr. Maupin or his personal history, you feel a little out of touch. However, Williams' performances (I would love to hear more of his narration, personally), Collette, Kannavale, Calkin and many other actors (the waitress at Collete's Donna restaurant often does a great job with a small part) she has first-class and good mood here - namely, the cold, lonely dark exteriors of Wisconsin and New York - provide a terrific setting for this story. He may have ends that are not particularly well connected with each other, but this is still a convincing enough story to stick with.
