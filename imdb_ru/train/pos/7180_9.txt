Perverted, weird, charming and fun! I could not stop laughing while watching this movie. Darren Stein presents the films he shot on a family video camera that grew up in Southern California in the 1980s. This is an interesting look at a novice director, his motives and ability to manipulate for the camera. Manipulation is a strong word, but don't we watch films that are somehow manipulated? <br /> <br /> From the very beginning I was surprised by the fact that the boys in the films seemed to be shirtless as possible. Later, Darren comments on his incipient homosexuality, and you can see it by hints (big hints!) Brightness at an early age. Maybe it was just warm weather in Southern California, who knows? Being gay, who also grew up in an educational environment, it's nice to see that his parents supported and loved him, and that his friends seemed to be fascinated by his nascent talent for the lens. <br /> <br /> "Put the camera on me" offers a look at the 80s, untouched by commercialism. You will remember hair, music and fashion. I am of the same age as Mr. Stein, so the return to the past was long-awaited. His solo a lip sync dance number is priceless, complemented by a Frankie Goes Hollywood T-shirt. <br /> <br /> Films are dedicated to dark themes. Child abuse, Holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasy and social dysfunction .No childhood is completely carefree and the way stein works with these items Etami, at least interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye out for convenience!
