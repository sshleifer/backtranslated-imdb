Just considering the fact that it is based on the most notorious mass suicide incident of our time, it would be enough to draw attention to this film, made in 1980 for television. But the fact is that this is an excellent re-creation of the life of Rev. Jim Jones, who built the church into a virtual empire and then urged it to disintegrate into a dirty cult in which the congressman and his entourage were killed, and 917 followers of the cult committed suicide by drinking Kool- Aid soaked in cyanide. <br /> <br /> Made very tastefully, but horribly enough, unlike the painful sadism of CULT OF THE DAMNED, GUYANA TRAGEDY with the participation of all the stars, including Ned Beatty (as Rep. Leo Ryan), Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brad Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, Levar Burton and Madge Sinclair. But it was Powers Booth (in his first big role) that really stands out as Jim Jones. He actually becomes a man, and his performance is exciting and intimidating. Thus, it is not surprising that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years.
