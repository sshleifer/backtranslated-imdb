Legend of Tsu <br /> <br /> I remember well the original Tsu warriors of Tsu Warriors, created 18 years earlier. For one Christmas, on a rare week, when Channel 4 in the UK showed a week of Hong Kong films, Zu Warriors was so exciting for a very young audience and his brother, and so memorable that she captured the memory of the now grown up sprog ... < br /> <br /> Actually, I think the original Zu Warriors is one of the earliest films I saw in my childhood, from which I can clearly remember the storyline and action films. And the memories of seeing Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and others in their classic prime. <br /> <br /> So when I saw this remake of the Warriors of Zu, I had a feeling of fear. Can he surpass my dreamy childhood memories of the original, or will he follow the path of other remakes and die a more terrible death than the villains and their broken necks that you will find in these kung-fu movies? <br /> <br /> Well, I can’t say the answer. But this is because it is not really a remake. The stories (and styles) are almost completely different. <br /> <br /> Legend of Zoo tells the story of King Skye, a lonely warrior whose owner, Don, declares his love for him, but her life is taken from her by a monster named Insomnia. Two hundred years later, Insomnia returns, Dawn reincarnates into Enigma, and Insomnia returns to destroy Zu. Meanwhile, White Eyebrows and Reds are trying to stop Insomnia with the help of King Sky. <br /> <br /> The plot is not replete with twists, but there were enough details in it to interest me. But I can see this film as one that you either love or hate. The film is dedicated to special effects, most of which are devoted to several computer environments, such as The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two, this film did not overdo it with graphics, and everything was tasteful. Nothing seems urgent - unlike the hero. Backgrounds complemented the action and did not suppress the scene at all. <br /> <br /> There are many characters in the plot, and the confusion of many people makes the film intriguing. Perhaps it was on the verge of “too many cooks,” but, as a rule, each character played a part in the story. But some of the roles, in my opinion, are “extended cameos,” and for some reason I have little to doubt about the need for this. <br /> <br /> Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo play central roles in the film, but I cannot say that this film showed its best performances. Cecilia Cheung seems to have at least matured in her game, but she is still pretty raw. Kelly Lin was a new revelation to me. Despite her very short role, I apologize and confess that I was bare! <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to say that I liked this film just as much as I liked the “original”. Given that both films were shot by the legendary Cui Hark, both films together are part of a chronicle showing how the film industry in Hong Kong has changed over two decades. And one of the charms of this fact is that you cannot compare these two films at all, because apples are apples and pears are pears. <br /> <br /> In the end, both films are very pleasant in their own right. And I come back to the memories, looking through the original again. <br /> <br /> Two, to see, but not to compare.
