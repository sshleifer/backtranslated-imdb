Lion King 1 1/2 is a very fun and exciting sequel. Do not expect a theatrical release, but expect the highest quality direct release video. <br /> <br /> It is installed when Timon and Pumba begin to watch the original Lion King in a darkened theater. and drastically switch tracks and start telling your own story. This is done with frequent comedic breaks. For example, in one particular tense moment, an advertisement for home shopping appears, and the distressed Pumba realizes that he has sat down at the console. These little moments pervade the film, and whether you find them interesting or not will largely depend on your sense of humor. If you are particularly concerned about movies that intentionally remind the viewer that he is watching a movie, then this may not be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Animation is the best they have put into the Disney DTV line, and integrates with the original material almost without any problems. Newer, independent material uses a lot of the original art style. All voice talents performed well, although I could not help thinking of Marge Simpson every time I heard Julia Kavner. <br /> <br /> Many of the jokes in the film will be well recognized by viewers as processed over generations, but are more familiar with the wackes of old friends than annoyingly repetitive. <br /> <br /> The music made me realize how much I liked it and skip a good musical integrated with Disney. The sock opening function in “Dig A Tunnel” is well set and fun. Timon and Pumba took up the initial sequence of the Lion King and their acquaintance with paradise is also funny. The only problem was the repetition of “Dig A Tunnel” at the end of the film, switching its lyrics and melodies from defeatism to rise. <br /> <br /> The storyline is pretty well done, and the integration of the new elements of the plot is almost perfect, although the last bit during the chase for the hyena slightly stretched the credibility of the storyline. The new story does not seem to handle the saccharin or emotionally charged moments too well, and it does it better when it resorts to a full comedy. <br /> <br /> Overall, worth buying. If you like all the bonus features that come with a typical set of two discs, then do it. Pincher Pincher, who is still willing to invest in a good movie, wait until it falls from four or more dollars and immediately rent it. <br /> <br /> Damon Crowley.
