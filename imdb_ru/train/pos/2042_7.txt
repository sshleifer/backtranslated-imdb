RATING STARS: ***** Missed **** Very good *** Good ** You could instead go for food * Avoid at all costs <br /> <br /> Naughty career bitch Kate (Frank Potente goes to London subway to take the train to take her to meet with George Clooney. However, after a busy day, she dozed off and woke up to be alone on a deserted platform. However, when she runs from the situation as a result one difficult meeting to another, she learns about something much more sinister and evil, waiting it is there. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the British Film Industry is truly becoming self-sufficient, especially in the horror department, with films such as Creep and 28 Days Later (in part it has echoes). success in what Creep intended to do really deftly creates (especially at the beginning) a terrible feeling of isolation and tense fear. high-level concept I'm from the '70s, which are based on shock and awe, not too focusing on character development and such. <br /> <br /> Because of their weaknesses, some scenes are a bit predictable, but in fact they cannot make it less frightening or effective. I am not sure that the final should have made it something of a moral game, and it’s not quite perfect, but it’s certainly very effective and performs its main function well. ***
