If you're younger than 13 or over 13 years old and are pretty drunk, you'll love D-war. If you seriously love all kinds of brainless action movies, you will love D-war. Otherwise, do not worry! Today I saw a movie with my nephews and 3 of their friends. They really loved it, and it made me feel good. After the end of the film, all the children (my nephews and their friends) could not thank me for taking them to the theater. <br /> <br /> CG is good. Acting and directing are terrible. The plot is very simple. But since half the audience was children, they shouted, shouted and cheered each time the dragons appeared on the screen. This made the viewing process much more exciting than it should have been. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to bring your children to, but with the exception of the final battle, D-War is disappointing. I give this film 7 out of 10, mainly because children love it so much.
