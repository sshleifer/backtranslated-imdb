I have never heard of a book and did not want to read it, but a film that I’ll probably see many times. <br /> <br /> This film is unforgettable, perhaps with the richest images I have ever seen in a movie. It’s like I’ve looked at pictures many times, and I think it was an idea. <br /> <br /> Awesome movie, story, actors and cinema. Full of deep emotions from all sides. Although I do not particularly like romantic films, I really liked it, and in the end Winona Ryder’s request to her father was deeply affected. <br /> <br /> Mr. Irons deserved an award for his performance, and Close was never better. <br /> <br />
