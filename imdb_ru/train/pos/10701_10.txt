Critics did not like this film. He bombed the States and as a result received only a limited show in the UK. It was a great shame, because it represents more British, not American humor and should have been shown in Britain first. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman looks amazing and absolutely convincingly Russian. Ben Chaplin is Dustin Hoffman's character from The Graduate, and the Birthday party has at least 4 scenes that remind the viewer of the classics of the 1960s (despite the fact that this is a completely different story!). <br /> <br /> Of course, he changes course a few times: from comedy to black comedy, from thriller to adventure - but it is memorable, touching, and a breath of fresh air compared to the average megabyte blockbuster. open mind!
