"Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain" was and still is an impressive classic! You would never have guessed that it was made in 1983. The use of special effects by Tsui Hark was very creative and inventive. (He continued to do this in the Chinese trilogy Ghost Story and later productions.) Even now, this can be compared to other films in this genre. "The Legend of Zu" is associated with "Zu" warriors from the magic mountain "! There is no need to watch this film to understand the plot of it. The plot is a bit difficult to understand. But, frankly, it is not so" It does not matter. It's all about action and adventure! I always wondered what Tsui Hark would do if he got CGI. Now we know that he made this film. Maybe sometimes it is too much, but the overall result is so great that I will not be critical of it. There is so much on the screen that you just wonâ€™t believe! I think it's a big shame that this film was not shown in cinemas here in Holland. The film is screaming about screen time in movie theaters! This film can easily outperform large budget Hollywood productions, such as Superman Returns or Xmen 3. The only thing I have to mention is the lack of humor! , fantasy, martial arts and humor. Somehow this is missing in this film. Again, I'm not going to be picky but these little things. "Legend of Zu" offers the most beautiful special effects that you will see. A real classic!
