It was a favorite of my childhood - I remember seeing it on TV and admiring it every time. Now that I've grown up and I have my own child, I wanted to introduce him to this classic film. We watched it last Friday and liked it. During the battle of Abu with a giant spider, my son's hand crept up and grabbed mine - he was genuinely scared. "Is he going to defeat the spider, Popp?" Just watch, you will see. He has no historical reference system, which could be talked about (eight years), so Baghdad under the grandson of Harun al-Rashid may well be Oz near Ozma. <br /> <br /> I think he especially liked how much heroism and madness were accomplished by a boy-thief, and not an adult king. In fact, if one deconstructs the film's narration a little, the king is an assistant thief and not a hero in general - which should be very pleasant for creative, enterprising youths. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a historical play - I suspect that by the time he is eleven or twelve my son will find it “trite” or by any other word that the next generation will use. A love story is hardly one-dimensional - as a cynical friend said: “Why does Ahmad love a princess? Because this requires narration. " Abu’s willingness to put himself at risk (repeatedly) for an ignorant, overwhelmed king struck with love is equally unlikely. But to argue about such things, taking flying mechanical horses, fifty-foot jinn and the Temple of the All-Seeing Eye, would be utterly stupid. The satisfaction of the fact that the prophecy was fulfilled at the climax of the film is immense, as was Abu’s last shot triumphantly flying away on his (stolen) magic carpet, looking for “fun and adventure at last!”
