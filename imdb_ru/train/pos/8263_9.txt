This film, along with WESTFRONT of 1918, are my favorite films made by Pabst, and I enjoyed them more than his much more famous films, which featured Louise Brooks (for example, PANDORA'S BOX). Probably because both are very similar to the films of neorealists, which the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style of film is designed to use non-actors (just typical people) in everyday situations to create exciting and realistic films. <br /> <br /> In this case, the film is about French and German miners, so accordingly, people in roles seem to be miners, not actors. The central conflict at the beginning of the film is that there is a huge mine at the French-German border. Instead of one big mine, it is divided at the border, and German workers are not welcome at the French mine, despite the fact that unemployment is rising in Germany. This, language differences (remarkably illustrated in the dance hall scene) and World War I conspired to create a huge gap between the factions, which led to the “WE are against THEIR” mentality. Later, the explosion causes a huge collapse in France, and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. Fearing their own lives, they argue that between the miners and the people in general, there is real friendly communication. <br /> <br /> The film is strongly criticized for xenophobia and tries in vain to make the German audience see the futility of war and hatred. It was an amazingly touching movie with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I've ever seen. However, given the story, the film’s influence was minimal at best. This is a real shame, as in this, WESTFRONT 1918, JÁACCUSE (Hans) and ALL THE SILENT ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) were great messages of peace and harmony, but ultimately they were failures in positive fluctuations in public opinion. So, from a historical point of view, this is an amazing and sad relic worth seeing.
