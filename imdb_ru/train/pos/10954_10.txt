Sarah Silverman looks like Zooey Deschanel’s completely insane, and I think I'm already in love. Yes, if you loved Jesus - this is Magic, you will like it. If you have not done that, what the hell is wrong with you? Kudos to the Comedy Channel for putting it to me. My life finally made sense, and “Your car smells like a fart” - my humor. I am a happy guy. In the first episode, I laughed hysterically, and I look forward to the next week. This is how Grease meets South Park. Totally outrageous. Sarah Silverman is someone I can watch while reading the phone book. Her delivery is accurate and oh, so funny. She never misses a beat. If you think this is not so much her choice of material. By the way, this is really good stuff, as she selects it for delivery. Thank you, Sarah Silverman! Thanks, Comedy Channel!
