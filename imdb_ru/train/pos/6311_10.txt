This film is very funny, and it has a great selection of actors like William H. Macy, who always play such roles, perhaps his most representative Fargo; and George Clooney, a very good actor showing his comic works in the Coen brothers' film “Oh, brother, where are you?” which became one of my favorite films! But it was hard to find “Welcome to Collinwood,” here in Mexico. In my city there are no good places where you can buy good movies. I tried to buy it at Blockbuster, but they don’t know it by its original name, so it might be a little easier to find if I have a name they gave it in Mexico, does anyone know this? Because I can I do not remember! Greetings. A.
