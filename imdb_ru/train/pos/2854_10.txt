Much has already been said about this film, and I would like to join those who praised him. This is a completely unique film, which uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster film, without any problems. In some moments, you just laugh out loud, in others - the feelings of the characters, whose mistakes and failures you observe. Genu Sabu can be shown in relation to some episodes of the film. One of them is that when all three men chase each other, they have an erotic day dream about a young woman whom they have just passed on the street. This sequence is beautifully made and well illustrated by the characters of all three runners. It is erotic and funny at the same time. Another example of the genius of Sabu is the part of the film where the runners get tired. The first one, the typical loser among the three guys, hallucinates that the woman who left him for someone else has returned, and you see how they dance with each other, and in the next picture he dances with himself who moves deeply . All the runners reach this point where they think they have returned something, they have lost or are on the move again. And in one part of the movie, they stop chasing each other, run in line, just laugh. This is the whole charm and absurdity of what we call the life that Sabu manages to show throughout the film. His characters fail (are they at the end?), But he does not deprive them of their dignity. “Monday” and “Postman Blues,” which justify Sabu's claim that he is a genius. Go and look at them! <br /> <br />
