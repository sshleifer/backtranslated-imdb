What an exciting movie. Even if it was not based on real life, the Forbidden Lie was an exciting portrait of a con artist in its element. And this is the type of film psychology that students can learn to learn about obsessive liars. <br /> <br /> The author of “Forbidden Love”, Norma, was revealed as a fraud in the media, but this step really gives her ample opportunities. to clear her name. <br /> <br /> But the turns with which she takes the documentary master are amazing. What a patient woman! I like this movie. I did not read the book, but simply heard good reviews and went to watch it on a boring rainy day. The journey in which this film is waiting for you is smart, interesting and exciting.
