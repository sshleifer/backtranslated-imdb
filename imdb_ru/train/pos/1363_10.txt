Great movie of the 90s! Parker Posey is incredible in this story about the nightlife of Manhattan, which requires so much money. Posey gives you a terrific job as a librarian and slider. This is a good, lightweight movie for Saturday night before leaving. The soundtrack is swinging, outfits from this world, the script is funny, and the actors do an excellent job. Redemptive value: you can do it in this world, if you try, just find your niche. I believe that Parker Posey is the PERFECT actress for such a character: young, incredible, and carefree. (You should watch the movie “Hour hours”). If you watch Party Girl, you will surely have a good time. Enjoy!
