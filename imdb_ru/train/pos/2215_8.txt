I bought The Feast of All Saints, and this is not a terrible film, but much could be better. It had a great historical value, played by a very talented actress / actors, and the actors could not play such a role and make it somewhat believable. There were some roles that were a bit mediocre and confusing, but I would not say that the whole movie was terrible. If you think about it, capture New Orleans from the 1800s and make something out of it, then it is quite difficult and much more difficult to find actors who can clearly identify these roles. But the only big problem I encountered in the film was that most of the actors who played free colored people were mostly fair-skinned Africans, not very versatile in filming those who were not light-skinned; one of the old Creole stereotypes that still exists. Whoever participated in the casting could choose a wider variety when it comes to shade, despite the fact that many Creoles consider color. Most likely, the choice of actors who in a sense looked almost white could have been more thoughtful. The actors did a great job, the script could have been better written, and in general I found the performances to be very believable.
