Bloody gangster story that unfolds during the Great Depression. This tells us about another notorious killer, Michael (Mike) Sullivan. For some reason, this time the story turns the other way around: Mike struggles to save his life and his only remaining son, because the rest of his family was killed because of the dirty play of his own boss. He succeeds in his revenge and provides an honorable future for his son, but in the end he is killed. Such stories never have a happy ending. <br /> <br /> The role of Mike Sullivan Sr. was wonderfully played by Tom Hanks, and the role of Mr. Rooney (mafia boss) was played by Paul Newman. The film makes a big impression, and we hear the famous phrase “we rob banks”. This film is still worth seeing, although you could expect more from Sam Mendes after his American Beauty.
