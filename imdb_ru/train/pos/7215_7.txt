FULL SPOILER. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty quick and exciting crime thriller, based on a play by Ira Levin about two funny playwrights (Kane and Reeve) who are preparing a story about the murder of their rich wife (Cannon) in order to get property and insurance. The plot is successful, but Christopher Reeve, as the younger and less authoritative of the two authors, decides to make a play of the actual murder - with a few changes in the details. Reeve assumes that in a scenario, for example, Eastampton, Long Island, can become Southampton, Long Island. The rest of the plot of the play is a dead sale, and, in truth, Reeve does not object to a little gossip or even an investigation into the accidental death of Cannon. This will increase revenue and its own Warhol ratio. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is Sydney Brül, a megaback playwright whose last four performances have been bombed and who would like nothing but to quietly return to work on a new game, possibly involving Riva, who would have bought back his reputation. He cannot allow Riva's scandalous game to be produced. So what else? - he is trying to kill him. In the end, they kill each other, the manuscript is assigned to their neighbor, psychic Helga Tensdurp, and she earns a million dollars by selling her to Broadway. <br /> <br /> This is a lot of fun for a number of reasons. One of them is the design of production. This multi-storey, multi-storey house with a large windmill on the top, located on nine of what should be the most valuable acre on earth (Eastgampton!), Would be a great set of excavations anywhere. You can't afford a puppy tent at Easthamptome. The house is not too big or baroque. It's just superbly modest, although for my taste it is a bit neat, such a clean house, that you are afraid to step on a thick carpet, afraid to leave a footprint. <br /> <br /> Next, acting skills can hardly be improved. Kane, Cannon and Fred Jones are great. Dayan Cannon shows excellent characteristics, like an agitated wife, whose pants are so tight that they look as if they were sprayed on, which is quite normal, given her assets. It seems that even Reeve, whose talent was limited, found a comfortable niche in the role of a friendly but psychopathic killer. Irene Wort, as Helga's psychic neighbor, was in some way difficult to determine, a mistake. Of course, she - or someone like her - was needed for the conspiracy, but, my God, what an offensive bias her character is to walk around and say: “I feel pain in it!” I suppose to make her a little more interesting, she got up in sweat and in a stupid hat with bicycle reflectors. However, it delivers inconvenience from start to finish. <br /> <br /> You should like the bitchy dialogue of Ira Levin. A distraught Kane pleads with Riva to tell him why he wrote the production play. "Because it is there, Sydney!" says Reeve, and Kane shouts: “These are MOUNTAINS, not PLAYS! There will be no games until some hole DOES NOT RECORD them! ”Kane’s great call to the police after his wife was scared dead, as planned. He turns herself into a stream of sobs, barely able to speak, as he reports the incident and begs to send an ambulance immediately. When he hangs up, his face takes on his usual calm expression, he blows his nose into a handkerchief and leaves, again, everything. <br /> <br /> The climax, although quite ironic, is confusing, noisy and full lacks the evil charm that Levin and Lumet brought to earlier scenes. The score mainly consists of careless riffs on the harpsichord that fit neatly into the film. <br /> <br /> You will probably like it.
