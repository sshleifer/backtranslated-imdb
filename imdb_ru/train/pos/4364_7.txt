I never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor until “Rob Roy” was released, but the film is definitely worth seeing. Playing the title character, Liam Neeson brings the same spirit to the role he brought to Oscar Shindler, and Jessica Lange also does an excellent job with his wife, Mary. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) - one person who is very likely to cause your skin to crawl. <br /> <br /> In general, it works as well as Braveheart (perhaps even better). I laugh when I think about how Hollywood produced two films, almost back-to-back, taking a punch in England. Fine. Also starring John Hurt, Eric Stolz, Brian Cox and Jason Fleming.
