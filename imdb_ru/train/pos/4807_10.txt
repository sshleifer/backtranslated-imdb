I really thought this movie was excellent. Not only is the story true, but the style is luxurious and yet close. I was a fan of how Emily Blunt portrayed Victoria and how she kept her spirit, despite the fact that she was forced into virtual exile in her youth. Blunt portrays the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner in which Vicotria became famous (perhaps notorious). The romantic elements of the film are so sincere and gentle that by the end of the film you really understand why Vicotria decided to live the rest of the day in Albert's mourning. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film also deserve attention. I highly appreciated the excellent music score, which moves beautifully along with the dramatic course of history. I also considered cinematography outstanding, some scenes make me gasp because of the pomp and splendor that they portray. <br /> <br /> This year there were so few films as beautiful and tender as this film, and it is valued as one of the best in 2009!
