Wow, this movie was just great. I really do not know why everyone says it is a slow pace. I thought the pace was perfect. The film tells about Michael Sullivan, who was perfectly played by Tom Hanks, who is a kind of killer killer working for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He does not like this job, but does it because Rooney paid for his house and helps him financially. He had nothing, and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But his children do not know that this is his work, and when he witnesses a cold-blooded murder, he finds himself in an awkward position. And when an atrocity happens, he leaves with his son and seeks revenge. They rob Awanks and more and build a connection. They are the perfect team. Hanks, as always, does an excellent job, as does Jude Law, who plays his terrible role to perfection. This drama is highly recommended because it shows a beautiful story and largely shows how the 30s were.
