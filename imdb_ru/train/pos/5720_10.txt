I saw "The Grudge" yesterday, and wow ... I was really scared, good thing. I love horror movies, and I really liked this one. There were so many "unexpected" scenes (what is the English word?) That made you jump into your seat. Although too many cries from the audience prevented not to laugh. I think the worst scene was ... on the bus, when the face flashed in the window or when Yoko walked without a chin. Makeup is also VERY good. Sometimes you could actually see that it was there, but it still added a strange look to the scene. The boy was really very good, so cute without makeup and terribly scary. The next time I hear a crash, I will probably be very scared ...
