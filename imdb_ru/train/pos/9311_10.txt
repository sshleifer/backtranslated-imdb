It was the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was also the best movie. Sci Fi original movies must be bad, that's what makes them fun! The line "I love that my dinosaur meat is well done!" This is probably the best quote! In addition, the plot sounds like something from a dream caused by a pot. Now I can imagine that the writers wake up after a long night of ascent and play a revolution in dance dance, and then combine the ideas for this: space paratroopers got on someone else’s planet that is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses to protect the science team studying the planet. The best idea! In fact, it comes to the full list of original Sci Fi films: dinosaur weapons, medieval times, space travel, terrible game. <br /> <br /> So watch this movie, but don’t buy it.
