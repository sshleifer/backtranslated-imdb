Forget about the "religious" films that have monopolized the television / film market ... this film has a real meaning. Although it can be viewed as a film with cheap emotional emotions, it also contains a message about forgiveness and a generally good moral. However, I didnâ€™t like the lighting in this film ... for a film about this subject, it was too bright. I felt that this distracted from the overall appeal of the film, which is almost an unforgivable sin, but the recognizable cast and their performances counteract this omission. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look ... buy a DVD
