A meteorite falls into the country of a small town, bringing a jellylike creature. An old farmer is attacked by an alien in his hand, and the young men Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corso) take him to Dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor gently heals the blister and asks Steve to investigate the place where the old man was found. When Steve returns, he sees a drop killing a doctor. Steve and Jane are trying to warn the police and residents, but no one believes them, while the drop absorbs many people, becoming more and more. <br /> <br /> The Blob is a cult and classic science fiction. This is a low-budget film, in which many actors and actresses (with the exception of Steve McQueen), terrible effects, but at the same time amazing and very, but very funny. This is the first time I see this classic (I saw a 1988 remake with Kevin Dillon), and I really recommend it to fans of Steve McQueen and science fiction B-movies from the 50s. The theme of the film of my review number 1400 could not be better. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Bolha” (“Ball”)
