I really liked the movie. In the end I was in tears. This movie is incredible. Watch the movie. You'll like it. I could give him more than 10 points. I liked to tease between chance and sassy.i, as the leadership shadow.overall, this movie was perfect. <br /> <br /> his sequel is a good but not very good movie. I think there should be a third sequel. Not only this film attracts children, but also adults. My family enjoyed this movie. Chance was full of humor. Sassi is a smart cat. <br /> I say again that THIS FILM SHOULD LOOK. The more you see this movie, the more you are attached to this movie. This film is a classic.
