The location of the store around the corner is precisely indicated at the beginning of the film “Balta Street” in Budapest, but it really can be anywhere. A small number of sets reflects the average European design, but it can be a store from any angle. The film is not about Budapest or the retail leather goods business, but about the ups and downs of love reflected in most of the main characters. <br /> <br /> Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak are sparring work partners, but their anonymous Letters to each other are full of hope, aspiration and romance, and the story unfolds to beautifully combine these two aspects. Hugo Matushek, the owner of the store, is having problems with his wife, she only has a voice at the end of the phone. Ferenc Wadas has a secret affair. Ilona Novodna has a gentleman friend who buys her fur products. Mr. Pirovich’s life is centered around his wife and children. Pepi Cato "plays Santa Claus" with a girl for Christmas. You even feel that quiet Flora Katchuk, sitting at home with his mother, is dreaming about someone. <br /> <br /> The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. It moves effortlessly from scene to scene. This is one of those quiet films that pays off over and over again, simply, but deeply. The dialogue reflects the nature of speech, which is not common in our day. <br /> <br /> All the action is great. Even minor characters, such as a waiter in a cafe and a policeman on the street, are flawless. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play well with each other. At that time he really became an actor and gave a pleasant and sharp presentation. Margaret Sullavan was a terrific actor and underestimated these days. Some of her other films deserve attention. Like Mr. Matushek, Frank Morgan is awesome. His moment of truth is very touching. Golden stars everywhere for performers. <br /> <br /> This is an exhausted phrase that they do not make them as they are used to (vague alteration of “You Got Mail” was terrible), but in this case it is true. Fortunately, the director Lubicz is not in the farce, but put a classic film about the spirit, charm and warm humanity.
