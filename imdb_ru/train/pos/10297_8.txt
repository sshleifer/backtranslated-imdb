Well, not quite. This film is very interesting, though. Last night I went and saw it with a friend, and she had to use the procedure "I think something may be in my eyes." The film is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carey is great as an unlucky reporter who has been given the opportunity to change himself and the city where he lives. In fact, all the characters are great. The film is not too funny or juicy, a good film to go with my wife. <br /> <br /> Overall, 8/10 .... note * I am not just a grader. That's all from BigV over and over again!
