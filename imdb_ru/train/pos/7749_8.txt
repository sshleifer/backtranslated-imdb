This movie knocks you down. This debut film from Tom Barman (known from the Belgian rock band dEUS) introduces you to 8 intriguing people who make up an irresistible movie mosaic. Each of them survived one day and one night in the metropolis of Antwerp. The bartender draws his characters with great enthusiasm and correctly weaves their individual stories - a tour, a force reminiscent of the best works of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. The patchwork of jokes surprises, moves, cheers; the dialogues are so natural that they seem to be improvised. Some great performances by Mathias Schoenerts, Nathalie Brods and an extremely funny duet from Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Lowwick is an unforgettable "Windman," a freaky guy dancing throughout the film. Sam is also responsible for the amazing choreography, and, of course, Tom Barman himself took care of a very steep sound track. We were seriously impressed: Any Way The Wind Blows is a film that knocks you down.
