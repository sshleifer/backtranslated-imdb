This is probably one of the most original love stories I've seen for ages, especially for a war movie (briefly). In fact, this is a story based on two worlds, one is clearly real, the other is fictional, but the filmmakers say at the beginning that this is only a coincidence if this is a real place. Anyway, Peter Carter (the great David Niven) was about to crash on the plane, he spoke to June (Monkey Planet Kim Hunter) before he bailed out and said he loved her. He had to die from a jump without a parachute, but somehow he survived, and now he sees and loves June in the flesh. This is another place, like heaven, miserably, because he survived and had to come to their world, so they send a French conductor 71 (Marius Göring) to convince him to leave, but he is clearly in love. Peter offers him to ask to leave his life in the court of another world, he is allowed. Obviously, love prevails when two lovers declare that they will die for each other, and June even offers to take his place! Also starring Robert Coote as Bob Trubshow, Kathleen Byron as Angel, brief (then still unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as English Pilot and Abraham Sofer as Judge / Surgeon. David Niven was in 36th place in “50 Greatest British Actors,” the film was in 86 place in “100 Greatest Tears for a Happy End,” in 47 place in “100 Greatest War Movies,” in 46 place in “50 Greatest British Films” it was number 59 on the 100 greatest films. Fine!
