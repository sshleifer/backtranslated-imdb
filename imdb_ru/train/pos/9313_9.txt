I really liked this show - we received the first and only, seemingly, series in the UK on channel 4. The characteristic was correct for money - a bit like the Simpsons in that all the different aspects of the population of a small town were <br /> <br /> There was no laughter - I didnâ€™t see it in an American television comedy at the time, except for Larry Sanders, and it really worked, which reinforced the assumption that these stupid police officers were really like that and not just bothering them . <br /> <br /> In general, a strange little number that just tickled me: I can't help but think that maybe it missed its mark with certain audiences. I think it would be a cult blow in the UK if it were shown at an acceptable hour. <br /> <br /> I will complete this with my standard comment: Where the hell can I get this to look again? Any ideas?
