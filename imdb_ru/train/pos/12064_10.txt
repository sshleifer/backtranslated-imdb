The Woman in Black is one of the worst British ghost stories ever made. A young lawyer who came to a small town to take care of the condition of a dead client is pursued by a mysterious woman dressed in black. with an extremely eerie atmosphere, and the battles are designed for and provide the greatest possible effect. The action keeps the viewer deeply involved, and the final is quite disturbing. The action is superb, and the strain is sometimes almost unbearable. So if you want to see a really creepy horror movie you can watch. I dare to see "Woman in Black" alone at night with the lights off. Highly recommend. 10 out of 10.
