Well, so, it comes a few weeks later, but it's here. This is mainly due to the statements of different negative nature. Starting from technology. When Star Trek: TOS worked, the special effects technology was extremely low, and, moreover, the team had little money to make any correct layouts. In the 35 years since the TOS premiere, the Star Trek team has become an expert in economics. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, they rightly decided to abandon the appearance of TOS and reverse engineering TNG et. everything. So what if they decided not to make a transporter of brilliant gold or made the phase guns look closer to those of Star Trek II? As for the nits chosen during the first contact with the Klingon Empire, then based on the comments made by Kirk and Riker, it was assumed that the Earth met with the Klingons only in 2200. Nothing was firmly established. <br /> <br /> The company gives us the most promising research site we have seen lately. This is what Voyager CAN BE. No series can develop without a few inconsistencies, but be grateful that Star Trek has so little. So stop grabbing and enjoy.
