Actor Hermann José plays the role of a football entrepreneur who gets a pass from two African players and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival Benfica club (his heart’s club) Porto, so these players didn’t play well and he wanted to FC Port was offended with this. But what happens is that these two players are, after all, good, and Porto sells them for a lot of money to a foreign club, doing good business. A film for a small country like Portugal, without great predecessors in great films, is a very good and funny comedy showing all the rivalry that exists between north and south of Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). Highly recommended
