I can not believe that people are looking for the plot in this film. This is Loral and Hardy. Light up already. These two were a riot. Their comic genius is as funny today as 70 years ago. Not a single dirty word from the mouth, and they were able to keep the audience in the seams. Their comedy was not sophisticated. If the pillow can't make you smile, there is no reason to watch anything these guys have done. It was a simpler time, and people laughed at things that were funny without a plot. I suppose you just have to think about enjoying it, so Iâ€™m getting ready. Two comedic teams do not count, We are just too tempted ... Are we not lucky?
