I keep watching this movie over and over and over. I have to watch this at least once a week. I'm from Africa, and watching this movie taught me some things that I didn't even know about Africa. Denzel's films are full of lessons for people from different walks of life. I wish he was my own brother. I also saw and love your Masalu Mississippi. What an exciting situation. When Denzel tried to connect his brother to work, he reminds me of my age, when my brother was always angry with me because I was busy all the time. My brother always took care of my old father and wants to see me the same. By the way, where did Denzel get this African accent in the movie “Freedom of Crying”? I first saw this film in Africa, and then I did not know that Denzel was an American until I moved here.
