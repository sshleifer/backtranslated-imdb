I love this film. This is a stupid, funny, cruel, surreal, played in the mind of a madman, and definitely not an ordinary comedy. <br /> <br /> If you don’t find the film amusing, then I think it’s not for your tastes, so it’s hard to write a review. <br /> <br /> For reference, Some other comedies that I love are Big Lebowski, Princess Bride, and Zulander (this game made me hear it a second time). There are others, but my taste is definitely unusual, and I’m ready to admit that most people just don’t like these things. I do not apologize for the fact that I have an unusual sense of humor - at least I have that. <br /> <br /> The scenes and characters of this particular film are well built, the verbal humor is cheerful, the situations are intriguing, the acting skills are very good (as one would expect from the actors), although the scriptural requirements for acting are not particularly high. The overall package makes for fun, funny, watchable and brutal entertainment.
