Ah, Domino is actually a breath of fresh air, something new in the world of cinema. I really liked the movie because of the confusing plot, various characters and intense camera effects. I saw some complaints about the camera, and, in fact, according to the creators themselves, bright and wild pictures were the culmination of mistakes made in time. Everything you see was the desired effect. Perhaps some complain because something like this has never been done before, although this is what makes it different. In a deeper aspect, what you see is how Domino sees things with his own eyes, think about it. <br /> <br /> As for the story, I don’t see anything wrong with that. Despite the fact that this is a "dirty" nature, according to some, in fact it is just a quick form of narration. The plot is really not that complicated if you are really focused on what is going on. Maybe it's just me, because I watch films from different angles, such as acting, plot, etc. I’m not a “translator” or something that takes films to pieces, it just comes to me. With that said, I think this is a really great film, despite the fact that its future is like a cult classic, blockbuster or something like that. <br /> <br /> And the characters, well, there is no doubt how diverse the cast is. I believe that the actors are excellent, as they all do an excellent job with the image of their characters, that's what makes the ladies and gentlemen of the movie. All the characters are very unique, and the advantage is that you witness a small piece of each of their lives, highlighting them further. Actually, I personally liked the cast and characters. <br /> <br /> All those who shoot and record this film may simply not see it the way I do, or it simply does not attract them. It doesn't matter if it's a great movie in itself, no, it's a great movie period.
