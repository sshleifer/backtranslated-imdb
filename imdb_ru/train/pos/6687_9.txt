Although I cannot claim to be a comic book fanatic, I read my share, so I think that I am part of the audience for this film, and I was not disappointed. Toward the end, the steam leaves, almost overwhelmed with ideas, and it seems that Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, has remained on the floor of the cutting room. In addition, a little Blue Raj Hank Azariah can go a long way. However, it is easy to forgive all these flaws if you have a movie that is very funny. It seems that all the actors are delighted with their roles, especially William H. Macy in the role of Shovel with a straight arrow and Janine Garofalo in the role of a Bowler. And unlike some, I found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier. I also liked how the disco was the favorite music of the bad guys; somehow it seemed appropriate.
