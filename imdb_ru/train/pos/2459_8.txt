A beautiful and touching film that deserves wider viewing than it can get. Semra Turan plays Ayhu, a second-generation Turkish immigrant who is trying to break the pattern. Not fully at home with her moderately conservative Muslim family, nor with her liberal Danish friends, Aisha’s martial arts experience becomes a struggle to find herself and have the strength to allow herself to be what she wants to be, despite her family and friends. <br /> <br /> Director Natasha Artie manages to balance introspection and narration so that it has depth without becoming a burdensome philosophical discourse, and the use of Xian Gao’s choreographic skills pays off in exciting fights. In the end, however, this is Semra Turan’s terrific debut performance, which gives the film the spirit. Crude charisma and the necessary skills of martial arts are complemented by heart to make her personal drama believable. <br /> <br /> Well, worth it.
