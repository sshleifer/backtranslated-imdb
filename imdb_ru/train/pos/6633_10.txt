The first film ever made. Workers flock from the factory, some ride bicycles, most walk, move right or left. Along with Melis, Lumi√®re is both the starting point and the starting point for the movie - with Melis begins narrative fiction, film, fantasy, fiction, and spectacle; with a clean, unvarnished, lumiere observation. True. There are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of the cinema from the latter into the weary formulas of the first. <br /> <br /> But consider it again. There is nothing "objective." The film is full of action - a static, inhuman scene bursts into life, activity, and the quiet harmony of the frame is torn, decentralized from behind from right to left or left (but never, of course, ahead of where the camera is). ). And yet the camera stands still, contains energy, possible subversive activity, subordinates it to its will. Cinema can be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - to map the world, edit it, limit it, limit it. <br /> <br /> The worse the historical reality of the film. These factory workers are employees of Lumiere. The authorities are spying on their employees, their invisible eyes looking at his faceless minions. Thus, the film describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the gate workers sit in their workplace. The opening of the gate seems to symbolize freedom, salvation, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, further limiting them. The first film is also the first example of video surveillance, the image of an invisible, all-seeing authority that captured its servants. A terrible, too prophetic film.
