What a fine example of "Less is more ..." Kurt Russell (Sergeant Todd) has only 72 lines and something like 104 words. What a challenge! Like a black and white photo, when your mind has to fill in the gaps, facial expressions, physical drama, emotional gesture - all this unites to make a stronger impact. This is one of those 5 best films I can't live without, right with classics like Road Warrior. If you like it, watch Mad Max 2, Warrior of the Road and Braveheart, both starring Mel Gibson. Also "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen, who was also in the Soldier. "Thirteenth Warrior" starring Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" starring Harrison Ford.
