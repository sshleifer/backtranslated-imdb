Of the three remakes of this story, I like them all, I have all three on VHS and, in addition, there is a copy of this on DVD. There are enough variations in the scenarios to make all three entertaining and re-viewable. Also, has any other film been redone three times with such stars? Of course, the main stars in this film are great, but the supporting actors are also great. I especially like William Tracy in the role of Pepi. He was so stolen that I was looking for other films in which he starred. He appeared in many, but most are not available. Like other comments, I also say buy this one.
