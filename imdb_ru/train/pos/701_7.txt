I did not know that, except how, so I think it would be much better if there were not many exceptions. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad short film. Tess Nanawati is a relatively new director and writer, so I think she deserves a lot of praise for making this film. You can tell it was an act of love for her. The acting game (outside Dominic) is a bit silly, and the quality of the film is not great either, but for a really budget film, that's good. There were times when the storyline becomes confusing, and there are parts that drag on, although I don’t feel that this greatly detracts from a person’s ability to understand a movie. If you love Dominic Monagan as much as I do, I say go for it. The reel was funny, I won't spoil it, but there is a special scene that is worth it to buy a DVD so you can watch it again and again. If you like the film, see Pink Mirror, also filmed by Jagged Edge. I know that Dominic fans will love this little piece of paradise.
