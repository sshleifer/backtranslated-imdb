This is a movie that might make you want to see it again. I especially liked how it ended. I did not expect the end to come, but when the Laws did not break the first time, it can be assumed that he will return again. <br /> <br /> The story is exciting and, perhaps, more psychological, but I understand that the plot should have captured the viewer, and action was needed for that. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that Michael Jr. could be as indifferent as his younger brother and mother were like being blown up. But I can appreciate the scene, which could not attract our attention, because she had a more interesting story. <br /> <br /> Some complained about Ganks as a gangster. I believe that this is not justified. If his character was harder, he wouldnâ€™t care if he pulled the trigger or not. <br /> <br /> Eight stars for this. Although it was released in 2002, I saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD.
