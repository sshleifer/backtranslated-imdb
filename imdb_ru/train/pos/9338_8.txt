True, the idea of ​​this series may have arisen from the tremendous success that Ellie McBill enjoys around the world, even here in Germany. However, this suggests that Edel and Stark are in many ways very different from Ellie McBill. <br /> <br /> The two main characters work great together. Felix Edel (Felix Noble), played by famous German actor Christophe M. Orth and Sandra Stark (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong, you know ???), performed by charming Rebecca Immanuel, exchanging quick romantic reports and constantly spying on each other, participating in similar comedic criminal cases in Berlin and its surroundings. In addition, they are assisted by a great cast of co-stars, primarily their secretary, played by Isabel Tüngertal, a rare gem with BIG comic potential. In addition, shadow dealer Wheeler, Otto, and Felix's noble childhood friend, Frank, work very well, not to mention Sandra's best friend and roommate, Patricia, played by the beautiful Barbara Demmer. <br /> <br /> In general, the joy that can be observed on Monday is just around the corner: no wonder the series and its stars received several prizes. Will Felix Sandra get it? <br /> <br /> Hopefully we will have to wait many more episodes to find out ......
