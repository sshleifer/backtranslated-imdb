“Kolchak: Night Stalker” is an extremely fascinating series in which an assertive, sarcastic reporter from more than forty years old is drawn into a deadly battle with supernatural (and sometimes extraterrestrial) forces. Based on a very popular pair of television films featuring Kolchak, this series quickly died in the mid-1970s due to low ratings, but nonetheless maintains a strong cult after today. But can an ordinary modern viewer dig Kolchak and his weekly encounters with the undead? <br /> <br /> This is a really hard question to answer honestly. Detractors of this series, as a rule, argue that it is formally and hopelessly outdated. On the other hand, fans say it is well written, works well, and sometimes really creepy. And I? I have legs in both camps. I really enjoyed watching all 20 episodes of Kolchak on DVD lately, although I can clearly see that the series has serious flaws. <br /> <br /> First, I will consider the question of whether Kolchak was a “formula” fiction. Now, I think we can all agree that most television shows have formulas — for example, almost every episode of Colombo takes place along the same lines. Repetition is not necessarily bad in itself; in fact, critics have long recognized that viewers often enjoy and actively seek repetitive entertainment. However, the problem with Kolchak is that his formula is just TOO tough - it is too repetitive, even by the most generous standards. <br /> <br /> In almost every episode, Kolchak investigates a murder and finds out that it was committed. some form of monster. He is trying to publish a story about the monster, but his editor Vincenzo is blocking him, always on the grounds that Kolchak does not have sufficient evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are working. And, alas, Kolchak is also disturbed by the police. So in the end, Kolchak does an independent monster research, finds out how to kill him ... and then kills him. Without ceremony, without reward or writing a big story about it. <br /> <br /> You see where this very strict formula can become tedious, right? I’m particularly puzzled by Vincenzo - if Kolchak is always raving monsters, and Vincenzo never believes in that ... well, then why doesn’t Vincenzo dismiss Kolchak or do he? This is what any normal boss would do. But the series avoids such realism and prefers to keep Vincenzo and Kolchak as funny antagonists. As a result, many of their scenes together are incredibly incredible - although they are also quite funny. <br /> <br /> Kolchak's best episodes managed to overcome the limitations of this formula, however, as a rule, because they contain some kind of unexpected twist. These episodes are good enough, and I think they are largely immune to typical criticism of the series. Here are some of my favorites: <br /> <br /> Horror on the heights is an episode that deserves attention because it is dirty, inventive and socially aware. Kolchak's dialogue has an unusually sharp and cynical edge. Although the script is closely related to the Kolchak formula, the script (written by Hammer Studios veteran Jimmy Sangster) is amazingly literate and goes deep into the background of the monster. <br /> <br /> Devil’s platform is a possible inspiration for Omen films. This episode stands out for me because the villain - very young Tom Skerritt - seduces Kolchak with a satanic contract full of goodies (and at the same time reveals much about the character of the reporter .) <br /> <br /> Firefall - this episode has a bad reputation among fans, but I liked it because it has a great red herring and a really creepy, almost unstoppable monster. <br /> <br /> Although I’m highlighting these three episodes for praise, I would say that most of the stories are at least interesting. For my money, there are only two full turkeys in a series of 20 episodes: Primal Scream, telling about monkey people who run wildly in Chicago, and Sentry, which has the most dull-looking makeup of creatures in the history of cinematic entertainment (and this estimate comes from a lifelong fan of Doctor Who and Godzilla!) <br /> <br /> So this is a good series. A bit repetitive, perhaps a little cheesy, but there are elements of greatness in it. Even during the weaker episodes, Darren McGevin’s remarkable performance in the role of a really caustic, tired of the world, infinitely funny Kolchak really shines. He plays the show effortlessly, so that, for example, Sarah Michelle Gellar never dealt with Buffy. McGavin was one of the outstanding actors, and this series is worth seeing only for him.
