I love this film very much and would really like it to be. This is just an exciting legend about an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, I really liked it and would love to see it again! I don’t remember too much about it, but that Native American boy lives in a good village with his family, and I don’t remember what happens, but he had to go to the desert alone. His sister packs him some food and he leaves. While he is there, some other Indian boys run out and put feathers on him, and he turns into an eagle. Legend has it that if you have ever seen an eagle in a turquoise necklace, then this is a boy. I have always been fascinated by legends, especially the legends of Native Americans, and I would really like it to be released on DVD someday, PLEASE FREE IT, whoever is interested
