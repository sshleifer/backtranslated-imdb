The "case of killing a nursery" begins without a break and continues until the very end. Everyone had a reason to kill the victim, and several people tried. William Powell is amazing, like Philo Vance, a gentlemanly detective. Mary Astor is freshening up like a niece who wants to marry her Scottish gentleman and enjoy her legacy This film is paired with Nancy Drew Reporter on DVD, which is also fun. If you need to rent a disc (or check it at your local library), do it. This is pure entertainment!
