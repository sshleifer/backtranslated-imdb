I really liked this film, and I came back to it twice in a week. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Detmers nailed the show - she was like a hungry cat on a hunt, playing with her prey. She erupts in rage and lust, taking the "too young" lover and smashing hundreds of pieces of fine porcelain to her terrorist's mother on the floor. <br /> <br /> The film was full of beautiful strokes. Maserati, a wonderful wardrobe, flower boxes along the roofs. I especially enjoyed the lesson of the ancient Greek language and the reading of "Antigone". <br /> <br /> I had the feeling of “Story O” - that is, when people belonging to the means indulged in unrestrained sexual adventures. Walking through a fantastic apartment among amateurs, she feels at ease - and why not, what is holding back the “Devil in the flesh”? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a real pleasure!
