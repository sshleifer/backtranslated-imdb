For those who judged others at the first meeting, here’s the perfect guide to depth of character. A grumpy old lady has a soft, thoughtful heart - and she needs new friends. Frivolous, uncertain, “ditsi” lady, who makes inappropriate, uncomfortable comments - sees deep in your soul and has a pure love for everyone. Cold, prim, in fact, neglected the waking passion of the wife, which can boil away in any minute - if properly tuned. Ideal beauty - a rich, sweet, party, pursued by the crowds - wants peace, silence and love without possessiveness. <br /> <br /> By taking the time to look beyond the surface, you will find treasures in everyday life from the least expected sources. All that is needed is the patience and touch of the spell.
