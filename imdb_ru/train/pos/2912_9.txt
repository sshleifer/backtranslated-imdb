Nowadays, we are too frivolous about the term "superstar", but here is one guy who really deserves it. <br /> <br /> I was chained to the filming of the entire show. The choice of songs was perfect - it contained only those songs that I really wanted to hear, and included documentary footage during the weaker new songs. I liked that there were only five guys on stage in a very minimalistic setting. (With songs of this power, you don't need a circus for entertainment). <br /> <br /> Shots from the crowd were amazing too. How many performers can affect the Beatles fans (now they are over 50 or more), make small children jump on the first lines of “Can't Buy Me Love” and affect everyone between them? <br /> <br /> Observing, I also realized that after the tragic death of John Lennon, Paul McCartney instantly became an afterthought. Paul not only lost John and George (whatever their recent relationship, it must be hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world), but he also lost his wife Linda and never seemed to get the confession received by the murder Lennon I agree that the murder of Lennon was terrible, but only now I realized that Paul was kind of forgotten after. I was very happy that he again found love in Heather. <br /> <br /> As for those who complain about the quality of audio / video, I have not had any complaints; both were crystal clear on my set. I think the same people will complain about the quality of the DVD when the next format comes out; they will never be satisfied. <br /> <br /> The only thing I regret was not buying a ticket for this show when I had the opportunity. Thanks to this video, I was able to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> When people remember John Lennon, they will first remember his murder and then his music. Now I have a new thanks for Paul McCartney, because if nothing else, he will remember for his music in the first place. And let's hope that the other madman will not change this, because the McCartney catalog is pretty good.
