This film, although it was recognized by critics, was, of course, not yet released in the USA on DVD, just like another great film, The Housekeeping, by Christina Lahti, that same year. But if you can support DVD Region 4 (Australian), this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are still some copies of VHS on the Internet. Davis is complemented by a great story, as well as unforgettable performances of her cast, especially Claudia Karvan and the late great Jan Adel. Surprisingly, maybe not, this film and its stars went unnoticed during the Oscars, as well as “Housekeeping”, but treat yourself to both - you will be glad you did!
