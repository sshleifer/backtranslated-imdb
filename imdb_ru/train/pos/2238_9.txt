Since this film is entirely in Swiss dialect, it is probably difficult for most German speakers to really follow this film. I am not from Switzerland, but I worked there for several years, so I had the opportunity to understand this great parody of the Lord of the Rings. I have seen a lot of films of this type (for example, “Scary Movie,” a lot of parodies on Scifi, etc.), But this is the best one I've ever seen. I give 9 out of 10. The only reason I can't give 10 is that there are some small details that could be done better, and because they did not provide any subtitles in any language on the DVD, so what's the chance of not swiss to understand.
