This movie is awesome. If you take it too seriously, of course, you will hate it; Nevertheless, the number of "guys" and "right" causes laughter and faint memories of 15 years ago. I like his ability to make me just laugh at obvious jokes and nonsense, and his ability to make me want to watch his predecessor, "The Excellent Adventure of Bill and Ted" (1989). If you are looking for a film full of multifaceted jokes and perfectly mature humor, do not watch it; However, if you need a funny and stupid, but intelligent and fascinating film, you will like it. I would like more such films to appear in today's cinemas. And hey, this is Keanu Reeves, who behaves like everyone parodies him, acting ... right ... not much better than that :)
