I was attracted to DAN IN REAL LIFE because of the excellent reviews and thirst for Dramedi, which was well written - thanks, Peter Hedges - and because when Steve Carell is filmed, you know and in LITTLE MISS SUN, a performance that is very interesting and useful. DAN IN REAL LIFE fulfilled this promise. <br /> <br /> The film is so real for many families around the world who have lost a member and still continue their lives in search of something that will give them back magic before they lose. With Steve Carell and the amazing Juliette Binoche, their relationship was so beautifully written and written that their scenes were so real for their characters and their travels. The cast, scenery and plot made DAN IN REAL LIFE unforgettable when we set off for the coming holidays.
