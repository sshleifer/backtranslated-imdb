I thought the kids in the movie were great. I deal with children in this age group, and I thought their behavior was very plausible. I had a problem with reference to the closed parts made by a 5 year old. I did not think that a comment was necessary and actually lowered my opinion on the film a little. <br /> <br /> I think Luke Benward got up and was coming. I would like to see more of him on the big screen. I liked his reactions to the situations in which he found himself. Often children in this age group do things without thinking about the consequences. Almost all the actors did this throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I also think that the sense of intimidation needs to be explored more in the films of this age group. Today it is a serious problem in schools. <br /> <br /> The ending was rather unexpected. Billy's thoughts about whether he won or not won a bet were very surprising. How he handled this situation was excellent. Too often today, children do not want to compromise. The actors in this film showed that compromise is an important part of life.
