I really miss the good old fashion movie Spooky. If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory were commissioned to produce such a film, it may have been this particular film, with the exception of the absence of a world-famous cast. This is one of those films that you watch on a dark evening with pizza and popcorn, and you donâ€™t even bother yourself with dishes until the morning, because you just want to hide under a blanket. Bravo to director Herbert Wise, writers Susan Hill and Nigel Knale, John Bunker's best production design, John Ralph's artistic direction and a great cast that makes me shiver and feel isolated even if I live in one of the most densely populated cities in the world in 19 century. I gave him a "9" of "10", because with the production and budget constraints of television, they really pulled from a big show.
