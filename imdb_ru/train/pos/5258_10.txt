"The ladies man" laughs very funny, with a great variety of actors, as well as with some very silly, but great scenes (including the funniest love song ever written). <br /> <br /> Ferrell - his usual quality in a brilliant side role. <br /> <br /> Tim Meadows plays surprisingly idiot surprisingly well and has written a few funny lines for himself that can be found in any comedy. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a purchase, if you look at it every 6 months or so, you will still laugh as hard as you did the first time. <br /> <br /> At the time of this writing, I’m confused that she has a poor 4.7. / 10 and I urge you to vote! <br /> <br /> And remember the children: “There is more movement in the ocean”
