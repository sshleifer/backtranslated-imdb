I don’t see Largo Winch as a comic (or is it a graphic novel? I really don’t know), but I have to admit that when I heard about the agent / hero movie, I was expecting something completely different than what I really received. <br /> <br /> At first it was amazing to watch it, it was nice to watch it. You could never really tell where it goes (some turns are predictable, but in general, you can never tell wherever it happens). The excellent work of the lead actor and a really good cast make this watch enjoyable. Not as actionable as some might hope or expect from such a movie, but a really good mix.
