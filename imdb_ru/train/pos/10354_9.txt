“Cry in the Dark” <br /> <br /> “Cry in the Dark” is a film that I expected would offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid but unremarkable film. This assumption was based on the fact that in addition to the nomination for the best female role of the Strip, the film received little attention from the main award groups. <br /> <br /> Little did I expect that “Screaming in the dark” would be such an exciting drama, well-built on every level. If you ask me, this is an undervalued classic. <br /> <br /> The film opens rather slowly, allowing viewers to calm down from the chamberlains at a relaxed pace and really notice that in essence they are an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Shepisi (director) chooses random moments to capture the family on vacation, which gives the looming sense of impending tragedy, and also shows attentive bliss with which Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neal) Chamberlain take care of their children. <br /> <br /> While the famous line “Dingo took my child!” Nowadays, this film has become something of a raisin, and the film has never even laughed at all. Azariah's actual death is horribly captured. He is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience horrified and asking questions. <br /> <br /> Much of the film takes place in the courtroom and is dedicated to Chamberlain’s ongoing struggle to prove his innocence to the press and the court, which Lindy suspects of murder. <br /> <br /> The fact that it is clear to us from the very beginning that they are innocent makes intense trials even more exciting. As a member of the audience, I was fully involved in the plight of Chamberlain ... and was genuinely angry, hurt, and saddened when they were made to look so bad by the media. But at the same time, the media / public opinion is understandable. I liked that the media in no way evoked sympathy, but they always had good reasons to hold their views. <br /> <br /> The final line of the film is very deep and perfectly reflects the central element that makes this film so different from other drama court sessions. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of the performances, the only ones that really matter in this film are Streep and Nill ... and they do everything possible. For me, this is considered one of the best (if not # 1) Meryl Streep. Despite the fact that she has different accents (which, of course, by themselves are very impressive), Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters. I believe that this is one of the most subtle performances of the Strip, and she gets into the park. And Neill, the actor who never impressed me, except for his charisma and appeal in JURASSIC PARK, is an ideal counterpoint for the performance of Stripe. From what I've seen, this is undoubtedly Neil's best work to date. It is a pity that he was not recognized by the Academy in the nomination "Leading Actor" in order to correspond to the stripovski ... second-hand, when they both play brilliantly with each other. <br /> <br /> More emotionally exciting than most films, as well as incredibly intense ... A CRY IN THE DARK has far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend to people who know the film only as a film, where Meryl shouts: “Dingo took my child!” Watch the film and find out how much more CREATIVE CAN THAN THAN this line. <br /> <br /> ... And ...
