The first hour of the film was mostly boring, if not more. However, this improved afterwards when Valentine began. In addition to the unexpected narrative about the killer’s identity, the hot tub murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this film. The scene in the garden with Kate was well filmed, as was the last scene (“turn”). In these scenes there was some genuine excitement and thrill, and the scene of the murder in the hot bath had an unpleasant (what should be the slasher) edge. Previous killings are frustrated with blood.
