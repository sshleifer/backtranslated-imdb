This film is not painful and not depressing. This is sad because AIDS in the early 90s was sad. But his real message is love and perseverance. <br /> <br /> Mark and Tom were in a long, loving relationship. Their devotion to each other is immediately apparent, and as the devastating effects of AIDS sharpen and become the center of their lives, you see strength and devotion that are truly heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> When "Silverlake Life" Originally released, I was actively involved in HIV and AIDS education and health, working as a volunteer as a consultant in an HIV / AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other film about AIDS at the time, because Mark and Tom were real people experiencing the same experiences that I saw daily in real life. I knew from my own experience how it was to observe how AIDS erodes former energetic, young, healthy people; seeing how this happens with Mark and Tom in the film was very similar to how my real friends are getting worse. It affected me in such a way that even all these years later still affects me.
