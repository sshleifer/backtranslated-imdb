I found this to be a surprisingly light touch in the film of the 1950s about the encounter with culture. John Wayne is unlikely to be a better choice as a cultural attaché, since he will be as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull at Harrods. But this time he was left to play a role that was much more passive than his usual bluffing persona, and he performed his task with style. The duke was a guy who could really behave himself. His facial expression and body language can be extremely subtle. <br /> <br /> Despite his considerable presence as an actor, and in terms of screen time, he could not dominate this film. Many of his good intentions came to earth. He owned no one's power, and a temporary narration was provided by the titular geisha, for whom he was a barbarian. <br /> <br /> The story of America’s attempts to achieve favor with isolationist Japan was more a political intrigue than a battle or hellish skin. I cannot comment on the accuracy of my research, but the strangeness of Eastern culture for Western feelings was well demonstrated. There were many small-scale choreographic ceremonies that entailed what looked to the observer as an authentic costume and props. The set of parts was complex and detailed. Big money and thoughts were attached to it. <br /> <br /> The torn romance between Wayne and his geisha added a bit of an extra element, and the film didn’t turn into a political effort or flag waving. The script was good without being too verbose. There was a great dialogue in Japanese, but long periods of translation did not interfere with the narration. It was nice to see a lot of real oriental musicians on the set. I could not tell if they were Japanese. But in any case, they looked from the side. At least, Caucasians did not play the main roles with disguise, unlike other attempts, such as Bloody Alley (yes, I know they were Chinese), Hotel of the Sixth Happiness or even King and I. /> <br /> Honestly, I enjoyed it more than any other movie. The script was the best to start. I never liked the songs from “The King and Me”, and I was not impressed by the heavy anti-communist subtext of the “Bloody Lane”. I confess that I have never seen this work before and found that it compares very favorably with many of the Duke’s most popular excursions. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
