Bell, The Book and The Candle were one of the great phenomena of pop culture of the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenomena that we are seeing today (back in the 70s - more than ten years ago - there were endless references to this film so far) . It made Novak a huge star, put a good subject on Jack Lemon's resume, shed new light on Jimmy Stewart and gave Lancaster and Gingold new learning opportunities in their careers (both continued to play witches and other curious "old bats", in the movies and on television). <br /> <br /> Along with the film of the 40s “I married a witch” (which helped make Lake Veronica an icon), “Bell, a book and a candle” inspired everyone to enjoy film and television. witchcraft things that started with Bewitched and continued through Practical Mag ic, Worst Witch and Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> I rarely noticed that the film is also a rather interesting alternative to the Christmas film. The story unfolds during the Christmas holidays and, in spite of the fact that it tells superficially about witchcraft, It really embodies the great spirit of Christmas (gift, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc.). <br /> <br /> I will always watch this movie (I have seen it several times since my first viewing at the beginning of 90 s), especially if it is shown near or immediately after the holiday season. He has style, content, great cast and awesome production values. And as Adam's Rib, he casually expresses ideas that were quite radical for his time, radical even now (in both films the female character is simple-minded and strong), and therefore always seems ahead of time.
