I remember watching it in 1962, when he was five or six years old, and REALLY enjoyed it. I recently had the opportunity to watch it again, for the first time since it was shown in Disney's Walt Disney. I forgot most of them, and some of them were child-oriented, but it was still nice. I can't wait to show this to my niece and nephews.
