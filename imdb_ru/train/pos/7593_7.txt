The film is absolutely stupid. <br /> <br /> But did you expect a high-brow intelligent film based on a comic called Slam Dunk? Indeed? Jay Chou's acting is not the most exciting thing I've ever seen, but I certainly liked the movie. Was it somewhere at the level of wonder what someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No, not at all. Was it interesting if you just took this superficial meaning? Absolutely. This is a film about Chinese idols and musicians who can play basketball with an unreal level of skill. There is an evil triad-style dude and a stupid schemer who involves Jay Chou in all of this. Love interest. This is formal, but actually suspend disbelief for some time. Come on. This is called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you think you subscribed to? Do yourself a favor if you watch it - I found myself a copy with some English subtitles that made the film an almost illegible conversation, but we got a big laugh from it. It would seem that they are very fixated on Jerusalem and the numbers 1, 10. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I was flung. I would watch it again. <br /> <br /> Especially for that bar battle scene. Well set and well removed. I especially like the plexiglass illuminated pool table - I would love to play one of them. <br /> <br /> Smoothly enough, but I'm digging in a trash cinema.
