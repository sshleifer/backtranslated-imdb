This film is a touching story about an adventure undertaken by 15-year-old Darius Weems. Darius has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an incurable disease that took the life of his brother at the age of nineteen and is the number one killer in the United States. He and several of his close friends travel across the country to Los Angeles to set up their wheelchair on one of their favorite shows, MTV Pimp My Ride. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never left. The brigade goes west on a journey that all its participants will never forget. Darius first boating, hot-air ballooning, swimming in the ocean and visiting the sights he always wanted to see, such as the Grand Canyon and New Orleans. The filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection with the material. They don’t earn $ 20 DVD sales. 17 dollars go to study the disease, and 3 dollars - to copy. The film received more than 25 awards at festivals, and I agree with the quote from the film “Diversity to Excite the Heart”.
