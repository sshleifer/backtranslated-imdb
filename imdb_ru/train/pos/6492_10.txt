I am not a very good writer, so I will be brief. Peace in War - the best documentary of World War II, which I saw. I have seen various World War II documentaries (not just English / North American), and this documentary seems to be the most complete documentary film of World War II I have ever seen. I think it could talk a little more about the Great Depression and why / how Hitler came to power, but he does a very good job covering the war. It seems complete and objective / fair to all. This does not exaggerate or detract from the role of different nations. There are a lot of original materials in it, including color ones, and many witnesses (this was done in the 70s, when they became much more). He has great music and a storyteller. In general, I gave this a 10/10, because it is so good. (I have not seen discounts in the DVD version, so I can not comment on them)
