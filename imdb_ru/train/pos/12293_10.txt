This is a great movie, and it is a treasure that can be caught only through episodic shows in cinemas, as it is not available on video / DVD. The way the film begins with the arrival of two lovers and ends with their departure (although there is quite a lot of time between them, and they do not stay in one place during this time), gives you a feeling of closeness and a feeling that the world is fine. If you have a chance to watch this movie, then do it. I can't wait to see it again, and it is a pity that it cannot be released for general release.
