I saw tons of HK militants, and this one is right on top of the genre. The action movie scene is just as exciting and kinetic as anything you've ever seen in any action movie. Kung Fu is impressive, amazing pyrotechnics, crazy work of stuntmen. Editing takes place perfectly, reinforcing the voltage and complementing the work of the fluid chamber. This film was made by old professional Corey Yuen, whose resume is filled with some of the best works of the genre, including the car Jet Li “The Legend of Fong Sai Yuke”. If something is missing in this film, it's the presence of a three-dimensional character, although Martin, the main character, comes closest to him. This film is full of archetypes, not characters - a sexual killer, a stupid thief and his naughty girlfriend, giggling villains. However, Shannon Lee has an amazing presence on the screen; she is gorgeous in battles, stunts and weapons. When she is on the screen, it is difficult to look away from her. She is so good. Why is this woman not the main star?
