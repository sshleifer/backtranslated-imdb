Best Treasure Island. They just don’t make movies <br /> <br /> like they are now or never. No one makes such films. This film is more than a novelty. This film is funny, frank and fascinating, but at the same time capricious, mysterious and gloomy. This is one of my favorite pictures. The director must have had some idea of ​​what it is, but he certainly leaves room for your own impressions and interpretations, leaving some imagination. Why he did not make more such films, I have no idea. Although <br /> <br /> reminds me of some of the best noir products, it is one of a kind. But this <br /> <br /> is not for the lazy and not simple.
