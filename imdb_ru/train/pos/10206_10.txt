Over the years of participation in film festivals, I have seen many such small films that have not received theatrical distribution, and as a result they ended up in trays of $ 3 in WalMart. I just found a DVD with Yank Tanks, an excellent document, but how sad that it turned into a slacker. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, I wish I had seen it in the movies in this all. I would prefer that New Yorker Films translate the title straight. It is good for Americans to stretch a little. If the title of the film helps the American audience explore random chaos, so much the better. Cinema imitates life and vice versa. <br /> <br /> In addition, I was distracted by the fact that the subtitles set prices in dollars. Come on! Euro is not hard to understand, make gringo audience do the math. After seeing the film, especially one shot in Paris, the viewer should not spoil the effect by reminding me: I am American, I watch the film, and they convert the euro to dollars for me. <br /> <br /> We will be glad to see more of these actors, as well as scriptwriters and directors.
