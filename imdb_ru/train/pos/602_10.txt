I have never danced flamenco, but for some reason it seems to me that this film is perfect. The colors, how glaring the dances were, the gypsies and rivals put together, made a film that seemed to end too soon. I have seen other films by Carlos Saura, and I agree that this film may be his best production. I feel that the best characteristics of his past films were combined and aligned to make Iberia. I appreciate the use of mirrors in uncovering the activities taking place behind cameras When I watched this movie, I felt as if I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid and comfortably watched as the dancers beat the wooden board behind a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this film fits like a glove. I don't know how I can get a copy of this film in the USA in the next few years. I recommend this film to anyone attracted to the livelihood of other cultures. It's safe to say that this film is definitely on my favorites list.
