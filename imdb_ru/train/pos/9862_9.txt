Finally I got to the infamous Ice Age. Besides the fact that maybe I’m not as funny as I hoped to see a brilliant teaser, I can’t say a word about it. Of course, this is not as impressive as the production of Disney (besides, this is Fox’s first attempt in the full-length CG film), but in some cases he has a huge heart (for example, Manfred’s gaze after seeing a sad glimpse of his past). ) I was on the verge of tears. But when they reunited the child with his father, I simply could not hold them back. A film that goes without problems on a thin line of juicy and cliché, and he manages to extract more from him than the best; The end result is one of the most moving animated creations I've ever seen. Gorgeous funny characters that grow quickly on you (and excellent vocal talents), as well as a lot of funny memorable scenes, especially on behalf of Scrat, make the film more than enough reason to launch it. Plus the Dodo scene, which is my personal favorite 2002 fun scene. <br /> <br /> I honestly don’t understand, but for some reason it really seems like CG animation will prevail in the future, but if it just means that there will be more such films (and who can forget Pixar’s works ), then I do not mind, at least for now. 9/10
