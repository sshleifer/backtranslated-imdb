Kim Novak is a witch on a hunt for a mortal lover, and James Stewart is her choice. A brilliant comedy about manners from the Broadway scene; Filmed by James Wong Howe in “The Color of the Witches” and performed by actors. Ernie Kovac is beautiful as the ever-disheveled writer Redlich. I like this movie, although it seems like few others. Kim alone makes him the winner in my Book. Ha! My number 5 movie is 1958.
