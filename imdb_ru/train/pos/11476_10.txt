Zero Day is based on the Colombian massacre in high school. and this is a video diary of two boys. at first you don’t know what will happen, you think it’s just a bad student film. until they start talking about the terrible things they are going to do in this quiet school. until they start talking about pipe bombs and cannons and start shooting at the forest. they talk a lot about this movie. everyone knows that this film is a film that you forget by watching a movie and watching a real video that two boys made. <br /> <br /> These two boys behave as if they are in a strange cult. they burn all things there. how to play stations play games dvd books homework school things. These two boys can be anyone, your friends, brothers or people you see walking along the street. he goes through daily activities there (and it makes weapons. In the videos they do, they mention the intimidation that happens to them, and how people said things about clothes and things you are involved in, I don’t say that this is right, but many people do things like that. <br /> <br /> and also the fact that these people are thought to like it because of the sensitive topic that they chose in this film. <br /> <br /> so here is my review on day zero. <br /> <br /> and let me say that the end of the shooting scene is flawed.
