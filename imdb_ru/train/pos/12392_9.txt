The “second beginning,” as the name implies, shows us the beginning of the end for humanity. Long before the appearance of the matrix, this short anime, written by Wachowski, shows us a world that may be facing us in the near future, at the turn of the 21st century, the second renaissance deepens into problems that are common to human behavior; greed, power, control, vanity, etc. <br /> <br /> The use of robots or artificial intelligence as slaves or servants is often found in fantastic / fantastic stories. The second renaissance is not an exception to this concept; however, instead of a simple “man versus machine” scheme, this story explains the struggle with which the machines were put up, the struggle for acceptance in a world driven by people. Where the human perspective is shown in the matrix films, these short animations tell both sides of the story. <br /> <br /> The second part of the 1 + 2 Renaissance era answers many of the questions posed by the original film The Matrix, for example, war broke out, how black the sky was, which led to people using batteries, and it also introduces us with a city of cars called 01, which may be related to the upcoming film "The Matrix Revolutions". <br /> <br /> I won’t give up too much of the story, since I don’t want to spoil the experience for the audience, but I will recommend it to anyone who is interested in the world of the matrix or just to anyone who is interested in Japanese animation (anime). <br /> <br /> 9/10.
