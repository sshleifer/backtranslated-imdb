Jammin 'the Blues has been a short nominated for an Oscar since 1944, mostly 10 minutes of improvised jazz played in one long jam. Marie Bryant sings "Sunny Side of the Street" at one point for the brightest moment of the film, and then jitterbugs with Archie Savage to bring this most exciting jam session to an exciting end. Directed by Goine Mili was a photographer, and this experience is shown in some of the double exposure pictures of some musicians, which makes it one of the most innovative perspectives of the 40s. According to some notes, I read that one of the musicians was white and had to be removed in silhouette in order to reflect the social attitudes of the time. What a disgrace. However, this most unusual film of that time is available on YouTube, so if you like jazz, I suggest you watch it there.
