A fascinating (albeit repetitive and rather didactic) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or upward, when trying to make yourself feel better by disturbing and suppressing someone lower than you seems to be the only option. But even here, in this desolate wasteland of lost dreams and without a future, it does not work, and turning to something or someone to console and share with him a simple act of charity gives a certain reward even if it just makes a gift tolerant , reviving memories of the past. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that there is little actual violence on the screen, this is a cruel and brutal film about the inconspicuousness of oppression (politically and personally), which does not contribute to light entertainment. It is obvious that, based on a play with a small cast of actors, a wider and more expansive attitude towards the general social and political environment would probably help the film reach a wider audience.
