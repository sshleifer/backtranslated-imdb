Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all good movies. Great movies. But nothing, and I mean that nothing fits the greatest Christmas movie of all, Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The film is so wonderful and there are so many messages in it that I cried when I watched it. Seriously, this is one of those films that need to be watched 10 times. When we see Pichu say that he will have to eat ice cream, we see sadness in his eyes and feel deep sadness, and then we ask ourselves ... what is so bad about this ice cream? Does this mean that we, people, treat ice cream as a good when everything he does makes us angry? Think a movie makes you think. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the best Santa Claus game. Unlike other Santa, he is a normal person. We see him imprison children and spy on children's dreams, and we are surprised; Is Santa we believe in really good? In addition, this Santa actually mentions Christ, the whole meaning of Christmas. <br /> <br /> You must see this cinematic masterpiece. We should just stop making films and broadcast nothing but this epic 24/7. Whether it is Christmas or not, this film gets 500/10. Anyone who says this movie is a bad, ignorant fool.
