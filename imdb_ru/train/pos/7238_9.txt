Warning of small spoilers !!! <br /> <br /> A good movie ... A VERY good movie. And I am surprised to say this myself, because I'm not a big fan of vampires, and the sound of the name of director Deran Seraphian usually means bad news. Most of his films are lower than action films, such as Death Penalty and Shooters. It was one of his first films, and perhaps he should continue to shoot horror films instead of action films. This film really fascinated me. Good achievement, not to see any famous actors or a big budget. This is really a story that keeps you focused. Especially fans of the original myth of Dracula will be pleased. Sarafian highlights another aspect of the famous Bram Stoker story and remains fairly loyal and truthful. This explains the life of the Romanian Count Dracula and how he scared the Turkish army, spewing dead corpses in front of his castle. Of course, reality and “based on real events” stop here. Drinking blood and everything else was invented by Bram Stoker. <br /> <br /> In this film, the Count (Vlad Teppish) emigrates to the USA and seduces tons of women. And they are all beautiful girls, I will give it to him. In general, a good game of unknown people, enough blood and blood to satisfy the more painful horror fans and an interesting storyline. This film is really unknown, and it was hidden in the darkest shelf in my local video store. But, of course, it is necessary to remove the dust from the cover and put it in the VCR. Damn, this is much better than the famous Nicole Kidman movie with the same name. These two films have nothing in common, but I blame this film for distracting attention from this cute little picture. Check it out ... my humble opinion is To Die For = 8.5 / 10
