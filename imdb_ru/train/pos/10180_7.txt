Indian directors have a hard time competing with films such as Laggan, where 11 henpecked, neutered males defend their village, and half of them are authentic idiots. Devdas, an unfortunate foreign drinker played by the Fedar, forgotten in oblivion, with characters running along endless corridors, not paying attention to anyone's feelings or feelings — alas, they live in a sophisticated wretchedness of red tapestry and theatrical performances. But to make a good movie, you have to go tightrope to calm frontbenchers, who are the most significant onlookers, who are hypnotized by split-skirts and fights of Dishum-Dishum, preferably with the participation of the moronic Bollywood lead actor who is a bit handsome. Thus, you can contact the director who wants to tell a story about the head of the village Leonin, who in his own words “protects his village” considers this film to be cruel or too masculine for a male audience. There are very few actors who can convey anger and pathos, like Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar allows you to watch in the yard how he takes and mocks a politician when his loyal fans laugh, when every word of satire rushes at him while his daughter bathes her grandson. This is an authentic scene that you can see in the countryside. India. Nana Patekar is an indispensable actor belonging to an old acting school that disappears in Hindi films. The portrayed violence is the hard part of storytelling with Song & Dances, added to the gawkers, without which the films will not be sold, a sad but true state of affairs. The faster this changes better for Bollywood. All said and done, this is one good movie.
