One would be very exhausted to not get caught in this jewel of the film (and I also saw hundreds of films in Hindi and Bollywood). The actors, beautiful scenery, locations and surroundings, deep emotions depicted in sweet songs (especially the singing voice of Udit Narayan, my beloved one) - everything was just fine. The human (imperfect) element was also interwoven to create some drama and control the plot, as well as allow a hearty solution. Alok Nath is such a terrific actor, so open to the emotions of the characters he portrays, he almost steals the show from young stars. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves real romances - those that go beyond superficial beauty and true love - as one of the best films, Hindi or otherwise!
