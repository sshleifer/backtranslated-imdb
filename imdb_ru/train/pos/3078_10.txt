I liked this show ... smart game, smart dialogue, great storyline with real people ... please return it or make it available on the Internet ... miss it very much ... Hopefully Davis really shines in this show . I like the idea of ​​six degrees ... It really makes sense in this crazy world. Rid yourself of these stupid reality shows and give this show a second chance. Please return it not to be embarrassed .. but please! When he got off the air, I looked on the Internet, and I liked how I can watch it with minimal interruptions, in fact, the online ABC makes it easy to enjoy the show when you miss them in prime time ... times are gone endless filming, Anytime you want to return it, I'm ready.
