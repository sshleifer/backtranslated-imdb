Hmmm, I think this line was from old movie posters. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid film that seems to have been translated from some language that was completely unfamiliar to the translator. Here's a tip: any movie that starts with a black screen and the caption “In the future ...” will be fun. This means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you. <br /> <br /> In this case, “In the future ...” means that instead of wars, nations are forced guys to climb into giant robots and figure it out to determine, well, it is never terribly clear, but it probably something really important. There are good guys (obviously, capitalists, that is, “we”) and bad guys (Commi!), And there are big robots working at bus stops. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the effects budget was quite narrow, so we I do not see a lot of big robots. There are many cheap interior scenes, and then a big space battle near the end. The space battle is especially good, as it serves no other purpose than striking the rest of the effects budget. <br /> <br /> With this money spent, the climate battle develops into (and I don’t make it up) two guys beat each other with sticks. I can always laugh at the bar, playing the final scene, complemented by the last line, which is guaranteed to leave the audience scratching his head. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is stupid. That's why I bought the tape.
