Elections are Chinese cinema, or triads in this case. Elections are held every two years to decide on a new leader, and at first glance it seems that between Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fay or, as I know him, “Another Tony Leung”) and Lok (Simon Yam, who was the judge in full contact!). Although, as soon as Locke wins, Big D refuses to accept the choice and does his best to gain recognition as a new leader. Unlike any other Asian film that I watch with gangsters, this film is not a fighter. It has its bloody moments when it’s necessary, as in Goodfellas, but basically it’s just a very effective drama. There are many characters that are really hard to track down, but I think it's a little crazy. The 100-year-old baton, which is a symbol of power, which I mentioned earlier, changed hands several times until everything calmed down. And although it may seem that the film ends at around 65 or 70 minutes, there are still a couple of big surprises that await. Simon Yam was my favorite character here and seemed to be holding the picture together. <br /> <br /> The election was quite the winner of last year's Hong Kong film award, for the best male role (Tony Leung), the best picture, the best director (Johnny To, who made the Heroic Trio !!), and the best script. He was also nominated for cinematography, editing, film screening (which I really liked) and three more acting performances (including Yama).
