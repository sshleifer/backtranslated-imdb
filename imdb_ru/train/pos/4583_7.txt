I saw it on Cantonese VCD with English subtitles. I thought the story was good, but there were times when some of the subcharacters were too excessive. It took away from the film, as well as from a pretty lame musical score, which really annoyed me throughout the film. If the musical score were improved, I could skip a few overexposed scenes. Then the film will be much, much better.
