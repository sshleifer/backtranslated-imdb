The creators chose the best people for the job, and set the scene wonderfully. Each interior is full of details that tell you about the people who live in it. Whether it is the period of the 20s (the first story), the present (that is, the 1950s) for the average history or the 1910s (the last), costumes and scenery are lovingly observed and created. I like the fussy costumes of two old women in the sanatorium - exquisite laces with the best Shetland shawls. Roland Culver in the role of Ashenden is very attractive, but not to mention the young lovers, this is Raymond Huntley as a person who is offended by the health and independence of his wife and torments our emotions. He used to play funny, pompous types, but here he is subtle, convincing and very impressive. “The Chinese Seas” (the great film of the 1930s with Gable and Harlow in the main roles) stole the plot from the episode “Know All” (and also wrote Kipling's story). I wish we could see Nonon Wayne more in the role of a jealous husband, although he had a good moment when he looked depressed in a Mexican hat. I love this gorgeous little bird who also plays his wife.
