Along with the South Pacific, “Guys and Dolls” are designed for adults - they are daring, sexy and full of men, since men and women are stretched. <br /> <br /> There is energy and aspiration that make it Stand out from the deck - the power of performance of Gene Simmond, the charm of young Brando and already masterfully Sinatra significantly improve the overall feeling and appearance of the play. <br /> <br /> Victory of Guys and Dolls is not a shame what it is: MGM musical. <br /> <br /> Still good to watch and listen with great melodies and dance numbers - it will remain one of the classic things of the cinema of the 20th century and will look with pleasure for many years. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
