I liked this show when it was broadcast on television, and I was crushed when I learned that someone had decided somewhere that it should not be continued! For years, I hung on my own copies of this show, those that I taped or taped for me. It is still. For the forces that finally decided to release this beautiful series on DVD, and I was finally able to get my hands on the little ready-made kits. Which brings me to this part; The part about what this show is all about. <br /> <br /> American gothic about the good verses of evil, basically the struggle between Lucas Buck (i.e. Buck, from B). He is an evil sheriff from a small town in South Carolina who manages things the way he wants things to be managed and stops at nothing. <br /> <br /> I felt that the show was wonderfully written and directed, and a lot of life still had to live. I really hated when it was canceled, but it seems to me that this is what happens when I finally found something worth watching on TV. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole coped well with the role of Sheriff Lucas Buck, he has just the right amount of charm of evil poems to accomplish this. Other actors also did a great job, so I think you could say that even casting was a hit for me.
