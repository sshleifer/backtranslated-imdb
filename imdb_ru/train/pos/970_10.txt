Now I saw a lot of films in my time, but each had a few select ones that were really good for me. And I'm a 19-year-old man who is impressed with this film aimed at a youth audience. This is a very undervalued gem for those who watch foreign films. Almost all actions are plausible, the graphics are decent (which you won't even care about when you watch a movie. Believe me, quarreling with graphics would be stupid), the story is well written and This is a movie that everyone can enjoy, not just children. <br /> <br /> That's basically what this film taught me. This one, made me laugh ... many, two, made me feel the characters, how do you think, and three, this is a very inspiring story. By the end of this movie you will feel good. Of course, in this anime there wasn’t any little child turning into a great warrior and anything to defeat some great evil. This is a formula that is often used. But in this case it is excusable, because, although they use puppets for some characters and average graphics, which you saw 5 years ago, you shouldn’t judge her appearance. It is very touching, the ending is original, and it keeps you in the film, as it should be. However, if you try to compare this with other films, such as “The Endless Story”, or with the fact that it will be different, your opinion. See how it is and you will like it. <br /> <br /> A lot of time has passed since I was impressed with this. The only other film in which I had this feeling was when I saw TMNT, when it came out. There is something in this movie that I felt in TMNT, and it really made me love him. So don't overestimate and take this movie too seriously, just enjoy it.
