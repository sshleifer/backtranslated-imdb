The man from “Snow River II” does not reinvent the wheel, but is a beautiful film that is pleasant to the public, and that strikes you with some wonderful notes. <br /> <br /> For those fans who need the elements that made the original film “The Man from the Snowy River” hit, (a breathtaking landscape, an amazing score, sweet romanticism and a spectacular action), this film really delivers. This story begins a few years after the end of the first, Jim (Tom Burlinson) leaves, collecting his fortune in the brood of breeding horses. He returns to pick up what he stopped with his brave, well-educated beloved Jessica (played by the Australian divine Lady Sigrid Thornton), who is still trying to break out of her corsetry education at her cattle station (Harrison is playing American Brian). Dennehy). The foil for Jim and the character that shocks the plot is a wealthy high-class snob Alistair Patton (Nicholas Idi), who aimed at Jessica. Add to this a bit of social tension around the land tenure and a stallion with a bad attitude from the first film, and this is the plot. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is acting. Tom Berlinler fits tightly into Jim's wide-brimmed hat and laconic humor. Sigrid Thornton is a great heroine and they control some real chemistry on the screen. Filling Kirk Douglas' durable shoes has never been easy, and Brian Dennehy stomps and screams, but he never feels very authentic in this piece. <br /> <br /> The music is swift and fluffy, and the cinema can be from Victoria's Tourist Reel. However, there is a moment when I feel very indulgent, as if the director wants another helicopter rider to show how great the landscape is without any personal human drama. There would be a little more sand here, we are Australians, we can accept it !! There are some very poignant moments with a stallion that defy faith. However, the funny thing about this movie is that there are some really inventive and touching scenes among some bright clichés. Jim puts the saddle on the stallion (VERY Horse whispers ahead of time) Jim and Jessica sit at home, a fabulous scene where Jim shows how Alistair rides with his faithful whip. I understand why this character is such an icon. <br /> <br /> In general, a very pleasant continuation. Here it is hoped that all involved want to do something else. Snow Man III: Craigs. I’m sure we would all like to see how Jim and Jessica do on their farm. <br /> <br /> There are a few extra scenes on the Australian DVD. It is worth if you are already a fan.
