Not sure if it’s considered a spoiler or not, so be careful: <br /> <br /> Just a small but important thing to watch out for, an intriguing opportunity: the boys steal a green Citroen at one point, for a joyful ride return it to its owner, causing him deliberate and vindictive hidden damage to the car, hoping that the owner will crash. Is this the same car that they stole much later from a family picnic? We know that the original owner sold it. In the end, they leave on a dangerous road, which, as I understand it, has been closed to all but pedestrians for the past ten years. Brand new bias to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this film could be called The Scent of a Woman. I do not recall another film, of course, not American, which treats the aroma of a woman in such a frank and open way, very similar to the “nose” of beautiful Bordeaux.
