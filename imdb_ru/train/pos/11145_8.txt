After racism, the rural exodus, also known as migration from the country, is another socio-political problem of the 1960s. The West Side Story has dealt with racism with the help of a love feast from an artistic point of view. Now, the Midnight Cowboy is dealing with a rural exodus tragedy of friendship from a psychological point of view. He has a very sad end, and we see how one of the two satellites of fate passed away. <br /> <br /> Directed by John Schlesinger skillfully conveys to us the deepest secret thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and evaluations of two New Yorks. scum. While handsome Joe Buck (Voight) dreams that all the beautiful women of the world begged him to share a wild love fantasy, poor Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthy life in a clean and sunny Florida. Accordingly, Joe becomes energetic to turn his fantasies into reality; and Ratso becomes a kidnapper to raise enough money to migrate to Florida. In addition, Ratso helps Joe find a way to do his best. They start sharing everything in life. They share food, they share medicines, they live in an uninhabited house, they share their incomes and, thus, they share a common destiny. Unfortunately, as the story progresses, Joe realizes that being beautiful is not the only thing that makes all beautiful women begging him to have fun; and what's more, Ratso cannot see Florida, since his heart was not defeated by his illness while he was on the bus that drove him there. <br /> <br /> Power is always true, and the Weak has no right in daylight. From here "Midnight" gives an actual look. <br /> <br /> Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy. Every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who carry their inevitable fate. Due to this, the Midnight Cowboy is a provocative look at the socio-political problem, the exodus from the countryside.
