One of my best films ever, maybe because I was good on the punk scene in the late 70s and went to many concerts about Hazel, but the film was a good storyline and played very well as Hazel, and then and Phil Daniels is confident in his latest project Eastenders !! Excellent performance of many unknown actors, who, if you do not take your eyes off, will see them in many British TV shows. Experience: Carver out of the Bill, the more I look, the more I notice, well, if you have not yet seen it still has a night with the video, do not forget to dig up a nose pin and heavy black eye makeup and shave your head in style Mohaniana .... Enjoy
