Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mysterious woman (Fay Helm) in a bar and invites her to watch a show with him. She agrees, provided that they do not exchange any information about each other - even names. Sometimes these are the best dates. However, when he returns to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Scott's wife was killed. His alibi is a mysterious woman, but no one can remember to be seen, and as a result Scott is sentenced to death for the murder of his wife. His secretary of Kansas (Ella Raines) is not convinced of his fault and intends to find a woman who can save him from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, and the viewer is 100% behind the attempt of Kansas to get to the truth. We accompany her through some memorable scenes, for example, her pursuit of a Mac bartender (Andrew Tombs) at night and a claustrophobic place where Cliff, the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) leads her to walk, drink and dance while he plays with friends This is such a blatant description of sexual desire that it is a special part of the film, as everyone sweats intensely and rhythmically throughout the entire scene. Ella Raines is good in the title role, and Thomas Gomez is a pretty cop. Alan Curtis started off well as an embarrassed, innocent man, but as soon as he was arrested, his speech turned left, as he became completely unpleasant for Kansas for no reason. God knows why she was stuck next to him. <br /> <br /> The film does not make you think about who the killer is, as we know about halfway through the movie, but it doesnâ€™t matter. In fact, it adds to the tension and dramatic development of the story, as we will be in Kansas to find out what is going on and then to hell with it! This is a good movie with some great scenes, but although Elisha Cook Jr. plays a memorable role, I just never like him in everything I see him ... someone gives me a tie ...
