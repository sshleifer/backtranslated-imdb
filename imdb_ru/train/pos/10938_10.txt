Rarely do I ever come across a film so full that I have to talk about it immediately. This film is definitely one of the best entertainment available and is very authentic. I happened to see a dubbed version, but I am now going to get a DVD remaster with the original Chinese dialogue. However, dubbing did not interfere and sometimes gave some seriously ridiculous humor: “The poisonous clan shakes the world !!!” <br /> <br /> The story remains true to the Chinese methods of intrigue, suspense and interpersonal relationships. You can expect twists and turns when 5 poisons and an expert pace are identified. <br /> <br /> Choreography for fighting martial arts is a separate class, and you need to believe it. It's like watching how real animals fight each other, but are created from their own forms of arcane martial arts. This level of skill among the actors is unmatched in modern cinema. <br /> <br /> This combination provides a serious dose of old Chinese culture, and I recommend it solely on the basis of the film’s genuine intention to tell about the fighting. history of art and mastery of its execution. ... Of course, if you just want people to beat each other along with the rude forms of ancient Chinese torture, be my guest!
