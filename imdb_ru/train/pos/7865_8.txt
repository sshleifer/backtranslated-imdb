Page 3 is a great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Never in the film did I look into space. Konkana Sen did a good job in the film, although I think that someone with great charm or enthusiasm would be better, but she did an excellent job. All the supporting actors were also very good and helped the film. Boman Irani did a great job. There is one thing that stands out in this film: HISTORY, it is gorgeous and very realistic, it does not beat around the bush, it is very straightforward in sending your message. I think that more films, as it should be done, I am tired of watching the same films with sugar floss over and over again, it becomes difficult to digest them now. Everyone has to watch, this is a great movie. -Just my 2 cents :)
