“Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow is a lot of fun. Like another reviewer, I repeatedly laughed out loud. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-conscious, research. Don't expect Bergman here. This film is about young people in the early 60s in Sweden and about the problems, read by the contradictions * that the nation and the world are facing. At times, Yellow seems to be a serious socio-political documentary film in which Lena, the main character and others, interview both ordinary people and politicians (for example, at home Olaf Palme). In other cases, Yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary. All this time, Yellow plays the role of a personal documentary film, which tells about Lena's life - her family life, her love, her political views, her view of herself. Is she a full man ?? complex, flawed, controversial, happy, sad, curious. And above all of this is placed a remarkable extra dimension of director Sieman and his team, documenting themselves, documenting Lena. This is what the yellow wings really give me. Not only do they suddenly appear in some very funny times and in some funny relationships, reminding the viewer that this is fiction and invention, but their presence in itself is another layer of the film; they shoot themselves shoot themselves. I was reminded of a Bjork music video of the same quality? music video about creating a music video to infinity, with each iteration becoming more and more strange and animated. I think that Shoman might have meant something like that. Although "Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow ”can not be a cup of tea for everyone, it is, of course, smart, witty, refreshing, boiling and authentic.
