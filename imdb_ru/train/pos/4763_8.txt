Unlike other comments, I found this film fascinating, even with all its flaws and the zombies of some actors. <br /> <br /> Being a technologist, I found the experiments interesting and hardware realistic. Although the reading of people's thoughts through the computer sounds fantastic, now experiments are being conducted to do just that. I note that these experiments are at a very early stage, and the results are not yet favorable. <br /> <br /> Movie characters are well played. The girl, although she replays a little, looks dumb suitable. A truck driver is a call for real truck drivers. At first, the minister expresses doubt (the chief investigator tells the minister that he (the minister) is not sure if he believes that God created the person or that person created God. But the minute the chips do not work, he falls into his faith. Only Ph.D. plays zombies. The secrets they hide are appropriate for their characters. In the face of death, they react like real people. <br /> <br /> The film is a warning against the dangers of unrestricted government surveillance. As a strictly thriller , the film lacks sharp sensations. As a scientific exercise with philosophical foundations, it is fascinating.
