This is the most beautiful movie. Color photography is beautiful because it shows the magnificence of the Metropolitan Opera in bright colors. Other interior scenes in various mansions, etc. Equally brilliant. As for music, what else can be said, apart from the voice of Lanzi, was at its peak when he sang the most famous and beloved arias of many worlds. Amazing Dorothy Kirsten is also pleased because her soprano voice blends with the voice of Lanza in delightful harmony. Of course, Hollywood took his customary liberties with the life story of Caruso. In the storyline is very little valuable, relating to real events. For example, the facts related to his death are completely fabricated and irrelevant to the truth. There are some very good websites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain several of his photos. These websites can be found using any good search engine. There are also several books related to his life story. But the fictional storyline does not spoil this beautiful film. The voices of Lanzi, Kirsten and the choir members are the real stars of this film. Enjoy, I know that I'm sure.
