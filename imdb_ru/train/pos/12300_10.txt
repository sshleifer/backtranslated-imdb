This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo plays Anna Cristi again, but all other characters have actors other than the English version. Both were shot one after the other, because Garbo had so many fans in Germany. Garbo herself allegedly preferred her Anna Christie in this version over the English version. This is a good story that must be seen by Garbo fans.
