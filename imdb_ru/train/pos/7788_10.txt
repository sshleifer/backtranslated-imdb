I love Ashley Judd and I think all her films are great. Ruby <br /> <br /> in paradise is one of her best. This is a very underrated film that you really should see to appreciate it. The story of a woman who tried to do it herself and refused to give in to temptations that would facilitate her life. Some of her films, such as “Kiss of the Girls” and “Time to Kill”, were probably better filmed at the box office and video rental. It was a very good movie <br /> <br />, but take the time to really watch Ruby, and I think you will agree that this is one of the best Ashley movies. <br /> <br />
