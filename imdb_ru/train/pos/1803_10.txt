My dog ​​recently passed away, and it was a movie that I loved as a child, so I had to watch it in order to try to cheer up. <br /> <br /> (Be careful, dog, I mean spoilers.) This film is not only for children, and it is far from ordinary. It was established in New Orleans in 1939. First of all, the dog was not depicted as an extra family member in this film, but as an adult with his own difficult life to deal with. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Charlie is not too different from his dishonest and cruel business partner Carriff. He is ruled by money, greedy and just escaped the death penalty, as he states at the beginning of the function. The difference between Charlie and Curry is that Charlie can learn and is willing to listen to others; Ann Marie and his girlfriend, Itch. Carface will not even listen to a fat, ugly dog ​​with big glasses, which turns out to be closest to him. <br /> <br /> Carface is trying to kill the hero, because he wants 100% of the profits in their business and will not accept only 50% - a very unusual way of dying of a German shepherd dog. In addition, being eaten by a prehistoric-sized alligator that ends up sparing your life because you can sing is very unlikely whether you are a dog or not. This is a caricature, and so it is logical here. <br /> <br /> Carrion's revenge method is murder, and Charlie believes that success is the best revenge, financial success. Having survived death, he starts his business, taking the source of funding from Carface, a very talented girl who has the ability to communicate with animals. They win a whole bunch of races, and Charlie tells her that he will give money to the poor - a hint of a hint: Charlie and Itch live in a landfill, and therefore are poor. He spends money on his casino / bar / theater, and not on other "poor." The reason Anne Marie has the ability to talk to animals is because she has compassion and listens carefully. She teaches Charlie ethics, pointing to his gambling, lies and theft. Charlie is trying to make up for this by buying his dresses. She added the ethics his business needed, while Charlie was in charge of management, and Itchy provided construction. <br /> <br /> Carface uses violence and material damage to destroy Charlie’s business, which is not protected by the government. Charlie loses everything, and he only has this little girl. In the end, he had to choose between her life and his own. First, he takes a watch for the purpose of self-preservation and sets them when the girl began to sink. Both the girl and the clock were drowning, and he had to choose which of them, and he chose the girl. <br /> <br /> A great part of this film, which tells about a person’s ability to learn the right things over time. and the child’s ability to cope with the natural death of his pet lies in the fact that he never shows anyone who dies! The clock symbolizes his life, and the clock is shown immersed and stopped. All deaths were suggestive, even for the villain. I have not cried during this film so far, and I received much more from it, so I had to record it and share it with you.
