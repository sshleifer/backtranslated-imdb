Despite the other comments listed here, this is probably the best film “Dirty Harry”; a film that reflects - for better or worse - the country's socio-political feelings during the years of Reagan's glory in the early 80s. This is also an awesome action movie. <br /> <br /> Opening with a liberal woman judge who canceled the murder case due to lack of material evidence and then went straight to the cafe faced several unfortunate hooligans (the scene prompted by the famous line "Come on, make my Day ”),“ Sudden Strike ”is one non-stop roller coaster of an action movie. The first time you take a breath, when the restless inspector Callahan is sent to a nearby city to investigate the background of the dead hood. From there it only gets better if over Callahan to cope with a huge group of grotesque thugs, as well as with a sheriff with a mysterious past. Excellent direction, photography and a fun script help make this film one of the best in the 80s.
