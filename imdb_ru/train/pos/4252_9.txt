This film takes you in itself in the first minutes and keeps you to the end. he has a very humane history and very good selected music. Moritz Bleibtroy (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby Metshurata (Gigi Amato) enjoy the game. It is recommended to people who are tired of the militants and want to watch a good movie.
