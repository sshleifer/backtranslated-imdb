Steve Carell made a career portraying a little strange guy, first in The Daily Show, and then in various supporting roles. In The Virgin, Carell found a clever and funny script that makes good use of his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stiizer, a middle-aged man who lives a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a bit odd, but in a sense clumsy, nice guy. One night, when he first spoke with his colleagues, Andy accidentally discovered that he was a virgin. His colleagues David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romani Malko) and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially mocked Andy about his situation. But it is clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent man, who is Andy, and they decide to help him, helping him to end his virginity. And so begins the search for Andy in adulthood. Andy is a typical innocent, and most of the humor stems from his naivete in the situation in which he finds himself throughout the film. Part of the humor is rude things, but most of them are just clever comedy. In addition, I found some parts of the film really touching, because Andy found that he develops romantic relationships and friendship, perhaps for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to portray a movie as a love story or drama; This is a comedy. However, every good comedy I've ever seen contains enough hearts for you to take care of the characters. A good comparison would be “Wedding Crushers” from this summer. Virgin has similar humor, but perhaps it is a little more vulgar in some of its jokes. I especially liked the finale of the film, which, it seemed to me, was the perfect way to finish the film. Without giving anything away, it reminded me of "Something about Mary." Very light and cheerful; it makes you laugh and smile, and that's exactly what you should feel when you finish the comedy. I highly recommend.
