It was 8 seasons, but first, in early 1959, and last, in the autumn of 1965, were shorter than seasons 2-7. CBS Chief William Paley canceled Rohaid’s production after seeing the 1st show of the 8th season in September 1965 because he didn’t like the show without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor, who quit after the 7th season. The latest new episode was shown in November 1965. The only CBS transfer in 1966, January 4, 1966, was restarted. <br /> <br /> I often wondered why Rawhide did not switch to color photography last season? Most of the major westerns of the 1960s switched to color by 1965. CBS broadcast color broadcasts for many of their sitcoms this fall, but westerns such as Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained black and white. On September 17, 1966, Gunsmoke was the last Western (and the last prime-time series to change color) for the Snap Decision episode.
