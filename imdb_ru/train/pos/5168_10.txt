I am a fan of such films. Films that will take you back and allow you to relive your childhood. I am already an adult and I have a lot of responsibilities, such as a mortgage, children, dogs, wife and many others. I enjoy my life, but it is not as innocent and carefree as at the age of twelve. Mike Binder's Indian Summer knows this and explores it, as if he were twelve years old. It brings you back to a time when life was simpler and much more fun. This brings you back to the time when you are worried about your first kiss and are thinking whether you can finish the camp marathon, and these were important questions. “Indian Summer” is a fantastic film and you should watch it at least once a year so you can relax and laugh ... and remember. <br /> <br /> Movie stars Kevin Pollak, Bill Paxton, Diane Lane and Matt Craven (and many others) were childhood friends, which their former camp counselor, Uncle Lou, calls to Tamakva camp. Uncle Lou perfectly plays Alan Arkin. He is a kind of guy who is the patriarch of the group. He also knows everything and embraces the true spirit of the figure of a father and a person who understands simple things in life. It is difficult for him to communicate with today's children, who need a player splashing in their ears when they are in a place of great beauty, such as Tamakva. This is a camp where moose roam the camp, the leaves are painted in the colors that God has given them, and they are watered as far as they can see the eye. Uncle Lou longs for the old days and asks his former campers to return to the camp to see one of them take over the camp. While they are together again, we can see their trials and tribulations, and perhaps a new love will arise between them. <br /> <br /> When the adults return to the camp, they soon begin to behave like children again, as the typical pranks of the camp are played out over and over again. They take out toilet paper from the tents, put toothpaste on sleeping bags, and so on. Everything is done in a fun way, and with actors like Pollack and Paxton, this is a very fun thing. <br /> <br /> But besides fun, we explore some very real adult emotions that everyone can relate to. In one of my favorite scenes, Kevin Pollak and Elizabeth Perkins go out to the bay, where in childhood they went canoeing. Pollack cannot understand how it all looks small, and Perkins finally tells him that the bay has not become smaller, but larger. This is not the main thing, but it does it subtly. We all grow, we all move on and, unfortunately, we all cannot live like 20 years ago. The more things change, the more they stay the same. <br /> <br /> “Indian Summer” is a character-driven movie, and it was beautifully written by Mike Binder, who actually attended the Tamakva camp (like Sam Raimi, who played Stick in the film), and it’s his tender and vivid memories of his experiences feed the film. There are many touching scenes, as well as a lot of fun. Both are perfect. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. I love everything about it, and this is a real hidden gem. <br /> <br /> 10/10
