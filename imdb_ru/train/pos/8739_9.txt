This is a funny movie. It has all the usual Disney components (music, a large selection of characters, history, attraction) intertwined with superb animation and excellent voice talents from lesser-known actors, such as, say, Antz and Price of Egypt. /> <br /> Characters work very well and have strong appeal, and humor is aimed at a wide level that overcomes the barriers of generations. The film is also presented in an excellent cinema format that adds cinema impressions. <br /> <br /> Call me crazy, but I saw the movie three times and Iâ€™m going to invite new friends to watch it this weekend. , Many skeptics saw this film at my recommendation and were not disappointed. I work in multiplex, and I can honestly say that no one ever left this film without a sense of satisfaction. <br /> <br /> Watch it, and do not despair, because it is lively, you will love this movie and you will definitely stay for final credits! Slips and outs at the end is the funniest part of the film, which is full of laughter everywhere.
