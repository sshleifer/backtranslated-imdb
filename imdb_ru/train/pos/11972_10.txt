I grew up watching Full House as a kid. I stopped watching him for years, but about two weeks ago I started watching him again. Now my children watch the show, and they also love to watch it. My children can't believe this DJ, and I am the same age. <br /> <br /> I really like this show, because this show can be watched with your family. It has good teachings from which your children can learn. Also there are no drugs and violence on it. Also, when children have problems at a show, they can always turn to their family for help. This message, which children should receive from television for several days, turn to their family for help, not to drugs. Children should watch more shows, such as Full House, rather than half a day on TV now. <br /> <br /> I also love the show, because it makes you laugh, and it is mundane. It speaks about the real problems of life and family issues. You can always learn a lesson from the show. <br /> <br /> I vote for the show for 10.
