Well, I have to say it was a damn fun movie. Despite the fact that the duplication was quite funny, and there were some strange moments when the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason, I was not disappointed. In fact, the story was quite interesting: the last member of the Poisonous Clan must track down the other five members and find out which of them uses their skills for evil, and who uses them for good. The trick is that during training all the clans were disguised, and since then they all returned to society under the guise of and changed their names. <br /> <br /> Fighting is a joy to watch, because each member of the Poison The clan has a different fighting style: toad (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard and centipede. In combat scenes, the actors jump everywhere, and, fortunately, the camera stays in place and uses a wide enough shot so that you can clearly see the whole action. <br /> <br /> The only drawback of the film is that the story tends to pull a little in the first half up to the first sequence of the fight. But stick to it and you will not be disappointed!
