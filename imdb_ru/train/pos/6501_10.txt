If you want to get almost everything you want to know about World War II from different perspectives, this DVD will take you, you WILL learn new things, so much so that you don’t need other documentaries on the subject. Get it, look it, learn from it. Good for school use. As a bonus, watch this with Tora Tora Tora, saving Private Ryan, Patton, a group of brothers, a bridge too far, the longest day, and other World War II epics along with it to make your knowledge of World War II even more complete. Sir Lawrence Oliver’s voice adds to the overall atmosphere of each episode in this 26-part series. Seriously, you won't find the best WWII documentary on the subject. PERFECT 10 !!!
