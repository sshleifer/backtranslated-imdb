This is not the most fun movie I've ever seen. Starting with the four offenders, sent by their fathers to the Winberg Military Academy, a tone is set that continues unabated throughout this stupid film and does not stop for a second. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to try to describe this film; elements of humor are so noticeable and brilliantly concluded that at first glance they seem to be nothing more than a silly comedy about the passionate desire of the 80s. But it is much more than that! Having just remembered those people from MAD Magazine, Up the Academy offers a formula and style that I have never seen since then as duplicates of ANY "funniest" Hollywood offer in previous years. In fact, the film is so full of infantile Cornball material that you can guess that the writers themselves were a pair of 14-year-olds. Watch this movie if you like acting "immature." Classic *****
