This one has a lot of things - Sinatra, Stein, Kahn, Pamela Britten - and a smaller amount of dross - Iturbi, Grayson - plus a bit of ho-hum - Kelly. It was the first true Sinatra film in which the producer spent a lot of money and you could see it on the screen (he previously appeared in two low-budget films “Higher and Higher” and “Step Live”), but if they only relied on Sinatra and the deep sixties selfish pianos from Grayson plus Iturbi would have stayed with a much tougher film and a better showcase for Sinatra. Since in all of his songs he is heavily hammered out of two duets with Kelly - “We hate leaving, I begged her” - in my own solos, “What makes the sunset, charm of you and I fall in love too easily.” Despite this move, Lively remains Sinatra’s best musical of the forties by one tenth of the budget.
