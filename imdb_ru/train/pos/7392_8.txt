I really like this movie. He has excellent chemistry between the actors, and he tells a rather universal story, the story of the prodigal son. However, what I liked most was the aspect that the bath was not just a background for the story. As the father told his son the story of his wifeâ€™s family in the northern deserts of China, the element of water and bathing becomes almost a sacred ritual. The water was so scarce that the simple bath had greater depth and significance. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film was very effective. However, there were moments when he was on the verge of "too" sweet ... bordering on cover during a concert in the park. But overall, I highly recommend this movie.
