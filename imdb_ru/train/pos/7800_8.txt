I first watched this movie when I was about 13 years old. Then he hit me, and in many ways it still happens now. But I am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical part now. Very little effort is made to study racism and interact with it, and therefore it cannot realize that the most powerful weapon against racism is to understand its essence in those who commit it. Instead, we get the dichotomy - on the one hand, beck and forest in the three-dimensional panoramic vision of the rainbow - on the other hand, two-dimensional characters are portrayed as impregnable mindless evil. <br /> <br /> All this makes for a great plot of the film, but it bothers me that people see the image as “accurate.”
