I first watched “Walking High” movies when I was about 8 years old, and I thought that Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job, they must have done anyway, because after watching the movies I tried to find out how can be more about this sheriff. Buford Pusser, how can I. All three parts of the film gave me a chill, and Buford Pusser was a real hero, I just wish he was alive today and that there were more people like him. I would like to thank him for getting rid of all the crimes and being so brave. I am very sorry that his family had to endure such horror and pain. My heart goes out to them. So from the 30-year-old fan of Sheriff Pusser and the 3 parts of the movie “Walking High” and the actors who portrayed him, please do not deny these films and actors, they just tried to tell us what a wonderful person Real Buce Pusser was and He has a wonderful family. And to all the young people who may have heard little about Buford, I invite you to watch the Walking High films and learn more about him.
