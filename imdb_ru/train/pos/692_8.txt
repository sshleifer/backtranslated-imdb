I first saw this film at the festival. There were a lot of good movies, but few people made me think about it for a long time, and Insomnia Nightmare was definitely one of them. Tess is definitely a talented director. The pictures were great. Casting was perfect. Dominic beamed in her role, which she beautifully built. There was not much information about his character, but she wrote the story so much that we cared about him. And Ellen ... I can't wait to see where she ended up! She shows a lot of talent, and I hope she makes some more films. Tess shows that all budgets of a million dollars are trying to get cheap thrills, since all this is not necessary as long as there is a good story and actors. Glory to all who are associated with this film. And thanks to Tess and Co. for distribution on DVD!
