I saw it recently through a cable channel. The film is great; This is one of the few musicals that I saw, which does not shy away from light and darkness. It depicts some of the grandeur of the era along with much misery. Some dance episodes occur so much, I did not know where to look further. One day I will go and see it on the big screen, just to see what happens. But what really brings it to another level is the performance of Oliver Reed as Bill Sykes. Not only is he a very mean and threatening person, but there is something else, some inner demons. I got the impression that if you corral him, he is capable of anything. As if the character Sykes was on the verge of madness, just waiting for the trigger. I saw Robert Newton's Bill Sykes from the 1948 movie, and I thought he was “just” a bad egg, but the performance of Oliver Reed scared me in my own living room.
