This film is a remake of two films that were much better. The latter, "Heaven can wait," was great, I suggest you see it. This one is not so great. The last third of the film is not so bad, and Chris Rock is starting to show some fun things that brought him where he is today. However, I do not know what happened to the first two parts of this film. It looks like some really bad movie “B”, where people sound like they are in some bad television sit-coma. The situations are forced, and it looks like they are just trying to finish the story so they can start a real movie. It all seems fake, and editing is just bad. I do not know how they could release this film in this way. In any case, the last part is not so bad, so wait for the video and watch it later.
