This is what I call the movie “Sci Fi; pre sci fi. This is no better than Lugosi / Karloff in this incredibly good movie like “mood.” These two true artists are at their best, just like the storyline. <br /> <br /> Karloff does an amazing job as a scientist who sees himself caught in the grip of vanity, pride and scientific competition. I was overwhelmed by the idea of ​​observing a man drowning in the three previously mentioned concepts. I was saddened and at the same time fascinated by the two stars that they make themselves. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of movie that asks for a remake. This time Harrison Ford played the role of Karloff and, possibly, Kieffer Sutherland in the role of Bela Lagosi. Perhaps this can be done almost as well. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best works ever created in Hollywood. As I said ... it doesn't get any better. Never.
