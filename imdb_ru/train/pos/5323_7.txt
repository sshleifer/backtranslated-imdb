There are a number of things that are not correct, although this is not very important, because what happened with whom and when is still in dispute. The most blatant freedom with the facts that I think of is when they start playing Kaiserkeller by Bruno Koshmider, when in fact they played Indra and later transferred to Kaiserkeller. <br /> <br /> I agree with Semprinni20 that the film was inclined in favor of the Pete Best version, but if he is a history consultant, then I think he calls the footage. I also agree with Semprinni that the recordings played by Pete Best have the final say on why he was fired. <br /> <br /> Although the film is not as generous as the later film "Backbeat", I prefer this film because it is more accurate and because it has a better script with a deeper characterization. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of things in the film that are quite substantial - for example, Brian Epstein, who is trying to hide the fact that he was “weird”, only to find out that the group always knew that he was gay. Small touches, for example, when a group enters a cafe and orders “Corn Flakes with Milk”. My favorite scene, which really has some basis, is where, at the audition, Stuart Sutcliffe just bought his bass guitar but can't play it, so he stands with his back to the impresario and tries to pretend, but he is caught. This is rock and roll. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
