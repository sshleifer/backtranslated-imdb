What about Tara Fitzgerald's compelling speeches? She is perfectly believable, because the wounded Mrs. Graham, hardened by experience, sharp and strong-willed, but not insured from the passionate attention of Mr. Markham. Toby Stevens is a master of his character, through every mischievous look and every hot-tempered character, every glimpse of insight in his eyes and an expressive expression on his face. He is the power of passion and hope that will restore Helen's wounded spirit. Huntingdon Graves is a great representation of an unreformable fraudster. Nevertheless, in spite of all that he did, in his refusal to play the hypocrite in the end there is an undeniable human dignity; at least he knows about his own mistakes and how they brought him to ruin. Helen’s attempt to save his soul — after he left him and took away their child at a time when it was unheard of — is a triumph of hope, hope and faith in the value of every human life and soul, no matter how wrong, no matter how sinful neither could a man be. The persistence of Markham can then be regarded as her reward for her faith and uncompromising moral character. Although self-confident ideas about morality, so strongly represented in the Tenant, seem outdated by today's standards, history is permeated with integrity, passion and conviction that still have an impact. The tenant is much more believable than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; here is the adaptation that makes new justice. I highly recommend viewing it!
