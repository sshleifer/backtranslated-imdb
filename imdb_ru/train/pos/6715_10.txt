I loved watching “Sabrina, the Teenage Witch” on Friday night on TGIF ABC. I think it was one of the best shows on TGIF. My friends and I met every Friday to watch this show, and we never missed an episode. <br /> <br /> My favorite character is Salem. He was adorable and sooo funny. I also liked Sabrina Harvey's boyfriend. He was HOT. I think Melissa Joan Hart also played a good teenage witch. My favorite episodes were Sabrina through the mirror and Hilda and Zelda: teenage years. These episodes were great. <br /> <br /> In general, I really miss this show. I hope one day ABC will return it with new episodes. I give this show 10/10 stars.
