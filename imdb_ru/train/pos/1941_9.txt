I actually thought it was a comedy, and sat watching her, waiting from laughter to an ass. it soon became clear that this was not a comedy, or at least not a comedy like "Jim Carrey". we continued to watch the characters - the film begins with rather gloomy, worried people who came together to try to overcome one of their main fears - the fear of water, the fear of swimming. we begin to gradually dive into their lives, become witnesses of their troubles, guess their thoughts. <br /> <br /> In fact, I made it look much darker than it actually is, and, moreover, the chain of events soon gives some light and hope for their lives. <br /> <br /> I probably would not have watched the movie if I knew that it was not a comedy, but rather a drama, but I had a good time, enjoyed the story and did not mind spending about 90 minutes on it. <br /> <br /> Many films describe the alienation of people in the Western world, this film shows how people can get together and help each other <br /> <br /> "and if you meet in the light of a dying day her, do not let her pass by you and go away, do not lose her, she is your gift from the sun ... "<br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> peace and love
