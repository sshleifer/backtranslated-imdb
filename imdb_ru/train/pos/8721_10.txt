Disney (and, of course, the wonderful guys from PIXAR) offer a pleasant humorous story combined with the best computer animation. I admit that perhaps the “faces” of the beetles were a bit more static than in “Antz”, and they only had four legs (in “Antz” six ...). But the backgrounds were excellent and the animation was exciting. But let it be a lesson: it was not the computer that made such a success: it was the man behind the car who added the nice little twists and turns I missed in Antz. Some highlights were, of course, "dead ends" at the end (so keep looking at the end, it's worth it!), Which were very funny and original. The line "Filmed completely on the spot" was intended for a more attentive viewer.
