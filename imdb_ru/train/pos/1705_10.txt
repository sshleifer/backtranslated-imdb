"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I do not understand why this film did not receive the best critics, it is funny, harmless and cute. I first watched it when I was 11 years old, and I really fell in love with it ... 2 days later I received it on VHS :-P Until today, I showed it to many friends, and they all liked it, but nobody knew film before. I think this is the problem, almost no one knows about it, so almost no one can like it ... This film never had a real chance, which is sad, "SI" really has the potential of a comedy like "Monsters Inc.". Or “Space balls.” Okay, enough of discontent - I really wanted to say that if you want to laugh over your head, look! Even if you are not angry at it, you should look! -> Get ready to laugh, earth scum!
