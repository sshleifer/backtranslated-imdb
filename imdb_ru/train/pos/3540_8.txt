I bought this game on an impulse purchase from Walmart. I'm glad I did. It was very interesting to listen to Sean Connery and play the game. I thought the graphics were the best I've ever seen in a movie / game remake. Bonus levels were very hard! Sniper, I think, was too strong, he upset me so much that I did not play this game for a week and a half. There were too many people who shot at you, and there was nothing behind them that could be hidden. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can change is a system update. I did not notice any difference from not upgraded equipment to upgraded, for example, buying improved armor, did not seem to make the armor stronger or more filled my life counter. I really liked the Q helicopter. I think the developers did a good job.
