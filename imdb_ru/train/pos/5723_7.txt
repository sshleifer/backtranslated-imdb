so, being a rather deep fan of horror films, I saw a film a long time ago that really made me jump (or play nervously). <br /> <br /> I will definitely get it on DVD when it comes out ... damn better than the ring. What I do not understand is that so many people with whom we spoke after the film thought it was terrible, well, if this is what you think, then so be it ... I know that I liked it and it takes a fair amount to make me actually feel scared, so I must say this is worth a look. <br /> <br /> Now you may be disappointed in the story if you need everything neat and tidy, because the plot has advanced a bit to help build the story (I think that if it were shown in chronological order, it would have ruined everything.) <br /> <br /> I’m actually glad that there were very few bloody riots in this film ... maybe all the rest of you studio scriptwriters and anything will understand you don’t need to spray all red on the set to make people afraid.
