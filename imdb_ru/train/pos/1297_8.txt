True to adapting a witty and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer (or something), relying heavily on the first-person narrative, but no worse. Sad (petty-bourgeois), philosophical and damn comic, the best way I could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like the more intelligent Charles Bukowski (no disrespect for CB intention). Surprisingly funny, but also a dark analysis of social and sexual relationships, the filmâ€™s great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognizable way that it makes you wonder: why aren't other films like that? One of the rare examples of how a good book makes a good movie.
