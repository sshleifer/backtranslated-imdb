I finally got the desire to see it in the cinema. I saw the Fritz Lang movie on video several years ago. I was hoping that the ideal screening conditions would work. <br /> <br /> The conditions in Cinematheque Ontario were perfect. Untouched full-length print. Intertitles in the original Gothic letter in German with simultaneous translation into English, accurate but not too literal. Live piano accompaniment. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The magic of the film splashed for a while, but in the end, it was not possible to catch it, at least for me. <br /> <br /> This film has no real relation to the Wagner “Ring” cycle, as I already knew, but some cannot. Wagner adapted the XIII century. Nibelun treated his own goals. However, in the first part of the epos of Fritz Lang "Siegfried" there is much that will be familiar to the listeners of Wagner. <br /> <br /> The Krimhild's Vengeance is the story of Siegfried Crimhilda’s wife, her marriage to King Etzel (Attila) Gunna and her desire to avenge Hagen and Günther, renamed the Nibelungs, for Siegfried’s murder. The spectacular conflagration of this film appears to have developed and expanded into the myths of Wagner over his Götterdämmerung, his Twilight of the Gods, and the end of Valhalla. This film remains earthy. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is impressive. Massive sets compete with those of "Cabiria" (1914), which inspired Griffith "Intolerance" (1916). Their decoration sets a new standard in barbarous splendor. There is a huge mix of scars, lousy Huns and Burgundians in Art Deco style. And the battle. Battles that never end in reality. <br /> <br /> Crimhild is very successful in his plan for revenge. She manages to destroy everything around her. Her devotion to the martyr Siegfried does not seem to stem so much from love or devotion, but from something closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth screamed, "Wake me up here." She knew that she was not emotionally ready for what she needed to do. But Krimhilda has no normal human emotions, and, of course, nothing can compare with the feminine principle. She is already "full of cruel cruelty" to borrow Shakespeare's phrase from the very beginning. Margaret Sean and her director convey this with fury. I do not want to exaggerate, but this brightness is in fact the only expression that ever “revives” the face of the Crimhilds. This is the maximum performance in one note. However, this is clearly intentional, and not just a case of bad play. <br /> <br /> What we offer is a one-dimensional sketch of vengeful rage. Some may consider Crimhild as an authorized heroine. I just see the movie as a woman hater.
