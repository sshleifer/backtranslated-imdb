Fifteen years later, Paris is still on fire. It's a classic in black gay movies, right there with other honorable black gay movies, The Color Purple and Mahoganoy. This original work captures the underground and inferior (i.e., "underserved") black and Latin gay culture and community, like no other work before or after it, including all sentimental retrospectives and gay Harlem Renaissance visualizations. I say the only "real" film that you find on this topic. This is Relentlessy Cunty (the classic invention of house music) that hits Hollywood, non-stop, fun camp (as soon as we do it) and deadly social criticism. All of this is from a white female director (who, obviously, was a sister Gurl or Mizz Ting). I could go on, but I think you already understood: I love this movie!
