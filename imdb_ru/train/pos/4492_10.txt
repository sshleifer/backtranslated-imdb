but I want to say that I can no longer agree with Moira. <br /> <br /> What a great movie. <br /> <br /> I thought about it only this morning, wanting to give advice to some limp shit who lost money on his debit card due to fraud and wanted to say: “Keep your money in your pocket” that i'm talking like james mason. <br /> <br /> Even if he did not utter these words I still think he will! I never forgot "Are you talking?" in his reconciliation with his son Hivel Bennett: "Always have money in your pocket!" Good advice. <br /> <br /> Children have not enough fathers with such implacable, but well-meaning relationships. Or even any father. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if we could restore the words “you”, “your” and “your” in our language to show that we care. This is just the same as “tutoyer” in French or “du” in German. <br /> <br /> Appendix: I just realized that many of my comments were about James Mason in Family Path! <br /> <br /> I think it's because I confused Susan George with Haley Mills. Well, easy mistake. <br /> <br /> I support tho 'comments. <br /> <br /> And Spring and Port Wine is very similar to The Family Way. <br /> <br /> When you took a girl to the pictures in those days, you really had something to talk about and talk about later, which influenced your knowledge of the world and your personal development. <br /> <br /> Theater experiences are almost real. And they are important for helping young people grow. <br /> <br /> Now, I think it doesn’t happen that teenagers can just walk in pictures like us.
