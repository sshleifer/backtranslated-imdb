I just looked at Rolla and what a pleasure it turned out. Toby Maloneâ€™s performance really stood out, and I actually cared about what happened to Matt throughout the film, which in itself is very fun, very dynamic with a good combination of well-rounded characters, which is a great achievement, considering that little work time. There are also many good turns everywhere, it will keep you guessing to the end. Other characters to watch out for are absolutely insane Tiny and sneaky attractive Jessie. He may not have a huge budget for a Hollywood blockbuster, but don't let that push you away, you could do a lot worse than check it out, you won't regret it. Good fun. 7/10
