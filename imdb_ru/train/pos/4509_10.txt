The arrival of white people in the Arctic of Canada challenges the freedom of a fearless hunter at ESCIM. <br /> <br /> W.S. Van Dyke, MGM peripheral director, was responsible for this breathtaking view of life in the Arctic among Inuit. Its production was on-site from April 1932 to November 1933 (although some annoying back-projection effects show that some of the filming took place in the studio). Despite the fact that at that time he was considered a documentary film, we would most likely call it “pre-drama” because it was written using an intriguing plot and plot. <br /> <br /> The film shows the daily life of the Eskimos, both in winter and summer. and actually begins in a warmer season without snow or ice in sight. A constant pursuit of food is depicted, and the viewer can watch the exciting hunt for walrus, polar bear, whale and caribou. The native language is used everywhere, using title cards; Only English is spoken by fishermen and mountains encountered by the Eskimos. In fact, this is the arrival of white people, both good and bad, and the change they make to Eskimo society, which is the main element of the story. <br /> <br /> This pre-Codex film is about a refreshingly frank manner with the Eskimo moral code, especially with their practice of sharing a wife, which was an important and completely innocent part of their culture. In fact, the entire film can be assessed as a valuable look at a lifestyle that quickly disappeared even in the early 1930s. <br /> <br /> None of the actors receive recognition on the screen, which, oddly enough, some famous performances. Chief among them is Ray Wise, who plays the main role of Eskimo Mala. Wise (1906–1952) was an Alaskan native of Inuit origin and is absolutely magnificent and quite plausible in what was a very demanding part. As handsome as any Hollywood star, he would continue to be filmed using the name of Ray Mala in an episodic cinematic career, often in tiny unpaid roles. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Japanese-Hawaiian actress Lotos Long plays the right second Mala's wife; The names of the beautiful actresses playing his two other wives are now unclear. Directed by Woody Van Dyke stands in front of the cameras as a strict inspector of the North-West Mounted Police. Joe Sawyer and Edgar Dirring, both long-time film actors, play two kindhearted men who must give Mal to Canadian justice. Danish author Peter Froykhen, on whose books the film was based, plays the short, bright role of an evil sea captain with wooden legs, who unwisely evokes Mala's icy anger.
