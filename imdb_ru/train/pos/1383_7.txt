The original name means "The birth of octopuses." I must confess that I do not quite understand this title. The English name is “Water Lilies”. But after I wrote this, I read another user’s comment: “The name in French also suggests:“ prieuve, ”or octopus, says that a person has to simultaneously manipulate many pressures. Thanks for the explanation. <br /> <br /> The main theme is the first sexual emotions of girls, when it is not clear whether they are directed to the same or different gender. This is no different for boys. I think that both Floriana and Maria will have heterosexual feelings without any impurities. <br /> <br /> Most of the film - water ballet. Sometimes girls' heads go down, and nothing above the water, except their feet and lowering their legs, which they will wave and kick in the air. For people like me who have never seen such things before, it was fascinating. - Floriana is the leader of one water lily team. <br /> <br /> Marie tells her that she would like to see Floriana training. It seems this is their first contact, not just ordinary. Soon they will walk together. Floriana takes Marie to the garage where the boy is waiting for her, and then leaves with him for an hour while Marie waits for her return. I took it for granted that the couple slept with each other. But later we learn from the film that they do less than that. <br /> <br /> I can provide some information that few people find elsewhere. There is a scene in which Marie secretly steals Floriana's trash bag. In it, she finds an apple, mostly eaten. And Marie continues to eat the rest. ?? There is a parallel scene in another film "Kazetachi no gogo" ("Afternoon Breezes") Hitoshi Yazaki (Japan, 1980). This is about young adult women, and obviously a lesbian woman is in vain in love with a heterosexual woman. She also steals a trash bag of her beloved, and also finds a more or less eaten apple and eats the rest. <br /> <br /> Later, Floriana tells Marie that she would like to have her first orgasm from her. Marie says she can't do it. <br /> <br /> But nevertheless, later Marie says that she is really ready to do it. And she masturbates on Floriana. There is no nudity in this scene. <br /> <br /> Probably only a female director could do such a good psychological show or study ?? I would like to quote Baudelaire "Les amours enfantines". <br /> <br /> Did Floriane play Adele Henel, who played the autistic girl in the Little Devils by Christoph Ruggie (2002)? ? very underrated film.
