In this film there is one of the greatest comedic dialogues and memorable quotes ever collected in one movie! The plot is somewhat lacking, but delightful jokes are enough to make up the difference. This is an eternal film for all ages, which is sure to enjoy. As a cinematic art form, this is very interesting; and with big stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas ... how could you go wrong? <br /> <br /> Such comedic dialogues and timekeeping, like this one, have long been underestimated, and it is very difficult for them to imitate. A good example of this is the fake of this 1986 film: The Money Pit with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film delayed and received bad reviews and comments from viewers. Achieving true comedic dialogue is an art.
