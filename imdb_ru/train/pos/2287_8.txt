This film surprised me pleasantly. He has a touching, slightly off-center approach that never loses your attention. This is a film that I have never heard of, but if you want a "sleeper", this is it. Great writing, staging and acting. I highly recommend this for viewers who want something thoughtful. Nick Nolte, Cheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are great. Why was there no more made of this film?
