Your ordinary garden mad mad box (delightfully composed by Stefan Sachs without enthusiasm) confuses various silly young "adults" (if you use the term very weakly) at Dayton Hall University, which is being closed for demolition. Showing the terrible play of the entire cast (Daphne Zuniga makes her debut here with a shameful and sinister movie in the role of Debbie, pranks, whose head is broken by a car!) , strangulation with a wire mesh, your standard exercise over the head, such a terrible thing), the ending of an unexpected unexpected twist, which was later copied in “The Offender”, Christopher’s creepy account (“HellRaiser”) Young, a slight smile because of Warped by female nudity and dutifully incompetent director Jeffrey Obrow and Steve Carpenter (who also blessed us with “Strength” and “Kindred”), this entertainingly soulless villainous atrocity of atrocity is rated as much exquisitely sluggish and insanely poor quality fun.
