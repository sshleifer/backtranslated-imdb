I'm not finished John Cleese (although I thought “Fawlty Towers was great”), but I'm a fan, and when I saw this seat, abandoned, on a shelf in my local blockbuster, I decided to try it. What I received was an amazing surprise and one of the funniest 50-minute viewing events I've ever had. Writing is a typical English "goon show" schtick. In fact, as a sound parody, this would not be out of place on the album "Firesign Theater". But the performance and the time are precisely defined, and this makes the “Strange Case” a terrific performance that British comedy fans can create for life. <br /> <br /> The British are a gift to combine widely satirical lamps with carefully observed “tics” of character and time, and the creators use both of them here for a good effect. Cleese’s picture of “Holmes” seems to owe a lot to Arkin and the Seller’s Inspector Kluz, but Cleese has such a physical comedy ability that he is more than restrained, but Arthur Lowe’s unexpected pleasure, which plays Watson as a genius, but an unbeatable incomprehensible imbecile with such excellent time and delivery that he becomes the best aspect of the film. I have never heard of Low before (his experience is vaudeville and musical theater), but as far as I understand, he justifies his entire career with this performance. <br /> <br /> Some people may not do this to take care of the “Strange Case ...”, especially if the British moodiness is not their “tea tea”. But I am very glad that I could see it before it disappeared from view.
