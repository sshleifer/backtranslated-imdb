God, God ... I was stupidly postponing (not the correct term, a long list!), To watch this film, and, finally, I had the opportunity to do it. And the "news" are: Amazing labyrinth spectacle! <br /> <br /> For any "follower" Von Trier: and Righet, the Element of Crime, Dogville, the Dancer in the Dark, Five Obstacles, etc ... Europe is probably the difference in its greatness visually. Everything is beautifully gloomy and claustrophobic! You really feel inside this “imaginary” nightmarish temporal strain. Taking from the masters of surrealistic cinema, such as Bunuel, Bergman, to the Noir films of the 40s with the acid drops of the avant-garde von Trier, leading the art scene as a "well-intentioned totalitarian" filmmaker of our days. His authoritarian way of solving very confusing issues, without being irrational, strikes the viewer's nerve with the intention to heal some of the deepest wounds that we feed in our hypocritical world. <br /> <br /> As a utopian, as it seems, I believe that people like von Trier can help society in many ways in a broader way. Day films and directors who carry such power are no longer needed as a tool for reflection, perhaps this could be the beginning of a new era: “The era of emotional control over our fears.” This is what he constantly offers us through his work again and again. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
