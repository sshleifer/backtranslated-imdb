I'm obsessed! The story is amazing, and the show is very addictive, but I like it. I am in season two, disc 5, and I am telling you that I am too attached to the characters now. If something bad happens to them, it will seriously affect my voice for the show. And Michael is on my list now. Just kidding ... I'm so glad to see that there is a 3rd season, because I was too afraid to switch to Disc 6, thinking that it would end. I can't wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors, producers and actors of Lost ... I like watching TV again. Before Lost, I watched every channel, going to bed because of my disappointment in television, but I must say that Lost is my kind of entertainment!
