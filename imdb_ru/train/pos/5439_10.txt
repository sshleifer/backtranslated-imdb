Obviously, the film had a great influence not only on the genre of a friend, but also on the genre of the action movie. George Lucas was supposed to be a fan of this film, since most of his Star Wars series seems to pay homage to Gung Dinh. The characters played by Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks are simply predecessors of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca. Even Gunga Din Sam Jaffe has turned into C-3PO and R2-D2 and whether he likes it or not: Jar Jar Binks. <br /> <br /> Today this film is viewed as not a PC, but Eduardo Chiannelli acts as a Guru leader of the Indian opposition to the British rajah, which can be reflected in many sentiments today. <br /> <br /> For a young boy it was a great movie. Three strong men leads and only a hint of romance. There was a time when young guys, who believed that kissing a girl in the Saturday matinee movie, were just capricious. Not like today, when more skin is met with delight. It's too late to mourn the lost innocence. <br /> <br /> We hope that this film will not be forgotten, and several people who surf the canals will stop at TCM and understand the movie with action, adventure and actors from thousands instead of CGI actors.
