this is what i call a great movie. he lives thanks to fantastic acting skills and a simple but human history. There are real characters that can be funny and dramatic. but the main theme is very cruel, like live. The bus driver and his son gather people all over the country (Yugoslavia) on the way to the capital Belgrade. funny and cruel situations that happen on the way, connect people and pigs who travel together. <br /> <br /> look, and you will remember it for the rest of your life ... it is filled with Slavic humor and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> and another reason for his magic: it's hard to get it !!
