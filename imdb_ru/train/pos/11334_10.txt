I would say that this film gives an idea of ​​the trauma that the young mind can face when a family breaks up due to a divorce or other disaster. I highly recommend this film, especially to parents or people who are planning to start a family. <br /> <br /> I found that the characters are attractive and very cute in many aspects. <br /> <br /> A scary monster, although probably not scary for most adults, has a very real hint of what can create an overactive imagination of a child who faces unknown horrors. <br /> <br /> I found the movie amazing!
