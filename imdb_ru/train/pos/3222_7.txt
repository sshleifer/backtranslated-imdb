The first two sequences of this film created two conflicts: a thematic conflict between the soldier Todd and his depressed humanity and a physical conflict between Todd and his bioengineering substitution. Both sequences capture each other in different ways. <br /> <br /> The scenario of the people is somewhat broken when the first of these arcs is solved in the middle of the film, which means that the second half is a little more than an action game. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, thanks to the creators for creating the action movie genre with a heart and even a little soul, and especially to Kurt Russell, who broadcasts very little. <br /> <br /> Not a great movie, but worth seeing.
