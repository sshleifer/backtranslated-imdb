This is a great movie! Most of us have seen the Jurassic Park, where Chaos theory is summarized by talking about the wings of a butterfly, which cause tornadoes on the other side of the planet. Well, Bug is all about it (or, at least, about something, don't worry, it's not a spoiler) I'm definitely not a religious type and don't believe in predestined things, destiny, etc. surely makes you wonder if there really is a coincidence ... <br /> <br /> Moreover, the acting and camera are also excellent, another proof that you can still make a good movie without a lot of money.
