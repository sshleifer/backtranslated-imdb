I was very pleased to go see the movie “Milanese” in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who correctly and fortunately printed the Milan philosophy in the film. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the standard in the career of the Milan couple, ranging from "birth" to death. A wedding at birth is so typical of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the guests of the wedding in the memory of how the couple approached each other and felt in love. In Milan's twilight, life is difficult, and after the sweet old days became harder and harder, finally, the product: a child who instead of strengthening relationships in a couple weakens because the “selfish effect” typical of today metropolis "identity. The advertising environment with all the “creative” atmosphere of stress helps to fit well into the plot. We lose our life values, and this is well and deeply reflected in this sweet and sharp film directed by Senza Pellet. <br /> <br /> Actors were chosen successfully, Stefania Rocca is good and good, and a positive surprise, unexpected kind Fabio Volo, well known for the “trash” series: Le Iene. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
