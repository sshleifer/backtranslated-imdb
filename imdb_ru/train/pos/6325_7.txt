This film is not only interesting, with an excellent comedy game, but also interesting from a political point of view. This was done at the end of the Soviet Union, but it mocks the Soviet mentality through and through. The story unfolds in the early days of the Soviet Union and questions the rationale for the revolution, both culturally and practically. Of course, by the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s, the strange restrictions of Soviet society were already relaxed, but the ideology and mentality are still alive and healthy and ready for some well-deserved deconstruction. Fortunately, all this deep philosophical commentary is wrapped in a fun and interesting package! <br /> <br /> jur
