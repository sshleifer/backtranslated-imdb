Considered by almost all critics to be the best of Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan’s films, I don’t argue with that, although there are a few others that I find just interesting. One thing: this is the longest series I have seen in 105 minutes. I saw only six of them, but it was longer than I was used to, and with the protracted finale of action films I thought it was all too long. <br /> <br /> However, this is a good mix of action, expectation and romance. It lacks only color and stereo sound. Primitive special effects do not bother me, since that was all they had in the 30s. <br /> <br /> Among some, this film is best known for one thing: skin! “Jane” never wore anything scant after this film was brought into use by the Hayes Code at the time of the creation of the next Tarzan film. Her outfit showed what a wonderful figure Maureen O'Sullivan was. The nude underwater scene, however, was not her - by and large. The woman under the water generally did not have a good figure, whoever she was. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of actions here. Before the finals, too, did not overdo it. The final lasted for 15 minutes and was so intense that it was too much to watch. <br /> <br /> However, this film offers everything - except for “The Boy” (their adopted son) - I would like to see you in the film Tarzan, even O'Sullivan, who makes her Tarzan, shouts about a dozen times. With her pair of “lungs” this was not a problem.
