This film is a great example of beautiful storytelling. The game is great. The story is inspired without being overly manipulative or fake. There were a few moments when they probably made people better or worse than they really were, but, considering that this is a Hollywood film, they showed amazing restraint. There was not a single explosion in the film, although they had one opportunity. The film, although containing intense roles, was not turned into an action movie. Thus, the story is made in order to focus on an unusual person, unfortunately, in ordinary times. Well done!
