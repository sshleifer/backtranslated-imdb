Kurosawa weaves a fairy tale in which there are characters as diverse as any Shakespearean drama, and acting is true, and each star plays its part as part of a larger fairy tale. It is touching, funny and intriguing in all parts. The development of the characters is almost perfect, the cinematography is bright and fascinating, and the story attracts you. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that “samurai freaks” and those who are obsessed with the dynasty of the end of the 18th and 19th centuries. The stories about Japan can perceive this film as not the best work of Kurosawa. Perhaps not at best, but even at worst, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. This story is so based on the elevation of the worldly lives of ordinary people in times of great change, that it is timeless, despite the fact that it occurs in the recent past. <br /> <br /> I would sincerely recommend this to any movie lover, and especially to those who are likely to continue reading the novel on which the film is based.
