Do not confuse "War Inc." for harsh satire or clever comedy full of domestic jokes for news fans. This is not true. <br /> <br /> This is an old-fashioned comic comedy, with ridiculously random plot twists, serial characters (given some depth in funny speeches by John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and a direct approach to political content. <br /> <br /> You see, the political views of the directors are that almost the whole country already knows that this is true. Yes, we understand that corporations benefiting from war are corrupt, inept pigs, political leaders responsible for this are even more inept jesters, and American imperialism has never looked more destructive and more inviolable than it is now - but Nothing it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> Here, all this noise is the situation that they play - sometimes ingeniously - as a backdrop for stupid fuss, like John Cusack's character (a hit with a heart) tries to change his life with a journalist who doesn't trust He (Tomei) and a young Middle Eastern star, who wants to end his marriage (Duff). Cusack's sister, Joan, plays her mate with an almost cartoon-enthusiastic quality. Ben Kingsley seemed to me wasted in his lesser part as a ruthless CIA boss. <br /> <br /> That's it, and it works. It’s just fun, but if somehow you don’t see reality and think that the war is going well, and everyone who is connected to it does a good job, and there is no corruption, and people in the Middle East want our Western culture to crowd out them, then Perhaps you will not find this funny. <br /> <br /> For everyone else, it was a light comedy with a political slant.
