Last night I went to bed with my girlfriend, and while she was brushing her teeth, I switched channels until I came across a Chinese film called The King of Masks. At first, I thought it would be a kung fu movie, so I started watching it, and then he immediately captured me, and I had to finish it. <br /> <br /> The little girl in the movie was absolutely amazing. She was such a wonderful actor that she was so small. Maybe the fact that it was in Chinese, so duplication in English made it difficult for me to say ... but it really seemed perfect. I was so bad for the girl that she tried to please her "boss", but everything turned out to be just rotten. lol Even when she brings him another grandson, just so that he can transfer his art ... it turns out that the child was kidnapped, so he is arrested and he has 5 days to live. lol ... all that she touches, trying to be kind to her grandfather, only has unpleasant consequences. <br /> <br /> In the end, he sees how much love is in her, and teaches her the art of masks ... which is very touching after all the failures in the film. <br /> <br /> Definitely a gem and completely original. <br /> <br /> Scott
