A beautiful story about how to follow your dreams and actually do something with them when you get the chance. Morris was also not easy - he had a family, a job, a job elsewhere, a mortgage, etc. - he could not just give up what he was doing and blithely jump the greyhound to play AAA ball for 4 months. It took courage. I am glad that they showed his indecisiveness, almost until he received a call to the majors. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him fighting the Red Sox (I think ...), it was a great story. Although Morris is actually more like John Crook or Mills Watson than Quaid - nothing wrong. <br /> <br /> Quaid copes well with the role of a person, a teacher, a coach, and an “older beginner” .... As a person belonging to the same age group, I can certainly recognize his position. You are not so old to do what you dreamed of in childhood, but it happens. You have to do it before Lator. <br /> <br /> True, nicely edited, stepped, acted, nice to see the familiar faces of the late Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here. <br /> <br /> Good work everywhere, glad it hit. <br /> <br /> *** outta **** ... who would have thought that the Tampa Devil rays would be the subject of such a good movie early?
