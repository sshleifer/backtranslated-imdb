This is definitely one of the best films that did not disappoint me. The soundtrack, along with the beautifully filmed manual cameras, was amazing. There is always a chance that the film will not adhere to the same convictions, but I felt that the rhythm of this picture and the time were excellent. Dakota Fanning is quickly becoming the main character in the film, which requires a child with an old spiritual personality, and she never disappointed me with her talent. As for Mr. Washington and, of course, Christopher Walken, they both overcome the problem, showing the dark sides of humanity trying to come out into the light.
