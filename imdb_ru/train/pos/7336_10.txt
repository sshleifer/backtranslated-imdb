This is another fantasy favorite from Ralph Bakshi; after viewing on YouTube that is. Located in the distant past after the Ice Age, this is a prehistoric quest with a sword and witchcraft between good and evil. Necron, lord of the ice kingdom and his mother, Queen Juliana, set their sights on conquering the known world. When their glaciers destroy the village of a man named Larn, he (Larn) vows to avenge his people and kill the Ice Lord. Meanwhile, the non-human minions of Necron and Juliana capture the sultry daughter of King Jarola Princess, Princess Tigra; but she manages to escape, and in the end she meets with Larn, who promises to take her back to Minesweeper; if people don't find them first. <br /> <br /> There was very little box office in this film (as in most of Ralph Bakshi’s films), but it became a cult classic, partly because of the quality of art, the collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famous fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. In addition, I heard that the script was written by Jerry Conway and Roy Thomas, two people who made stories about Conan’s comics, and background artists were James Gurney, an illustrator of Dinotopy; although admittedly I have never read Conan or Dinotopy. As well as the artist Thomas Kinkade, known for his works for figurines, music boxes for The Bradford Exchange, in addition to paintings. As in the film The Lord of the Rings and American Pop Music in Bakshi, this film was rotoscoped, but this process works better than the first one. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this is one of the best animated films. fantastic films ever made, and the terrific collaboration of two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With many fantasies, sexual hints and exciting adventures.
