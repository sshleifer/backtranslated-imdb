Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First of all, this is a series of fans available only on the Internet, and mostly friends and neighbors who have computer programs, home video cameras and sewing machines participate in it, so that, as Mickey and Judy once put it, make a show. These are definitely friends and neighbors, you can tell. Many of these people are not the most beautiful people you have ever seen, either the youngest or the thinnest ?? some of them stumble upon their lines as if they are walking on marble ?? some of them have strong accents, or, firstly, they seem to speak poorly, which makes it almost impossible to understand a single word that they utter. However, you must admit that everything that these friends and neighbors have gathered is really interesting to watch. Yes, some dialogues are hockey. Yes, it's a bit strange (although admittedly a bit cool) to watch the kisses of two Starfleet males (although some kissing scenes seem to go on and on.) Yes, you cringe a little when they clearly quote ST: TOS , TNG other shows and movies, or when you hear the theme from the Galaxy Quest, played at the beginning and end of each show. Good. We can get it. What for? The graphics are first class. Better than almost everything you saw. And sometimes a show or two really stands out in the story? some of them are actually real tears. <br /> <br /> “Hidden border” - complete pleasure in every sense of the word ?? but you must give credit to the people involved, where credit is due. It takes a lot of effort to deliver production of such a scale People, scenery, costumes, graphics are a huge effort of many people. We look, we come back and thank them.
