From an artistic point of view, this is an excellent film - the cinematography, the music and the costumes are magnificent. In fact, this film is more beautiful than the director of Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he wrote the film only in the way it was shot a few years after his death. <br /> <br /> So, as far as writing is concerned, the dialogue was well written, and the story is sometimes interesting. However, this story was also rather depressing, but somewhat unattractive - after all, this is the story of a group of women working in a brothel. Interestingly, although prostitution in Japan is considered a much more acceptable affair, women still strive for a better life. This reminds me a lot of the film “The Streets of Shame”, although the characters of “The Streets of Shame” are much less attractive and more dimensional. <br /> <br /> Thus, in general, he gets 7 - mainly because of everything, BUT Letter. It is a pity that the story of the great Kurasava is the weakest link in this film.
