Although I live in Minnesota, I recently studied in France and came across this strange gem of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie was at least amazing. A creative and unique film, various directors presented something of their own in their interpretation of love in the City of Light. The first instinct is to try to fit each of these little stories into a common storyline, much like you can with the 2003 Love in fact. This attempt, however, makes the magic of each individual segment obsolete. Taken at face value, each of the short segments of which is taken as a separate film, love stories together tell a beautiful message. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a movie is strikingly bizarre — often to the point that it is confusing — and every single segment can be difficult to follow. However, for the observer, who pays close attention to each of the segments, the short plot lines become clear after a short time. The confusion almost intrigues; it keeps you on the edge of your place, waiting for what comes next. It makes the viewer think: "Has it really just happened?" but also leaves them satisfied that it really happened. This is such a film, when the viewer, leaving the theater, cannot actually decide whether he loved or hated him. The initial reaction is to go and see it again and again, just to see how these separate lives have blended into a cinematic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> An interesting decision to make the film multilingual adds something to the range of people who can relate. This adds to the reality of the film - here the American tourists speak English, Parisians speak French, and so on. The number of people covered by the film leads to an understanding of the international language of love. <br /> <br /> From illness to the supernatural, from the love of parents to the love of husbands, this film covers all the basics of a romantic story. In its beautiful and bizarre way, each unique event is somehow in its place to tell a story: stories of all types, sizes, nationalities and forms of love.
