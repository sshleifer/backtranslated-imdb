Despite the fact that the film is clearly dated, viewers can still easily identify with the plight of the unfortunate Buster in this timeless and very funny story about losers. Buster fights against malevolent controversies in three different eras: the Stone Age, the Roman Age, and the Modena Age, playing almost the same character, simply by changing the setting to help us identify different "ages." In this film, we see one of the earliest comedic images of the “caveman” stereotype, which conquers its love not by romance, but by brute force, as well as a funny turn in Roman gladiatorial combat, two comedy sketches that long before such parodies as Mel Brooks "History of the World: Part I". The main theme of the film is simple, but convincing: although times may change, we still face the same struggle even in our time, in which we fought in prehistoric times, in order to "beat the girl" (keep this in mind, this is the theme of America in 1923, when chauvinism was still in fashion). It is interesting to look at this film more than eighty years later and think how dramatically everything has changed from the “modern times” of this film to the present day.
