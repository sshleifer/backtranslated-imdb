Sweet funny story about how 2 people intersected, preparing for the wedding. The former police writer and public school teacher fall in love with each other in this magnificent New York environment, although they marry other people. Perhaps a bit trivial is that the “partners” are both type A personalities, while our main characters are much more relaxed. Nothing heavy, but it made me smile. And hello guys - sell the corner to Natasha Henstridge and the girls - sell them a juicy romance, everyone will win!
