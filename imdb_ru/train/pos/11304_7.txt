I'm not sure under what circumstances the director Visconti decided to shoot James Kane's film “The Postman Always Rings Twice” (I'm not even sure if Visconti acquired the rights to the book), but the resulting film is definitely interesting. This is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version the most), but thanks to the excellent Visconti direction and the actors Clara Kalamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), this is necessary for lovers of noir. Visconti mixes neo-realism with noir sensitivity to great effect. Although the film is not perfect. My main complaint is that the film is too long for its own good; the story moves very slowly (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing their films). I think film noir works better with a short run time. Fortunately, Kalamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that interest the viewer. Anyway, as much as I like this film and the remakes, I think no one has made the final version of Cain's highly acclaimed book.
