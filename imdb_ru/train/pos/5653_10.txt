It was an absolutely fascinating series, and I was sorry that I could only catch a few shows when it came out late at night in the UK. The style of it was so different from the others of its kind, and it was all scared by stylish fear. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative that I see) to understand what a truly innovative series is and how it got into the imagination. Now I understand, after reading the comments that have been canceled, it is simply unbelievable. What a bunch of “headless overpawned turkeys” must have (or maybe still do) run around to do it.
