Over the past ten years, this film has become one of my favorite works of pseudo-noir. Each of the three storyline threads that Kazan has given us has its unique pleasures. Home chatter between White Geddes and Widmark, movement between rooms, small gestures, such as the phone book that Barbara puts on a chair under her son so he can get to the table, these little intimate connections between husband and wife, everything is well thought out. and naturally. More than anything, I love their porch, that second living room, where itâ€™s obvious that they spend most of their summer time. The second thread is a professional relationship between many in the film, but especially between Widmark and Douglas characters. It may not be very original and a bit noisy, but in general, everything looks real, respectful and effective. The third thread, the ugly story of Blackie and his battered little gang, brings us closer to the dark and intimidating Noir world. Blackie Palans is as cold as a piece of ice. This self-proclaimed businessman, this self-made person clearly has difficulty, to which we only briefly refer. For me, this film continues to be fun.
