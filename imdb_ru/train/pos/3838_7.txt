FOURTH PERSON (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands, 1983). <br /> <br /> The film is based on the story of Gerard Riva, who works best as a thriller. This is quite surprising, considering that Riva needs about a hundred pages only for a slight plot twist, and tension is the last thing that comes to my mind when reading his work. <br /> <br /> “The Fourth Man” is passionate about symbolism, Paul Verhoeven is usually extremely anxious to prove something mostly to hostile critics, and I’m never sure what he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an awkward way, he quickly disagrees with the original idea or plot, and it seems he almost forgets what to see on the screen and what not to take into account. In The Fourth Man, he does not describe the plot in as much detail as with sex and nude (there are a lot of them), but, like in most of his films, he seems to be afraid that viewers will not get it, and the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudes and graphic sex scenes. There is hardly any scene without sex or completely frontal nudity, most of which is so insanely unfounded and right on your face that it undermines otherwise a good story. <br /> <br /> However, when you can cope with Verhoeven’s rather obvious satirical approach, sometimes this is a rather interesting thriller with some intriguing plot twists and good performances throughout, in particular Tom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabbe. <br /> <br /> Camera obscura --- 7/10
