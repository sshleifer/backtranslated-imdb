The following two seasons of this original series were less than dull. The consequences of the disastrous rearrangements of recent seasons have contributed to a reduction in life expectancy of three seasons. Perhaps if the traffic jam was turned off after the first season, it would have acquired a cult mark. <br /> <br /> In addition, the first season was really fun! Witty, clever with excellent writing, it was promising. The excellent drink of the first season contained the right ingredients â€” characters / actors, storyline, and so on. Plus the original comedy about the paparazzi reporter was original for download. Nora and her colleagues "photographers" on the hunt, night after night, day after day for exclusives. <br /> <br /> Many things don't make sense to me. Just like this show, and my other favorite - Gross Pointe never "did it." If only the first seasons of "Naked Truth" and "Grosse Pointe" were released on DVD, please, anyone there ?!
