I remember watching this movie, shown several years ago on Lifetime TV, and thought it was an interesting story. A few years later I see it again and fall in love with this film. The story of the film is fascinating in itself. The cast makes it even more attractive. Meryl Streep is definitely on top of her game in this picture. She nails Mrs. Chamberlain with manners, an accent and even a look. She shows the pain, the pain, the surprise and the anger that Lindy had to endure, and in the process it's hard to remember that this is not Lindy. In my opinion, this performance of Meryl was better than her victory at the Oscars in Sophie's Choice, and she should have received her third Oscar. Sam Neal is perfect as Michael Chamberlain and for some surprising reason was not recognized by the Academy, at least in the nomination. In general, this film receives only ONE Oscar (nod Stripe for the best female role). However, he received several Australian Oscars and nominations. get excellent views from the whole composition.
