This is typical of Tom and Jerry. The situation is designed, a conflict arises and chaos begins. Characters behave accordingly, the natural tension between different characters leads to a general chaos. The best (and funniest) part is when the peace treaty comes into force and is respected - all sorts of strange miracles appear before you. A word of warning - it's very unwise to let Tom help you do your morning cleaning! Highly recommended.
