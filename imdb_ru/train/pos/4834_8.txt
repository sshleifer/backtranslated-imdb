For anyone who wants to get an idea of ​​the Soviet view of modern Russian history, this monumental film is a treasure. The story begins at the turn of the century (1900) in the yellowish colors of sepia in old photographs that improve to black and white in the middle of the century and to full color when history approaches modernity (that is, the 1960s). /> <br /> The story tells about a boy in a remote Siberian village, marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist in the Tsarist era. Later he joins the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brings Soviet communism to his village. His son, thanks to local beauty, fights the Germans during World War II. When he returns to the village, the oil industry takes off, and we face some Soviet economic idealism. <br /> <br /> This film is long and slow, but perfectly logical and very well made. This can be seen in three parts.
