While there was some stagnation in Hollywood for several years after World War II, there was a very fruitful film industry in England. In The Man in the White Suit, inventor Sydney Stratton (Alec Guinness) creates a suit that never gets dirty. Unfortunately, this means that some other businesses may now go bankrupt! How can Sydney handle this and preserve his dignity? This is an example of one of the best films in which Alec Guinness co-starred before Obi Van Kenobi became. This is a good look at the general absurdity of the business world. If you are planning to start a business, you can consider watching this movie.
