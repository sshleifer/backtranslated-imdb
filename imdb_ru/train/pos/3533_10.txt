Unfortunately, there is no DVD, but you should pay attention to TCM or VHS. The secretary believes that her boss is wrongly accused of murder, and courageously takes on many dangerous characters, trying to establish the truth. A film with a lot of turns and dark alleys, none of which I will mention! The sequence of the jazz band, where our heroine is looking for information about the killer, is one of the most erotic scenes in the history of Hollywood, despite the fact that she has a very low budget and was made during the Second World War in black and white. Despite the small budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a film of the original style and outstanding vision. Ella Raines was a great actress who opened Howard Hawks, who knew a lot about these things, including the most evil women - Joann Drew, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of her era. Robert Siodmak was one of several German, Hungarian and Czech filmmakers — Sirk, Wilder, Zinneman, Lubicz, Curtis, Lang, etc. — who emigrated to Hollywood and brought with them a very original and fresh vision. Unfortunately, Ella Raines was never given such a big role again, and in the end she ended up in poorly produced westerns.
