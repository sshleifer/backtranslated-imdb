No messages. No symbolism. No dark undercurrents. Just a wonderful mix of music, nostalgia and fun brought by people who obviously had a great time. This is a refreshing antidote to some pretentious garbage thrown away by the studios. Of course, NOTHING with the incomparable Judi Dench is worth seeing. And Cleo Lane's brilliant jazz singing is a bonus. This lady is in the same league as the late Ella. It happens on my shelf with films so that it can be pulled out again whenever I feel the need for a warm experience and a cordial good-natured smile. Just a great movie!
