Although Super Mario 64 does not look like the rest of the games in the series, it is still classic and in no way inferior to old games. Games with such a large repetition value are few. Plus, this game has so much variety. There are 15 levels, each with several different tasks that you can complete, and many other hidden tasks. The game is not very difficult, but its absence does not distract from the game. As soon as you win, you will want to erase your game and start again. And just as fun a second time, a third time or two hundred times. Must belong to any Nintendo 64 owner and is itself the reason for owning Nintendo 64.
