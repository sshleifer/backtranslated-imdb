For anyone who does not speak Swedish: the Swedish [original] title of this film; "Ronarna" is translated into something in the line "Rogues". This fact is the main problem that I faced in the film, because in reality this is not about robbers. This is a young woman working for the Swedish police investigating robbery. You may think that this is an ordinary job at the table, but this girl will soon enter the field, taking matters into her own hands, as the story goes, even shooting at one of the robbers ... Exactly: We have seen this before. The fact that there is a rather interesting twist in the middle of the plot doesn’t help very much, as the final is just as cliche as the first two thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> What saves him from the fact that he has become another mainstream film is that he is skillfully executed in all respects, that the actors are just as great as they are, and do not replay, and that the director really manages to keep it so exciting, as for most of the story. /> <br /> One thing I really liked about this film is that his music sets the right mood when necessary, but is absent the rest of the time, which gives a good sense of reality for the shootings and car chases spread throughout the movie. Nice touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish actors who are often videotaped hurts the film sadly, because you know that he will not just play the heroine’s boyfriend and become a secondary character in the background, but this is something that has to be neglected. <br /> <br /> In general, this is an entertaining film that steals more money than time. 7/10
