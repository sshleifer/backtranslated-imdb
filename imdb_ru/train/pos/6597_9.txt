We always watch American films with certain accents in each region (south, west, etc.). We have the same thing here. All foreigners must watch this film and must be biased to embrace a different culture, except that Americans and Europeans almost dominate the film industry. <br /> <br /> This film tells us about a parallel world that does not exist. even for those who live in a city as big as São Paulo. All the actors improvise, and they are very realistic. The camera gives us an idea of ​​their tangled world, about the loneliness of each character and invites us to share our world. <br /> <br /> This is a really great movie, and the worst rentals are even at home.
