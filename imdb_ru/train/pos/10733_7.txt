Watching this movie again led to memories of childhood. I am 34 years old, I have not seen him since 12-14 years. I almost forgot about this movie, but when I recently watched it again, some scenes literally caused me to tear! This little robot "Jinx" (friends forever!). It was just like revising my childhood. It was an absolutely amazing experience for me. I will always cherish this film for this reason. I hope that some of you, the readers, may relate to my experience, not to this particular film, but to any film that you have not seen for a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> - Thanks for reading
