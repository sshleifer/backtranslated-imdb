I admit that I saw only three plays by Shakespeare (Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth and, of course, Hamlet), I liked one, I found another so-so (Macbeth), and Hamlet Found a masterpiece. I am pleased to inform you that this adaptation is as good as an intense and dramatic game. The acting is extremely strong (with the actors in which Kenneth Brana, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal are involved, how can you lose?) Speak your shameful lines straight from the script itself, that any fan of Shakespeareâ€™s play will get a chill. If you are in this popular drama, I urge you to see this powerful 1996 adaptation from the Shakespearean Kenneth Brande.
