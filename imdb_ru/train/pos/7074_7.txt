Terry Gilliam went back to the future (he already did it in Brazil) to tell this story about a virus that destroys the human race. <br /> <br /> The script is completely crazy with some simple tricks. but this is quite interesting, and Gilliam proves that he has imagination (futuristic scenes are just great). As for the cast, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (what happened to her?) Just fine, but Brad Pitt is so annoyed when he plays roles that go out of his hands, he turns out to be so forced and does not deserve everything. He should just play beautiful and successful young people. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
