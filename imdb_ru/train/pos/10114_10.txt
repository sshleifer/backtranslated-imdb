“The Phantom World of Edward D. Wood Jr.” is the final documentary about the life of a man who brought us films such as Glen or Glenda, The Monster Bride and, of course, Plan 9 from Space. This exquisite film far surpasses other documentaries, such as Look Back in Angora and Plan 9's Companion. This rounds off his surviving environment, many of whom died after filming, and gives an honest study of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in that he looks at the dark corner of the past of Hollywood, sentimental in relation to the director (up to obsessive music), this documentary is absolutely necessary for everyone who loves a director who failed so much on his day. All the two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively unite the life of Ed and his untimely death for the viewer. It is best to look at 3 o'clock in the morning, putting on the Angora sweater.
