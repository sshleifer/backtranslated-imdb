Although I have not seen this mini-series for more than twenty years, I still remember how I managed to achieve a balance between character, plot and the story of wonderful adventures. The use of special effects was limited, creating a more poetic rather than literal description of the story. The two versions that I saw were duplicated (English and French), but the actors seem to speak their own language, not just Italian, so the synchronization problem arises. This does not spoil storytelling. Among the cast, Irene Pappas as Penelope is the most recognizable for North Americans. It is recommended to all Odyssey supporters ever returning.
