This film may have a dubious pedigree, because it was made for television, but it is one of the best films I have seen. The film and its actors won several awards. It is exciting, exciting, and it will completely absorb you. The story of chasing a murderer in the iron veil of Russia by people who are willing to risk their careers, trying to save the lives of future victims, would be an irrefutable story if it were fiction but supposedly true. I highly recommend it.
