This is a real film of the 80s: then they made, perhaps, 100 times more films than they do now, and this makes many of them very interesting ... It was a cultural phenomenon that no longer exists. Nowadays, perhaps the same kind of people who would have made cheap “straight to the video” —movies in the eighties, are doing cheap porn. Porn seems to sell. Anyway, it's above the average level of a trash movie: it has a good and exciting story, and it's pretty well done, I think. In one scene, you can even see the microphone swinging at the top edge of the picture. Of course, there are also small cameos by Ozzy and Gene Simmons, but they are not very conducive to the success of the film, although they are good in their small roles. Monster, heavy singer "Sammi Curr", looks really awful, especially when he sings. One of the worst monsters I've seen in horror movies. I may have nightmares about him the next night. Not recommended for intelligent movie lovers.
