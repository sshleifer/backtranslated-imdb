Taking on the roles that Jack Albertson and Sam Leven played on Broadway, Walter Mattau and George Burns play a pair of old vaudeville comics, a team in the tradition of Joe Smith and Charles Dale, who seem to have different views on life. /> <br /> Walter Mattau can't stop working, the man never learned to relax, take his time and smell the roses. He is a capricious old cursingist, whose best days are behind him, and his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin are finding less and less work for him. <br /> <br /> He was greatly offended that his partner George Burns decided to retire 15 years ago and spend some time with his family. A workaholic such as Mattau cannot comprehend this and make Burns decision personally. <br /> <br /> Benjamin gets into a brainstorm, reunites the guys and does it on special national television. What is happening here is quite funny. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys is also a sad, bitter-sweet story about old age. Mattau is on screen for most of the film, but it is Burns, who received praise in the form of an Oscar at the mature age of 79 years. <br /> <br /> Burns introduced a little bit personal into this film, as well. As we all know, he was a direct man from the great comedy team of Burns & Allen, from whom the Monty Python squad borrowed a lot. In 1958, due to health problems, Gracie Allen retired, and George continued to work for up to 100 years. Or at least pretty close to being an active performer. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys are based on the Smith and Dale team, however, and if you like The Sunshine Boys, I highly recommend you watch “Two Tickets to Broadway” to have a look at a couple of guys who entertained the American public. at the turn of the last century. The sketch of the doctor who make Mattau and Burns, directly from their material. <br /> <br /> And I think you will like The Sunshine Boys.
