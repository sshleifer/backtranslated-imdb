Plainsman is an entertaining western, no doubt a classic that is relevant even today. Gary Cooper - Wild Bill Hicock, perfect for the role, along with John Wayne and James Stewart, they were the best actors who played western heroes in their generation. Jean Arthur is great, like Calamity Jane, none of my friends have played her better than she. Even if it is not historically accurate, the film manages to uncover the most important thing about Hikok and the time when it happens. Sometimes you have to sacrifice a story to express your point of view, and this is what DeMille does here. Hickok's friendship with Buffalo Bill, the sale of rifles by a great manufacturer to compensate for the losses he suffered due to the end of the civil war, Custer and Little Big Horn, the uneasy relationship between Buffalo Billâ€™s wife, a religious woman, with Hicq, a man who killed many, as well as an unusual romance between Hiccus and Calamity - all this makes Plainsman an unconventional and interesting film. Anthony Quinn has a very short appearance, which already shows what a great actor he was going to become. Much attention was paid to show the original guns of the time.
