Let me begin by saying that at the age of 34 I was suddenly a widow. I was devastated because he was NOT ill — he died suddenly from a coronary disease — his carotid arteries exploded — he died in our home. There was a lot of speculation on the part of the police, because he fell for something, and it broke his head. I was a murder suspect until the autopsy came back. <br /> <br /> My children were injured just like me and in love with a father as good as he. I had three small children, without education, without financial support. I took it very, very hard. <br /> <br /> Within two years, my relatives attacked me verbally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually, demanding that I not mourn the children, put on masks and show people what they wanted to see, and not show them my pain during the holidays ... No one stood up for me and my choice to spend one day off, except, of course, the grief therapist I saw, who advised me to follow my heart and soul. My relatives did not understand! It changed my relationship with them forever, and I never went back on vacation. This is just one example of how my grief was disrespectful! My own (new) husband saw me fall apart, talking about injury when I talk about my soul. I faint, I can not breathe, hyperventilation and, as a rule, ceased to exist for several days, even if I try to convey hidden pain. <br /> <br /> Now about this movie ... <br /> <br /> Today my soul is excited, my heart is broken. My fears and pain reappeared from the real demons that this film represents; how man grieves compared to how others await us and the demons inside. Adam Sandler beautifully depicted the terrible torment that you encounter, overcome and, above all, work in your free time! This film saved me from all the pain that I had been trying to cope with for years. You see, when something hurts your soul so deeply, so deeply that words come out of your mouth at times of thinking, you cannot cope with it, not wanting you to be dead and go through life, in a dead state. <br /> <br /> The Bible has Scripture, Romans 8:26, for which I clung, that when my mouth and soul do not know what to pray for, the Holy Spirit of God carries this agony to the feet of God. - I don't need to talk. Sandler portrayed it perfectly! <br /> <br /> There is a scene where he was dragged to a court hearing in order to ensure mental health, and he returns to meet his relatives --- (familiar to me) --- and he tells them the stunning truths that he possessed, in fact, that he could not overcome. This is a very powerful and powerful performance. I started to cry and it was difficult for me after the charges got up to get out of the theater, feeling that my legs were too weak to do it. My son was with me and saw it with his own eyes, my exact movements, trying to keep it all together; a lesson for him, my youngest, who hardly remembers his dad. For me it was 13 years old, but this film brought me back to the moment when I lost my relatives forever, when they demanded a mask for my emotions and my surrender to their desires, and not respect for my own. <br /> <br /> I am writing this in such a way that if you are grieving, you are ready for this film, but I highly recommend it in the 1000-star performance that Sandler gave. <br /> <br /> If you are still not grieving, take a lesson from his film and just listen and accept the choice of people in their grief, allowing them to find peace in due time! Sometimes the soul cannot utter words to convey our pain. <br /> <br /> Go and watch a movie with napkins, rather than preparing to take it ... into your soul!
