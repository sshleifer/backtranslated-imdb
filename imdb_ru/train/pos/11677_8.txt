I loved the Long Way Round and didn't even know about Race to Dakar until I saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket. I bought it, and after a small “hmm-whether it will be just as good” the first episode, I decided that it was so. Charlie Boorman was great, like other crew members. Glad to see him again with Yuan. There were a lot of curses in him, but that didn't bother me. As for their lack of mention of this on the packaging. This is largely due to the stupid exclusion certificate that the BBFC has. They should have given him 15 for just one language. <br /> <br /> A series is strongly recommended, I want more!
