I have long been waiting for such an original painting, like this one. Brokedown Palace has this “hard to believe” aspect, but with original directing and script, Palace has made great strides. <br /> <br /> I really never liked to watch Claire Danes in any of her films, but I will tell you that she really changed her mind with this. Kate Beckinsale joins the Danes on holiday in Thailand, where they meet a young man who convinces them to go with him to Hong Kong. However, he did not tell them that they would carry an obscene amount of drugs for him. Well, in the end they go to a Thai jail. I know, I know, how could you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs? Well, if you can deal with this tiny delusion, you will find a very well written and played story. Recently, I discovered that I am drawn into the plot lines of films that I watch, and develop a personal feeling for the characters that I watch. This film is no different. By the end of the film, I began to take care of her more than about the other characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, a lawyer who lives in Thailand and specializes in international relations. As always, Pullman demonstrates excellent performance and perfectly ties the film. <br /> <br /> There are a few twists and turns that will lead you to tears by the end of the film. This is one of those films that you most likely passed by when you were looking for this movie to watch at home. In my opinion, the next time in the video store, do not pass by this again.
