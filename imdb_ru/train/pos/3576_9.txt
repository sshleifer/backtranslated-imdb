To be honest, I find this film too depressing for my own good. This is VERY depressing to the very end. I can’t justify passing judgment on any character who did things that I didn’t like (well, except for the disgusting character that Fredrik Forrest played). But it’s still so frustrating to see how people behave in this way, build walls around themselves, when at least one word can break the ice and promote healing. <br /> <br /> A terrible tragedy falls on the family of Montana. They believe that they have lost one son, but it turns out that they have lost 2. The bottom line is that if they just communicate and face their grief, they will not lose their second son forever. <br /> <But they just can't. Something is stopping this family from sharing their sorrows. Some families are immersed in silence and resentment, while some others point fingers at guilt (and then go on and cheat on their poor pregnant wife, seducing a deceased pretty girlfriend ... that Andy’s character is really a snake!) threatens Arnold, is his grandfather (Wilford Brimley). Grandpa seems to be able to talk to a boy without judgment or even children's gloves. He seems to know what the child is thinking, although Arnold says little nowadays. For a poor child, it is truly a blessing to have such a person to whom he can turn. No one else seems to understand the fact that Arnold may be in shock, in denial, or that his way of grief may not match the style or speed with which they expect. It is easy to judge, get angry and feel that someone is “made of stone” only because he does not grieve in the way we think he should. <br /> <br /> The story is very quiet and naturalistic. You are not going to get some spoon narration or some Hollywood resolution. I was very concerned about the fact that this child was so burdened with guilt that he felt that he needed to travel a few hundred miles to apologize to the wife of this pig Andy for something he should not blame himself for. Arnold may have accidentally killed his brother, but no one is responsible for ending this marriage, which seems to have been lousy anyway, with the exception of two people in a marriage. This is just a silly luck that Arnold did not get into the car with a pedophile or a murderer. <br /> <br /> Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are disappointingly effective because parents, who for some reason cannot find in themselves the opportunity to communicate with their son, to find out what Arnold is going through. Jason Presson, whom I have not seen anywhere else, except for a children's favorite called EXPLORERS and a creepy ghost story called LADY IN WHITE, did an incredible job as Arnold, a great play from a child actor. <br /> <br /> In addition to being a bit slow from time to time, “STONE BOY” is a great and very depressing film.
