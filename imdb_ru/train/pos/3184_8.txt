In this Hong Kong film, the slaughtermen have shot melodramas more than the Young and Restless Week. This is rather a return to the original trilogy "Emmanuel" (especially "Goodbye, Emmanuel"), than the slanderer D'Amato. Lee's Tea (Emmy Wong) is undergoing a terrific transformation from a harsh nurse to a hot street-carter. The future Italian porn star / politician, Illona Staller, who later go by the name of Ciccolina (and has sex with HIV positive John Holmes) plays EMY's competition. Exotic locations and a few decent soft scenes complement this theme. Recommended for fans of the original "Emmanuel", one of which I am!
