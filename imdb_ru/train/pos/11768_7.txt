This film surprised me pleasantly. Out of the box, I got the impression that it was an action movie, but it was too ridiculous to be a thriller, although it was somewhat exciting. <br /> <br /> He has many good roles and funny situations. This film and James Belushi was born to make Bill Manucci, he does an excellent job. The rest of the cast is not that bad either, and especially Timothy Dalton is a pleasure. <br /> <br /> The story can be quite confusing as new characters appear in the film. Things get harder, because no one rarely tells the truth about things. If you don't pay attention, in the end everything may get a little dirty, but I really liked it. <br /> <br /> Louis Morneau is not so famous, but he did a great job of it. and I never lost patience when I watched the movie. <br /> <br /> Men are worth seeing.
