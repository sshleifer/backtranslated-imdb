First, it was a brave movie. I have seen irreversible and can understand the comparison. However, I can not understand the people who broke this film. I can see how the end could come to an emergency, but I would have lied if I hadn't said that I would like every guy who ever forced a woman to have sex, deserve exactly what Jared got. Conversely, this did not solve anything and did not improve, and the fact that the film does not pretend to make me appreciate it. <br /> <br /> A previous commentary called the film pathetic and claimed that no adult would stick. I certainly did and intently. I am 24 years old. The way the film pulls makes it realistic for me. People are so used to seeing sweets and fast-paced scenes on the screen that if you ask them to concentrate on one brick at the heart of the film for too long, they will not only lose interest, they will destroy everything that was built and call it trash. In fact, it is their lack of patience and understanding that requires fine-tuning, rather than a product of a creative mind, such as that of Talia Lugasi. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson demonstrated the numbness of self-destruction unmistakably. I think she portrayed Maya before and after the attack with great ease, and the transition between them is an act that I rarely ever saw as successful. Often, as in the “teenage” films mentioned in the previous commentary, the effects of rape are either extremely insane and impulsive, or terribly repressed, isolated and lifeless. Dawson, in my opinion, manages to balance in such a way that many of the survivors become victims: a drone-like existence during waking hours, some kind of dead-end work, to survive (and be distracted), and then indulge themselves with vices, to lose themselves in the sobriety smoke, and not the hypocrisy that brings sobriety. <br /> <br /> I thought this film told the truth, and I appreciate it for finally showing people the other side of rape. So many people allowed the end of this film to absorb the middle and the beginning ... I believe that Maya’s face during the act was the end ... not the action itself ... not the revenge or meaning behind it ... only her face .. . <br /> <br /> thanks
