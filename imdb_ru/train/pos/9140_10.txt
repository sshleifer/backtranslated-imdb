I love this film!!! Purple rain came out that year when I was born, and since I remember myself, I had a heart. The prince is so tight in this film. Last night I went to a special show of Purple Rain, and it was like a concert where I was glad to see real fans, because this film is so underestimated that it is truly one of the greatest films of all time. Music is inviolable. A film about “The Child”, played by the Prince, his family is unfavorable, his group is the hottest act in the city, and he looks at Apollonia, the beginning singer. No doubt why purple is my favorite color, I can thank “The Kid” for that. So, if you have not seen it, then you need as soon as possible. This is a classic - 4ever!
