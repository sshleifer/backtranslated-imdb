Well, the main reason I tuned in to watch this film is because Trey Parker and Matt Stone from South Park shot it. However, as soon as the film began, laughter began from my belly. From subtle gestures to jokes, to frank toilet humor everywhere, as well as constant reliance on some very ingenious hints. This film can ruin him if he becomes the strictest poker face, not to mention his poker underwear. Some of the funniest blinks, and you miss the jokes that you ever portrayed in Hollywood, along with the constant criticism of yourself thrown into the bargain. <br /> <br /> I just want to show that not only Trey Parker perfectly knows how to write, he is not too worn in the old acting game either. I was surprised at the amount I was consumed by this film. However, I am very concerned that it is not available for purchase over the Internet, here in the UK. Understand, boys! <br /> <br /> Iâ€™ll continue to show it to all my friends, pointing out funny bits and sometimes snorting to my lager. In general, a great movie, if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy. However, if you do not have a sense of humor about stupid or rude things, stay away! However, I am sure that the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Blyth can make you overcome these prejudices.
