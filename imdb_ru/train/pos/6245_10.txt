“Hundstage” is Zeidlya’s first science fiction film (before that, he shot great documentaries like “Animal Love” or “Models”). Seidl worked on this project for more than 3 years, but it cost only about 2 million dollars. the actors are very good, especially the non-professional actors who almost played themselves. cinematography is also good. The whole movie is shocking, and some scenes may be too big for “ordinary” viewers. The film shows a lot of sex and violence, but also the fact that people are lonely and can not communicate with each other. Finally, I must say that this is one of the best and most useful Austrian films in recent years. I apologize for my bad english. <br /> <br />
