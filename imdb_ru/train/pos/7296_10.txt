There is no connection between Fortier and Profiler, except for the fact that both are police serials about violent crimes. The profiler looks crisp, Fortier looks classically. Profiler graphics are pretty simple. Fortier's plot is much more complicated ... Fortier is more like Prime Suspect, if we should notice the similarities ... The main character is weak and perverted, but has a "clairvoyance" People like to compare, judge, evaluate. How about just enjoy? It's funny that people who write Fortier look Americans, but, on the other hand, they say they prefer American TV shows (!!!). It may be a language or a spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and funny. The game is not superficial ...
