Besides the fact that it was one of the few films that I have ever shed (goodbye, masculinity), this is one of the most beautiful Indian films that have ever been filmed. No one can forget about this, starting with the carefully thought out scenery and ending with the ghostly looks that Mina Kumari gives. Pakeezah's music is amazing, especially if you understand sublime poetry, and is definitely one of those films "OMG, 5 minutes is another song." You have a feeling that Sahibjan is trapped among all the amazing jewelry that she wears and the well-groomed courtyards that she accidentally passes by. <br /> <br /> A parody of all your dreams ..... .....
