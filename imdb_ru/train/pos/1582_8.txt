Another small piece of the huge mystery about the Holocaust turned upside down in this documentary book about the Rozenshtrasse protest in Berlin, an event I didn’t know about, which began in late February 1943. Details are provided in the appendix that follows this review. <br /> <br /> The film’s narration tells the story of this protest in another modern story that begins in New York now. Here is a wealthy, inattentive Jewish woman, whose husband has just died, shocking his children and others, insisting on an extremely orthodox funeral ritual. She goes even further, demanding that the groom of her non-Jewish daughter leave the house. <br /> <br /> The lost daughter Hannah (Maria Schroeder) first learns from her elder cousin, who during World War II in Berlin, her mother, who was then 8 years old, was taken and protected by an Aryan woman. Hannah throws everything, goes to Berlin and finds this woman, Lena Fisher, who is now 90 years old. Hannah easily persuades a woman to tell her story. It seems that all too much. <br /> <br /> The film then improves, focusing on long memories, mainly on the events of 1943, which surrounded the protest, in which the fictional central character is the same Mrs. Fisher at 33 years old (played superbly by Katya Riemann) Baroness and an experienced pianist, who is married to Fabian (Martin Feiffel), a Jewish concert violinist, one of the men detained on the Rosenstrasse website. <br /> <br /> Narrative briefly intertwined from time to time to return to the present and again to end in New York. While the scenes in the present are saturated with color, the scenes of 1943 are blurred, they are pronounced in gray-blue colors. <br /> <br /> The quality of acting is usually quite good, which can be expected given the large supply of talent. in Germany and led by Margaret von Trotta, New German Cinema’s most distinguished female filmmaker, the former actress herself. <br /> <br /> The story of the protest is told simply. There is only one feature missing that could help: at the end there are still text notes indicating the final result for those people who were taken into custody on Rozenshtrasse, and this result, as can be seen from the addition below, is incredibly positive. <br /> Rosenstrasse is not very good in the opinion of most film critics. Overly long, overly multi-layered, carriers of gender stereotypes manipulating music: this is how ordinary raps go. This is too long. But I found in this film a strict, powerful, spontaneous and completely convincing protest voice of women who kept the vigil out of place on Rosenstrasse, where their Jewish relatives and others were kept. In this image I did not find anything flashy, modern or manipulative. <br /> <br /> The very absence of extreme violence (no one was shot or physically assaulted) increased my tension, which gradually increased as the film progressed. You continue to wait for some kind of vicious attack to start at any moment. The darkness of the film stayed with me later. I often woke up late at night when I saw the film, my mind was filled with dull, melancholic, chaotic images and feelings caused by the film. For me, this rarely happens. (In German and English).

But before in this case the deportation of prisoners could occur, wives and other relatives learned about what was happening and appeared at Rosenstrasse, first one by two and two, and then in ever-increasing numbers. <br /> <br /> It is possible that six thousand people took part in the protest, although not all of them at the same time. Women demanded the return of their husbands, day after day, a week. Unarmed, unorganized and without a leader, they faced the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich. <br /> <br /> Joseph Goebbels, the gauleiter (governor or head of the district) of Berlin, who seeks to ensure that this city is racially cleansed, is also responsible for the public morality of the nation. In both cases, he was worried about the possible consequences of women's actions. Instead of calling for more open dissent, shooting women in the streets and fearing to endanger the secrecy of the “final decision”, Goebbels, with the consent of Hitler, freed the prisoners of Rosenstrasse and even ordered the return of twenty-five of them that had already been sent to Auschwitz! <br /> <br /> For both Hitler and Goebbels, the decision was a simple postponement of the inevitable. But they were wrong. Almost all liberated from Rosenstrasse survived the war. Women won an amazing victory over the forces of destruction.
