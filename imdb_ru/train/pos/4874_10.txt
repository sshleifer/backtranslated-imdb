Kusturika did it again. Another masterpiece. Coral comedy, full of his own landmarks, with a violent rhythm and many great moments, we laughed and laughed, what a party! Music is everywhere, as well as shooting, animals, crazy bastards, sex and amazing gadgets and inventions, everything is colorfully visually entertaining only. Pure movie in essence. A wonderful experience to watch. And one is especially grateful, since good comedies are so rare and so beautiful. Well, this is one, and if you liked Kusturica's previous films, you will like it, although, like in all comedies, this is a chemical reaction, and you should be in the mood for this.
