What if the platoon G.I. from the Japanese army was to be sent back in time for 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the Tokugawa shogunate? Great hearing, right? Cinema is exactly what is written on the bank. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the authors did not bother to explain, as a rule, absurd in science fiction films, scientific confusion with the transfer of time. No how or why. They just did. Nevertheless, the very sequence of the transfer of time is fussy and rather beautiful, if not a bit outdated. Not as stupid as you could imagine. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is devoted to T's idea. But while he loses a little pair with various plots that follow the soldiers' arrival in medieval Japan, he picks up with a destructive sequence of battles. Undoubtedly, this is the main order of the day. The whole concept and, as a result, the film itself, probably originated from this simple step: what if GI equipped with the latest in modern warfare means to fight samurai? And the boy does it. <br /> <br /> The main sequence of fights, which lasts more than half an hour, is probably one of the best of its kind in the action films of the 70s. Not only is it ruthless and tedious at pace and length, it is also a terrific combination of styles and techniques that are used only in unique spaces such as G.I. Samurai can deliver. I mean, where else will you be able to show tanks, ninjas with shurikens, a helicopter and samurai in one frame? G.I. a platoon led by Lieutenant Iba literally through hundreds of extras breaks them off from machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks. <br /> <br /> This one-leg mishmash style is firmly rooted in the sprawling djidai - the epic epic about Kagemush Kurosawa or the Banner of the samurai Hiroshi Inagaki, and the other in Western action movies and action films. There are stylistic touches (for example, great slow motion shots and bloody violence) that resemble Sam Peckinp or Enzo J. Castellari near Keoma. Japanese cinema has always been influenced by Westerns and other Hollywood works and vice versa, as well as GI. The samurai effortlessly turns this melting pot from east to west into an exciting movie. <br /> <br /> The creators of the film, fortunately, take it all seriously, and the film takes great advantage of it. It’s not that the ridicule mentality is completely absent, he just doesn’t try to condone such a bad, good audience that likes to laugh at his films. The budget was probably huge, as can be seen from hundreds of additions, elaborate costumes (very worthy for production, which is not a traditional Jidai Geki) and special effects. Camera work and editing are all top notch, almost better than a film without high artistic ambitions worthy. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not without flaws. There are many scenes of "songs", where all kinds of Japanese rock of the 70s, disco and country songs are played on montages (there is a scene of gluing, a scene of love interest, a scene of "war in hell", etc.). The songs themselves are rather lame and trite and distract from all this. Despite the fact that he works with a whopping 140 minutes, for the most part he flies like a bullet. However, some scenes, flashbacks and scenes in the first half could be cut out for a tougher effect. <br /> <br /> The cast also deserves mentioning with the participation of such prominent names as Sonny Tiba, Isao Natsuyagi (Goyokin, Samurai Wolf). ), Tsunehiko Watase (The Yakuza Papers) and Hiroyuki Sanada, they all beat the right notes.
