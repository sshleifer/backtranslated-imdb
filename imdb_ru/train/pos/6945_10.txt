My favorite genre of cinema is western, it is really the only genre of cinema of American origin. And, despite Sergio Leone, no one makes them the same as the Americans. <br /> <br /> Winchester 73 right at the top of my list of ten favorite westerns. It was the first and only black and white movie about a partnership. director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was also a landmark film in which Stewart chose a percentage of the profits instead of the direct salary from Universal. Many such deals were made for players, making them as rich as the magnates who hired them. <br /> <br /> Up to this point, Anthony Mann took mostly B-shots, noir-like things without real budgets. Shortly before Winchester, 73 Mann made a good Western with Robert Taylor, the Devil Door, who never gets enough praise. I am sure that James Stewart must have seen this and decided that Mann was the man with whom he decided to cooperate. <br /> <br /> In this film, Mann also created a mini-company, for which John Ford was legendary. Other actors such as Millard Mitchell, Steve Brody, Dan Durya, John McIntyre, Jay S. Flippen and Rock Hudson will appear in future films of Mann besides Stuart. <br /> <br /> This is a simple plot, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutchman Henry Brown and killing him. Why I will not say, but until this moment we have never seen such cold rage of James Stewart on the screen. Anthony Mann penetrated into the soul of Jimmy Stewart and pulled out some demons whom we all fear that we have. <br /> <br /> Hatred is well demonstrated at the beautiful moment at the beginning of the film. After Stuart and his friend Millard Mitchell were disarmed by Wyatt Earp, who is played by Will Gere, because the weapon is not in Dodge City Earp. Dodge City has a Winchester rifle competition, and the favorite of stakes is Dutchman Henry Brown, whom Stephen McNally played under threat. Stewart, Mitchell and Gere enter the salon, and Stewart and McNally notice each other at the same instant and take out a weapon that is not there. Look at the close-ups of Stuart and McNally, they speak more than 10 pages of dialogue. <br /> <br /> Another character that Stewart encounters in the film is Wako Johnny Dean, played by Dan Durya, who almost steals the film. Perhaps it was the best moment of Durya on the screen. He is a psychopathic criminal killer, deadly as a left-handed, although he has two six pistols. <br /> <br /> Another person Stewart meets with is Shelly Winters, whose fiancé Duria pushed for a fight and killed. Her best scenes - with Duria, who loved her. She plays for a while, until she can safely get away from him. Guess who she will end up with? <br /> <br /> In some small roles there are great performances; there is no acid note in the cast. John McIntyre in the role of a running Indian merchant, Jay C. Flippen as a sergeant in the grizzly army, and Rock Hudson received his first real notice as a young Indian leader. Even John Alexander, better known as "Theodore Roosevelt" in "Arsenic and Old Lace", plays a short but impressive role as the owner of a trading post, where McNally and Stewart stop at different times. <br /> <br /> Mann and Stewart shot eight films together, five of them are westerns, and was ready to make the sixth western, “Night Passage”, when they fell out, and Mann left the set. The end of a wonderful partnership that produced several quality films.
