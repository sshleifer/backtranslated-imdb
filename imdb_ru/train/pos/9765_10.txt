I saw this funny little movie at the age of 10/11 in 1979, when it was broadcast on CBS. I did not know that it was in the theater at all. To rate this in terms of children, I would give 4 out of 5 stars, because being a little boy at the time, he seemed a bit "girlish." <br /> <br /> The climatic scene, where Gazuki was tickled by daylight at all, was a bit disturbing at the time, but you outgrew such things. <br /> <br /> When in 1995 I discovered the Video of Blockbusters for myself, I had to return to it! I still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit old. I don’t know where the other reviewer got the idea that he doesn’t have it on VHS. <br /> <br /> It's over there. Maybe even on a DVD, at least I hope so. I want to share this with my children someday! 10 stars here is still a great kids movie. (end) <br /> <br /> 08/08/2009: Finally found a copy of VHS! Woo-hoo!
