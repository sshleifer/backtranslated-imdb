I think a friend lent me this DVD, which he received from the director at the festival. I warned that some of the technical aspects of the film were a bit shaky and that the script was good, but not great. So maybe this changed my mind, but I have to admit that I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Outstanding actors. Yousef Kerkor was really good as Ernie, the main character, rather pathetic in a pretty manner. Adam Jones (who also supervised) and Justin Lane were excellent as roommates who drove Ernie crazy. The character of Bill (Justin Lane), who spends most of the movie dressed as a panda, was my favorite; it seemed the least one-dimensional and reminded me of an old roommate in college, so I called the guy after watching the DVD. Very cute and very funny. Some of the other actions were good, some were so-so, but there was nothing bad. I also really liked the Vigilante duet. Funny and funny. <br /> <br /> I give this high mark, although she has some problems, because when you watch her, you can say that these people cared and decided to make their film their own. Excellent with Adam Jones and the team.
