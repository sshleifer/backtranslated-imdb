I was very surprised how much I liked this movie. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful and warm. Andy McDowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable. At this time, the director of the film MacDowell did not make her beautiful another character in the film. The romance between Kate and her young man is beautiful to watch, and she plays very well. Her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life. Imelda Stalinson, who was the MVP in many British films, does a great job on this. There is some tragedy in this, but I think that the film, in the end, is saved by a brilliant acting game, clear direction and ingenious writing. The quality of the film is excellent, and the music is good, although not available for the sound track.
