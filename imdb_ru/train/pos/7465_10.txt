A warning. Contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen this movie yet and plan to do it, just stop reading here and take my word for it. You should see this movie. I saw it four times and still haven’t decided what exactly happened in the film. That's all I'm going to say, because if you haven't seen this movie yet, stop reading right now. <br /> <br /> If you are still reading, I will ask you a few questions and maybe if someone. If you have any answers, you can write me and let me know what you think. <br /> <br /> I remember well my English teacher in the 11th grade. His name was Mr. Krisak. For me, he was wiser than he had been in years, and he always had this devious way of teaching you things that you may not have been too enthusiastic about. If we didn’t like Shakespeare, then he turned history into a modern novel with a modern language so that we can understand it. Our classroom was never a room, it was a cottage, and we were on the lake reading a book in our free time. It was his own indelible way of capturing something in our lip-like minds. <br /> <br /> I start this review of Vanilla Sky with the description of this brilliant man, because once he gave us a task that was firmly imprinted in my memory, for example, the phone number of a long-lost best friend, and this is finally it made sense to me after watching the Matrix. Now, if I didn't know better, I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers really were a pseudonym for my teacher, Mr. Krisak. But giving them the advantage of doubt, we assume that it was not him. But it was the first time that this appointment was more than just intangible. <br /> <br /> He asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that this is real. Show me how you can say that you are real. This forced the class to pour out all the usual ideas that I am sure you can imagine. Everything, from pain, touch, feelings of loss to hunger, was transferred to our teacher to prove to him that we are real. After each script we gave him, he returned with the only answer that would leave us in a bind. <br /> <br /> “What if you are nothing but a dream of others?” <br /> <br /> What if you were someone else’s dream? What a confused question. This was a question / scenario asked us about 15 years ago, before astronomical use of the Internet and the rapid development of computers. How possible could this seem then? But if you look at modern technology, now ask yourself what you were part of someone else’s dream. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant, but surreal film of this year, Mulholland Drive by David Lynch, explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other film could have hoped. In short, this is one movie that literally (if you allow) will amaze you with all the possibilities that surround you. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise plays David Eames, a young, hot, righteous, full publisher and owner of several magazines. He inherited this from his father, and although he has talent and business skills, his governing council, the Seven Dwarfs, believes that he is a rich dick, born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel that he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success, which each of them believes must go to them. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, we meet one of David’s magnificent toys named Julie Gianni, played by Cameron Diaz with disastrous, but pompous perfection. David and Julie play a good game, arguing that they are just here to use each other, and they are not at all interested in a monogamous, committed relationship. This is a type of relationship commensurate with other experiences of David, which he had in the sexual bloom of his life. And although both say a good game, we can say that only one really speaks the truth. <br /> <br /> Then we meet with Brian Shelby, whose brilliant actor played by Kevin Smith's boyfriend Jason Lee. Brian is writing a book that David is going to publish, but they are also very good friends. This is what David has very little in his life, and you can feel real concern for each other at the beginning of the film. Brian has one famous line about which he goes on to tell David again and again. And this "sweet is not so sweet without bitter." He then tells him that one day he will find true love, and not just this status as a part-time lover, which he seems to assign to all the sloops who inhabit his bed for a night or two. <br /> <br /> During David's huge birthday (so huge that people like Steven Spielberg wish him a happy birthday), Brian enters with his date, Sophia Sorrano, who, of course, will be played by Penelope Cruz with the fact that the actress should be the best this year is a blow at the invitation, and at first David and Sophia seem intrigued with each other. And in the typical manner of David, despite the fact that there is his best friend, he begins to flirt with Sophia. To complicate matters, Julie appears without an invitation and begins to spy on David. Then David spends the night with Sophia, but they only talk and draw caricatures of each other. There are no handkerchiefs. The next day, when David leaves Sofia's apartment, he is greeted by Julie, who offers him a ride, and from there ....... well, I think we all saw the advertisement. <br /> <br /> That's all I’ll really say about the plot, because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurry perception. We are introduced to the character played by Kurt Russell and several other shadow characters who all play a part in this maze, like smoke. There is a subtext of death and a possible panacea, as a panacea that may or may not create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the intriguing possibilities that the film offers us, but it does not end there. <br /> <br /> Like many films that are flourishing today, this film has a secret. The sixth sense may have begun this passion, but look further, and you can perhaps thank the Angel's Heart for the start of the craze. Regardless of how he came to be, Vanilla Sky has one of its secret intestinal destroyers. And what makes this film so funny is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way, but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the problem of truth and lies that you have just experienced. I saw this film four times, and every time, because I want to see if there is anything else that I can lift, something more that I can understand. To be able to work in the theater, to open up new opportunities for him is something rare in the film. All the ersatzas, the so-called "Best Photos of the Year", were good, but nothing spectacular. They lack substance. “Beautiful mind” was intriguing, but flat, “Royal Tenenbaum” was interesting, but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a rarity, because it’s a movie that makes you crave for more, but it guarantees your satisfaction, because the movie and those who made him take care of it. I know that this film has received mixed reviews, but I just think that those who do not like it do not quite understand it. <br /> <br /> This is what film making should look like. This is what the film should do for you. This should make you feel something. Most of the other films of this year were just empty spaces. This is not true. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 Best film of the year. I would very much like this to be nominated for the best photo, and I would like Cruise to be promoted to the best actress, Diaz for the best actor, Cruise for the best actor, and Jason Muse should be the best supporting actor. Cameron Crowe should be there too. None of this can happen, and it is a shame. This is one movie not to be missed. <br /> <br /> And finally, I’m sure that Mr. Chris'ak will like this film, and perhaps this is the film that can answer his question. Can you prove you are real? Or are we just a figment of someone's imagination? Are we artificially replanted for someone else's embarrassment? This is a film that raises more questions than answers. And I am sure that he is all right. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes
