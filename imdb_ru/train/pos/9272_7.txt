It was the first of Panahiâ€™s films that I saw, I saw him at the Melbourne Film Festival. I was completely absorbed by the different characters he creates, and the way they react and behave differently compared to Australian children, and yet at other levels, in a similar way. I think that, perhaps, if more people could see films like this, they could see people as personalities and avoid racism, which often feeds on the fear of the unknown. There are obvious big political differences between the Oz culture and the Iranian culture, but I found more subtle differences between the characters that this film so successfully unveils on the screen is extremely exciting. The characters have their own characteristics that seem so unique to me. I found that this makes the characters attractive to see.
