Every time you think you have a pen for a deathtrap, a different plot twist appears. It is better to just sit back and enjoy the ride on it. This film, which is best known for its kiss on the screen between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (which, unfortunately, was cut from the television version I saw), has much more to recommend it. <br /> <br /> Sydney Br√ºhl (Michael Kane) is a very unhappy person. Once a successful playwright, his last few plays on Broadway have failed. And although his wife, Myra (Diane Cannon) is nothing more than supportive, in both monetary and emotional terms, it does little to help Sydney feel better. To add insult to injury, a young playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), just sent Sydney a play to watch. First Anderson, and Sydney sees that the young man is a talented writer. He jokes to his wife that he should invite Anderson, kill him and present the play as his own. At first she laughs with him, but when Syd actually invites Anderson to dinner, she worries about what he can really bring to life his scheme. And her fears may be justified ... <br /> <br /> This is a great script. There are twists and turns in the plot, and they get faster and brighter as you get closer to the end. This is such a film, which from the very beginning stands on the edge of your place and keeps you there all the time. An absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery. <br /> <br /> The game is great. Kane demonstrates his excellent performance, and he shows the ability to play cultural, sophisticated and intelligent men. Reeve also gives a superb image of a person who is not as wide open or innocent as it seems. Cannon's madness works well for Myra. And Irene Worth in a good role plays a curious neighbor, who is also a psychic. <br /> <br /> This is a film with a final that you never expect, and repeated viewing helps to remember things that were missed earlier. views An unsung classic, who, unfortunately, is remembered only for the stage, which shook some of the feelings at the time - and this is a real shame.
