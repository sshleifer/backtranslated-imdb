The best movie of Stephen King along with IT, although this film is more fun than scary. <br /> <br /> This one has it all: <br /> <br /> - a magnificent cast with Alice Krieg and Brian Krause and a funny cameo from King himself; <br /> <br /> - Awful horror in a funny storyline; <br /> <br /> - excellent use of music, in particular “Lunatic” Santo and Johnny; <br /> <br /> - similar characters in King’s typical setting anywhere in the village; <br /> <br /> - a lot of humor. You cannot get good fears here because it is too fun and excessive; <br /> <br /> - old, but really good makeup effects that no longer do! <br /> <br /> Score 4.5: I do not understand, really. When was the last time a horror movie was as fun as this one?
