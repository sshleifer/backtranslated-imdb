The only reason I knew about the Midnight Cowboy was that he was in the top 100 AFI Critic. For the top 100, this is not a very famous movie; Indeed, I had to search for a copy in order to find a copy, I got the version on DVD for about half the price. Surprisingly, the rating was only M15 + (uncut version). <br /> <br /> I doubt that many will take note of this review (more like a comment), so I will make it brief. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the strangest films I've ever seen, in part due to the use of installations, artistic filming (very art-house) and an unusual theme. There are a lot of things in the movie that I still don't understand (I saw it twice), and this makes the movie emotionally confusing. <br /> <br /> Filming and acting was very good, and these are characters more than life that make this movie unforgettable. The main character is Joe Buck, a “cowboy” from Texas who moves to New York to become a male prostitute. He meets the crippled crook Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo and, of course, they become friends, passing the usual escapades. What makes a movie interesting is two different characters. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film didn’t really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo, so that the audience had a real emotional connection, although the finale is of course rather sad and tragic. You probably already know what is happening when reading reviews, but this is pretty obvious from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think that the film explores its main themes perfectly and with all the urgency. Deprivation of humanity (manifested in the darkness of city streets, collapsing apartment buildings). Most of the characters in the movie are outlaws (con, giggolo.etc), but you can't help but love them. Joe Buck is charming because he is so naive and optimistic, while we start to feel pity for Ratso later in the film. <br /> <br /> I think the film was rated so highly because it certainly was very innovative for its period. At the time (and even now) it was definitely not a typical film (pretty art house). At a time when tired westerns, musicals and dramas predominate in the cinema, a film with such an unusual theme as Midnight Cowboy appears. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I have to say that I really liked the movie. The image conveyed a fabulous quality. I especially liked the scene at the party, the music, the images, etc. They remain in memory long after watching. Nevertheless, as a movie for entertainment, he was a little lacking (not quite my style of film) in the thrill. This is a film that needs to be savored and appreciated, not a cheap action-thriller. <br /> <br /> Although I hardly consider myself sufficiently qualified to analyze this film, the characters and their motives were quite interesting. From what I understand from my memories, a grandmother was sexually abused by Joe Buck as a child, although it seems to have nothing to do with this story. He is a careless young stallion who suppresses his dark memories. The religious connotations in the film are also puzzling. Some suggest a homosexual relationship between Buck and Ratso, although I don’t understand where they got this idea from. The topic of homosexuality as a whole is more than covered in their conversation, and then in Joe Buck's meeting with the lonely old man, but she has nothing to do with the main story. <br /> <br /> Of course, from a technical point of view, one of the best films of the decade (more than 70s in it than in the 60s), and revolutionary for its time, covering topics that dared to shoot other films. While he has a simple, sentimental story (disguised with a sharp edge), the film’s beauty lies in strange, often psychedelic episodes.
