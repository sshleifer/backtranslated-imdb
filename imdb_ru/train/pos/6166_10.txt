In fact, Bill was a cultural source from which a beautiful rainbow haze of social introspection arose, inspiring such renowned derivatives as Policemen, Departed, The Godfather 3, and, of course, more recently, The Wire. <br /> <br /> With multifaceted characters and storylines that have been described as “4th dimensional Shakespeare,” Bill grabbed you by the collars from the first episode and just didn't let you go. <br /> <br /> The show covered, foresaw, and even occasionally caused all the major global events between 1984 and 2010. The most famous moment is episode 19 of episode 5, which was released on the eve of the second Gulf War. Wrong and ultimately ending Detective Jim Carver’s career — a drug raid on Craig’s “Funny Boy” Richardson’s apartment on Jasmine Allen’s estate in early 2003 — was widely viewed as a predictive allegory for the coalition’s inability to find weapons of mass destruction after the invasion of Iraq several months later . <br /> <br /> However, it was the work done by Bill in an attempt to highlight some of the lesser known problems faced by the police that brought him the most praise. It was sympathetic drama covering such sensitive areas as shlemofobiya, uneven dressing, homosexual in van lost batons random drunk zoofilirovanie (regretfully), sirens aversion syndrome (SAS), groin irritation caused prosecution suspected while wearing too starched uniform and many, many other problems that still bother, bother, harass, and bother the officers. <br /> <br /> One of the most famous fans of The Bill, Nelson Mandela, should say the last word: “It would not be an exaggeration to say that I would not have passed through the dark emptiness of solitude, which summed up my last years of imprisonment on the island Robben, if it were not for the cordial, spontaneous jestering of Red Hollis. ”
