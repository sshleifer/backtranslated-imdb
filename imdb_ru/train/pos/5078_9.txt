This one stood out for its originality. I'm seriously tired of watching Hindi films, which are a whole bunch of Hollywood and British films. Some flaws were inevitable, however, this film is a must see. Surya portrayed a bona fide, bona fide policeman (unlike pot-bellied, hungry for money, which we usually see), was amazing. He has come a long way from his work at Nerukku Ner. I liked the movie so much that I had to own it. I usually don’t like movies about senseless violence, anyway, I really feel for every character and therefore cannot bring myself to call this “meaningless” violence. I don’t appreciate excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most Hindi and Tamil films. I really liked this movie because it is missing. The reaction of the ACP of Anbusselvan to the loss of a wife is not exaggerated, heartbreaking and makes me cry. At certain times I watch a movie when I want to press the FF button. Many times I wanted to do it in the cinema. I never wanted to do this while watching this movie. I really hope that Ghajini will be out soon.
