Presque Rien is a beautifully observed portrait of a young French homosexual. Excluding both stereotypes and sermons, this is an amazingly naturalistic film, superbly played, shot with a sense of the seaside city where the action takes place, never melodramatic, but often painfully real. In any case, this is almost too realistic, since there is little of the usual plot, only scenes from life. But the absence of universally accepted dramatic tension means less than it could be in such a finely painted world. Presque Rien may not be the most exciting movie in history; but his simple humanism serves him well in comparison with pre-planned holiday or fanatical views, which often cloud the interpretations of this topic. Worth seeing.
