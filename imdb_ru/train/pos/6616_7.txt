This is a movie that I decided to go and see, because I'm a big fan of adult animation. I often find that when a film develops not around a famous actor or actress, but rather as a story or style, it allows the film to be seen as a work of art, and not as a demonstration of the ability of actors to differ from their styles. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely more about style than history. While I found an interesting story (a thriller that borrows history and atmosphere from films such as Blade Runner and many anime films), it was sometimes a little difficult to follow, and I didn't feel that everything was the same well could have. It definitely had a mixed feel of French animation and Japanese anime combining. Good or not, it is up to the viewer to decide. Visually this film is a pleasure for the eyes, and in this sense it is a work of art. <br /> <br /> If you like adult animation or would like to watch a movie that is different from most movies at the moment, I would recommend it. All I can say is that I enjoyed the film experience, but it was a little disappointed because it could be better.
