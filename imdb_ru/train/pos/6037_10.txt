What a wonderful British film, screaming good laugh and sexy Gary Stretch, as well as a lot of bikes and a lovely Welsh village. <br /> <br /> Members of our ARROWHEAD Bike and Trike Social Club appear in it as additional services! Hooray!! <br /> <br /> There are some really fun moments, a good acting game, a good idea. <br /> <br /> Met director John Avey at the show in Wareham, Dorset. Great man, down-to-earth and good laugh. This film should be supported, as well as all great British films! <br /> <br /> So please go and see it, if you can, they have a website with cinemas that show it, so find one near you! /> <br /> I can't wait to get a DVD. Some of our biker friends have already seen the movie two or three times and cannot get enough of it. <br /> <br /> Amanda
