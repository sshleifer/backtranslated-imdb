Not only does this film have one of the great titles of the film, it is a sports third team of 70s-old children's actors Hayk Eissenman and Kim Richards. I think I remember this film, which was broadcast on Halloween week in '78, when it came out against Linda Blair in the film “Stranger” in our house. I missed it on the first run, deciding to watch another movie. Later, repeating, I saw that I had made the right choice. The film is not very bad, but in fact there is not enough cold or surprises. Although I really liked the scene when Richard Crenna shoots a family dog ​​to no avail.
