Of all the football films that I watched, this is one of the 2 best. Another creature is fever. But Hero is the world's greatest cup and, therefore, perhaps also the greatest player ever to play in the world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is mainly focused on him, but at the same time revolves around other giants of the game. <br /> <br /> The musical score is remembered, and the images are powerful. The narrative of Michael Kane is accordingly unbiased and also calmly dramatic. This story is not about individual World Cup games; rather, itâ€™s more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself. <br /> <br /> Exciting games such as France vs Brazil (one of the greatest games of all time) were covered in the same vein. The final Argentina vs Germany also went the same way. highly recommended. Classic world football. to watch again and again, especially if you are a Maradona fan.
