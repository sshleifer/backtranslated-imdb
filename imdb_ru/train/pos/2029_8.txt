A lover of horses can only appreciate this movie. There are several films that show horseback riding. I would like to know if Brian himself will ride in the film. I would also like to know if he loves horses. Brian was in many films where he traveled. Where did he learn to ride? The only part I find difficult to accept is that the skating scenes are always full of inclination, as if the horse can run forever in full steam. The filming is top-notch and captures horses in such a way as to show how dangerous things can be on top of a horse. It would be very interesting to find out how they cast this film to find all the very good riders on horseback.
