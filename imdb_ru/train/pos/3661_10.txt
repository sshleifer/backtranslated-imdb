Snobs and pseudo-experts believe that this is "far from the best of de Sica." Those who suffer from a serious lack of innocence will discover the problem associated with this masterpiece. De Sica spoke very bluntly. In his Italian, there is no intricate introspection of modern Italian cinematographers or the bitter self-parody of Pietro Jermi, the sharp bitterness of Mario Monicelli, the solemnity of Visconti or the cold observation of Antonioni. De Sica told us stories about how his father sat on the edge of his childrenâ€™s bed before they went to bed. There is no attempt to intellectualize. Miracolo A Milano and to a lesser extent Il Giudizio Universale are realistic fairy tales or what we call today magical realism. A film is a gem from beginning to end, and Toto is a character that you take with an open heart, but which naturally requires you to have a heart. Cinema in its purest form. Great.
