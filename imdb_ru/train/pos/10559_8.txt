For a long time I did not write an IMDb review, but I felt obliged to write it! While watching this movie, I found one specific review that encouraged people NOT to watch this movie. Do not pay attention to this ignorant man! ANYTHING is a fantastic film, full of laughter and above all ... imagination! Are you not tired of being force-fed on the same cycle of junk films with chewing gum? Sometimes there is a film ANYTHING that gives you something that you have never seen before. I don't even care if you don't like (or even dislike) the film, but no one has the right to discredit the film. IMDb has a huge impact on reputation, and no negative reviews should discredit this film. Just say that you hate it and why you hate it ... but do not try to tell people that they should not watch it. We have our own thoughts, and we will decide for ourselves, thank you. <br /> <br /> If my opinion is good, I would say that more people will like this film, and not those who hate it. <br /> <br /> Treat your eyes with sweets! I do not see anything!
