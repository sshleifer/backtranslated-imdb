It is a pity that because of the name of this film will avoid people who hate football. Deal with it as if Beckham is more than just a fun sports movie. The storyline is touching and intelligent, but not picky, the jokes laughed out loud funny, and the characters acted well. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are great as teenagers Jess and Jules, showing great performances both on and off the pitch. Anupam Kher is wonderful, like an agitated father Jess, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who was so amazingly evil in The Train with the Devil, this time is as good as a handsome guy, using his magnificent Irish accent completely! Even if you don't like football, watch this movie. Anyway, it will make you smile.
