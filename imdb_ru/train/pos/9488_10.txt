A very memorable, intelligent and intense film from one of the real geniuses of French cinema, astonishingly capable Henri Verneuil. The plot is an exact parallel to the Kennedy assassination and takes place in an indescribable fictional country. The film, both visually and in plot, is very sharp. Filmed with meticulous precision, it follows Henry Volney, the Prosecutor, who takes responsibility to unravel the coup. In many respects, this is a very disturbing film, not least because of the cold and analytical accuracy of its comments on the inner workings of the so-called modern state. The atmosphere and the characters are absolutely believable, and Verney did not leave anything accidental in his intense plot. On the other hand, this relatively little-known film has just begun a 15-year experience with Oliver Stone, who was made famous for the film “JFK”, a film in many areas of inferior quality, the smallest of which is not credible ... <br /> br /> This is a masterpiece, it should be seen by any movie lover, preferably in the original French version with sabs.
