Peaches is really an amazing movie. I am writing this to refute a review from someone named Auscrit, who appeared on this site. First of all, the idea that Monahan’s first film “Interview” somehow represents television is an unusual statement. Here is a film that has been praised worldwide and is simply one of the best Australian films ever made. It is well deserved to win the best picture. Peaches - bold, bold and bold care. For me, it works on every level, and now I've seen it twice. Monahan is a director who demonstrates great skill and incredible sensitivity. If Auscrit commented that it was another television film, etc. And that Hugo Weaving is useless, he simply does not “receive” the film. Or rather do not want to receive it. Frankly, this is the kind of commentary that can be expected from another director who is jealous, or bitter, or both. Or someone from the industry, whether it be distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. Your average player, I found, just does not write such comments. I noticed other comments on the site and a link to the film Sommersault. One has to wonder what people think they are watching. Unfortunately, in Australia at the time when SS came out, there was a push, if you didn’t like it, it means that something is wrong with you and not with the film. This media manipulation is fairly common below. The reality is that the only similarity between the two films is that they are the rights of straight films. Unfortunately, for me SS is a film about nothing that could be told in 15 minutes. I see it as a one-dimensional alarm movie. Peaches compared is a masterpiece. Personally, I can’t wait for what Monahan will do next, since he is clearly far ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema. In conclusion, if the film does not win all this year's AFI and IF awards, then this is a fake game. As for Auscrit, please find something more constructive to make your time.
