This movie is really funny! If you want to rest your brain for an hour, then go and see. She is called a blonde and a blonde, so do not expect deep and meaningful jokes. What kind of movie is it and using all the stereotypes we have about two blondes. It's just a funny movie that you can watch on a date or with friends (especially if you're not too sober. Lol). Pamela and Denise are still pretty hot chicks. It is a mistake to consider this film a work of art. Come on, this film is about blondes! It should be light, fun and superficial. One more thing, I donâ€™t think girls will appreciate and like this movie, but the guy will definitely like it.
