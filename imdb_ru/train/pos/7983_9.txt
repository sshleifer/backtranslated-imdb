It is hard to transcend this film in several ways. Everything works very well here; casting, acting, screenplay and cinematography are all first class. For the viewer, this is a touching, cruel story of love and human redemption. For film critic there are many sharp techniques and technical advantages. There are some tactical blunders, and, as discussed on the boards, the final lacks realism, if one strictly adheres to the formal point of view of the preparation of a CIA agent. However, I perceived the finale as more exciting because of the fact that Christie, instead of following the pragmatic approach of a CIA agent, basically gives his soul to the Ultimate, not taking into account the consequences. Like Jesus himself, Chrisi becomes superhuman through his sacrifice, regardless of whether it has a pragmatic meaning or not. In any case, I highly appreciated the fact that Krisi does without the usual bourgeois morality and simply overcomes the bad guys one by one in his methodical search for justice, which actually leads to redemption both for himself and for the innocent. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film is very worth seeing, if the genre at all attracts you. Excellent soundtrack, great writing, impeccable casting and solid performances in all directions make this film the best of 100 (or better).
