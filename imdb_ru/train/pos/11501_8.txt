I remember this show a little, but I remembered that it was great! My older brother recently reminded me of the show, and I saw an advertisement for D.V.D. The network, again screwed up by pulling it out of thin air, so that they could put what else on this place? This should have gone through at least 3 seasons. Why not? Sometimes I think that network leaders think they are “gods” in the entertainment world. But they are mistaken and miss from time to time to miss the good placement of the show. Let it be said that they have a lot more failures than “hits”. It was one of the bad decisions to abandon the composition. Anyway, I get it for my collection.
