Let me just summarize: I have three children aged 5 to 10 years. I believe that the trip to the theater was a success when there are no talking animals. I have seen most of the children's videos in our collection at least 72 times. I can tell you when the film rolls over in The Wizard of Oz, a sex joke over 18 in Eldorado, and a tragic flaw with the ending of Rudolph with red noses. Probably, I could only decorate Nemo from memories. <br /> <br /> What makes me support one of my children (he is changing) who offers this title for the family movie of the evening? In a word: Showerman. <br /> <br /> A minute of silence ... <br /> <br /> * sigh *
