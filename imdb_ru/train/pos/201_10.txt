The great and unappreciated Marion Davis shows his stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy, which also shows the great William Haynes. Davis plays a guy from Georgia who smashes Hollywood with the help of Haynes. They appear in cheap comedies, until Marion is "discovered" and will not become a big dramatic star. Great flashlight on Hollywood and its claims. Davis and Haines are a wonderful team (sorry they never talked to each other), and her guests were shot by Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn and Marion Davies it is) a dial tone. A must for any serious movie buff or for anyone interested in the still-defaming Marion Davis!
