This is perhaps the most underrated film in the Brooks Cannon. Of course, its flaws. This does not give a realistic idea of ​​homelessness (unlike, say, citizen Kane gave a realistic idea of ​​lounge singers or Titanic gave a realistic idea of ​​Italians, whom you IDIOTS) Many of the jokes did not succeed. But, nevertheless, this film is very attractive, unlike many comedies, and this is really impressive in the history of some of the most offended members of society. This is not a Fisher King, but not shit. My only complaint is that Brooks had to play someone else in the lead role (I love Mel as a director and screenwriter, not as a leader).
