I love this movie like no other. On another occasion, I will try to explain its merits to the uninitiated, but for the moment let me quote several parts of a wonderful dialogue, which, please, remember the whole tongue in your cheek. Australians and the British will understand, all the rest - well? <br /> <br /> (lyric name of the song) "he can drown beer, he can choose strange in his latest double-breasted outfit Bondi". <Br /> <br /> (another lyric song) "All you can help me - bastards, bastards or worse, and England is a hole in the universe." <br /> <br /> (during a television interview on The Artistic Program): Mr. Mackenzie, what artists have impressed you the most since you were in England? (Reply Barry) Flamin 'bulls artists! <br /> <br /> (talking to a naive young pomp girl): Mr. Mackenzie, I suppose you have hordes of Aboriginal servants in Australia? (Barry's answer) Abos? I have never seen abo in my life. Mom performs most of the solid yakka (i.e. hard work) around our house. <br /> <br /> This is just the taste of the cheerful farce of this crazy Australian film. If you can get a copy of it, watch and enjoy.
