I just bought a refurbished version of the film, which I remember with great love from my childhood, and it is certainly made for fun evening entertainment. Bedknobs definitely makes more sense in its full form, remote scenes (especially scenes from McDowall) quite neatly link events. What is a little confusing is how the scenes were remastered. Obviously, the soundtrack for this recording was lost or damaged, so some bright spark in Disney decided to duplicate the scenes with a new dialogue. That would be great, except that half the actors were not going to do it (some for better reasons than others), and all this has a rather sloppy quality. Part of the word sync is rather weak, and David Tomlinson’s voice was voiced by a guy who doesn’t look like David Tomlinson (I think he actually has a hint of German). Nevertheless, it is nice to hear the full versions of all the songs (although “A Step in the Right Direction” is still missing) and the moments of magic in this film still shine through. And I urge you not to giggle when young Paul looks at Angela Lansbury so innocently and shouts: "But what does this have to do with my pen ??"
