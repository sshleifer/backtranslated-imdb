Level One, Horror. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this film at the age of 10, I realized that it would cause nightmares. Did it. Surprisingly, as I recall, it was a sound just like the kind of monster that caused them. <br /> <br /> Level two, psychoanalytic theory. <br /> <br /> Later, as an adult, I saw the story as it was: what if the wild, unrestrained instincts that we all suppress manifest. <br /> <br /> Level Three, Pure Science Fiction. <br /> <br /> The best way to plausibly implement the plot of "What if" occurs through the genre of science fiction. This is pure science fiction, not “cowboys in space,” which today is called the genre. <br /> <br /> After 43 years, Forbidden Planet remains the greatest of all science fiction films. If planning a remake, SKG or Lucas, be careful!
