From start to finish, I laughed very much throughout the entire film. Surprisingly, The Groove Tube is perhaps the most grand, but the roughest of all comedy parody films. That is how I enjoy watching TV, not missing when switching channels, and suffer from insomnia! For 73 minutes, strange, strange humor never stops! Just think how all this meaningless laughter can help you enjoy life easier! This is the way, WAY is better than Comedy Central or any prime time show! Do yourself a favor and throw away all these soft, sloppy romantic comedy films in the trash! Better yet, tell the box office manager that you want The Groove Tube back on the big screen!
