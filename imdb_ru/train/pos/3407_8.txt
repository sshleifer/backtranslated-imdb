Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful, but empty film. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful, but empty life. Truly magnificent cinematography and scenery, and the bottomless chest with Dietrich's clothes are also fabulous. She looks great; Bowyer looks young and slim. <br /> <br /> The story of a woman who seeks meaning, and a former priest who seeks life, seems rather stale, but against the backdrop of such unreal sets and skies, it somehow works, given that two stars, a stunning Max Steiner rating and good cast. The film lasts 76 minutes and looks badly edited, plus some characters just appear or disappear. <br /> <br /> Joseph Shildkraut is fun as an Arabian guide, C. Aubrey Smith is an old priest, Lucille Watson, the head of the mother, Tilly Losh, the dancer, John Carradin, the soothsayer, and Basil Rathbone play ... well, I don't sure He just rides out of the desert and spoils everything! As already noted, John Gilbert was supposed to be shot with Dietrich. I can't help but think that he would be wonderful. The role of Boris, who was tired of the world, would have fit the great Gilbert. And after the success of Queen Christina (along with Garbo), his career may have returned to the same course. <br /> <br /> I can’t remember any other Dietrich film of the 30s in color. She looks great and wears amazing clothes. My favorite is Valentino as the Shiek-like outfit she wears by the pool. <br /> <br /> Of course, it’s worth looking at the lush sets and color, as well as at the two great stars.
