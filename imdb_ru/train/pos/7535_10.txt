Club 700 gives an excellent look at world events. Some describe it as dishonest or cheesy. I find the program informative and inspirational. For many, it is only natural to throw mud at a program that has proven so successful. There are very few shows that can point to a 40-year track record of success in the world of television media, and Club 700 is one of them. Although Mr. Robertson could be wrong in saying that someone must be killed, I find it curious that so many people literally upset themselves to jump into criticism. I, of course, said some nonsense in my life. I, of course, would be ready to forgive Mr. Robertson, as he arranges a great show.
