I just looked again tonight. I forgot how much I love this movie. It is surprisingly interesting and leaves you with the feeling that everything is in order with the world. I like the hints of Mozart, starting with the debut with “Einstein” playing “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” on the violin, and singing Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during Ed Walters' IQ test. I like the fact that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to make a career, especially the unique situation for the 1950s, when this film begins. (I myself was a teacher, but I stayed at home to raise my children, so please do not think that I am some kind of loyal female talker). Surprisingly, a man who is “only a fat monkey” finally looks just as important and worthy as Catherine’s fiancé, a clinical behavioral researcher. The message for me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is determined by a much larger number - no labels. There are so many little jokes and one-line players that are almost useless if you don’t watch and listen carefully. <br /> <br /> I caught a few things in the film that are not on the fools page. In the scene, when Ed Walters speaks at the symposium, 3 tools (protractor, ruler, etc.) hang to the right of the chalk protrusion. The following camera shot is only 2. In the credits in our video, he shows Tony Shalub’s character as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti, who introduces himself in the film and is listed here on Imdb. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. In some assessments this may be a mistake, but it makes much more sense than many believe. Not only what a wonderful cast is assembled here. Watch it and enjoy!
