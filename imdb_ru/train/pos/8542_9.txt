_Waterdance_ skillfully explores a wide range of aspects of dorsal-injured life. From the petty torment of faulty fluorescent lamps flashing overhead to sexuality, masculinity and depression, the experience of disability is revealed. <br /> <br /> The variety of central characters underscores the complexity of the material under study - Joel writer Raymond, a black man with a dark past, and Bloss, a racist biker. At first, these people are united by nothing other than the nature of their injuries, but they retain their competitive spirit. Over time, sharing experiences, both good and bad, unites them as friends to support each other. <br /> <br /> The most obvious of the transformations is what Joel experienced, who initially distanced himself from his fellow patients with glasses, headphones, and curtains. When he comes to accept the changes that disability has made in his life, Joel discards these details and begins to get involved in the struggle of the people with whom he shares the parish. <br /> <br /> The dance mentioned in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep your head above water; to give up dancing is to give up life. _Waterdance_ is a touching and powerful film on many levels, and I would not hesitate to recommend it.
