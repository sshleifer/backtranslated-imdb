This is not a great movie. The acting is not surprising (some sub-charterers even play poorly) The film is not beautiful in any sense. Nothing really inventive or new. If you like big movies, this one is not for you. yet it has a big one - REALLY a BIG plus on stories. Larry's story works because we know this story from our own life. The girl we didn't invite for a date, the test we failed, the friend we failed was all in our story. This film works because it touches it. This is a great story because it is small. This is the life we ​​all have, with the regrets that we all have, and yet the message is: every life we ​​could live would have its opposite side. The first time I watched it, I was 15 years old. This was shown at a party at my school. After 16 years, I think about it all the time, and every time I see it, it causes a smile on my face. Watch it It will do you good. You will be happier with what you have.
