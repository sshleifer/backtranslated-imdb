I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I think she is one of those actresses who would rather not shoot in front of the camera, but be herself. She did it, and she looked so natural in Elizabethtown. In this film, however, she tried to add a more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the film, so that she looked more like a sober editor. While in the second half, she completely returned to her daily track, and I just could not tell her to be an editor. Therefore, her performance does not tolerate this film. <br /> <br /> The film as a whole attracts and inspires. Yang's character is full and reasonable. In any case, the film tells a large and complex story. <br /> <br /> The only big drawback is that there was no turning point in the hero and the heroine’s love story. I’m completely confused when they kiss at the end of the story, because it’s pretty confusing for two people.
