By 1987, Hong Kong presented the world with films such as Samo Hong's “Meeting with a Creepy Look” “Chow Yun Fat” in John Wu’s “Better Tomorrow” icons, “Zu Warriors” and the classic “Mr. Vampire”. Jackie Chan achieved international video success, but it was in “The Chinese Ghost Story” that the HK cinema for the first time in many years received its first real crossover in the West. <br /> <br /> Western filmmakers have never seen anything. like. It was a film that used various ingredients that HK cinema used for years (a flying swordsman, wildly set martial arts and the supernatural), and mixed them to create a film that was unique in appearance, feel and performance. Forget about the poor and unnecessary sequels that he spawned, this is the original and the best. <br /> <br /> Directed by Siu-Tun Ching (still best known as the action choreographer in films such as Wu, Better Tomorrow 2 / /). The Killer '), under the supervision of legendary producer Tsui Hark, has created a fantasy / horror movie masterpiece. And with such an experienced team at your disposal (at least 6 martial arts coordinators) the chances that the film will be completely unremarkable are unthinkable. <br /> <br /> Editing the amazingly prolific David Wu (who wrote / Directed by `The Bride With White Hair 2 'and edited classic names like' A Better Tomorrow 1/2/3 ',` Hardboiled' and the cult hit 'The Club') is simply brilliant work. His creation of ideally choreographic tree-climbing sword fights makes them one of the best HK cinemas ever created. Fast moving, outlandish, but not embarrassing them, even today they are the pinnacle of their art. <br /> <br /> The film crew also worked wonders. This is a film, where each shot is a masterfully drawn picture. Where wonderful night scenes with a blue tinge, shrouded in omnipresent ghostly fog, are an exciting platform for revealing our history. This is a film in which everything is used to create fabulous beauty. Even the silk clothes and dresses that Xiao Qing wore become living parts of the film, whether in romantic episodes or battle scenes, silk fabrics ever present flow through the screen. Even a simple scene in which Xiao Qing changes his mantle turns into monstrous beauty, as each skill on the set combines to create the most memorable scene from such a simple act. The sets are also amazing, giving a different worldly meaning to the woods, and the temple and the sharpness of the burnt, flag-filled heathlands for an amazing finale. The staging of Zhongwen Xi deserves the highest praise. <br /> <br /> Another important factor in the success of films is the music of Romeo Diaz and James Wong. Hong Kong films gave us fantastic music and songs that added so much to the success of the episode, but in A Ghost Story, music is very simply vital. Starting from the first song, the music becomes as important as the characters. <br /> <br /> The score is the perfect combination of modern and traditional instruments. Drums, jingle bells and guitars pound along the action sequences with great effect, but it is in the slower, painfully romantic parts that it comes into its own. Here; Flutes, strings and female choral effects create, perhaps, the best musical works that can be heard in the film HK. Add to this the female vocals, a stunningly beautiful song that sounds over Tsau-sheng and Xiao Qin's love (you can't see anything, but the effect is wonderful. It's a lovingly innocent movie novel) and you have a vivid example of the power of film music. <br /> <br /> And we, of course, have acting talent. Leslie Chung ("Best Tomorrow 1 and 2" and a very popular singer) is an outstanding innocent tax collector. His work in a (fortunately soft) comic sequence is never excessive, and his scenes with Joey Wang are played with the proper amount of passion and innocence. <br /> <br /> Joey Wang (who would later mostly be reduced) supporting roles in films like Chow Yun Fat (Andy Lau's classic “God of the Players”) never looked more radiant than in her film. She is the embodiment of ethereal beauty. Her tragic image of Xiao Qing is stunning. She shows her heroes sadness about who she has become and what she should do, but also gives off subtle eroticism in scenes where she lures men to their horrible death. Veteran actor Wu Ma (“Mr. Vampire”, “Swordsman”) is very cheerful, wise, brave, but very ill-tempered, Yen. He passes the fine line between eccentric and irritation with practical ease. And what character could easily hurt the film, in fact, it is surprisingly interesting and memorable. <br /> <br /> What about monsters and little animals? I heard you cry. Well, they range from rather rude but funny stopping movements / animatronic zombies that inhabit the temple (which leads to a big running gag with constantly interfering attempts to chew on Zau-Shen's funny unsuspecting nothing) to a rather audacious but surprisingly effective Lord Black . Complete with an arsenal of evil flying heads and quite outstanding wire work. Most of them have never reached the top. <br /> <br /> But the most outstanding effect and creation is the killer language of the spirit of the tree. We first encounter this thing with the effect of a rushing camera in the style of “Evil Dead” when it suppresses the throat of its victims in order to deliver a deadly French kiss that turns the victims into silky zombies. But later he is shown in all his mad glory. It can become so big and long that it shoots through the forest for prey, tears up trees, wraps around the building and wraps around its slimy length around people before picking them up and throwing them into the trunks of trees !! It may even crack to show a filled canine mouth! This is an outrageous idea that, given the deeply romantic main plot, it should not work. But this is so, to a fantastic and unforgettable effect. <br /> <br /> So all this is a classic example of film making in Hong Kong. This teamwork, which gave us a truly innovative film. This is a film filled with wit, invention, action films, monsters, martial arts, ghosts, fantastic ideas, vivid visual effects, beautiful music and, most importantly, its timeless charm, one of the most exciting romances of cinemas.
