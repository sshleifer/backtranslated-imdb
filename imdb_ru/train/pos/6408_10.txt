A classic Hollywood biopic is the best sense of the genre. Gooding and DeNiro both show amazingly heartfelt performances in two major roles, and the cast is equally superb, with outstanding performances by Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport. <br /> <br /> The only “nit” I can choose is that Teron’s role was unnecessary and distracting (not her role that was good, just the film seemed to add two unnecessary scenes to adjust to her role.) In addition, the characteristics, dynamics and action of a true story are exciting and unforgettable. The evolution of the main characters and how their experience develops their creatures are uniquely characterized by artists. Despite the incredible length of the film, the rhythm remains unchanged. The account is also awesome. <br /> <br /> For us, is this a predictable Hollywood movie? You put. Thus, Mike Lee drug addicts should deduct a star, but everyone else should get great pleasure.
