“Amazing Grace” evokes a feeling of lethargy, as she tells the modern story of various lives in an apartment building. The language of communication is Hebrew, but drama can take place in any modern city. With equal aplomb, he observes family values, romance and characteristics of age groups. He does not judge characters, only represents them in a straightforward manner, as they seek to solve their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of the game is very good, and observation of the characters is insightful and cutting. I really appreciate this smooth movie.
