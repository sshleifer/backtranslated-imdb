This film is perfect for all romantics in the world. John Ritter has never been better and has the best line in the film! "Sam" beats near the house, it is pleasant to look at him, and it is so fun to play with him. Ben Gazzara was an excellent actor and itâ€™s easy to fall in love with him. I am sure I met Arthur during my travels. All around, a great choice to pick up any evening.! :-)
