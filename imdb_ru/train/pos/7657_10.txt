This is a very dark, cruel, even brutal film about a break in the death row, which fails. Black and white photography does not allow her to date. Mickey Rooney is excellent in the role of a perverted, but strangely sympathetic leader. One of the first films depicting the psychological desolation of death row cameras. It is also quite sharp.
