Two women, sick of their controlling husbands, go on vacation for a month to Italy with two other very different women. They come back refreshed and energized in this wonderful little film The Merchant - Ivory. <br /> <br /> Magnificent landscapes and location is also not bad. Seriously, a very good period, part 7 of 10
