For the viewer who encounters him many years after its creation, Winchester 73 has something in common with Casablanca. As long as you watch it, you have the feeling that you are looking at a series of clichés that are so often found in the genre; then you realize that clichés became clichés only after they were copied from this particular film, and that they were so widely copied, because this film was so wonderful. In other words, it is fruitful work. <br /> <br /> Winchester '73 is a joy to watch. The broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable, but mainly because you have seen them copied so many times in later films, and, nevertheless, it still contains a number of twists that surprise you. The dialogue, pace and direction of Mann are excellent. Stewart, in particular, glitters, and if you are a fan, this is a must-see, but he is not alone in achieving good results. It is noteworthy that many of the most thoughtful and / or witty lines go to secondary characters. Because it makes these characters (much) bigger than cardboard cutouts, it gives the film an extra realism. <br /> <br /> This is an amazingly underrated film that is worth paying attention to. The DVD also contains an interview with Stuart, which tells about the film.
