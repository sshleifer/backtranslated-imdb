Rock Star: INXS was the best music show I've ever watched! There were some of the greatest rock and roll songs ever written by 15 very talented singers / performers. It also had (in my opinion) the most soulful, pleasant, unexpected endings in the whole reality show. It actually made me shed tears of happiness for the winner !!! For 13 weeks of this television competition, viewers learned and met with all the participants. After more than 30 episodes, the remaining participants looked more like friends than strangers competing with each other in a reality show. And the fact that INXS was and remains one of the greatest rock and roll bands EVER added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality series. If you don't have a recorded series, the ROCK STAR: INXS DVD is a great alternative.
