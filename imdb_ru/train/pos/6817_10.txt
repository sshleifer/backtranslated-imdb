I like this film, it was a very interesting fantasy film, which told about the real meaning of the family, the history of our country, about the fun action shown in the film. I watch time @ top about 4 X per week, and I just love it! I would like a sequel to be made to see more of Susanâ€™s father in the past and to watch Susan mess around with her new younger sister and doesn't have a phone, computers, gameboys or anything else from the 21st century. I hope everyone else enjoyed the movie as much as I did. I think you can say that I am at the height of fanaticism, and I do not mind. The little boy in the film "Robert Lincoln Walker" was just amazing. I wonder who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if he plays in movies or TV shows?
