this film simply shows that you don't need big explosions, computer graphics worth billions of dollars or high-paying actors and actresses to make a good movie. All you need is a great storyline and plot. who is the master of all Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa copes brilliantly. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the epic period. and for those who love Kurosawa early work. 10/10
