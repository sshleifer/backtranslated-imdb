I first saw this film when it came out in 1994, and recently watched it, and it is still funny. I don't know if you need to understand hip-hop in the 90s, but it helps if you understand. In the 90s, when the NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, internal divisions arose within groups and participants, when they diverged (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.). In addition, the wanna b's rappers (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams from the C & C Music Factory, etc.) appeared on the scene. This film makes fun of it all in such a way that it seems like a really documentary film. Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer who spends a year in the life of the fictional rap group N.W.H. The band members are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / director), Tasty Taste (Larry B. Scott / Revenge of the nerds and Tone Def (Marc Christopher Lawrence). They are an emerging rap group whose policies make them controversial. What's good about this film, so this is what he is so good at depicting the hip-hop industry of the 80s, and they scoff so much at it. But if you know the rap of the 80s / 90s, you know what part of this material is true. However, by itself, without knowing hip-hop, itâ€™s still a funny funny movie, and for all those who ask, yes, Spinal Tap was the first, but Spinal Tap Auger is not the first crook movie. In my opinion, it is no less funny and in a sense better than Spinal Tap. Since Spinal Tap belongs to heavy metal, Fear of A Black Planet is rap. And songs are also ripped off hooks. The DVD is full of chalk, including music videos. NWH as a band and as solo artists. Brilliant performances by Rusty Kondiff and Larry B. Scott.
