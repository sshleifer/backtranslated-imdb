A guy desperate for action is trying to hit a gorgeous girl on the bus. She refuses him, but when he runs after someone who is trying to steal her purse, they still get together. And there it begins - a relationship that is slightly corrupted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It is no secret that there will be problems between them. <br /> <br /> In short, a story that can grow into a cool movie. And IMO, he succeeds in being a good movie. This is not a masterpiece, but I cried several times with laughter - the two main characters revolve around each other at a crazy love festival, which, even with a superhero, is believable. <br /> <br /> Thin story, but it turned out very funny and, therefore, worthy of cinematic time. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 broken hearts
