I don’t like “inflation ratings,” but I just had to give her 10. I can’t think of anything that I didn’t like about it. I saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it. I’m sure the Hollywood remake that someone told me about with J Lo and Richard Gear would be excellent, but this original Japanese version of 1996 was so emotional and makes me think that it’s hard for me to think about it anyway. could be improved, or its installation changed to a different culture. <br /> <br /> The story I found is worth seeing, and with scenes of fisticuffs or gun shots or something like that! Imagine that! <br /> <br /> All the characters seemed well developed, ... even non-core characters had good character development and enjoyable play, and the casting seemed very appropriate. <br /> <br /> These days it’s hard to find a good movie-musical, and maybe it’s not quite suitable (there’s a lot of knowledge about how to dance, but not to sing), but I really think that Gene Kelly and others, who defended a place for dancing in our lives would very much appreciate this film and the role of dance in the story of a middle-aged man who is successful in a family in Japan, looking for something ... he doesn’t know exactly what. <br /> <br /> The team of people in Japan who contributed to this film, thanks for creating and performing.
