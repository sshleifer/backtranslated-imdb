Although the name may mean, "Pig Pigs" is not the star of Porky Pig. Rather, it is a young pig with an appetite more insatiable than the character of John Belushi in Animal House. His mother constantly scolds him, but it is useless. So much so that he goes to another house where an abnormal scientist forcibly feeds him more than any ordinary mortal can handle (but in the end there is a surprise). <br /> <br /> I would say that this cartoon seemed like a place between really wonderful cartoons (Daffy Duck debuted three months after the release). But make no mistake about it, they do something elegant here. The whole sequence of forced feeding today looks more relevant, given the obesity epidemic that has swept our country. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is not the biggest cartoon film, but itâ€™s worth watching.
