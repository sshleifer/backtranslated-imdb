Some of the recognized “masterpieces” of Altman seem to me more sad now. Maybe it's me. Like the last reviewer, I even like this “smaller” Altman (recently shown on FMC), although I don’t think it was aimed at a wide audience. Organizing politics as a “microcosm” for public campaigns. Some of these satirical "dokudram" are now dated, for example, when Dick Cavett watched "Evening Show", but I found most of the dialogue amusing and insightful (for example, "You really. This means that you do not threaten anyone"). The story is not "deep", but I liked it. And funny performances, especially Cavet (like “himself”), Lauren Bacall as an aging conservative, Glenda Jackson (who actually became a member of parliament) as an ideologue of the left wing (in the opening scene, someone dressed as a carrot on the sanctity of politics) , and Carol Burnett as a basket. All in the unique style of Altman, although, perhaps, not quite inimitable, as usual. But rather inimitable.
