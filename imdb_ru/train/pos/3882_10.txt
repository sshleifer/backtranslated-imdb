I watched this tape, immediately rewound it, looked again and laughed twice as strong. I highly recommend this tape for those who do not hate, but feel uncomfortable around transvestites. This shows you that transvestitism is a feature, not a personâ€™s integrity. Comedy is not the only problem. This man is great. All comics should aim for his level of candor, intelligence and talent.
