This film beautifully depicts the plight of a patient with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). The subject is made with compassion as well as humor. Helena Bonham Carter as a person with ALS is so convincing that it was hard for me to believe that she only played. Kenneth Branagh, an excellent actor, lives up to his expectations as a bizarre artist who behaves poorly and has to maintain friendly relations with Elena’s character as part of his “community work,” an alternative to imprisonment. Observing the relationship between the two is a pleasure from start to finish. The fact that this is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous ideas. Man deeply cares about them two.
