A state-of-the-art house in a wealthy area seems to be the cause of each of its inhabitants’s bizarre (and deadly) behavior. Or, at least, Lara Flynn Boyle’s character, Colonel Kennedy, claims so. After a series of deadly incidents in the giant house next door, Kol knows he needs to give something. Marc-Paul Gosselaar also plays the main role of the mysterious architect. <br /> <br /> My opinion: “The house next door” works thanks to Lara Flynn Boyle, places (beautiful house) and stylish sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to mention absolutely stunning. She inspires confidence in her character and makes the film intriguing. Without it, it would not have been possible. "This is so vivid," says a potential buyer for the house. Yes, it is alive. But the story itself is not that big. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Boyle’s presence, not much is happening here, as a huge amount of film is spent on watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners. Results are predictable. But I still liked it. Cinematography gives the film a sophisticated look. 8/10 because of Boyle, the background of the evil ultramodern home, locations and cinematography, scenery and wardrobe.
