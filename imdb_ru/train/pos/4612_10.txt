Fred Gwynn, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar and Yvonne De Carlo starred in this funny and funny film. The late Fred Gwynn is really beautiful as Herman Munster, who lives with his grandfather Munster (Al Lewis), his wife Lily (Yvonne de Carlo), his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is cheerful as the owner of the wax museum, which has a whole section dedicated to the MÃ¼nster family. When the wax figures of Hermann and Grandfathers begin to terrorize the city, everyone blames both. Two must now clear their names before it is too late. You will laugh out loud like me.
