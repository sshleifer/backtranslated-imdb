Noir quality Foley in this rich and intense cellulose film, apparently, "perfectly" combined with each other. Frame-by-frame, edit, edit, the film unfolds around the concerned boxer, discovering his own goals (or lack thereof) Other comments around may indicate a lack of interest in the pulp, but I personally think this is a beautifully composed film!
