This is one of the most spiritual films I have ever seen. I went with about 150 people to St. George, and we saw this film in the center of a visit to the St. George Church. Not one person had dry eyes in the audience. In addition, non-religious and anti-Mormon people were present in the audience, who felt the spirit of the film and were touched by enchanting music and the re-creation of the history of the pioneers and the difficulties they faced because of their beliefs. /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who wants to know more about Joseph and the difficulties that the pioneers went through. After all, it is part of American history.
