This very specific production of Wagner’s last opera has definitely grown on me. When I first saw this, I was somewhat annoyed by the surreal images of the films and felt that too much was put on the story. However, if you can come to terms with a rather large number of quite clever “tricks”, I think you will find that the film manages to capture the very strange, otherworldly atmosphere of the opera, and that there are moments that are particularly good. <br /> <br /> Personally, I never understood the role of Kundry, until I saw Edith Clover portray her. Her performance (lip-synchronous by the meme of the singing voice of Yvonne Minton) is nothing short of dazzling, from beginning to end, and only he justifies the hours that are required for the perception of the film. <br /> <br /> Another reason for the delight in this film is that it captures the fascinating interpretation by Robert Lloyd of Gurnemanz’s important role that Lloyd has played in opera houses around the world. I was fortunate enough to enjoy them as Gurnemants on the Metropolitan Opera scene several times, and the sympathy of his voice, and the warm, paternal character of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be preserved, like his performance in the two main monologues of the character, the scene of Carfraytag and the retelling of prophecy in the first act. <br /> <br /> In the version that I saw, there was a videotape made for America, and therefore there were subtitles that, alas, could not be done with. This is especially regrettable because the translation used is very inaccurate and imposes an extremely Christian interpretation of the film, which already makes interpret the interpretation of the opera. It seemed to me that this completely contradicted both the obvious ESCAPE of Wagner’s Christianity and his deliberate attempt to “generalize” the Christian elements of history. (See the footnote with a spoiler at the end of this review.) I find it almost impossible not to absorb them when watching a movie with subtitles, and I highly recommend that if you have the ability to rotate the subtitles in DVD versions, you do this instead the opera is unfamiliar to you, you carefully read the libretto beforehand. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that there is a lot in the film that I don’t like, and I’d like to see it differently, I would have done it differently ... but this has steadily increased in my assessment throughout many years since i first saw it, and i feel interested in enjoying it again and again. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________________ /> <br /> FOOTNOTE CONTAINING A SPOILER: A good example is the famous Kundry line: "I saw him ... him ... and laughed." This translates to subtitles for reasons that avoid me, like "I saw the face of the Savior." This is especially annoying to me, because throughout the libretto, Wagner very consciously and carefully calls this invisible character, WHO DOES NOT SHOULD BIBLE Jesus, “der Heyland”, i. E. German for “Healer” - referring to the wound of Amfortas, and all wounds and afflictions and the need for healing.
