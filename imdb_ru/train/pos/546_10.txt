I thought it was one of the best follow-ups I have ever seen. Sometimes it seemed to me that I just wanted someone to die, and Stanley would kill annoying characters. It was such a well-made film that you were happy when you died that way. My only problem was that in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was shooting this, and it was weird. Judd Nelson is cute, at least in my opinion, and he performed very well in the role of Stanley Caldwell. Brilliant movie.
