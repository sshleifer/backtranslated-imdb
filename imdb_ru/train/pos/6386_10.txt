Disney, the name of a film that once signified everything innocent and suitable for all ages, finally began to realize that in order to survive, you need to become more diverse. Such diversity has been very evident in the last couple of years. Films such as The Emperor's Tarzan and The New Groove made an attempt to move away from the traditional routine based on Disney's past songs and move onto a new, unexplored territory. "Atlantis" - the most courageous step, but we must remember: this is still Disney. The first serious film to come out of Disney’s animation studio is a great achievement for them — in fact, it’s so serious that it turns into PG territory. Perhaps that is why many families were scared to see this last summer. <br /> <br /> But despite a more mature theme, this is still a film that Disney wanted to make in families, not just in adulthood. therefore, the plot should have been simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to be taken away from the Little Mermaid kingdom and others. <br /> <br /> So in fact we get a potentially detailed story, unfortunately, suffered a blow in the form of a 96-minute film. Ultimately, this is a thriller about Atlantis, and not about the exposure that precedes it, so in the first half hour we have so many episodes that bombard the screen as much as possible, without losing the sequence. Suspend your disbelief in how the characters so quickly get from point A to point B, you can hardly find an animated film that comes out of Hollywood in detail! If you need epic levels of detail of the plot, refer to the "Titanic" by James Cameron. Both films are about the boat. <br /> <br /> And let's talk about love, right? Yes, as in many films, the lead man (one Milo Thatch, a clumsy archaeologist) and the lead woman (Kida, a clichéd Atlantic princess) are going to fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as cliche as I expected. By the end of the film, this time the touch / sensation / kiss sequence of the characters was much more depressed. There are several moments in the film in which attractiveness grows, but this is not in the sense that, say, “The Little Mermaid” (a good thing). <br /> <br /> You may have realized that this is a pretty cliché film. Right. You have your main character and heroine, who are supported by more than half a dozen crew members who go on an expedition, and they all get their moments during the movie. Numerous other characters appear, take a few minutes of screen time, and then disappear. Does it require genius to do math ?? A 96-minute film with an emphasis on action and visual effects, as well as a significant cast of actors, has very little time to expand the characters to any degree. So what does he rely on? Cliche, and a lot of them. Each character mimics what was done a thousand times earlier. Do you have a clumsy scientist, an attractive princess, a colonel with a square jaw, a rich eccentric, a manic bastard, a Russian fatal woman ?? Do I need to go further? <br /> <br /> I don’t know why anyone managed this ?? I found the mocking nature of this film rather amusing. Well, it should be a serious movie, but do you really expect Disney to give up every feature of its story? At least, the authors tried to come up with a consistently witty dialogue, and sometimes he even inspired a little. <br /> <br /> But in the end, it is these great, stunning visual effects that give the eye this cake. The CGI animation is truly amazing in some places and does not overshadow the characters, which was a flaw that allowed the recent “Titan AE” down. Speaking of characters, Disney hired an external comic book to create the design, giving the movie an anime style. In fact, the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes much to the anime, much more than any previous exit to Disney. This led to a conflict with the fans of the Japanese anime "Nadia" due to the general similarity of the film with the animated series mentioned. Not seeing this anime, I can not comment. <br /> <br /> With the image there is sound. Gary Ridstrom leads the sound team, and what a soundtrack! From the first shot, the sound stage is alive and enjoyable. James Newton Howard views us in a dynamic musical score that complements the film in every way, never sounds out of place and always helps create tension or suppress it. <br /> <br /> I may have missed the point of what the Creators intended. For me, the film conveys that this is an exciting adventure trip, albeit with a more serious tone than any Disney movie before. If you do not like an ordinary mocking attitude, then perhaps the effort invested in visual effects will delight you. Damn it, at least, the mythology is much more correct than can be said about other Disney efforts (* cough * Hercules * cough *). <br /> <br /> This is a positive, 10 out of 10 review from someone who was amazed by this movie. Do I always suspend my disbelief with any animated film ?? After all, the laws of the real world are more than often violated in a cartoon environment. So sit back, enjoy the ride, and maybe everyone can find something for themselves in this movie.
