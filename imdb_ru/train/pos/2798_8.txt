Jess is 18 years old, she is very smart and wants nothing but to play football. When she joins the local team, she has to lie to her parents again and again, because they will never approve of her pursuit of their dreams, they want her to calm down a good Indian boy and learn to cook. <br /> <br /> Bend it like Beckham is a very funny movie about well-being, which should not be deep and complex, itâ€™s just good. All the actors are very good and they play their roles very well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works great, and the script is very realistic and very funny. <br /> <br /> Great family movie 8/10
