This Halloween movie is the same as the fun Christmas story for Christmas: both are relatively low budget, no star names ... and both are two of the biggest and funniest films available, both are seasonal CLASSICS !!! “Space invaders” from the very beginning rush with warmth and humor and an excellent set of characters ... all five stupid Martians, Clembecker realtor, Russell's deputy, Vern in TRK and many others! You just need to watch this film to believe it, and, like in “Christmas Story”, it gets better and better with each viewing, and you notice funny little things every time !! MOST DEFINITELY TEN !!!
