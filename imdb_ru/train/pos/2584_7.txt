The film begins very slowly, with the lifestyle of Wallace Napalm accompanying the photo services station. His wife was confined to her house with a bracelet on her ankle as a result of the sentence for arson. Wallace is a volunteer fire brigade employee and takes fire fighting seriously. <br /> <br /> When we observe the rather boring life of Wallace, something new and unpleasant appears suddenly: a wandering carnival arrives in the city. One of his stars is Wilder Napalm, Wallace's brother. He is a clown, but he has a special talent. <br /> <br /> Wallace too. They are both pyrokinetic or "pyrotic" people capable of kindling fire with the help of mental energy. Wallace keeps his strength secret; Wilder tells his friends what he is capable of. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: Some of their differences go back to a child incident when they accidentally caused the death of a vagabond. Wallace is holding back from using his powers; Wilder wants to be public on national television. <br /> <br /> Complicated question, Wilder wants Wallace's wife, whom they both met many years ago. She becomes an apple of discord and becomes one of the reasons that the brothers finally began a literal exchange of fire. <br /> <br /> The film is entertaining, but not funny, funny. I think enough to have a copy in my library. This is a good original movie.
