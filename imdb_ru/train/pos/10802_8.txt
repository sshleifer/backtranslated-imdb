I am at the opposite end of the previous comment. <br /> <br /> First of all, I don’t think it was intended to be a direct sequel to “The Jerk”. I mean, this is not called “The Jerk 2” ... this is “The Jerk, Too”, which makes me believe that, although many of the characters' names are the same, they actually revolve around a completely different person. /> <br /> Think about it: there is practically no connection with the previous film, except for the names of the characters; completely different story; other composition; and the fact that this is a partial musical. <br /> <br /> I will say that this film is trustworthy. He has a lot of laughter ... Mark Blankfield in his prime.
