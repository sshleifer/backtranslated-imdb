I remember Casper’s comics, but I don’t remember any cartoons. Perhaps they were not memorable; I don't know, but in my old age, I watch this very early animated short film about Casper yesterday. After that, I was shocked to read user comments here. Did people miss the final? <br /> <br /> I have to understand again and again that Casper is not like other ghosts who like to go out every night and scare all opponents. “He sees no future in this,” says the narrator. Instead, one night he goes to the rural part of the city, accidentally scares some animals and cannot find friends. This brings him to tears until the little fox hears him crying and makes friends with him. These two become buddies, but soon the fox runs after its life with fox hunting in the process. <br /> <br /> Other reviews mention what is happening, so I’ll also touch on that. The fox is killed by hunting dogs (not shown), and Casper in tears loses "the only friend I've ever had." But no one mentions the happy ending of this story. “Ferdi”, the fox becomes the same figure of spirit as Casper, jumps on his knees, licks his face, and the narrator comments: “They lived happily ever after.” Both characters look very pleased. <br /> <br /> What's so sad about that? This is a good story with a good happy ending.
