Los Angeles television news reporter Jennifer (beautiful Barbara Bach, known as “The Spy Who Loved Me”) and her two assistants Karen (attractive playful Karen Lamm) and Vicki (pretty Lois Young, who is not only killed first, but also exposes my delicious body in a refined, nude scene in the bath) going to Solvang, California, at the annual Danish festival. Since all local hotels are booked flawlessly, three beautiful ladies are forced to look for a room and food in a posh, but gloomy, remote mansion owned by the bizarre Ernest Keller (delightfully played to the utter perfection by the late great Sidney Lassic) and his gentle Virginia sister (solid Lelia Gelia) played (solid Lelia Gelia) (a solid Lelia Goldey Glory Gordny Lassik) Unfortunately, Keller has one very unpleasant and deadly dark family secret in his damp basement: a fluffy, pitiful, diaper, the incest-born Mongolian man named Junior (alternately touching and terrifying depiction of Stephen Fersta; Flounder in Animal House "), which, of course, is released and causes some damning damage. Skilfully directed by Danny Steinmann, with a uniformly fine play from a strong cast, an incredibly perverted plot, an excellent make-up by Craig Reardon, pleasant mended atmosphere, amazing wildlife culmination of a slow but steady pace, pleasant well drawn characters and surprisingly heartbreaking final freeze-frame (incest story contains unexpectedly strong and sharp blow), the unjustly forgotten psychopath in the early 80's worth checking out.
