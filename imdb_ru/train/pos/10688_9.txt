I really didn’t know what to expect when watching a movie, except for a slightly surreal storyline that a single man orders a Russian bride via the Internet. That was Nicole Kidman. I really liked the film, and I thought: “Wow!”. <br /> <br /> A refreshingly down-to-earth film is beautifully developed, with a few surprises at every corner. The relationship in the film is trustworthy: Nicole and Chaplin work great against each other. The humor is subtle, with some gorgeous “office” scenes in the bank, and the thriller element adds tension without being Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In general, a film about real people in an unusual situation. This is not so much heroism as a subtle relationship. Brit filmmaking at its best ... <br /> <br /> (9/10)
