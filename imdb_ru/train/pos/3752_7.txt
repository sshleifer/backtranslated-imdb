This film is unusual and bizarre, and it is almost unusual and bizarre in a very good way. I give this short 7 only because it is so unique outside the walls, but most of the time it seems that it is fancy only for the sake of being fancy. If the film had managed to combine its more bizarre moments into a kind of plot, it would be really fantastic. <br /> <br /> The main problem here is that the creators simply mixed a bunch of shit about spatulas, and then added another whole bunch of shit that would have sounded like it would sound ridiculous, coming out of the mouth of a scapula. <br /> <br /> This is definitely worth checking out, but this is not the best indicator of any onslaught of creators of wild fantasies.
