Sweet romantic drama / comedy about how Stuart and Sullavan wrote love letters to each other, not knowing who the other is. Naturally, they work together and can not tolerate each other. The rest can be guessed. It is perfectly performed by all the actors (especially Sullavan, Stuart and Frank Morgan), has a witty, smart script and looks absolutely amazing. It takes place in Budapest and was filmed in Hollywood, but I caught myself thinking that I was seeing Budapest! Everything looks so perfect and dreamy. One of a kind movie. Do not miss!
