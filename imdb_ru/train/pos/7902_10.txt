This film is exceptional in its gay iconography and extends it not only to aesthetics, but also to music and actors. Throughout the film, there is a childish miracle, which is visible through the eyes of the main character. Her carefree perception of the world around us is funny and beautiful. In a sense, it is a slacker for girls. See how you enjoy a relaxing entertaining night movie. Buy it if you like different views on the world of media and love combined (?).
