Here I thought that “Nanuk from the North” was the last word in the archaic semi-local “Eskimo” films. How wrong! Being an avid sea kayaker, I did not sleep until 330 in the morning to look at it in the hope of seeing some hand-made "skins". The film did not let me down. Any student involved in kayaking / killing should see here. (Note to SKER colleagues: it seems that they use Norton Sound kayaks with single-bladed blades). <br /> <br /> But the film went far beyond the scope of this seemingly narrow interest. Despite the fact that, as others have noted some fake bits, the film has so much heart that they are just a little annoying. It was (in terms of this very amateur anthropologist) probably the perfect time to make this film. Beginning of the thirties: "radios" are so new that they (including Louis B. Meier!) In fact allow the Inuit to speak their own language. And there was so much more, despite the penetrated melodrama, authenticity. They really beat this polar bear, this whale and those caribou. The fiftieth version of this film would be so funny with “stars”, “Technicolor”, etc. Version of the seventies? Not even. A very good addition to this excellent film is White Shadows in the Southern Seas (1928). Geographically mirrored by the Eskimos, it also deals with the relentless and deep destruction of Western culture / technology by unsuspecting people.
