Riget II is a good sequel, but not as good as the first. This series is not as serious as the first. In this much more comedies, although good. <br /> <br /> We returned to the Danish Riggspitalat, the Danish National Hospital. Mrs. Drusse is going to leave the hospital, as her work is completed, but fate wants everything to be different. Soon, she chases after ghosts, and Helmer drives everyone crazy, and will soon become much worse when black forces are unleashed in the Kingdom. <br /> <br /> This story is much more comedy than the previous one. Of course, a lot of fun, but it makes you take the show a little less seriously. History has retained many items from the last series and added some new ones. It's well written, but some new elements are just stupid, but they save him, making him look more like a comedy. Good story, but not as good, original and exciting as in the first series. <br /> <br /> Actors are the same as in the usual cast. They are all very good. This is a strange story and setting. Some parts are just an ugly show, and the characters change during the show, so keeping it serious and making it real is not an easy job. However, these actors do an excellent job with this whole situation. <br /> <br /> Many of the good qualities from the first series remain intact. Cinematography is one of those qualities. The handheld camera, which made Trier known around the world, gives a series of tension and realism. This gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow characters, and Trier uses these abilities. Good, agile, excellent lighting, good composition and editing make it enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to see a better effect in this sequel than in the first one. Also be ready to see some more. I didn't think this green thing looked too good. I thought it was unoriginal and not suitable. However, ghost-like effects are really good. Non-digital effects also look good. Little brother looks just weird, but you accept it. Everywhere I would say that the effects are from good to good. <br /> <br /> The music is not bad either. Sad and cute. Some of them are really touching. It fits really nicely. As a first, there is quite a bit of music in action scenes, and it works very well. <br /> <br /> All together it gives a good continuation. If you saw Righet, you can see it without disappointment. He has many of the same qualities as the first series. However, I would recommend watching the first episode before seeing this. These two make up a series that you don't want to miss.
