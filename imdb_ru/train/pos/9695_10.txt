Some people may call “Poly” a children's film, but I want to say that this is something more. Perhaps more than anything else, this film goes to great lengths to show the plight of immigrants in the United States — relevant to recent debates. The film tells several stories in which a parrot tells a janitor from Russia (Tony Shalhoub) about how he was looking for his original owners in America. There is an elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) with whom he is friends, then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin) and others. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very well-made film. I usually do not expect much from such films, but this one is a pleasure. I certainly recommend it. Also starring Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Halley Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
