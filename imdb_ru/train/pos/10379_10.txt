“Plato's Run” is an interesting film “b” with Gary Busey. This is a rather unknown film, so I watched it in the trunk of the car, and it seemed to me that it looks funny. I was right. Gary Busey is played by Plato Smith, a hard mercenary who was set up to kill. the powerful Cuban crime lord who is now on the run, Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends, played by Steve Bower (scar) and star fighter Jeff Spixman (expert). what I liked about Plato was that the film never got bored. The plot may have been filmed before, but it was still good that acting was funny and the action was quite funny, especially the culmination of Gary Busey made a good hero ironic. since he usually plays the bad guy, and Steve Bower is good as Plato's bosom friend, even Jeff Spixman makes a good performance, and he can't even play well to finish him, running Plato is a pleasant effort from nude-image movies, and I I give him 7 out of 10
