Just finished watching a movie and wanted to express my own opinion (and justice) to the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, to clarify the situation, this film does not pretend to anything other than the solid action comedy. He is not focused on the revolution in the film industry, does not cause criticism and does not want to be perceived as a whole. If you really want to fully enjoy this film, I suggest you abandon your critical thinking and your desire for a good story, because you will not find anything here. Having established this, let's dive into the movie. <br /> <br /> I didn’t expect this film simply because it didn’t have a strong plot (yes, the audience of the film, I also underestimated this film), but I never expected that I would like this film so much. I even enjoyed it more than Steven Chow's clicks (which I consider Kung Fu Hustle to be his best effort and would also appreciate it 9). The action is delayed and epic, while the comedy is suffocating in the right places. <br /> <br /> Spoilers are vigilant, I think that the action may be unrealistic, but why should I watch a serious basketball film anyway? There are many other sports films (drama) that have already done it well, why create another one? Spoilers end <br /> <br /> I don’t even know why you are reading this. Go and watch it. Just remember, without thinking - just watch, enjoy, smile, laugh and <br /> <br /> From time to time they (the film industry) create masterpieces such as “Pulp Fiction” or “The Godfather”, and sometimes they make movies, which is better in a bunch dump. I'm not saying that Kung Fu Dunk deserves the recognition that previous examples had, and again, if we are talking about Stephen Chow-ish's comedy, this is the top ten. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended if you love: -more frivolous films with really good action -Kung-fu -Death Trance -Kung-fu and comedy -What the hell to watch this. You will have a great time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for you cast of Kung Fu Dunk. ^ _ ^
