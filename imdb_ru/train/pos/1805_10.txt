I just watched this movie, I first saw it when I was 7 years old, and I could almost remember the end. so I watched it about 10 minutes ago, and (it may seem to me that I'm a child, I'm 12 years old), I started crying in the final, I forgot how sad it is. I think that basically I was sad for Anne-Marie because she said, "I love you, Charlie," and also: "I will miss you, Charlie," just made me really cry, haha. It should be one of my favorite movies of all time, it's just a movie that is worth watching. WATCH THIS, haha, that's all I can say XD <br /> <br /> but I like this movie, this is a real classic. <br /> <br /> xx maverick xx 10/10
