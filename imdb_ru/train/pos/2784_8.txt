Nahra is from a conservative Indian family who does not like girls playing football. But our attractive young star CAN play serious football. Rees Myers coaches Nagra and encourages her to perform, while Knightley is a teammate and friend. What should a girl do when her sister's wedding is scheduled for the same day as the football match? In its own way unique in the BFGW, as Nagra tries to transcend traditional family traditions. Here it is the dad (well played by Herm) who can see both sides of the problem. Suspended the whole point of view of hockey with a late sexual preference without a crisis, if they needed a filler, they could have gone elsewhere. A good final summing up.
