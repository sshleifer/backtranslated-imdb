I saw this movie with my father. I must have been quite young, about 15 years old. He was in "Star Movies" one afternoon. The film began a little vague, but you could say that these robbers were going through. It really picked up the pace after the first half hour. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I think this is an ensemble, they just play so well together. I can watch this movie anytime. I think this is a relative stupidity of the plot and characters trying to deal with a very strange account. The jokes are not trivial, but at the same time thin and extreme, which makes them so fun. <br /> <br /> The perfect comedy for a lazy day.
