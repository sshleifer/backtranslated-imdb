I entered the Straight Story, expecting a sad / happy drama with good leadership and good play. I received it. What I did not expect was the allegories of the trials of human existence. Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about a 300-mile ride on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for people. <br /> <br /> If you didnâ€™t notice, look at it again, paying attention to the age of the people Alvin encounters, the terrain through which he passes, the reactions that are given to him, types of discussions (one of the first things about pregnancy and children, one of the last outside the cemetery). The last road he rides is especially haunting in this context, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness increase. The last mechanical failure could be regarded as death, and the miraculous revival of his engine associated with the afterlife, in which he achieves the desired reunion. <br /> <br /> I only hope that some of the people who have branded it as a slow juicy melodrama are not in a hurry to look with more holistic attention.
