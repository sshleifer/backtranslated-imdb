“Running Man” is one of those films that, if you watch it, will become boring and even depressing. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch it once or twice a year with a couple of friends and a few drinks. <br /> In today's atmosphere of domination of television and the capitalist regime in society, this really works as a revisionist social commentary after the boom of the 1980s. Forget about it though! There are other brilliant and more compelling reasons to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger is in great shape, because Ben “Bakersfield Butcher Richards”, and the inclusion of the tie belts of one liner was completely inspired, because the really frivolous (with his rantings on Killian over the camera is the main highlight ). <br /> <br /> The design of the stalkers is genuinely American, and it reflects the characteristics shown on the TV show “Gladiators” on the PC. and WWE also. The terrible end of Buzzopila will cool any spectator to the depths of his soul (as a foot note, why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in that the supposedly cheerful actor with a bitter sense of humor?) <br /> <br /> Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole Thorssen are gorgeous in supporting muscles (and in real life they are Arnie's germs), and there is even Mick Fleetwood in it! What more can you ask for? <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Running Man, if you are looking for a great entertaining game with a grim ending and great characters. Just do not expect from him education (at least, surface value). <br /> <br /> Quality, damn it, I really like it. You too, if you are not a topic. 7/10
