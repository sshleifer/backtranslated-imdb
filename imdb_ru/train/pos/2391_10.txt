My husband and I enjoy The DoodleBops just like our 8-month-old baby. We bought him a DVD and a CD just to watch and listen to them. They are fun, energetic and very entertaining. They encourage children to be active, share and care. They always have a positive message along with fun entertainment. Every time our son hears a song, he quickly turns his head to the TV and starts jumping up and down with excitement. Dee Dee is a wonderful singer, she has a great voice. Mo is a great dancer. I would recommend The DoodleBops to anyone with children. Our favorite song is The Bird Song. You just can not help but smile and want to dance when you hear it.
