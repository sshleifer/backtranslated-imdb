I love this film. When I was a kid, it was one of the first films I saw making me flinch. Of course, now it is soft, but once it was awesome. Dentists are something that many people are so afraid of, so why not make a film about a killer dentist? It's funny, fun, sometimes scary, but awesome. And I always had a love of medical horror. And Corbin Bernsen plays Dr. Feynston well, no one could do it better. And for a low-budget horror movie, effects and things like that are pretty good. And I also like the theme of music, it goes well with the film. Ken Fori (Dawn of the Dead) also plays a curious cop here and does an excellent job with his task. There are a lot of blood and really cool scenes of torture / death. Check this!
