And the film for television was also good. the acting and plot were just great. This is one of the few films that I have ever seen, and I felt a perversion, because when I saw him, I was afraid that the Reaper would come to kill me through the screen of my computer. There were only a few minor mistakes in this film, but it was very easy to see. <br /> <br /> Antonio Sabbato Junior played an excellent role in this film along with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. There is so much waiting in this film, and I wanted more, because I never thought that a low-budget television film could be so powerful. After watching this, I read the novel on which this film was based (four times), and it was also great. If you ever see this movie on TV, I'll watch it. The effects in this film were pretty well done, I honestly donâ€™t know what a living calcining person would look like, but from how the FX team made this film, I was impressed, and all it shows is that all this is badly made for television movies. there with low budgets should not be so bad. <br /> <br /> watch this. This is really good, no, really!
