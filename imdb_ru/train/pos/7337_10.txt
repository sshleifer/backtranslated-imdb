Good story and great animation. The influence of Frazetta and Bakshi is obvious, and that is good. Anyone who loves Conan the Barbarian or the Dungeons and Dragons game should enjoy it. The battle between good and evil is obvious, although sometimes it may seem that our hero is neutral. Most often in science fiction films, elves are usually depicted with white skin and blond hair, while goblins and orcs have dark skin and hair. Anyone who is familiar with the works of Frazetta, Bakshi or even Tolkien knows that they are not racists. Anyone who loves fantasy movies should love this movie. This is not for small children due to violence and sexual hints. Casting was well done, the scenes and music are first class. I hope that someone will soon release this gem on DVD. I consider myself lucky to have a copy of VHS in good condition.
