Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know that she was ridiculed because she played many roles with accents, but every time she nailed an accent. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as depicted here, was not particularly likeable and not so clever. But this only makes the work of the Strip even more remarkable. I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nominations. As for the film, well, there were a couple of interesting things. I donâ€™t know much about Australia, but the theme of religious fanaticism among the general public has played a big role in this story. In many ways, I missed it when I first saw the film several years ago, but yesterday it sounded loud and clear. And it seems that the Australian press has succeeded in persecution and extravagance just like their American counterparts. Pretty good movie. A bit different. Rating: B
