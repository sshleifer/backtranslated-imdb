Imagine what a school would be like in such a world: children are one big gang that has really good musical taste, and they unite against bad directors and teachers. "Rock 'N' Roll High School" takes place in this world. This is how the Ramones record comes to life. All the characters are as stupid, innocent and charming as the Ramones songs, and the music itself is, of course, fantastic. High school comedies have really changed over the years, if you compare the film "American Pie" with the classic film of the late 70s, in which tasteless sexual jokes do not sound at all. Since the remake is obviously in development, you can probably expect that the charm of the original will be lost along the way and will be replaced by vulgar, half-funny jokes about the members, as Bill Hicks called them. However, the main problem will be that the Ramones CANNOT be replaced. They were the perfect band for this film, and no one else even came close to taking their place. So the best thing to do is to leave the original alone, no matter how strange and charming it is. Gabba-Gabba, hey!
