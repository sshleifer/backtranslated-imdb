Despite the fact that its publication in this country was restrained, while in other countries it was an obvious disregard (the “R” rating in the States did not help - honestly, simply because HBC uses the C-word!), In fact, this is a fine part. work. Sentimentality sometimes threatens to strangle her, but she is overcome by the game of two leads. <br /> <br /> It’s easy to win applause just because you are playing with a physical or mental handicap (Daniel Day-Lewis, Jeffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.) And Helena Bonham-Carter may not quite catch physical degradation BDN, but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional attraction completely compensate. In fact, almost all of her performances are held by her eyes (and with what eyes!). This is an intellectual turn from an actress who quickly destroys her reputation as an English Rose and becomes a figure of some height. Awards must necessarily follow, but, alas, not for this wonderful presentation. <br /> <br /> Brana, it seems, never gave his best results in the movie (except, perhaps, "Hamlet", and there his play was diluted with a large cast). Here, however, he leads his other appearances, playing on the verge of a self-loathing, unstable, ultimately nice guy with a subtlety that he didn’t always display, demonstrating both mind and depth. In short, we believe him just as we did not believe him, as Frankenstein, as a priest in the Proposal, a lawyer in the Gingerbread Man, even as Andrew in Peter's Friends. This is definitely his best performance - so why could he not produce goods much earlier? <br /> <br /> Like a film, it looks more like a television offer, and without its stars it probably will not make up very much. But it was very nice to see this pair take off their socks like this, and I look forward to hearing more from them (though not “Love's Labour's Lost” ...). 8 out of 10, but Brana and HBC get 10 out of 10.
