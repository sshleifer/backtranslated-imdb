Rozenshtrasse - a touching story of courage in distress. Reichdoich women believe that their Jewish husbands were locked in anticipation of deportation. Lena Fisher, an aristocratic woman who has renounced her family, finds herself in a crowd, like the sister of General Gudaryan. But the title and privilege do not deserve special attention. <br /> <br /> The Reich Service is also not intended for women prisoners whose husband is on the frontline. In one of the most terrible scenes of the film, the guards take the wedding ring given by her husband and soldier. <br /> <br /> So that you donâ€™t think that this is typical German cruelty, here in America we have Lady Bush imperiously ordering the arrest of the Mothers of the Golden Star (mothers of US soldiers killed in battle) because their very presence is offensive. Unfortunately, in the 60 years from Der Fuher to Der Fembler, little has changed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the eight-year-old daughter Ruth escaped arrest. <br /> <br /> Waiting in the cold on Rosenstrasse Lena At first, Fisher reluctantly perceives Ruth as we usually speak German. Even Lena Fisher's brother, Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach, who knows about the Holocaust and opposes it, warns Lena against this. but Lena prefers to accept this idea with American rebellion, even renaming Ruth, the more Aryan-sounding name of Helga Lehmann. <br /> <br /> The siege ends on Rozenshtrasse, but Lena mourns: what happened to Ruth after the war? Years later, Ruth's daughter, Hannah, goes in search of her mother's past and meets 90-year-old Lena under the guise of writing a personal history of the war. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me interesting that Hannah wanted so badly to look for the family, but never checked the fate of her grandfather, who, as you know, served on the Ostfront.
