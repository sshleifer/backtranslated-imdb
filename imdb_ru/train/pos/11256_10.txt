Without a doubt, the best of John Le Carré’s novels, exquisitely turned into a classic film. The speeches of Peter Egan (Magnus Pim, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weygang (Axel, real name of Alexander Hempel, the controller of Czech intelligence Magnus), Ray Macanally (the fraudster Magnus) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus mentor) Believer and British controller , along with the other characters, are so perfect and natural that the person responsible for their use should have been awarded a prize. Even small details, such as Major Membury, are made to perfection. This suggests the strength of the performance and the strength of the heroes of the novel, that, despite Magnus’s duplicity, one cannot help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to the Jack Brotherhood and slimy Grant Lederer from American intelligence. I read the book at least a dozen times, and I watched the movie almost as many times, and both are hypnotized. If I had one book on a desert island, “The Perfect Spy” would be a choice above all others.
