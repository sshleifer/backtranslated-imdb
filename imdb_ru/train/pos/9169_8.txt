I really liked Timothy Dalton, although he was a little young and too handsome for Mr. R., but I thought that Zela Clark was too plump and short. This version, however, was very faithful to the novel and very well filmed. I saw 4 versions, Orson Welles is still my favorite Mr. R., although George Scott did very well, and it was a struggle between Joan Fontaine and Sassana York, although both were too old for this role. I recently saw a brilliant TV version of Rebecca with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I would really like these two to perform Jane Eyre. By the time I looked at the Ciarin Hinds version, I think I was Jane Arad, but I would never get tired of those first few minutes when Joan Fontaine’s voice tells the beginning of the first version I’ve ever seen. I always want to go back and read the book again.
