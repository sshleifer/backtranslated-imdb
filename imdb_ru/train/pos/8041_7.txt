Despite some of the negative comments that this film received on the IMDb pages, itâ€™s still worth seeing, as this is a story about survival and a camaraderie between two different people with a different mentality during a difficult mission in the Panama jungle. <br /> <br /> Peruvian director Luis Llosa takes us along to watch this thriller in Panama. There are some good moments in the film when Beckett, a veteran of the Marine Corps, shoots a newcomer who was recently sent to try to destroy the infamous head of the drug cartel and the corrupt army general who could become the country's next president. The only problem, Miller, has no experience in achieving what was assigned to him. <br /> <br /> Miller, the arrogant newcomer to the jungle and the guerrilla war between the military and the drug lords against penetrated American intelligence officers learn a valuable lesson from Beckett. What looks good in theory doesn't matter in the jungle. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger, an actor who records little, as he proves in this film, but in the context of the film he is just like a man of a few words. Billy Zane, who plays Miller, does what he can with a role that does not give him fame to a decisive end. <br /> <br /> For action movie lovers, the Sniper offers 112 minutes of action that, with a little trimming, would make the film more satisfactory.
