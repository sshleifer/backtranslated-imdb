16 years have passed since its initial launch, I would hope that some “marketing master” will already promote the version of this classic live or at least try to reprint the original 65 episodes. I can not understand why the science fiction or cartoon network did not understand this. In fact, the Galaxy Rangers had well thought out plots and even the best scenarios. For its time, the animation was above average quality and excellent compared to modern Japanese animation in the form of a slide show. It preceded the heavy toy tie on the market, it might have sealed that it was also doom. I would gladly spend the money on a GR DVD, if there is one.
