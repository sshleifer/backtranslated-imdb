This movie is great. Simply. It is rare to find a comedy with levels, and this is a damn good example of this. When I first watched this film, when I believed it, my friend and I looked at each other and asked: â€œDid you just understand that? For those who doubt, look at the levels. Look at the comparison between Vic and the people in the club, DNA! Look at the different characters, each fighting for a position, and if you do not see anything else, look at the connection between the cure for Vic and the way through the film. It's all in Vika's head! The first line about the world of Vick. The final scene with a camera heading to Vika, and inside, the whole universe! Carefully quoted, wonderful cartoon gangster, handsome, handsome, handsome!
