My friend and I, Annette, watched it together and we will comment on both of them. <br /> <br /> Both of us really enjoyed watching this, although with the work of Dicken it took a bit of freedom. Dicken's many works are somewhat gloomy and dull (including Oliver Twist), but this film changed all that. It was fun, colorful (both visually and musically), and the characters were more carefree. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: Usually I don’t care about music and dance films, but the melodies in this performance. were catchy and lively, and the choreography was awesome. <br /> <br /> ANNTTE: It really speaks about Travis. I can not emphasize how good dance numbers. For example, you can say that these guys really worked hard, bringing the routine to perfection. <br /> <br /> TREVIS: Three actors really stood out from IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed) and Sly Dodger (Jack Wilde). Dude, this Oliver Reed can really be a good villain. That scene where you see his eyes through the mailbox made me chill behind my back ... AMAZING. And this guy Jack Wilde was the perfect sly cunning. And Nancy was fantastic (dude, I was bad when she was killed). She can sing too! Kudos to the casting department of their choice there. I hated Oliver Twist's baby. He was too whiny and weak for my taste. (I continued to wish Bill Sykes toss him in the mud during the chase scene.) And they should not have made him sing. <br /> <br /> ANNTTE: The acting was really great. In addition to the tremises mentioned by Travis, I felt that Ron Moody (Fagin) did a great job. He was so funny and at the same time slightly sinister. Supporting actors were great too. Harry Secombe did very well with his role as Mr. Bumble. And he has a beautiful singing voice. I saw Mr. Secombe perform in another film called “Davy”, where he played an opera singer with pleasant results. The talented Harry Secombe was supposed to be shot in a lot more movies. <br /> <br /> TREVIS: As I mentioned earlier, the story is not entirely true to the book, but IMO was more convincing. This film was also not boring, like some musicals. And continuity made you move along with the characters. Melodies do not distract from the plot and do not put to sleep too long. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Any musical film that Travis watches in full should be a rare find. And this is really a rare find. This is a very easy to see product that delivers the viewer smoothly and pleasantly to the end. On the day when all the films seemed to be effects combined with pretty faces, it was a refreshing interlude. <br /> <br /> Our overall rating for this was 8.5 out of 10. (We will round up to 9 in this case.). <br /> <br /> TREVIS: I rated this figure as 7, mainly because Oliver Twist's child (Mark L.) irritated me, and his songs were torture for my too sensitive ears. Otherwise, it was an outstanding film. <br /> <br /> Annette: My rating is 10. Movies are not much better than this. And you can say that everyone who participated in this performance really worked hard to make it what it was ... a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Please don’t miss this one ... even if you usually don’t like musicals. This is really a rare treat.
