The 8 simple rules for meeting my teenage daughter were a good start. The talented Tom Shadyak was involved in this project. This meant that the comedy would be no less exciting, and this is exactly what happened: the show remains one of the most fresh, funny, witty shows created in a very long time. Every line, facial expression, choice of actors, the scene - everything is impeccable. There was not a single episode, after which I thought: "The man who was not as good as the others." Everyone was outstanding. Again, this is the type of perfectionism that we used to expect from Tom. For those who don't know, Tom Shadyak is directed by Ace Ventura (the first film), Nutty Professor (the first one) and Liar Liar. Quite a summary. He is a producer here, not a director, but his magic touch is felt in every episode. The family consists of: <br /> <br /> Father: Paul Hennessy (John Ritter): cute, slightly neurotic, can be frivolous from time to time works as a sports writer. Unfortunately, John passed away in 2003, leaving pleasant memories in his memory and almost certainly contemplating cancellation. <br /> <br /> Mother: Kate (Katie Sagal): Come on, who didn't fall in love with Katie when she played Peg married to children? Al Bundy was our hero. We, the audience, gave him the respect and love that he never had. But without the careless, parasitic, lazy lifestyle, Peg Al would probably have been just another Chicago father, and not a mess that Peg (in fact, life) made him be. At that time, Katie was a mommy and still remains a brunette (instead of red) and as lush as before. Kate is a conservative mom and loving wife. I know it sounds boring, but comedy it fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> Ditzy Blonde Daughter: Bridget (perfectly played by Kaley Cuoco): the idiot almost never played so well. In addition to Goba on the Arrested Development, Bridget may well be a fake for any awards of this archetype. Bridget is shallow, self-centered, not very bright and a bit slutty in her eyes. She plays the stupid role of a blonde better than anyone else. Perfection. One of the highlights of the show. <br /> <br /> “Missing geeky daughter”: Kerry (Amy Davidson): a girl and a geek, she does not receive any love from life or circumstances. Feels missed, undervalued and ignored most of the time. She is Bridget's younger sister (in fact, she is older than her), and completely opposite personalities and brains cause endless clashes, much of our entertainment. <br /> <br /> Son: Rory (Martin Spangers): was the second IMO's most funny character before Ritter dies, then John passes, new characters come, and Rory is not the sage who is used to the verbal perversions he used to: this was mainly about the character of David Spade. <br /> <br /> These characters were the main ones in the time of John Ritter. Unfortunately, the extremely funny Larry Miller (one of my favorites) did not get a lot of screen time. He played a colleague / rival Paul. After the aortic dissection cost Ritter his life in 2003 (September 11), the show was on hiatus for a while. Nobody thought that this could come back, but later, with a couple of new additions. The second stage of the show began, and the new characters were: <br /> <br /> A strict, confident school principal: Ed (Adam Arkin): I saw Adam here and there on a talk show. It was the first time I saw him do something. Impressed, this word I use. His performance was very impressive. It is sad that he was not brought before. He also plays Kate's potential love after Paul passes. The gradual progress in this direction (which would sound crazy at first) brings a lot of praise to the authors. It was done slowly, neatly and perfectly, with constant respect for Paul (Ritter). <br /> <br /> Grandpa Relationship: Jim Egan (James Garner): an unexpectedly long-awaited addition to the series, he was a cannon fodder for endless "old" jokes, mostly ... <br /> <br /> 35- mom's summer unemployed stepbrother: CJ (played to insanely ridiculous heights by David Spade): I knew that Spade was funny, I just did not know that he was SO funny. Somehow, Spade’s very familiar presence is felt inside his character (as opposed to an individual character), which is understandable, since he is a comedian and plays in a comedy show. This eerie feeling is like someone borrowing a lot of material from David Spade’s speeches in films, talk shows and features (award shows, etc.), and demonstrates the excellent impersonation of Spade’s comedy voice, except that is IS Spade. By that, I mean that you understand that he is not trying to play someone else or a completely new character: he is a stupid, funny Spade, whom we have learned, and he accepts this pleasant humorous formula to the absolute top. Every line he uttered, every sarcasm that he produced, literally all classics. Spade was insanely ridiculous; so SO funny. <br /> <br /> The humor and drama of the series were raised after his return, but viewers thought: “John is gone, this will not be the case.” This is understandable, given that we are talking about a group of people (American viewers) who gave "Yes, dear" a free trip, but forced Andy Richter to "Control the Universe" to cancel immediately. As the quality of the show improved, its ratings declined. Soon this was no longer, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> And I saved the best for the last: Married With Children fans are waiting for pleasure. And boy, what was the pleasure. I'm still trembling, just remembering it. This is a surprise, so good that it would be crazy for me to spoil it, even if I legally do it under the pretext of "spoiler ...". Suffice to say that this is something that you will never forget. I know that I will not :-)
