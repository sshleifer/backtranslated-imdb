This short film trailer is mainly about how Superman and Batman work together and form an uneasy alliance. Obviously, these two characters have completely different views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes a punishment. It's very funny to see how these two iconic characters try. I won't go into the storyline. But I'll get into acting, which is awesome. All well played. Two actors playing Superman and Batman are well suited to their characters. The same directors who made Batman: Dead End, and Grayson also made this short film. Of the three, I probably liked this least, but I still thought it was well done. For me, the best in the world is 7/10
