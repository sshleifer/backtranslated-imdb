This movie scared me to death when I was a kid. This is not “Citizen Kane,” but he has his moments. The hand breaking scene is good. The plot is good, even if the characters are not there - maybe somehow connected with the acting. Put some famous people in the role, and then see what you get. It was one of those who shot, edited (which was not enough) and distributed for several months films like. This is a classic low-budget sci-fi project that deserves to be done. I rated it based on 9 other films of this genre and age.
