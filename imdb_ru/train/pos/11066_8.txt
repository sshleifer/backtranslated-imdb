For a long time, it seemed that all the good Canadian actors headed south of the border, and (as I guessed) all of the second in rank filled the top slots, and this left trash for sex comedies. <br /> <br /> This film was a real surprise: despite the outlandish scenes typical of farce, the actors seemed to be trying to bring something in their characters, and what we, the audience, returned, was almost a real suspension faith. When the extras from the music video attacked the evicting police, you almost believed it was possible. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of some of the best sex farces (Canadian or not), you should definitely look for this one. of. And a big surprise, this sexy farce is also loaded with very good nudity.
