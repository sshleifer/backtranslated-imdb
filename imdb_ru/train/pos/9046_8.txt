I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) for the first time, and since then I have watched all of his films that appear on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he even looks a bit like Owen), which just oozes from the screen. I am sure that if he gets some meaty roles, he will once split the Oscar ... <br /> <br /> This is not a slander of this film. <br /> <br /> This is a good story, with very believable people (well, is it based on the author’s early machinations of rockets), an excellent cast? Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always on my watch list ?? with the right mix of humor, pathos, excitement ... and a great soundtrack with so many rock'n'roll oldies to make them tap with their feet. <br /> <br /> But this film had a special meaning for me in 1957. I was the same age as Homer Hickham; Like him, I looked at the night stars to watch as the satellite swept through the darkness; like Homer, I experimented with rocket technology in my backyard and even used the same chemicals for fuel; and, like Homer, most of my attempts ended in an explosive disaster! How fun it was ... <br /> <br /> Although I didn’t reach his big (metaphorical and physical) heights. But here's what you learn when you see this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is the main family movie, but it seems that today it is a dying breed. Take the time to see it with your children: you all will have a lot of good laughter.
