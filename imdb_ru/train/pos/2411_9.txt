This film strikes me as one of the most successful attempts to find plausible answers to some of the current questions that have arisen in the recent science of Passion (the suffering and death of Christ) in the New Testament. (What motivated Judas if money was not a problem? What could have caused the Sanhedrin to meet on a high holy day? Why did Pilate shake?) . As for me, I find the portrait painted here - the willingness of ordinary people to so easily donate general decency, when their own interest is at stake - much more realistic and deeply disturbing. (The selfless expression “just doing my job” on the face of a man who drives the first nail into Christ’s wrist is as scary as any other moment in the film.) The film does not claim to be “authentic,” but the settings and costume invariably feel more “Correct” than many more highly valued efforts. This is a slow film, but if you accept its voluntary limits (after all, it is “Death”, not “Life” - “Christ”), in the end it’s very useful.
