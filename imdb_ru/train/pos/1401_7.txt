Well, we have extremely cruel violence against the Supreme (although not as extreme as other Verkhoven's films), we have plenty of sex and naked bodies, but something is missing ... Oh, yes, he lacks information known Paul Verhoeven in his science fiction films. I admire how Verhoeven presents the characters and how they feel humor, but unlike most Verhoeven films, the film itself lacks humor to get into a comedy genre. Acting was above average compared to most slash films. <br /> <br /> What makes “A Hollow Man” a good film is not a story, not the cast or characters, but amazing special effects that would otherwise make the film as impossible. The crew really made a stealth man, without using things like a floating hat, hanging from the wires of the piano, and other practical effects (effects made on the set). The most awesome effects scenes are not visible when Kevin Bacon is invisible, they appear when Kevin Bacon becomes invisible and visible. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this story about an invisible person deserves more imagination. Here it occurs in the lab for the most part. I would love to see the invisible Kevin Bacon rob a bank and get away with it, or, say, steal something from people's bags or something. But what has been shown is decent enough to make the Hollow Man a fascinating film. Rating: B
