The ideal son is a story about two 30-year-old brothers, one of whom seems to be “perfect”, and the other, in fact, screwed up, often finding himself in drug rehabilitation centers. After the death of their father, these two gathered together after a long absence and the usual rivalry between brothers and sisters emerges. Only when the “ideal” brother makes a startling discovery that he has AIDS, an irresponsible younger brother, finally, makes a step to bring order to his life and take some responsibility. <br /> <br /> The film does a good job of chronicling the “return” of the younger brother, although sometimes this may seem a bit far-fetched (it is never that easy to defeat drug addiction). What makes the film more gentle is the treatment of AIDS, a topic that has become somewhat outdated in the cinema in the last 5-10 years. And also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two former warring brothers is very plausible and well done. Both main actors were both very competent, if not terribly charismatic. <br /> <br /> Initial work with director and writer Leonard Farlinger, whose own brother died of AIDS. The ending is also well done. <br /> <br />
