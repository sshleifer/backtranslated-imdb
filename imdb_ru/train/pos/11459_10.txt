On the one hand, this film can reveal a child in us who just wants to build sand castles and toss something into the air, just to see how it falls again. On a deeper level, it explores a deep desire to reconnect with the earth. I fully sympathized with the artist when he said: "When I am not here (alone) for a while, I feel without roots." <br /> <br /> I considered Andy Goldsworthy to be one of the great contemporary artists, I am familiar with his works mainly from his coffee tables and pairs of installations in an art gallery. But to see his work in motion, captured perfectly through the lens of Riedelsheimer, was a revelation. Unfrozen in time, the works of Goldsworth come alive, spinning, flying, dissolving, crumbling, falling. <br /> <br /> And this is exactly what he does: time. The process of creation and destruction. Appearances and disappearances. Exit from the Void and the formation of the Universe and back. It has shamanic qualities bordering on madness. You have a feeling that you are watching him at work, that his art is a life force for him, that if he does not do this, he will die somewhere. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for us, Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography. Otherwise, with the exception of a few cairns and walls, they would exist only for one person.
