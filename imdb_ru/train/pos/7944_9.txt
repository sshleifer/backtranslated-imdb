Have you ever or do you have a pet that was with you through fat and thin, without whom you would lose, and who do you love, no matter what? Betcha never thought they treated you the same way! <br /> <br /> A wonderful, wonderful family film. If you have a weak spot for animals, it is guaranteed to make you cry regardless of your age. I used to watch this movie all the time when I was small, and I found out that now, at sixteen, I love it as much as I did then. I could never choose a favorite character then, and I still don’t think I can! I love all three animals. The dialogue seems very real and convenient, like a loving, but hostile family. I really love Chance, and how in the end he says that he finally has a family. Yes, of course, but we must remember that this is a family film, and it copes well with this role. Sassy has only an ideal dose of “audacity”, and Shadow is the ideal leader / role model for a young, adventurous Chance. <br /> <br /> Animals overshadow people, but, of course, most of the lacrimal moments occur during interaction with them (ie, Molly’s salvation, and the end). Not to mention the incredible soundtrack, which gives every moment even more emotion, and the accompanying swelling of the heart. I give it 9/10. Compare (and even evaluate better than) Cats, Dogs and Babes.
