Not every film should stimulate you superficially. I will accept an ambitious setback due to a massive hit on any given day. Although it really cannot be called a failure, the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. This paranormal quality makes me watch over and over again. This is a complex, provocative film, in which there is nothing difficult. The problem with the film is its structure. It seems that his impenetrable plot ends, as well as the second end. Although everything is technically dazzling, the film is by no means too long. The extreme delay in Leoâ€™s wake comes 20 minutes late. <br /> <br /> Excellent cinematography is often achieved through a decent script, but here the innovative shooting technique offers a lot of visual ideas. Composite fiction is provocative and attractive; The character is projected in the opposite direction, but his own hand in the foreground is not. The pictured world is deliberate, cunning and absurd. Watch for the unforgettable, technically amazing murder, from which your jaw will fall. <br /> <br /> The compositions are awesome. Whoever decided to release (out of print) a video tape in the format of pan and scan, he never saw it. Where is the DVD? <br /> <br /> It is impossible to imagine how someone can give such originality a bad review. You should see it at least once. You feel that von Trier has bitten off more than he could chew, but in the end this film turned out to be even richer. I suspect that he is familiar with Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent, in which insidious Europeans also manipulate American deception and several Wells films that bring insane joy in technology just like him. All von Trier films explore the plight of the naive among inexorable societies. After Zentropa, von Trier departed from this type of audacious technical experiment to a dull, overvalued, non-nuanced juice, like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.
