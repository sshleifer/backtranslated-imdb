Much like the comic duet of its name, "The Sunshine Boys" became a forgotten classic more than 30 years later. This is hardly mentioned along with other great comedies of the 1970s. It does not make sense, given the special feature of this film, perhaps the best Neal Simon ever written. <br /> <br /> Walter Mattau plays Willie Clarke, once half of the legendary vaudeville comedy known as Lewis and Clark, now a bitter 73-year-old solo actor who can't get a job in advertising potato chips. His nephew and agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) is confident that he can get a job if Willy agrees to reunite only with his estranged partner Al Lewis (George Burns) to celebrate the nostalgia of show business on ABC-TV. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is what the Sunshine Boys have been doing for it in peaks, from the very beginning, when a series of videos from the 1920s, featuring various artists from ancient times, flashes before us to the accompaniment of "Be A Clown "Cole Porter. Then there is the modern setting of the film in Manhattan, where there are a lot of flared trousers and wide polyester ties. Periods clash in Willy's glorious mess in an apartment in Manhattan, where framed photographs and caricatures of celebrities who have long since died look down from the walls at the grim tabloid headlines and empty Zabari grocery bags. If you were alive in the 1970s, like me, you could even feel yourself in that apartment. <br /> <br /> Willy apparently lived there for too long. He sleeps in front of the TV when the kettle boils in another room. Willie wakes up and picks up the phone. <br /> <br /> "Hi, who is this?" Pause "Never mind, this is tea." <br /> <br /> Old people living alone may be a sad material for almost everyone, but Simon’s dexterous mind and unmistakable sense of character make this adaptation of his 1972 stage hit a comedy of gold. The amazing thing about “The Sunshine Boys” is how much he loses his nose in the almost existential state of Willie, without turning you off at all. “He’s 89 years old, and this is how he dies from nothing,” says Willie about an old friend writing songs before deciding that a man probably died from writing a song that “lady” rhymed with “child ". <br /> <br /> Burns won an Oscar for his restrained performance as a gentle but awkward Lewis, but it’s Mattau who brings this house, his makeup and his proud but torn character really sells you the idea that he was already 73 years when he did it. Willy is supremely disgusting, he deserves a description of Ben "crazy old man", but you support him everywhere, enjoying his small victories, even if they come at the cost of the patience of others. His lines kill you, especially when he tries to kill Lewis, for whom reuniting television is a bad idea. <br /> <br /> "You do not know!" Willie tells Lewis once. “I am still in demand. I'm still hot! ”<br /> <br />“ If this room were on fire, you wouldn't be hot, ”replies Lewis. <br /> <br /> Director Herbert Ross shoots everything very casually and carelessly, with low light and medium-range shots even in emotional moments, to leave room for comedy and general Zen messages about the grace of the film thanks to its quiet acceptance. You never get the feeling that you are watching a movie, one of the many spells of The Sunshine Boys, and the direction of Ross, like the action of the three main characters, is of great importance for achieving this goal. <br /> <br /> Comedy is tough, especially when people look at how life passes by them, but “Sunny Boys” make it all seem like pleasure, because for us it’s like that.
