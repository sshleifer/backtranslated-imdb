Fine story with lots of great shots. Dream catchers here are three women from D.R.A.M. team. And, to a lesser extent, the guy accompanying them. Traci Lords convincingly plays the female half of an evil business couple intending to poison the world with anthrax. The original in this film is a bra-bomb, put on a captured member of the team D.R.E.A.M. Of course, an accomplice saves her three seconds before the explosion. Although this climax always works well, although it is clearly taken from the Goldfinger by James Bond and “You only live twice.” In general, a good watch, James Bond replaced here with three Angels Charlie.
