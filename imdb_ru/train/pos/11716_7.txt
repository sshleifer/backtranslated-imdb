Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvira as a TV presenter for nightly horror films, and when the character turned out to be unexpectedly popular, she suddenly found herself doing everything from beer advertising to commercials on “Evening Show” with Johnny Carson. She reached the peak of her popularity in the late 1980s, and the result was the film "ELVIRA, ART OF DARKNESS." <br /> <br /> The plot is lightweight. Television horrible movie hostess Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her great-aunt dies, she travels to New England in the hope that the estate will give enough money to support the stage show; she is disappointed that she has inherited a worn house, a poodle and an old book. It happens that a Puritan city is beyond description, and it causes righteous indignation wherever it goes. It also happens that her great uncle is secretly an evil sorcerer and is very determined to lay hands on the "old book." Add a few teens, a diced bun and a hated woman with fakes, and that’s it. <br /> <br /> No one will accuse him of being a cinematic masterpiece, and he really draws from time to time. But Cassandra Peterson demonstrates a terrific talent from beginning to end: sneaky, sexy and mixing low-humor with flashes of sharp comedy, she dances in the film like a ring master, in a circus banal and often self-satisfied jokes. From the disaster of FLASHDANCE to the madness of witchcraft, it is no less than wildly entertaining. This is a huge amount of fun, and the conclusion of the film can even cause considerable uncertainty. Will Elvira be better than her evil uncle and save the day? Well, I do not want to give anything, so let's just say that you will be very interested to know about it. <br /> <br /> The quality of the DVD is fine, and the bonus material does little, but if you are tuned in to something stupid, it will definitely respond to your desire. And if you have never seen swirling, you will find a treat. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
