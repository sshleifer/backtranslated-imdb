Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE, is basically an effective chiller with an exciting story based on the myths of the aborigines. Richard Chamberlain is a good advocate, whose life is becoming more and more inevitable from reality when he goes deeper into the murder case, which involves Aboriginal tribal rivalry. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does everything he can to guide Chamberlin through the realm of Dreamtime, an alternate reality / timeline that is central to Australian history and tribal traditions. Heavy in the atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in the plot, the film unfolds to an alarming finale, which is somewhat reduced due to bad effects, probably due to budgetary constraints. Nevertheless, the intriguing film, whose general impression of mystery and fear lies beneath the surface of what we perceive as “reality,” will remain with you.
