I have to say that when “Pushing Daisies” came out, I was immediately overwhelmed by a fairy tale similar to such gloom. The narrator made the cake out of this whole trial, making death seem as routine as baking Ned's (Pace's) cakes. And that bringing them back to life was just as usual. <br /> <br /> The trio of Ned, Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) and Charlotte "Chuck" Charles (Anna Friel), and also sometimes partner Olive Snook (Christine) Chenoweth, who made the Wicked musical such admiration), made for some fantastic dialogue and stupidity. It definitely deserves the name of a (romantic) comedy / drama. <br /> <br /> Ned and Chuck are created for a shy and not quite ready-to-love couple who are still exploring their feelings, even if they can't. Touch is an obstacle that does not seem to interfere with aids such as gloves, cellophane and fancy graphics in the apartment. But, despite the awkwardness presented when they develop their feelings around a strange secret, which only a few know, they still manage to show their chemistry on the screen in touching scenes, for example, when Ned gives Chuck hives. The presence of Olive, however, makes some breakthroughs in the song in the pie shop and unforeseen complications for the couple. <br /> <br /> The second season fell sharply, suppressing a show that had real potential. In some episodes, the storyline was hastily and awkward, forcing you to ask “what just happened?” Both in the general plot “The Dead Man of the Week” and in the main plot line. Adding Father Chuck and two stepbrothers to Ned did not help, and at least one of the plot lines was almost reworked (did the episode "Comfortable Food" not look like the episode "Bitter Sweets" in that the dead man of the week died in food ?) There were several touching moments (hives) that helped push the relationship between Chuck and Ned, but each time they approached, the writers decided to add another wrench, rather than allow the development of the relationship (Oliver returns from the monastery, Chuck dead father returns to life and n back, you get the picture). <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it didn’t work, but the concept was good and seemed surrealistic in a good way, enough there is a nice color / cheerful smiley and incredible scenarios reminding you that this isn’t "Dead Like Me" . On the other hand, according to the creator of Brian Fuller, now it’s time to push, so this makes it believable again. <br /> <br /> It should have lasted longer, but at the moment it’s just a thoughtful thinking. Kudos to any new show is trying to replace this short-lived gem.
