When I started watching Fay Grim, I had no idea that this was a continuation of Henry the Fool. Now, the latter was not a film that I presented as a sequel. But one has arrived, and that is pretty good. I assume you saw the original, so I will not explain it. This one begins with the fact that Fay (Parker Posey) lives with her son, whom she had with the ruthless Henry (Thomas J. Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniac) is still in prison. One day, a son gets dismissed for bringing a pornographic toy to school. But this is no ordinary toy. He keeps a secret that explains a lot of what happened in the first movie. And this secret delves deeper into geopolitics than "Siriana". <br /> <br /> I have to say that I am very impressed with what Hal Hartley did here. Perhaps this does not quite match the quality of the original, but, of course, looks good at what is happening in the world. And the end leaves room for another continuation. <br /> <br /> Also with Jeff Goldblum in the lead role.
