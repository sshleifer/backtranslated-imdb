if you are like me, you will love this wonderful film about coming of age. I think heâ€™s upstairs with a prank / love book / US high school / cry / calendar girl / crybaby / with all the great movies made in the last 50 years in the early 60s, and he has a great soundtrack. Not so many songs, as in some films of this type, but still great. Sometimes it is very funny and causes a great love interest. All the young actors are great. It was another type of great movie. My favorite movie of all time returns to the future when Marty McFly returns to 1955. In these wonderful films, he stays in the amazing 50s (early 60s), there are some films of this type better than this but not many.
