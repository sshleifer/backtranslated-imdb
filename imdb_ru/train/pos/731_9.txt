This movie is sooo funny !!! The game is wonderful, the Ramones are sexy, the jokes are subtle, and the plot is what every high school student wants to do in his school. I really liked the soundtrack, as well as carefully verified cynicism. If you like Monty Python, you will love this movie. This film is a bit of a "fat" esque (without all annoying songs). The songs that are sung are pleasant; You can even sing these songs as soon as the movie ends. This musical takes the second place in musicals for me (second place after blues brothers). But please do not think of it as a musical; seeing how the songs are so pleasant, itâ€™s hard to say what happens is a carefully set scene. I think of this film as a comedy with hints of romance. You will be reminded of what it means to be a rebellious teenager; Needless to say, you will remember your old school years after watching this movie. Strongly recommended for both the family (since it is very young, but also for adults, since there are a lot of jokes that are funnier with age and experience.
