As a collector of memorabilia in the movies, I had to buy a poster for this film, and now, when I finally saw it, it must be the best in it. There is nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than an image of a melting person measuring 27x41 inches. However, there is nothing more terrible about your VCR than the hour and a half image of a melting person. At first I thought that this film was pure rubbish, but then I realized that there were some qualities in it that made me laugh. Dr. Ted Nelsonâ€™s character must be the most reckless person ever to appear on the big screen. His dialogue is so banal that it is unbelievable! ("This is unbelievable! It seems to be getting stronger when it melts!") How does it completely melt, and what exactly is the Plan to "help" him? If this film was supposed to scare his audience, I think he missed his calling.
