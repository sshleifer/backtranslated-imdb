The raw wildness of the wild island will scare the hell out of you! Believe me. <br /> <br /> When a boy from an alienated wild family encounters curious tourists, Pa Savage wants revenge, and he will stop at nothing. <br /> This is a real horror movie with truly wonderful horrible moments. <br /> <br /> In addition, negative feedback clearly comes from someone who lacks knowledge about the film. The filmmakers chose lighting and cinematography to reflect the dark, gloomy and inhospitable mood of the story; in other words, to get a certain aesthetic. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film won several awards at the horror film festival.
