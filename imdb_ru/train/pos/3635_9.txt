This is a great Disney flick.it - ​​the story of an aging high school baseball coach (Dennis Quaid) who was once on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher, but was injured at the end of his career. But through a series of events, Jimmy Morris (Quaid) tries his hand at a major league team and even makes a list. This is a great family movie. He is inspirational, but not too loud. It is fun and interesting. Adults will love this movie as much as kids.it is based on a true story, although I am sure that the filmmakers took the liberty to tell this story. Quaid sensational as the main character, very convincing. if you are looking for a movie for the whole family you can enjoy, look no further. 9/10
