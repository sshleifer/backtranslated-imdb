Tintin was one of my favorite heroes in childhood. I used to take books in the school library at every opportunity. My favorite was the “Sharks of the Red Sea” - so much action and humor. <br /> <br /> This documentary was a brilliant exposition of the story about Herge and his development of Tintin. The personal experience of the director in an interview with Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist, who inspired Chan's character, was very exciting. <br /> <br /> An excellent documentary about a very talented and beloved artist. , A great example of one who has become world famous and brought joy to millions of children (and young hearts) around the world.
