Good fighter, but nothing new. This happened high in the mountains, which showed some beautiful landscapes and the like. One person takes a group of mercenaries, the lead flies, and he kicks ass. It could be called "Rambo goes to the Rocky Mountains", it was the same piece. He had one very effective scene right in the first movie that made me cringe in horror. Not a bad picture, but just as old, as old.
