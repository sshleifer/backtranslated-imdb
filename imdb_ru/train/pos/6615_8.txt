I am glad that I can say about the film with Karas and the sisters of the Tasuyevs “Revival” almost only positive moments. <br /> <br /> And, first, it looks like it should look like; boys adventure, RENAISSANCE - a story about the investigation of a policeman in search of the missing young scientist ?? Ilona Tasueva, a geneticist and researcher at Avalon. <br /> <br /> The tale of Karas, Ilona and Bislan, although much less well known than Sin City, is the best film and more appreciated by connoisseurs. For fans of French comics, this will be even more significant (last week I replenished my collection of French comics, although I’m not very up to date). The atmosphere, the music, the characters, their lines, the plot - all this is cute and sweet. The highest policeman from Paris, Karas, demonstrates a young woman who was a rising star of medical genetic research, Ilona Tasueva, a slightly hot blonde, whose rebellious sister Bislan was erotically preferable, I think. <br /> <br /> For me, an old fan of comics and TV series, RENAISSANCE, an amazingly beautiful cartoon, was like a repetition of the episode "WILD WILD WEST", here the mythological past is replaced by the same mythological future, more exhausted and bliss, but in some sense as exciting. RENAISSANCE does not cause concern; and it does not look particularly good; but it is seductive and hypnotic. Moreover, he makes sketches, albeit briefly, of peace, true peace - and we will think about Avalon, Nakat, Jonas Muller, the Tasuev and Goran sisters, Farfell and Karas, telling about his distant childhood in Kasbah. I liked the feelings of RENAISSANCE, a certain softness, friendliness and adventurousness, as well as a professional, confident look; Among these new cartoons, this and the adaptation of Dick Linklater (- the only and the first in the history of adaptation of Dick -) stood out for me as a work of beauty and genuine excitement. <br /> <br /> I thought that the futuristic devices were appropriate and, if not accepted, brightly creepy (for example, invisible costumes). <br /> <br /> Characters have exotic names such as Bislan and Farfell, mostly collected in the world of art and entertainment (Goran and Ilona). and Naguib ??). <br /> <br /> No one seems to have noticed that the RENAISSANCE poster shows Rourke, similar to this guy — Marv; who does not make it a SIN CITY plagiarism, but not a model of originality, and in fact there are more similarities with Miller’s tale, namely the grim futuristic look of a decayed society, a brio hero (in fact, the cross of Willis’s character and Rourke’s character in the previous film ), on the other hand, this cartoon breathes more public air full of adventure, and, in a word, it looks like a SIN CITY for children, well, I mean, more disobedient children, because it shows a little nudity. What I said could be argued that the features mentioned are characteristic, even though the clichés and common places look in futuristic, more adult comic books; This is true, and it was old Miller, who showed these things on the screen, and RENAISSANCE has some similarities here and there. Now it is also fair that each RING should have its own ERAHORN, so for each city of sins it has its own revival. I admit that I was rather partial to these gloomy futuristic stories, rather undemanding specialties.
