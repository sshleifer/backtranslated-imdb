While watching the film, I was in a very light mood, and also this film is light, but the end of the film is just unexpected, which leaves long memories in mind. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Abhay and his profession to be a witness during marriage registration. Soha comes to the wedding, and his boyfriend doesnâ€™t, leaving Soha alone on the street, she cannot return home, and she has nothing to live here in this situation. Abahi turns out to be her assistant, this is the basis of the story. <br /> <br /> The rest is just watchable, and the end of the bitter-sweet story that Abhay encounters, which keeps you on the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> Dialogues and music are good songs, everything is in order. Good direction. Therefore, according to the scenario, you feel that the film is slow, but with the plot in mind, everything is in order. <br /> <br /> Truly watchable, especially with a light mood I enjoyed it at home with cola and peanuts. my rating for this is 8/10
