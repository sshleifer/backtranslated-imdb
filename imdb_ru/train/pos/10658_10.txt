The only time I saw this movie was when I was 10 years old. I remembered it all these years, since I could not sleep for a week or more after seeing it. It just thrilled me. I was on vacation with my aunts at Ft. Worth, Texas, and I will never forget that. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me so that I can become an adult. It took a lot of research to find out what kind of film it was, but I always remembered that Barbara Stanwick was in it and finally I was able to get a name and reviews about it. I really liked it, but it scared me! Jaqui
