First of all, the film is a brilliant work of art (cinema). The plot was full of surprises, a small child pretends that an adult will inherit a million dollars and how he spends it. I mean how excited this is. This time Walt Disney really outdid itself. The comedy is expected most of the time, while others are unexpected. I mean, was this movie ok or was this movie ok. It also teaches a lot about wise youths, and I am this child really wise and a little smart pants. But it sucks. How the hell could such a guy get a hot cop and his father let him go free. It’s like letting the killer go on bail for ten years. If I had to do this, I would have been beaten with a “subtitle” (a huge stick that I used to sting hard on the ass when used). This baby is really lucky. Back to the story. The filmmakers really knew what they were doing when they made this film, but it’s still not perfect. The game was good and bad. The child and the woman had no chemistry, like the father, but the brothers were excellent. ” The special effects on the other hand were inconclusive. Plus this movie is not based on reality. I hated and loved it at the same time.
