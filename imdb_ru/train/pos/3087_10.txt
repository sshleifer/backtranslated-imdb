Six degrees is a great show! I watched the whole season online, since I just found it, and was terribly disappointed that there will not be season 2: '(and to top it off, ABC has now turned it off, so you canâ€™t view it online anymore. Why would ABC create such a great show, with a great storyline and great characters, just to get it off the air without even finishing the story. Related characters. To be honest, I feel that ABC can at least host an online show for viewers who like it. while they continue to broadcast the trans. valuable reality shows.
