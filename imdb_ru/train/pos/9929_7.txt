I doubt that much of this film is based on a true story. In the beginning, it speaks on the basis of a real story, sort of. I can bet that the only truth is that the former model, which has become a bounty hunter, is probably named Domino. <br /> <br /> In any case, Domino begins a conversation with Lucy Liu, who works at the FBI. Dominoes are being questioned about what she knows about the theft of $ 10 million. Thanks to the memories, we see Domino as a child, then as a model, and how she became interested in head hunting. She mainly talks about two other bounty hunters, Ed and Choco. They allowed her to join the group. It is strong, can use any weapon and, if necessary, will look attractive. <br /> <br /> They are linked to the fraud that Clarmontâ€™s clerk commits. Along the way, the group begins a reality show in which Ian Seering and Brian Austin Green are involved. They seem to be masters and must have really desperately tried to appear in it. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was interesting and she had a little laugh. Editing didn't bother me. There is also a lot of violence, mostly with weapons and blood. It could have been a bit shorter. <br /> <br /> CONCLUDING REMARKS: Enough to watch.
