Cor blimey. This film surprised me a lot as it is a comedic masterpiece. Billy Zayn is awesome as a central character, and everyone manages to play him straight enough so that the comedy is natural and easy. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is really good, and the scenery is a joy. I recommend that you watch this film with a bunch of comrades, a few bottles of your favorite liqueur and prepare to be surprised and very entertained. <br /> <br /> This goes so well with such masterpieces of kitsch as Plan 9 From Outer Space that it is in the true tradition of the "B" movie. But what makes it bigger is the caliber of the people who took part in the film. Ron Perlman, for example. I still giggle over the stage, where Zayn rides the stairs for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style. Everyone's a little crazy, and so much the better.
