I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival, where he received a standing ovation! This film tells a story that, as far as I know, has never been told before, namely about the revolt of Rozenshtrasse (a street in Berlin) of German pagan women who were married to Jews at the end of World War II. So this is a unique story, and besides, this is the only Holocaust film I've ever seen that shows that there were GOOD Germans (for example, in “Anne Frank”, the Dutch was helping the family) who did NOT support The Nazis, in fact, had the courage to resist the immorality and cruelty of their country during the Nazi regime, risking their lives. The acting is gorgeous, interesting and intricate in New York, the background work of Von Trotta in every scene and outstanding filmmaking characteristics, including great cinematography. Of course, the family in New York could speak German. Many immigrants in this country prefer to speak their native language with their family — a common occurrence. So this criticism is unfounded. Saying more will ruin the experience. The film is long, but I have never looked at my watch. I hope that this film will gain some distribution in North America, since this film is not only a masterpiece, but it can really help to heal any hostility of people to the Germans because of their support for Hitler. If this movie is playing in your area, I urge you to see it! You will not regret it!
