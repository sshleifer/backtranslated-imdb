In Carmen, Saura is again trying to establish a dynamic understanding between reality and fiction, between the real passions of personalities in a dance company preparing choreography for the dance parts of the opera “Carmen”, and script passions from the history of the fictional Carmen. the famous fatal blend of free spirit (read disregard for loyalty) and its ability to drive men crazy with desire. Saura used the same fiction / reality in an earlier black and white film, “Bodes de Sangre” (Bloody Wedding). But while the tension between the dancers rehearsing the “Bloody Wedding” showed an advantage in how they turned into fictional characters of the story, which will be performed by directing their emotions into their roles, Carmen is a parallel between the petty libidinal motivations of the dancers squad during rehearsals and spirit associated with the mythical Carmen, never even close will not be believable. It remains a gadget, and for this reason a distracting occupation. To see the comparison, you need to see a bloody wedding next to Carmen. However, it hardly matters, Saura's melodrama is trying to impose its Carmen, because the flamenco dance and guitar rehearsal music, which make up 95% of the film - some of the most famous flamenco dancers and musicians, more than pay off the cost of recording. Defective film and a miracle: perhaps perfect for training Keats "negative ability"?
