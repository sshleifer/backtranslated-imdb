Also known as the Great Ghost War. The Great Yokai War is Miike’s attempt to make a family film and the damn good job he does. The problem is that I cannot imagine that many parents want to show this film to their children. The best children's films are movies that are scary or have slightly frightening images, “Endless Story” and “Return to Oz” come to mind, but in the case of the Great War with Yokai Miike, it probably goes too far. In fact, at the show I was a man representing the film, which was repeated there to two families, that he probably didn’t really fit. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that the young hero of the film introduces himself and explains about his current family problems. This brief moment of ordinariness is sharply disturbed when a cow gives birth to a calf with the face of a man who screams that something awful is coming before falling dead, like an abomination (it is quite possible that the obvious disgustingness of a being of a little strange respect for Kato). <br /> <br /> After an incredible presentation of the main villain Kato and his minion Aga (surprisingly attractive Chiaki Curia) through an apocalyptic uplift of the army. For a while, the story returns to normal, but it won't take long for any logic to completely disappear, and the young boy teams up with the Miyazaki group, which refuses to destroy the evil sorcerer. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is quite simple and unexpectedly beaten, sometimes the entire selected film seems completely out of place in a film that so regularly breaks cliches, but it is helped by a simple awe-inspiring vision of the wizarding world. This is truly a Miyazaki film, turned into a lively action movie, albeit a much more sinister and more vicious than the regular Miyazaki film. <br /> <br /> The film is just joy when I look at the Yokai designs, and pretty much practical, while the evil monster robots, although they don’t demonstrate the best CGI in the world, are practical and endanger that gives them a much bigger tangible threat than you could imagine. <br /> <br /> are generally excellent, they just make their characters completely natural, and this is commendable when you consider that most of them are wearing body suits or latex costumes. Even Agi, strewn with a ridiculous hive, looks ominous and deadly thanks to the amazingly excellent game of Curia. <br /> <br /> Although the film has many elements that firmly carry it into the territory of the family cinema; cute creatures, younger heroes, the evil villain, a sense of mischief and adventure, and the absence of violence. There are elements that make you think about whether Miike should shoot such a film. <br /> <br /> The army of robots is a really terrible threat to everyday objects bent into monstrous beasts like T-101 without skin and with added chainsaws. These beasts tear the characters apart; suck the creatures into their bloodied mouths and abduct the children from their homes, brushing them right from the nose of their parents, before indulging in a little poisoning. <br /> <br /> Creating a creature is equally difficult for young minds. Yokai, in fact, the heroes, feed in a giant furnace full of diluted hatred that eats away the yokai's flesh and causes their evil souls to have pieces of metal. If the children thought that the smoldering Anakin was bad, wait until they see a hedgehog the size of a man burning to death in a vat with melted hate for a minute before turning into a motorcycle abomination. There is also a rupture of the limb; in one case, a torn off arm twitches in front of the camera, from which blood is dripping, a fair amount of sexual energy (Agi wears one dress designed specifically for fans, and it seems that as a motivation he sleeps only with Kato, while “The Princess of the Rivers” carries almost nothing, and the young hero gropes for her hips in several scenes), as well as the general humor that goes right over the heads of those for whom, it would seem, this miracle technique was created. <br /> <br /> An example of this is that the Yokai are only interested in the final battle when they think it is a big party. The ensuing battle is more like a festival than anything else, with beer, surfing in the crowd and hype. In addition, the scene in which Agi beats a viper from a cute fluffy creature seems to be intended to attract the masses, tormented by excessive Pokémon. <br /> <br /> The end of the spoilers At the end of the day the Great War Yokai is easy for Miike is stronger than the latest films. Despite the fact that it lacks some perverse charms, say, Gozu or Ichi, it just constantly pushes the audience onto the path of general madness. In fact, this is perhaps the most irresponsible film Mike, in which he so sincerely perceives the pure magic of this subject. <br /> <br /> Just look at the random flash of Gogo's ass.
