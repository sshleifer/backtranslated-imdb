I was a little skeptical if I had to watch it when it was first shown on CBS. I was one of the many people who were in New York that day, I went to school at Hunter College. I did not want to see all the devastation and carnage, but, like many, I was curious to see what it was. Tears filled my eyes as I watched this documentary. All my memories came back, and only intense images were incredible. I bought an anniversary DVD and watched it several times. How these guys were able to capture these shots was incredible. If you have not seen this documentary, do yourself a favor and check it out. This is clearly depressing and causes tears in his eyes, but this is an incredible document of this country's darkest hour.
