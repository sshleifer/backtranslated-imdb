A pleasant surprise! I expected a further downhill on the line: The Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an inflatable film. Perhaps, therefore, few have approved this new type of Bruckheimer fare. Clever dialogue instead of energetic odnostrochnnikov, decent background / motivation instead of stereotypes about the shake-n-bake, and when the chase began, you really craved it. Fans are waiting for the Armageddon roller coaster: stay away. This one is for smarter action movie fans. It didn't even bother me, Jolie seemed so small.
