The boy and the girl are persecuted by the local warrior, because the boy killed (by chance) the warrior's father (or whoever he was). And they travel through the nature of the most severe regions of Africa. <br /> <br /> The pictures in this film are not so good (except for this baby elephant). But this is a very good adventure, and it is not very censored, there is some blood, flesh and nakedness (which lightens the film a little). <br /> <br /> I give this film 7 because of his picture African nature and its action.
