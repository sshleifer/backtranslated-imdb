I give ten out of ten, this is one of the best movies ever. Absolutely overwhelmed, dazed and stunned by the whole picture, an amazing game of Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and the whole team, an amazing story ... Just look inside yourself and have the courage to admit it touched your soul, because it is strange but there are all the answers, which you have ever been looking for ... the very best, mr. Ritchie! VERY BEST. Those who are looking for a simple game and clashes continue to shout that they are disappointed. But now there are a lot of small films in Hollywood, you can't remember what happened the next day when you saw it. On the contrary, Revolver is unique, I hardly expected that it would be possible to portray such a clear and ingenious picture of myself, everyone who had to watch it. Absolutely unsurpassed, amazing, dazzling ... Watching this, you can get an idea, I do not doubt it. In fact, no words can express my admiration ... I still wonder how it was possible to make such a film after several years of frivolous Hollywood junk we watched. Thank you from my heart, this is simply the best.
