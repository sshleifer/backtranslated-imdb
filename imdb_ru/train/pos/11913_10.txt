This is a great movie for female bodybuilders and female action fans! I think Sue Price did an excellent job in this film (Nemezis 2,3,4) and established herself as a great fighter. She has a very striking appearance and an iron will to resist a powerful nebula (Nemesis 2). Although the film is not very valuable, and Sue Price's acting skills are not the best thing to be found in my life, the film itself was something of a tremendous, priceless decoration for female bodybuilding fans! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 were copied by other famous sci-fi films, such as Terminator or Predator, but this is not the main thing. The fact is that in this film A.Puin played a very talented bodybuilder who put all her energy and talent into the body to show us what she is capable of. I really liked this film, and I looked with the same enthusiasm as Nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). What a pity that he has not yet shown on DVD :-(
