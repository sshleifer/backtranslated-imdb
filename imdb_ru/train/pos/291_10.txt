The Zombie Chronicles has nothing to shout about, it is obviously not an award-winning film, but this is an entertaining B-film by director Brad Sykes who shot Camp Blood, which was another entertaining film with a low budget. Acting is bad, as in most cheap films, but this is what makes it more interesting, zombie makeup is cool and effective, especially with a budget, the blood is also big and coarse, the film looks like a zombie version of Fairy Tales from the crypt, as we get two stories about clashes with zombies in the forest, stories are funny and make you think, especially the first story. Zombie Chronicles is much better than some low-cost zombie movies, if you like low-budget B-movies or cheap zombie movies, see Zombie Chronicles.
