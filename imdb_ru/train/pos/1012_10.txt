Stargate SG-1 is a kind of side effect from the 1994 Stargate movie. I am so glad that they decided to expand this topic. The show starts from the very first episode, retired Jack O'Neill has to go through the gate again to meet his old companion, Dr. Daniel Jackson. In the first two episodes, we meet with Samantha Carter, a very intelligent person who does not allow anyone to walk on it, and there is Tilk, a quiet, compassionate warrior who challenges his false god and joins the team. <br /> <br /> The main bad guys are called Guld, they are parasites that can penetrate his brain, thus controlling them and doing evil deeds. Any Guald with a huge amount of power is often considered a "system lord." The warriors behind Gualdom are called Jaffa, and parasitic Gualda is placed in them until Guald gets into the human brain. <br /> <br /> In these episodes, we mainly see SG-1, a research team consisting of Jack / Daniel / Tylyk / and Sam, going through the wormhole, which instantly transfers them to other planets (this device is called Stargate) and they encounter new cultures or bad guys. Some episodes relate to the world, which means that they do not pass the Stargate once in the episode, but rather deal with pressing problems on Earth. <br /> <br /> Over the years, you begin to see a decline in the SG. -1 team, as a cohesive, and more storylines. This, in turn, means even more episodes in the world, which is understandable. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- Although most of this show is good, there are some examples of storylines that don’t always dwell and don’t pay much attention to travel over the past few years. But still, first-class science fiction!
