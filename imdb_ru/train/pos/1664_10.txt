I thought this film was stunning, with completely outstanding performances by Valentina Worms (Artemisia Gentileschi). <br /> <br /> Worms portray Artemisia so beautifully, with uncertain but sure manners, her hands mark out the idea before moving her model to a place. The passion that Artemisia imparts to her art is simply spectacular. <br /> <br /> Although not every character was frankly beautiful, it made the film more realistic, as the hair on the face and clothes were ideal for that time. . <br /> <br /> In general, I thought this movie was fantastic.
