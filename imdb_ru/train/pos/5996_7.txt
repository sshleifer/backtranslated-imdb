Again and again, I stated that if people do not want remakes or sequels to be made, they should stop seeing them and go into the world of independent cinema instead. Having said this, however, the last time that I myself saw an independent film must have been easy six months ago. So, here is a review for indie, which I turned my attention to Youtube; The Cure. <br /> <br /> Immediately you can say that the film is aimed at an avant-garde cinematic approach in which the use of extreme close-ups, scopophilia and quick editing is wired. He is proud of what he looks like - and is entitled to it. For the most part, this is a very well-made little piece, with the exception of one unforgivable disregard of the 180 degree rule and the comically bad shot effect, which seems to be the calling card for self-financing projects. <br /> <However, despite these amateurish mistakes, most of the shots are really nice to watch. We were presented with a good use of props and locations, a good visual effect and some very atmospheric, smooth editing, which became more commendable, since this is definitely something that you will not see very often from the Youtube presentation. The plot is fragmented, and although the basic premise is fairly simple, it may be difficult for some to understand exactly what is happening, but what we see here is telling avant-garde stories at work; You cannot count on a simple three-act structure, and if you do, you may not be ready for such a film. <br /> <br /> Where, unfortunately, the film is disappointed, so is the sound. What you hear everywhere is a distorted voice-over, which often sounds disingenuous, and even worse - continuous background music that undergoes minimal changes and adds nothing to anything. There is so much attention paid to visualization that the sound is frankly neglected, and it becomes really obvious when you realize that you just missed four sentences of the narration, and you need to go back to find what has escaped your attention. <Br /> <br /> So give him a watch, but do it with the sound off. <br /> <br /> Last thought; Has anyone else reminded of the cover of Doug Naylor's novel "The Red Dwarf" "The Last Man" at the beginning of the film? If you have a book, you know what I mean.
