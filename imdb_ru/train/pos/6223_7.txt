From modern sensuality it is sometimes difficult to watch old movies. Annoying is the need to observe how a stereotypical field librarian should take off his glasses and become beautiful and stupid to win a man. Especially such a petty and unstable person. He is obviously a player (I would not trust him to remain faithful to her), who does not want to be complacent, who only looks at silly attractive women and always calls them "baby" (ick!). Even after she completely changed her appearance and her life for him, he goes to her only after he (supposedly) is rejected by another woman, and learns that Conny has spent all her money repairing the boat for him. I wanted her to confront him, and not miserably pursue him! His sudden appeal in a few minutes was absolutely unreal and did not work for me. <br /> <br /> In addition to this story, I really liked the movie. How can you not love sailors dancing with each other ?! (You can say that they were from San Francisco ....; D) The "rehearsal" dance was great, watching Ginger Rogers purposefully drop out of the "right steps" was great. The last dance scene "Face the Music" with beautiful costumes and art deco decorations was beautiful. And I really liked "We Saw the Sea" (although they used it too many times, as if they understood that this was their best song). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot was a bit weak, like most musicals (IMO) - and the songs were fine, but the dances were worth watching the movie. I wish they could show several shots from San Francisco since it was supposedly taken. <br /> <br /> It is strange to see such a carefree naval film, knowing that Hitler was already doing this time. I must try to suspend all knowledge in order to plunge into a fictional fantasy country.
