Ida Lupino was one of the few women who broke through the director's glass ceiling in the Hollywood studio system. It is not surprising that she also dealt with proto-feminist themes, which, when they were touched at all, were approached so carefully that it was rarely quite clear what we were talking about. In Perturbation, she looks at rape and its aftermath, and while in the short film this is called “criminal attack,” this time she leaves no doubt about what happened. <br /> <br /> Mala Powers (in her official debut) plays a secretary-accountant at a large industrial enterprise; she lives with her parents, but is engaged to a boyfriend (Robert Clark), who has just been promoted and now earns $ 90 a week. Leaving the factory after work late at night, she discovers that she is being pursued. In the next scene ?? best in the movie ?? she tries to escape from the pursuer in a tangled maze of buildings and lanes, but fails. <br /> <br /> When she returns home, disheveled and shocked, the police cannot get much out of her; she claims that she has never seen her intruder (who was involved in a diner near the factory). Trying to pretend that nothing has happened, she returns to her work, but falls apart, thinking that everyone is looking at her, judging her. She falls into a state of fugue, runs off to Los Angeles on a bus, but stumbles at a bus stop to rest. <br /> <br /> Waking up in a strange ranch, she learns that Tod Andrews, a young minister in an agricultural town in California, saved her. She lies about her personality and arranges the job of packing oranges. The two fall dimly in love, but it’s clear to Andrews that Powers keeps terrible secrets. When at a corporate picnic, she grabbed a wrench and snapped the skull of Jerry Paris, who tried to steal a kiss, the truth about her past comes out .... <br /> <br /> It was courageously The film will be released in 1950, and this may explain and justify some of its shortcomings. Lupino never restores the inspiration of the scene of an early attack, and the film goes crazy in a mad and sentimental character, ending with a talkative and didactic. Yes, Lupino had important information, but she did not trust the story, which spoke for itself. Her cast, pleasant but soft and generic, didn’t help much, returning to melodramatic poses or homely calm. But “Outrage” was a breakthrough, paving the way for the subsequent discussion of what really is a crime of rape and what it really means for its victims.
