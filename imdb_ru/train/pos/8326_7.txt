While Fred Schepisi "I.Q." actually does not have any important qualities, it is still worth seeing. Walter Mattau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) to fall in love with a doctoral program at Princeton in mathematics Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizziad and his friends (Lou Jacobi, Jean Sachs and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: in the end, he looks like a French impressionist. <br /> <br /> Obviously, a little film is historically accurate, but that's not the point. He didn’t reflect as a light comedy, as the exact opposite of the most famous film of Robbins in 1994 (“Escape from the Shoushenk”). The film about Einstein’s whole life should have focused not only on his scientific achievements, but also on his political activity, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of Scottsboro Nine and spoke out against nuclear weapons (it came to the point that the FBI saved the file on him). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is acceptable. Also starring Stephen Frye, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keane Curtis.
