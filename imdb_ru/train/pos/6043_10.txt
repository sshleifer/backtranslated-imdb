I watched a movie about freebers and I think it's great! itâ€™s a casual fun, about the time the British film industry did something interesting !! well, that the guy who met them at the service station is mentioned in the film in the news agents, a nice touch. Acting was convincing (I'm a biker), they reminded me of some of the good times I had on the bike scene. It was nice to see the director start playing, well done, John! At the end a new crop is mentioned, is it the basis for the second film in Ireland? hope so keep them. Great movie, well written, realistic characters!
