When I first saw the Romeo Division last spring, my first reaction was BRILLIANT! However, on future views I was provided with much more than just a master shot. This picture has a unique voice that will sound throughout the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> The initial installation provides an excellent palette, which assistant S.P. Sarro uses to create his art on this canvas of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Sarro really uses the camera as a brush, while he takes us on a trip that envelops the public with a terrific fighter who goes beyond the traditional format we are used to and deeply immerses in dark themes of betrayal, revenge and the importance of communication. This film is the dream of any director in its essence. <br /> <br /> However, Sarro was not alone in this epic endeavor. The letter provided by scribe Tim Sheridan was equally breathtaking. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such a presence and charisma on the screen. In particular, the final scene (ATTENTION: SPOILERS !!! SPOILERS !!!), where Vanessa always manifests herself as one of the coalition and the villain, is written in such a gloomy tone that it is one of the most frightening. endings I've ever seen. Sheridan is the next Robert Town. <br /> <br /> In the last remark, it is obvious that this performance was a considerable feat. <br /> <br /> So you have to pay tribute to producer Scott Shipley, who seems to have creativity and genius to go along with Jerry Bruckheimer. Never before have I witnessed such a spectacular performance with such attention to every detail. The work of the producer is one of the most difficult in any film, and Shipley makes it easy. <br /> <br /> In general, this film combines creativity, stunning staging and workshop direction. This is the art of cinema at its best. When the end of the film comes, the only thing needed is more. <br /> <br /> The Romeo Division is an innovative, masterpiece and, most importantly, the Romeo Division is truly an art.
