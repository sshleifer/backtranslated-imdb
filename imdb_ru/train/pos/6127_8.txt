Jack Frost about a serial killer sentenced to death. On the way to his death sentence, the prison truck in which he rides faces a chemical tanker filled with a chemical that turns its molecules into snow and turns it into a snowman. Being the killer himself, that would turn him into a snowman killer. Jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who caught him. Now, Jack begins to run amok again, killing people in a small town. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t think that Jack Frost has a chance to become a classic of horrors, but this is an entertaining film. Just put your brain aside and have fun, but don't take it seriously.
