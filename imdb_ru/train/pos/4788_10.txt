This is one of the greatest films I've ever seen: I glowed inside during the whole movie. Music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on the screen. The slow pace was set by the method of movement (riding lawn mower with a large trailer) and was supported by background views and sounds and the slow life of other characters. <br /> <br /> The story actually happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. everything was completely real, as if the actors had actually become characters. Sissy Spacek came up with an acute, tireless daughter who suffered a lot but moved forward, always wanting to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth played well, and he became very well Alvin Straight, a stubborn but loving older man who travels around Iowa to visit his estranged brother Lyle, who had a stroke. During his life, Alvin learned a lot, and this seemed to show the best in the people he encountered on this path. <br /> <br /> The film stresses the importance of the family for this person and, I hope, for all of us. I look forward to seeing it again and again. Directed by David Lynch, this film proves his directorial skill. Farnsworth was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor; at 79, he was the oldest contender for this award.
