I saw Salvation Grace right after he was videotaped. Since then, he has become one of my favorites! The plot is not very complicated, but does not distract from entertainment. He is full of comedic moments and has a very nice quality. Characters make the movie so good. Each of them has its own bizarre qualities that complement the humor; two old women come to mind, played by Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law. An excellent game was made by everyone, especially Brenda Bleten. She and Craig Ferguson were great together with a few fun moments. If you are looking for a good comedy, I definitely recommend this movie!
