Karen enters the Japanese home as a nurse assistant to Emma, ​​a strange woman who sleeps during the day and wakes up at night. Karen walks upstairs, hearing noises when confronted with a frightening ghost. She learns the secrets of the house. <br /> <br /> This is very scary! Scenes are shocking and scary! The characters are good. The settings are creepy. I love the whole plot! The ending was shocking! I stopped at a stage where a little boy meowed so loudly that a man found his sister upstairs and I was shocked. This is the worst movie I watched. I have not seen the Japanese version. I recommend this to horror fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
