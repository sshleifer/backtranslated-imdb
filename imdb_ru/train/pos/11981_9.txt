"FULL HOUSE", in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure that I have never seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. One of my favorite episodes is when Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Laurie Laughlin) get married. If you want to know how it was so funny, you had to see it for yourself. It was a two-part, so you should have seen both parts. Another of my favorite episodes is when Jesse, Stephanie (Jody Sweeten) and Michelle (Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen) lock themselves up at the gas station on Michelle's birthday. You should also have seen it yourself if you want to know how and why this happened. I have a lot of others that I like too. Everyone always gave a good presentation, the design of the production was impressive, the costumes were well thought out, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, despite the fact that it is now visible by syndication, I strongly recommend that you catch him in case he turns off permanently.
