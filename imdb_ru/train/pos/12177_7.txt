Recall: the next morning, after his boyish party, Paul woke up from a future mother-in-law and found that a woman was sleeping next to him. Unfortunately, this is the waitress from the bar, not his bride. Suddenly, she appears everywhere ... on the freeway and at her parents' dinner. And it's hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex-boyfriend told him to take a picture. It is not only about saving his wedding, but also about survival. <br /> <br /> Comments: In fact, everything is much better than expected. Not a sweet romantic comedy that I expected, but something more ridiculous, something with a slight bias. This film is not afraid to joke a little further. And Jason Lee is now able to deliver comedies, especially when his character is scared and deep in trouble, as he is here. And he received good support from the beautiful ladies Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. And in fact, I thought that Lochlin Munro played a good role in the role of the former. <br /> <br /> So, greater emphasis on comedy than romance, and the end result was good. I really liked it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
