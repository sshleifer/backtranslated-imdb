I really liked this movie. He took a rather grim story — the story of Shakespeare's Macbeth — and wrapped it in a bizarre, often amusing and piercing modern yarn. <br /> <br /> Prestige of how the director brought completely different worlds of modern New York and Macbeth. Scotland together under one roof. The opposing worlds act to <br /> <br /> really reveal the intrigue and comedy of the play, and you have to love Harold Perrino as a chorus, a role that is not in the play but which really helps jazz things up. The ending stands out among the little indies that I saw, thanks to its isolation and originality.
