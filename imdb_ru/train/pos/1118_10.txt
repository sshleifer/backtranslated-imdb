Well, this could be one of the funniest movies ever, and Sandy gives an idea of ​​the power of the tour! Alas, her career has not begun, but, finally, she will always be remembered for her three first-class paintings: “The King of Comedy”, “The Doll of Dallas” and “Without You, I Am Nothing.” She meets different people, from New York secular to Diane Ross, to create harsh and cheerful criticism of popular culture in America. Sexy and fierce, tender and sensual, philosophical and melancholic, she convinces the public in every scene, and in fact she is “very beautiful”. Look at it (if you are not from Iowa), you will surely like it !!
