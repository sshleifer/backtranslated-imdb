This show has been my salvation from reality for the past ten years. I will be sad to miss this. Although Atlantis filled the hole a little. <br /> <br /> The last episode of SG1 (in any case, on television) was beautifully made. Robert wrote something that looked like reality. As if he was trying to explain how it was on the set of the show. (Anyone who has worked closely for such a long time is faced with ups and downs. But over the years they have become a family). I thought it was a great way to finish despite anyoneâ€™s criticism. <br /> <br /> SG1 was something special, and again and again he carried me through the threshold of disbelief and surprise. Beautiful characters, stories, directors, writers. From the first episode I was hooked. The combination of action, science, drama, and especially comedy worked so well that it made me continue to want more. <br /> <br /> There are no real words to fully express what this show means to me. I can only thank those who have kept the show so fresh and interesting for many years. This inspired me to many things that I thought were impossible. <br /> <br /> I look forward to films next year and I really hope that there will be a lot of them. I never want the show to die. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
