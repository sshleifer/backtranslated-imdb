For me, this review may contain spoilers, but I like to watch movies, having no idea about what will happen, so I think that many other reviews of this film contain spoilers! <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie again, and I have to repeat that it has the BEST final in any movie. Ever Ever Ever The real translation “The beating of butterfly wings,” oddly enough, is not used as a translated name. I suppose they thought that most Americans would not know what chaos theory is (except for those who saw or read “Jurassic Park”). The film is based on the theory of chaos and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events that all lead to one event. The film is a whirlwind of amazing cause and effect as we follow the chain of chaos when it is intertwined between several characters (about 20?). In a sense, the ending seems inevitable, even so, but if you think about it, this is the perfect end. Think to yourself: “What else needed to be said”? This is at the same time a very bold end. It is unfortunate that we should go abroad for a gem like this, but such a final will NEVER come out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
