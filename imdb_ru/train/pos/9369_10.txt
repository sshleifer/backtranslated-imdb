This film is proof that the film noir is a steady style and is extremely worthy to stay alive. For me, this is the best example of cinema since the days of Chinatown. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he will never get the recognition he deserves. He never advertised properly when he was first released, and he had to gather his fans on venues like Vanguard Cinema and word-of-mouth. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend people looking for something more than thoughtless Rent this movie for fun and immerse yourself in its very tangled plot.
