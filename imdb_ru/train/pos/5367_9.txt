This film is one of the most underrated films of its time. Watching this movie is full of action, and when something doesn’t happen, the humor doesn’t correspond. A brilliant essay for a film created to give us a bloody mix, a game show in which criminals are competitors, and the near future, where the general public craves blood. Also Arnold does not let us down with some of his best liners. I do not want to spoil anything for you, but I will tell you when Arnold gives his “I return”, he will get the best answer of all in this film. I hope you enjoy this gem just like me.
