I first saw it at a foreign film festival. This is a magnificent nail puller about a conspiracy to free the Estonian treasury from a billion or so gold. All of this is filmed in a grainy, granular style that Hollywood rarely uses - but it perfectly reflects the atmosphere of the newly liberated Baltic countries (note: Tallinn did look much less gloomy in 2003 when I was there). <Br /> <br /> There is a lot of humor and a little romance. I do not want to spoil a number of startling but logical surprises, so Iâ€™ll just say that this film about the theft begins with a great script, and the direction and performances are top notch. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most nervous example of its genre - I would put it against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it is far ahead of the new OCEAN'S 11, although (intentionally) not so brilliant. RENT OR BUY NOW.
