I could not find anyone to watch DIG! with me, because none of those whom I knew was a fan of one of the groups. Naturally, everyone assumed that you can enjoy this movie only if you like the music of The Dandy Warhols or Brian Jonestown Massacre, but this is so far from the truth. The only requirement is that you have an interest in music and / or pop culture in general. The way the careers of the two groups go in parallel is an ideal representation of the ways a group can go, and watching the public eat and spit out Dandy Warhols is exciting. I agree with the other reviews, which mention that it would be nice to get the last word from Anton himself, since he is clearly depicted as his own worst enemy and a bulwark of the group’s ability to simply remain. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing for me is the Dandy's respect for BJM (despite their absence or reciprocity) and for Anton (despite his unstable behavior). Dandy Warhols respect the art group produces even if the group hates all dandy warhols now stand for (although this is debatable). Best of all, when drummer Dandy says: “I don’t recognize them anywhere else, I’ll again,” and the guitarist unconsciously blurts out: “I’ll still buy their records. For me, it just shows how powerful good music can be. <br /> <br /> Be sure to watch this movie, even if you know nothing about any of these groups. It's more about the themes of rock music and how they evolve, which makes this film so interesting. Rarely follows a group for so long.
