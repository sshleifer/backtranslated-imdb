The young Mr. Lincoln marks the first film about the collaboration of director and star John Ford and Henry Fonda. I remember how many years ago, Fonda said that, being a young actor, he was understandably nervous because he played Abraham Lincoln and was afraid that he would not stand the test. <br /> <br /> John Ford calmed him down before filming began. saying that he was not going to play the Great Emancipator, but simply a lawyer on the prairie apprentice. After the case was settled, the Foundation led the cast, which John Ford shot in the classic film. <br /> <br /> This is not a Lincoln biopic. This was previously in the era of sounds with Walter Houston, and a year after the young Mr. Lincoln Raymond Massey played the play of Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln, winning the Pulitzer Prize, in Illinois. Massey is still the defining Lincoln. <br /> <br /> But, as Ford said, Fonda played not the Great Liberator, but only a lawyer from a small town in Illinois. The film spans about 10 years of Lincoln's youth. We see him working in a department store and receiving several books on law from an immigrant pioneer family whose path he will cross later in the story. And his affair with Anne Rutledge, with her early death, left Lincoln the most dreary being. <br /> <br /> Fast forward to 10 years from now, and now Lincoln is a practicing lawyer starting to notice. He served several terms in the legislature, but returned to private practice, not quite sure what policy was for him. <br /> <br /> This is where the main part of the action takes place. Two sons from this family, he received books on jurisprudence even when they were accused of murder. He offers to protect them. And not the usual murder, but one of the deputy sheriff. <br /> <br /> The process itself is an invention, but the gambit used to protect Richard Cromwell and Eddie Killan, who played two sons, is based on a real case that Lincoln defended. I will not say more. <br /> <br /> In addition to the speeches, the great strength of the young Mr. Lincoln is the way John Ford captures the mood, atmosphere and atmosphere of the small prairie town of Illinois in the Fourth Part of the July Celebration. As if you are watching a newsreel. And it was the mood of the country itself, young, vibrant and growing. <br /> <br /> Fans of John Ford films will recognize two musical themes that were repeated in later films. At the beginning of the romantic break with Fonda and Polina Moore, who played Ann Rutledge, the music in the background is the same theme that was used in “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance” for Vera Miles. And during the dance the melody “Beautiful Susan Brown”, in which Fonda and Marjorie Weaver, which plays Mary Todd, is the same one that Fonda danced with Katie Downs, in “My dear Clementine” at the dance for raising the church in Tombstone. <br /> <br /> Lincoln will forever remain a favorite subject of biographers and playwrights for two reasons, I suppose. First, he is the living embodiment of our own American mythology about people rising from the bottom to the top of their own power. In fact, the young Mr. Lincoln very vividly shows von Lincoln. And, secondly, the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in American history and that he made an exceptionally good and moral decision to free the slaves during the civil war, although for some necessary political reasons. His murder provided him a place in history. <br /> <br /> In addition to the Foundation and the others I mentioned, we should especially mention Fred Kohler Jr. and Ward Bond, two city hooligans, where Kohler was the victim of a murder and Bond is the main prosecutor. Also Donald Meek as a prosecutor and Alice Brady in what turned out to be her latest film as the mother pioneer Cromwell and Quillan. And a very good presentation of Spencer Charters, who specialized in rustic characters as a judge. <br /> <br /> For a film that captures the drama and romance of the time in which you play, you cannot do better than the young Mr. Lincoln.
