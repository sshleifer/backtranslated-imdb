Castle of Blood is a good example of the quality work in the horror genre that appeared in Italy in the 60s. The film has all the necessary elements - the old dark house, the atmosphere, a decent story and Barbara Steele. Steele makes most films worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The story of the haunted castle. People visited, but no one came back. Our hero makes a bet that he can spend the night at the castle and return to pick up his winnings. But the night he attends is a special night. Every night comes a night when the dead return to survive their death. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I see in the film is running time. It almost feels augmented. There is much of the first act where literally nothing happens. Our hero stumbles in the dark, not finding anything interesting. But as soon as he finds something, the film begins to develop and becomes quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Castle of Blood is a must for Steele fans and fans of Italian gothic horror.
