It’s hard to watch this movie without thinking about what the TV show will be like, especially if, like me, you like the TV show more. But much can be said about the source. <br /> <br /> Oscar Madison (Walter Mattau) is the best New York athlete living in an apartment with eight rooms, a divorce victim and his own stubbornly careless thinking. Enter his friend Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon), who needs a place to live after his wife threw him out of his stubborn, neat way of thinking. The result is a train wreck and one of Neil Simon’s most favorite screenings. <br /> <br /> First of all: I love this apartment! A table for poker, a board for darts for new products, oblique photos of baseball players, empty booze and beer containers, even a pair of Roman columns. This is a place where men can be boys. Simon and director Jean Sachs do a great job of opening the stage performance, the Oscar drawing room, transferring the action to the bedrooms and the kitchen and giving the increasing tension between Oscar and Felix more angles to bounce off of it. <br /> <br /> The familiar score of Neal Hefty was heard on the television show, but was never so swiftly organized as here, in several different arrangements that cause the action on the screen to take off whenever it is played. Real-time work and night shots of Manhattan give the film total energy for films shot at that time and place (Buddhin, Henry East of the World, Midnight Cowboy, Manchurian Candidate, Rosemary's Baby). etc.) <br /> <br /> Is Lemmon and Mattau too heavy compared to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman? To be honest, the film is intended to become a more serious matter, devoted to the unusual condition of divorce in mid-life and frustration inherent in the inability to make a relationship work. Simon means more than the entry of Felix and Oscar in the game "Password" or the battle of wits with Howard Coselle. But I don’t know ... <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Mattau were amazing comedians I like to watch especially in the middle of this film, as I often do in their individual films, but I never understood why they were considered an excellent comedy team. Here, in their esteemed partnership, they seem to be filmed in two different films; Lemmon in the comedy drama and Mattau in the farce. Mattau is great at the beginning, he fascinates us with his behavior of a teddy bear at the poker table, but towards the end of the film he becomes the same as Jack Torrance in Shining, reacting to Felix, who cleans his apartment and servant. delicious food for his friends in such a way that completely upsets the delicate balance of guilt. <br /> <br /> While the final is bothering me, the part that many see as the most abrupt, the beginning, works well, as I see it. Watching Felix stumble while trying to commit suicide is not the best comedy, no, but it's a good way to get into a great comedy, causing us to experience some kind of real pain before causing warmth and laughter. (In addition, there are great shots of the more severe parts of the city.) In the middle of the film, this scene would be a miscalculation, but it serves as a way of identifying Felix’s torment and a sense of dramatic relief that occurs when we see Oscar and his poker friends arguing warring <br /> <br /> That's where Simon's lines are so good. They are the main strength of the film. He gets the banter absolutely right and real, and still makes it funny. “I don't mind what you say, Felix. You have something to say. What scares me is that I begin to listen. ” The telecast showed how it is always better to consider the film to be wrong; in fact, the telecast once showed that it is necessary to take “something at all”, but the film creates a solid foundation and joy in itself. ,
