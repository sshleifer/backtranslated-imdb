The brilliant Elizabeth Taylor is shot in this little-known classic as a young girl from London who falls in love with the owner of a tea plantation from British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Upon arrival, she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to a new culture, as well as constantly being aware of a herd of angry elephants. William Diterle, who also shot "The Life of Emile Zola" and "Jenny's Portrait", is masterfully working to bring a somewhat dark and almost eerie shade to this romantic picture, and the decor is one of the most beautiful in black and white themed mansion and magnificent island landscape.
