Before I watched this film, I had many contradictions. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I was a typical high school student in Shakespeare's class, which I didn’t even like, much less understood. half off! Shakespeare would be nothing more than UNKNOWN if I hadn’t spent ALL my concentration on his almost encrypted plays ... encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language ... and then I still wouldn’t get most of it. <br /> <Secondly, it was 4 o'clock! I never thought it could be good. <br /> <br /> Well, let me tell you something. This film was so masterful, so beautiful that I actually understood the whole language during its performance. Now the script followed the letter in this film, the same script that was incomprehensible to me in Shakespeare’s class. And then I opened my mind and understood it. I almost doubted while watching a movie! But lo and behold ... when performed, and only then Shakespeare comes to life. Thus, this version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare is truly a master who has written wonderful stories. When I saw him on the big screen, especially in the big big movie (with beautiful cinema and photography), I played Brann with a stunning role, somehow ... I understood what was happening. What was said. The language is amazing and passionate. This allows for coarser emotions ... when words cannot describe something, perhaps Shakespeare's words can. <br /> <br /> I still believe that the Fist of the North Star (animated, English dub) is the greatest film ever made. No movie gives more entertainment. But a film close to toppling the Fist from this position (which Hamlet did - he came close) is really amazing ... inspires fear. It was not a movie. It was an event. <br /> <br /> Even more surprising, it made me appreciate Shakespeare. Wow. Powerful. Powerful word. One of the rare, really powerful films. <br /> <br /> These are two hundred trillions of stars from endless stars. Yes Yes. <br /> <br /> By the way, all of you guys are in Shakespeare's class ... forget about it. You are wasting your time. You should see the plays played. Only then will they be given justice.
