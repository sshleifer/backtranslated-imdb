This show is awesome! I have been a fan since its premiere, and it only makes me look ... I saw some awful things here that I wouldnâ€™t want, BUT, it really shows you how addiction affects all participants, not just the addict. You can see all sorts of different addictions, from drugs and alcohol to a shopping addict, or a eating disorder addict. And in fact, it is very sad to see some of the famous people who have also passed. We have seen experienced musicians, NBA players and even young people who really need help. And since they began to show several follow-up observations, it was also great. Now you can see how long they live after going on the air. If you have not checked it yet, please. It's on A & E and it's awesome! New eps - Sunday evenings at 10 pm, if I remember correctly ... so install your TiVo!
