I know, I know that it was a good ending, but sincerely it was awesome. I love it when the movie ends with a terrible dark nature, but this time I was impressed that Darth Vader turned against the Emperor, I was really surprised. The tormenting sequence in this film was when Luke was tortured and defeated by the Emperor / Darth Sidious. He is going to be destroyed when Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith, destroys his dark master. Good sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised by all the ships of the rebel warships and all the imperial warships and superstar destroyers. I liked the new race they brought to the screen: Mon Calomari, ewoks, sullesteian (co-pilot Lando) and many others ... Most of my favorite scenes in this film: 1-When Vader kills the Emperor and is fatally wounded, 2- When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda, and then Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) appears (the greatest scene in Star Wars). 3- When Leia kills Jabba, the strangling criminal Lord of the Hutts. <br /> <br /> I personally like the script and the Battle of Endor, representing the land and space battles, as well as the best Star Wars match between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker on the Death Star. Post scenario: Scenes with Leia in a slave bikini are remembered. 9/10.
