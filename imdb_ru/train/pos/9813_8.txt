This episode introduced Golodek to the world of PNP. You need to contact Jarada and deliver an accurate greeting, otherwise it will greatly offend them. Tired Picard decides to go on a trip to Golodek, and a wonderful adventure begins. The settings are excellent and almost like a movie. Alas, the Jarada probe, sent shortly after, damaged the well, and all its protective devices stopped working. Picard and now the guests must outwit the bandits of the 40s of America and return for a date with Jarad. Picard correctly welcomes Jarad, and a new day is coming between Mankind and Jarada. This pearl of the episode of the first season set a chill for many interesting and unusual adventures.
