Any film that relates to fanaticism in a positive way is a film that should still be viewed by the current audience, since the meaning and moral of this story will always be relevant as long as we have a world full of fanaticism. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is a really old-fashioned love story .. the guy meets the girl .. the boys lose the girl ... the boy returns the girl .... <br /> <br /> The weakest role goes to the deceased Kent Smith as Lieutenant General Webster (Riccardo Montalban takes second place) ... my question is: how did he even become a three-star general ... a character such a weakling in the presence of his wife and his subordinates, it is surprising that they generally show him respect. <br /> <br /> Brando's southern accent is a bit exaggerated, and in some scenes there are several holes, but in general I like the film every time I see it. <br /> <br /> Red Buttons are great ... I always like to see comedians in dramatic roles ... as in the case of Button, a comedian can often depict a personâ€™s tragedy better than a more traditional film. ramatic actor.
