Ok, where do I start? ... This film has changed my life! The plot was seamless. James Cahill committed suicide. Initially, after the first viewing, I was disappointed that I did not see it on the silver screen. However, this was before learning the many possibilities of a DVD !!!! Oh my god, Jake Cahill’s commentary on the film was almost as perfect as his play. He spoke about the industrial secrets used in the film, which you can only get with experience. <br /> <br /> Other actors impressed me a lot. The scene where the guard is talking to a girl in the hallway reminded me of some of my favorite blue (pornographic) films. I, of course, with Gangsta, when he expresses his disappointment without a sequel. <br /> <br /> I’m still amazed at each viewing of the relevant martial arts skills, supported only by a sign indicating the library’s location to the school ... and maybe the guy is retiring! In general, the eternal classics and the best film in recent years! where is my Oscar at dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
