I write this 9 years after the last episode was shown, and I still can not figure out what impact Wyleside had on me. <br /> <br /> He really went where many other police dramas went and got on. But he went further and did not deviate from the realism of the streets, often depicting life events and characters up to T. <br /> <br /> I miss this series, instead they give us stupid "Underbelly", which is too dramatized and creating a whole bunch of American trash. <br /> <br /> Wildside remained loyal to Sydney’s uniqueness, and for this I really owe this wonderful series. The acting was awesome, and it is a shame to see that only a few actors have advanced their careers, while others have disappeared into obscurity. <br /> <br /> I don’t want Australia to forget this wonderful piece of its television history. Therefore, I ask the ABC to release the full series on DVD, not the first three. Give this series the end it deserves.
