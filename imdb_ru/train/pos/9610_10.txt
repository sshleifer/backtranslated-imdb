I cried from my heart watching this movie. I have never suffered from any eating disorders, but I think this must be a very true picture. <br /> <br /> Alison Lohmann is superb! She expresses these feelings surprisingly well. My teenage years are back so bright. Anyone who has lived through difficult times as a child or teenager will be able to relate to this film. I recommend that all of you see this! <br /> <br /> The music is great too - I found Diana Lorden. <br /> <br /> I also look forward to meeting Alison Lohman in white Oleander, because I am sure that she is perfect for the role of Agnes.
