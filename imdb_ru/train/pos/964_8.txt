“Yokai Daisenso” is Takashi Miike’s children's film, but, as was to be expected, it is probably too dark and scary for younger ones. However, older children may well eat it, that is, if you play it, dubbed in English. <br /> <br /> The story tells about a boy who moved with his mother to the village to live with his grandfather after a divorce. During the village holiday, the boy is chosen as the “rider of Kirin”, it is a great honor, but with this honor, of course, many dangers and adventures arise. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, evil deeds are at hand, like a woman in a white miniskirt, go-go boots and hair in a beehive teaming up with an evil Ukay, to turn people's insults and throw objects against them. And this evil manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster heading for the City of Fury itself, Tokyo. In one rather amusing scene, there are two abandoned people who watch the monster fly over the city ... one says: “Oh, this is just Gamera.” <br /> <br /> A young boy befriended Yokai, monsters of his kind, mostly benign, who isolated themselves from people, and the whole Yokai group in Japan, who fight evil together. <br /> <br /> In many ways, Miike and the team shot the Yokai films of the late 60s - early 70s and turned them into a modern action adventure for older children, which combines some strange mechanical monsters that make me think of " Transformers. The appearance of the film is great, the effects are interesting, and some of the humor will just float right above the heads of the child, but still, the elderly can enjoy it. As for adults, there’s not so much that you don’t like, if you’re a fan of Japanese monster movies, you’ll love it. <br /> <br /> Cool and fun things, sometimes dark but maybe it's just Miike .. and what a wild ride. 8 out of 10.
