I saw this film, when it came out, when I was 17 years old, and he became interested in classic rock (still exists) ... <br /> <br /> I have never loved opera before, because I hate soprano voices, but he changed all that. He was adorable in the film and had such an amazing voice. <br /> <br /> I heard on CNN that he died of pancreatic cancer at home tonight, he would be missed, and he definitely left his mark on this world. <br /> <br /> I hope to buy this film, if I can find it, watch it and enjoy. * smiles * Maybe I should go to Amazon.com and see before it is sold out.
