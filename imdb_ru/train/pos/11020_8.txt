This film is an exciting, thrilling, visually addictive action movie with a lot of dark humor. It was one of the biggest hits of 1993. This is one of the best films of Harlin. Lithgow is a terrific villain. Stallone certainly made the short return of this sharp thriller. Perhaps this is Harlin’s best work as a director. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a clear anamorphic widescreen transmission (2.35: 1) and Dolby Digital 5.1 stunning surround sound.
