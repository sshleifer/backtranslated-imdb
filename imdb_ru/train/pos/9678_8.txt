He made me wish that my happy birds could talk. See the ticket for the reviewer who missed the film. A sweet story that will appeal to people of all ages. Paulie is a nice treasure. He has a lot of clever lines that really made me laugh. I especially liked the dance episodes during his show business. You can forgive the obvious clich√©s by cheering him on in his quest to reunite with Marie. A charming film featuring two strong characters who are genuinely friendly with a little parrot, separated from their young owner. I would like to see more of a woman who is blind and must give up on a mutual journey. I liked her artistic and poetic inspirations, the shame that she could not share Paulie's reunion. Bless Paulie in his new home, finally with Marie, perhaps he was joined by a handsome young man who helped him defeat his opponents in order to complete his journey
