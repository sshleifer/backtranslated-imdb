I thought how Grinch's Christmas stole was a pretty good movie. It was not terrible and was not great, but it was nice to watch. It seemed to me that Jim Carrey was sometimes getting a little annoying. Because of this, the Grinch looked like a person with a special education, when all he needed was to be evil and insidious, but still he was backward. I really thought that the landscape, when it was not in the Grinch Cave, was beautiful, and in some places I laughed, but most of the time I thought it was just annoying. This movie could have been "SO" much better if they changed Grinch's identity, and they included a few more laugh scenes, because most of the humor was not funny. In any case, I liked how Grinch stole Christmas, but don't worry seeing
