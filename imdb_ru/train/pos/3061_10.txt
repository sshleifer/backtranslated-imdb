This film reflects the kind of ensemble work that everyone wants in each film. Barbara Bane and Donald Sutherland (who play husband and wife) are positive, discussing "family business" as if it were a grocery store or dry cleaning. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are also awesome. They play with each other as members of a first-class theater troupe who understand that a quality product requires every actor to selflessly support others. And finally, Sammy (David Dorfman). What a stunning performance from a child ... and what a strange resemblance he has with Ullman, whose son he plays! <br /> <br /> We turn to a unique story in “Panic,” and this is a rarity these days tired of formula crap. The dialogue is sharp and intelligent, and this relatively short film, however, has the ability to evoke a full range of emotions in the viewer. There are places where you can laugh, be shocked, be horrified, be saddened, be agitated, angry and love. This is not a movie that makes you jump for joy, but when it's finished, you are more than satisfied, knowing that you have spent the last ninety minutes doing a damn good job. <br /> <br /> Many of us go to the cinema if we are treated to high-quality food like this one. When will the forces wake up in Hollywood? This is a real shame when something so good cannot be seen outside the festivals, and the households are fortunate enough to have a cable.
