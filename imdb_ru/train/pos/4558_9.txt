MY LEFT LEG, in my opinion, is a great biographical film about one of the most talented authors and artists in the world. The performances were amazing, the soundtrack was great, and the casting was perfect. I thought that Christie (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented person, although I could not understand what he was saying most of the time. In addition, when he threw a tantrum, I was a little scared. Moreover, it is so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy. In conclusion, if you are a dedicated fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or like biopics, I highly recommend this great biopic about one of the world's most talented authors and artists. A real pleasure and a good time are waiting for you, so do not miss it.
