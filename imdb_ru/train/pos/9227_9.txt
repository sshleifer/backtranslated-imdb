Postfeminist portrayal of cruelty and sadism. <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! <br /> <br /> This underestimated gem of the film tells the story of Flavia, a noble girl of the fifteenth century, immured in a monastery after identifying her father and the entire medieval Christian society, upon seeing a fallen Islamic warrior. as a person, not as a demonic figure. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to accept the patriarchal rule of the monastery (directly indicated in the scene where the bishop arrives, surrounded by soldiers and monks). Flavia is clearly beginning to question the society in which she finds herself, and, faced with a whole system of enslavement, repression and violence, inevitably leads to a tragic end, not only for herself, but for everyone around her. <br /> <br /> It is believed that this part of the non-use is far from the truth. This is a film describing the consequences of violence, the consequences of patriarchal domination, the nature of the uprising and the decomposition of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> I called it in the title of this article "postfeminist". And, in the end, the triumphs of Flavia must always be spoiled, compromised and perverted by people. Even the terrible end of Flavia is made by men for men (women turn away, and only monks look without horror. <br /> <br /> As for the widely discussed violence: this is a description of the consequences of violence and the Horrors of the world, driven mad by religious excess. If he shied away from violence, it would limit the influence of the film, make the film cheaper, and allow it to be assimilated in the patriarchal discourse revealing it.In addition, it is a realistic portrait of medieval society. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot, brilliantly played (especially Florinda olkin and Maria Casares), containing a remarkable score Piovani and still uneasy after all these years, Flavia - a classic of European cinema.
