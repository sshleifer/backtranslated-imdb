Originally conceived as a solo car for Dudley Moore, "Not only ... but also" saw his former Beyond The Fringe employee Peter Cook at the first show, and took it so well, as the BBC-2 controller insisted he would have on it every week since. It was a classic comedy team - Cook was tall, handsome and witty, and Dudley was short, charismatic and musically gifted. The sketch that destroyed the house, made them in a pub, dressed in flat caps and silencers, fantasize about such movie stars as Jane Russell and Greta Garbo. It remains one of the most fun scenes of all time, and even when Cook’s corpses are still well kept together. <br /> <br /> These characters — the idiot Pete and the even bigger idiot Dud — found their way in each episode of the actual show seen elsewhere, for example, in a zoo or an art gallery. In the latter, they were chewing sandwiches, discussing works of art. “This cartoon by Leonardo Da Vinci ... I don’t see a joke!”, Says Dad. Pete points out that when he was first introduced, he probably had people in attacks. Dud almost choked on his lunch. “You really enjoy these sandwiches!”, Adores Cook. The pair threw humor at each other in a way that was joyful to contemplate. The sketches themselves set new standards for comedy, standards that would not meet until the appearance of Monty Python. <br /> <br /> As the popularity of the show grew, the quality of guest stars grew. Peter Sellers, for example, and John Lennon, the latter, representing the filmed film, based on his poem “Deaf Ted, Danuta and I”. “One foot is too small” - Duda had the role of “George Spigotta” (the name later used in the film “Blinded”), a one-legged man who jumps into the office of film producer Cook to listen to the role of 'Tarzan'. Cook is trying to fail him as best he can. “I have nothing against your right foot!” He says. “The problem is you too!” <br /> <br /> Dad occasionally interviewed the eccentric Sir Arthur Stribe-Gribling (Cook), who, when he didn’t teach crows to fly underwater, planned to open a restaurant called “Frog and Peach”. Another classic was “Jumping Nuns” (also reused in “Blinded”) But my favorite for all time should be “Superthunderstingcar”, an incredibly funny (and accurate) parody of “Thunderbirds” by Jerry and Sylvia Anderson. Pete and Dad played all the roles, and the last one did Lady Penelope. In "Ludwig" Ludwig Van Beethoven became the star of the pop show in the style of "This is Tom Jones." “The Immortal Bargo” was a tangled documentary about the life of the reclusive film star “Emma Bargo”. At an unforgettable moment, she drove through London, roaring through the loudspeaker: "I want to be alone!" <br /> <br /> In the third season, there were “Poets to the Corner” with such characters as Ronnie Barker, Spike Milligan. Barry Humphreys, Willie Rushton and others are suspended above the Gunge tank. Each of them had to improvise the line of the poem, and everyone who could not do it in rhyme, found himself in unpleasant things. <br /> <br /> A total of three seasons were made, created (at different times) by Joe McGrath, Dick Clement and Jimmy Gilbert. Unfortunately, very few publications survive. Worse, the scripts were also destroyed. I can not believe that this situation was allowed. <br /> <br /> The show ended in 1970. Then the comics hit Broadway, filmed the notorious Derek and Clive tapes, but Cook’s constantly growing alcoholism smashed them into pieces. Eight years later, Cook announced that the new series was in the near future, but this turned out to be a welcome reflection on his part. His former partner made films in America and was not going to work with Cook again (at least not at that time). <br /> <br /> Enough material was shot for the BBC-2 replay season in the early 90s. As expected, some items could not stand the same way as others. Cook died in 1995, and as a sign of respect for the BBC, he put together a program made up of various interviews with Parkinson and the show Not only ... but also. It was all quite appropriate when Pete and Dad ended up in heaven. “Bloody hell!” Exclaimed the latter. Moore passed away in 2002.
