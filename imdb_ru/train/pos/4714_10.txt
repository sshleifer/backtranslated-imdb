Famous words of the foreign owner of the nightclub Roman Maroni, the “lousy sampler”, who spends the entire film not only as an opponent to Johnny Dangerly, but also in English. <br /> <br /> Another underestimated classic that only Johnny Dangerly can do is a stunning satirical film about a kind-hearted boy who secretly leads a criminal life, helping to pay for his mother’s medical care and sending his brother to law school. br /> <br /> Yes, there is a story, but who cares? The cast, which includes Joe Piscopo, House Deluxe, Marilou Henner and Alan Hale Jr., will keep you waiting to see what happens next. <br /> <br /> There is too much laughter in it to put it on here. As an airplane, you have to pay attention, or you miss something. It is highly recommended to anyone who can laugh or two !!!
