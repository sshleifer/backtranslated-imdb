I'm not going to spoil the content of anyone who has not looked at this modest masterpiece of Kay Pollack. <br /> <br /> The world famous conductor, who was brilliantly played by Michael Nykvist, is seeking rest from stress, returning to his childhood. village. The villagers, who silently followed the genius, gradually seduced him to share their greatness. <br /> <br /> Each role in this film has a very specific goal and shows remarkable potential in each of the actors. play your own chord in short but precise words, a symphony of love. <br /> <br /> Not love in terms of relationships, but in the spirit deeply immersed in each of the characters, each of which reveals its own true story, their needs, their skeletons, desires, and much more. <br /> <br /> I will not forget to mention the two main roles played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyquist, whose dramas are played in an unforgettable harmony of emotional feedback. They touch each other with pain associated with their inability to love themselves. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyquist is really experienced here in a very complex situation, in one of those films that either turn out to be catastrophic or fantasy. And itâ€™s fantastic from beginning to end, not one second less or more than enough, you have a sense of change and a taste for more. <br /> <br /> Today, of course, one of the best films I had the pleasure to watch.
