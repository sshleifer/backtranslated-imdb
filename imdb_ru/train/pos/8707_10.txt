The Swordsman is one of the most beautiful romantic films I have ever seen. The name of the film can be translated into English as "swordman". The main character (Sasha) was born with one exceptional ability: he can protect himself with an extremely sharp sword that emerges from under the skin in his hand. At first glance, he may seem like another stupid superhero from a meaningless film about unreal events and feelings. But it's not a swordtail. It can hardly be called an anti-hero. I think that he is just a man who has lost the meaning of his life and faith in good, justice and love. In his life, he never met a man who could understand and love him (except his mother). Every step he takes is stained with blood; he takes revenge on all for the gift that has become a curse for him. And suddenly he meets her. She does not need empty talk and explanations. She loves him for what he is. She doesn't care what he did. The fact that he is next to her is more important than anything else. But she soon learns his secret: he kills two people (her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect her in front of her eyes. Even after that, she could not escape her feelings. They are trying to escape, but there is nowhere to hide. Finally they have a serious car accident. He is in a cage; she is in a mental hospital. They know nothing about each other, but she believes that he will save her. He overcomes many obstacles, but finally finds it. They run again, but they are not invulnerable. She is injured, she needs rest, but the police almost catch them. He does not know what to do, they are cornered, and then his sword begins to cut trees, a helicopter around them, but this is not necessary, because she is already dead in his arms, and he is again a lonely person in the whole world.
