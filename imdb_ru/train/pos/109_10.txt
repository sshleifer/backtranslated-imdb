This film is for those who believe that cinema is the seventh art, not an entertainment business. Lars von Trier creates a noir atmosphere of post-war Germany, completely mesmerizing. You fall asleep and you are only released at the end of the credits. The plot is sure to go second, but it's still a fascinating story with difficult questions that come up. Just great.
