I have to admit that from the EROS MOVIE COLLECTION this should be what I love most, as well as another one that I also considered. History is what really makes you look. Many EROS films have a hammer-like plot that smashed it into pieces before starting production when you watch it. Everything is centered around sex, and who can find out how many different people will come at the end of the film. And, my God, never watch one of these films when someone pulls out a gun. It doesn’t work because it’s almost ridiculous, but you don’t want to waste energy on it. <br /> <br /> “Losing control” is exactly what its name is. The main character, the main character (surprisingly talented and beautiful Cyrus Reed). Control is the control of a person over his feelings, his body and feelings. And one man changes everything for her, makes her almost another woman. But the mirror shatters. This is a great movie that I would like to come up with first !! <br /> <br /> 10/10
