I saw it on the big screen and was encapsulated. The period of the young years of Queen Victoria is a mystery, and this is an excellent description of how a young girl took on one of the highest roles in the world. <br /> <br /> The script is perfect, the acting is amazing History and attention to detail outside this world. Emily Blunt is as beautiful as Victoria. It's funny how her mother plays Elizabeth the 1st, and William IV is played by Prince Albert! (Think Blackadder). <br /> <br /> This image of Victoria shows that she was once a rebellious young woman - Iâ€™m sure she would be at the Jeremy Kyle show if it were then: her boyfriend is trying to steal my life. "< br /> <br /> A beautiful part of much of the history of Britain and the Commonwealth.
