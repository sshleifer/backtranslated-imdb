This is true for the original manga with the same name, aka (Tramps Like Us in the USA), but you can still enjoy it, even if you have not read the manga. This is a different kind of tail, showing a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone else. However, due to her external strength, she is afraid to show her inner feelings and therefore allows those around her to injure her with their blunt comments. The only one who really understands her and with whom she can feel at ease is her new pet ... man ... Momo. If you want something other than ordinary boring stuff with some great J-Dorama actors (Japanese drama), then this is definitely a series for watching ... and reading!
