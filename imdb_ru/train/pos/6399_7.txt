Although this is certainly not the best film I've ever seen, it definitely cost $ 8 (which is not the case with many films these days.) <br /> <br /> It was a pleasant story about the true story although many of the details of the real story were distorted for the film (i.e., the character of Billy Sunday in a real story united three or four people). Robert De Niro, of course, was good, and Cuba Gooding Jr. was also impressive.
