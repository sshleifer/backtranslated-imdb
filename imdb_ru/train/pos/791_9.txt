Having no idea about this film before watching it on the Rialto channel, I found it to be a pleasant, piercing and enriching film. <br /> <br /> Casting was superb. I loved all the characters, they were a bit exaggerated in some places (but this is a movie). The way he looked, and the pleasant frivolous trip of the main character lasted until it became bad, as in real life it can. Yes, I thought Andy McDowell was great. I was especially interested to watch this film as soon as it started, because people so often joke about her acting skills (I find it rather strange, because she, in my opinion, is always a good actress). <br /> <br /> The end, when Andy's character said “sometimes I feel that he was never here,” and so on, it was as complete as it really is in such a situation (with which I can personally identify yourself, then there was this great classic Nocturne play. I think Chopin, which was an excellent way to finish (exclude a light comedy at the end, which was probably unnecessary). <br /> <br /> I say “well done” to the creators of the film - I have seen 1000 of the worst films!
