This film really woke me up, as if he awakens the main male character of this boldly excellent film from his dream of life. <br /> <br /> This guy John (Ben Chaplin) leads his mediocre safe cashier’s life in a bank in a small provincial English town, while an amazingly wild, insane girl for Nadi (Nicole Kidman), ordered by email from Russia, enters his life to become his beloved wife according to the plan of John. However, there is a glitch - Nadia does not say a word in the language of John. Despite the fact that he is calm and devoid of emotions outside, John is so keen on Nadia's beautiful, that instead of using the full return policy for the matching service, he buys her vocabulary to begin the process of communication. <br /> <br /> What happens next in the story really shocks poor John from his densely well-paid clerk who is safe, into a decent-minded decision-making figure, giving the viewer a subconscious message "you probably would have acted in the same way" . <br /> <br /> Kidman, Kassel and Cassowitz are a great Russian team, and they are almost indistinguishable from real things, “almost” only due to the slight accent present in their Russian dialogues, but light enough to impress their native Russian hard work. done to make the words sound right. Nicole Kidman once again proves his talent by playing a character completely different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is fast and exciting, and you are certainly not ready to stop watching, when the final headlines appear, you will rather feel that you are in the middle of the plot, and you have a desire to see the sequel as soon as it is will come out. <br /> <br /> My advice is to go out and immediately get this movie, watch it and enjoy. To summarize, he has an unusual plot, a great game and ideas below the surface. Like the idea of ​​“rude awakening” from the artificial safe everyday life of a wheel in the Society’s car, the life that members of Fight Club so eagerly craved, and the car from which Pink Floyd sings (“Welcome to the car”). ! "). I can argue that in the end John rather went with Sophia on his way to the unknown, than did not meet her at all. <br /> <br /> Thank you, writers, for a wonderful story, and everyone else for this great film! Please make a sequel! And you can put it anywhere and name the place as you like, because the authenticity of this place has nothing to do with 99.9999 percent of potential viewers, I'm sure of that.
