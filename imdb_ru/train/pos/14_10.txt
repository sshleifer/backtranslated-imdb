This film has a special place in my heart, because when I first saw it, I taught adults how to read and write. It sounded very true to me and even to the outstanding student that I had at that time. There are scenes that make you swallow sudden emotions, and those that even cause a smile on your face due to the clear identification with the characters and their situation. <br /> <br /> Wonderful performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro, marked by their best works, the magnificent turn of the young Martha Plimpton, the inspiring storyline and the exciting musical score create the most pleasant and useful impressions.
