Jerome Crabb plays the title role in this film. I have seen this film 6 times, and I'm still not tired of it. This film is similar to Flesh + Blood in some ways. Gerald Soatman is a great writer. He wrote all the Dutch films of Paul Verhoeven. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I saw all of his films, except Showgirls. My mother doesn't love him so much, but I disagree. I think that all his films are suitable for watching, especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith has made several of his films, including “Remember All,” “Basic Instinct,” and “Empty Man.” I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died. Dutch films are different, but still enjoyable.
