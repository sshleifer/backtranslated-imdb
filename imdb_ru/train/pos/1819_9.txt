When I first looked at it, we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and watched it about 3 times. We just watched it again, and I liked it more than the last time I watched it !! :) :() <br /> <br /> The film is mainly about two dogs named Charlie and Itch (voiced by House DeLuis, and I love House DeLouise!). Charlie is half gangster and half yummy that I like. Itch is his bosom friend. Charlie is killed by his friend (NOT) and sent to heaven. When Charlie comes back to life, this is the beginning of an amazing adventure. <br /> <br /> Five main reasons why I am absolutely CRAZY about this movie: First: I love characters (except for Carface). My favorite threesome is Charlie, Itch and a little girl named Anne-Marie, who arrives a little later. Two: I love the period of the story in which this film is set. It is established during a ban in the United States. Three: the animation of Don Blute is (as usual) gorgeous. The backgrounds are nice too. Fourth: in this film there is a strange excitement that keeps me on the edge of space. Five: the songs in this are beautiful. My favorite song starts with "I need Brazil, pulse, thrill" ... <br /> <br /> So watch this wonderful movie when you can, you will not be disappointed! :);) :()
