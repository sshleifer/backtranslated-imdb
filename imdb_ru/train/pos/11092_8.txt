The 52-pick up never received as much respect as it should. He works on many levels and has a complex but understandable plot. Participating actors give some of their best performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Shader and John Glover are perfectly played and give deep images of characters. Also noteworthy is Vanity, who was supposed to turn this into a serious acting career, given her unexpected abilities, and Kelly Preston, whose character will haunt you for several days. Anyone who loves action in combination with a difficult complicated story will enjoy it.
