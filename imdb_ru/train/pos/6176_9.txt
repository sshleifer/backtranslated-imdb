The 1986 television film "The Spirit" was the pilot for a possible series. However, Spirit creator Will Eisner did not like the film, so the series was not filmed. I thought it was a very interesting movie and captured the spirit (sorry) of the comic with a modern twist. I wish it had materialized into the series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was the perfect Spirit. Nana Visitor was great Ellen Dolan and, of course, later moved to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine years later. Perhaps with the release of the big version of Frank Miller "The Spirit", more people will be able to see this rare pearl of the history of the Spirit. It seems that when Hollywood shoots a film from an already created character or idea, someone will inevitably look for previous versions of the object and publish it on video to earn a few dollars. When Antonio Banderas donned the Zorro mask, we were able to get the masked earlier versions of the hero on a DVD, such as the great version of Alain Delon of the 1970s (although all the copies I had ever seen were poorly edited). He hopes that someone will soon release Spirit's television adventure on DVD.
