“Girlfight” follows a project in which a New York schoolgirl lives out of a sense of worthlessness in the world of amateur boxing, where she gains self-esteem, purpose, and much more. Although the film is not about boxing, boxing is all about the film. So much so that you can almost smell the sweat. Technically and artistically a good shot with a sense of honesty and reality about it, “Girlfight” is not a nestling or a “Rocky”. It is rather a very human drama that even viewers who do not know boxing can communicate with.
