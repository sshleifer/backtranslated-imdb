I can not say that this film deserves something close to the amount of vitriol, which some reviewers are laying on it. Yes, it got stuck due to overloaded time, unsystematic editing, and excessive dependence on special effects of cheeseball. And she does not have enough energy, the necessary comedy to make the average viewer sit without checking her watch. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, he also has funny funny lines, a talented and serious cast, as well as the classic premise of a loser. Macy, Stiller and Azaria are great as a “core” team, and Garofalo and Studi do an excellent job adding conflict and diversity to the team. I cannot say that Rubens or Mitchell added a lot to the film as a whole, although everyone had few chances to prove themselves. <br /> <br /> The plot, as I said above, is your classic “not so good” material. There are no surprises, since you know that they will win. What makes it worthwhile is not the absurd, tasteless heroes and villains, but the dialogue and interaction between the characters. Underneath it all, these people are children at heart who just want to do the right thing. The best scenes in the film give this film its emotional foundation. Look at Azaria’s relationship with his long-suffering mother; Macy's charming innocence of his unwillingness to accept Cap. Amazing Secret Identity; Stiller's rage (not much different from the strange, spasmodic guy you once knew, who always fell into awe, impotent rage on the playing field); Garofalo's desire to avenge his father. This childish belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place is the true appeal of superhero comics; and under his parody exterior, Mystery Men shows us why these battered comics are so important to many. <br /> <br /> He never turns into a full-fledged whole because of the huge number of semi-dry plots (romance, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the main plot is so funny that he compensates for this. The fact that it should be good, meaningless fun seems to have been lost by some reviewers here, so I’ll write a warning: if you are the type of viewer who finds his pleasure from the Itch and Scratch cartoon to be destroyed inexplicable and illogical Do I believe that this is something like * * * snorts * ... _magic_ xylophone? ”), then you are too literal and humorous for this film. Instead, rent a Sandler movie. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
