This is a movie for fun; I did not think the world made a social commentary from one small film. Personally, I think this film is ridiculous, audacious and memorable. This is a fantasy, like an ashtray that becomes a princess. This film was made very well, I could add that in the 70s it was a period of the best experiments in the movie with the possibility of mentioning human sexuality. This film is not about a homosexual man or not, but about love in all its strange forms. This film shows some of the gay reality in the 70s in Hollywood or California. Beautiful boys are supervised by not very beautiful men. Women who had to remain deeply locked in an emotional closet or take risks without a career. Bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community. <br /> <br /> Then fantasy begins !! Let's mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor, and what do we have? Well, this movie, which in any case was better than this grim repetition of "The Big Big Thing". Perhaps someone should have asked the entire film crew to watch this movie, and then try to do better. <br /> <br /> I liked this film when I saw it in the 70s, and it still brings a smile on my lips. I sincerely advise everyone who wants a funny, gentle movie to curl up with popcorn and have some fun. Some people need to be enlightened !!! And this is the movie with which you have to do it! <br /> <br />
