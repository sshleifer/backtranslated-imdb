This film is as good as it is difficult to find. The hero of the film (both the writer and the director) is Simon Geist, a man “having an agenda”. He creates a fake magazine to be able to interview Los Angeles pigs — actors, models, musicians — who believe that their own feces do not smell. With intelligent dialogue, Zucovic succeeds in this. Of course, the budget for this film was probably the fact that he paid for a used car, but this film is so solid and so well written that it works very well. Any person who can reproduce Edward Munch's Cry in the reflection of a silver bin in a local coffee shop must be nominated for a certain type of award. Give this film a chance and listen to what it says ... because they have been doing the same car since 1986 ... it's called "car." Bravo, Zhukovich, Bravo!
