These are cult things. My friends and I gather once a year to enjoy this movie. It is very funny and very dry. I have seen this move dozens of times, but so far I have not enjoyed it. The actors are funny, and with each viewing, everything becomes better! If you like “morons from space”, you will like it. Great game in the war of the worlds. I love the rampage of Red Necks to get aliens, a bug on the hood, DOD, a heat-rich annihilator, a minefield, Red Camouflage, overcoming a speed limit of 1,800 miles per hour! "I'll take the bucket!" Very funny. I would like it to be released on DVD! Forget negative reviews, see for yourself!
