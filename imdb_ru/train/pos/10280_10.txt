The gaming house is a must. So nice from time to time to watch movies that are perfect for dozens. I have seen several films that can capture you so quickly. From the first scene, this film simply captures you. <br /> <br /> I try very hard not to give away too much to those who may not have seen it yet, but there will be a FEW SPOILERS, THERE WILL NOT READ MORE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW. <br /> <br /> I would say that “The House of Games” is not just a great movie, but also the best movie about fraudsters I've ever seen, without exception. From the moment the movie ends, it can be played. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Crouse, because Margaret Ford is just perfect, from her manner to bending her voice, she immediately gets the part. Joe Mantegna was great too. The dialogue in this film has an unforced, almost indescribable quality, and these two people communicate in their views just as they do with their voices. I also liked the way the film was shot, in such a grainy, surreal way, it was perfect and helped to make the film the way it was. <br /> <br /> There were several films that I saw and loved that it reminded me of the inclusion of The Grifters and Ordinary Suspects, but in fact, The House of Games is completely different in its own way. Margaret and Mike are two of the most exciting characters I've seen on the big screen, and they have not only the chemical composition of the screen, which is strong and tangible from the moment they meet, but also the build-up that starts from the moment they see each the other is electrified. You know that something will happen, but you do not know what. And only when you think that you have guessed that this is “something”, do you understand that you didn’t even scratch the surface ... <br /> <br /> “The House of Games” is one of those films that can be at a dead end in a certain genre of movie type, but in fact it is a film about human nature. The study of character is not only the mind of a fraudster, but also a victim. As the film progresses, and we learn more and more about the main characters, we learn about them not only through what they say, but also how they say it. This is an excellent character study, and it is impeccable in terms of its output. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would rate it 10 out of 10, name it (although this is not my favorite movie, quite high on the list) is certainly outstanding and would go so far as to say that he is considered one of the best character studies and contains some of the best "turns" I have ever seen. Although I love all types and genres of films, when it comes to films about the human psyche, in fact it is not much better than that. Watch this movie.
