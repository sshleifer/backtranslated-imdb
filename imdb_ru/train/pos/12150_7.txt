This film is one of many Kung Fu action films shot in Asia in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is full of cheap sound effects, dubbed dialogue and lightning martial arts. But unlike most films of this genre, it also has a decent plot and a lot of great comedies. When the workers of the dye factory are forced out by Manchu hooligans from work, they hire a fraudster (Gordon Liu) to try to scare them away. When his attempt fails miserably, he enters the Shaolin Temple to learn how to fight for real. But instead of making him a Kung Fu apprentice, the Master instead orders him to build forests to cover the roofs of all 36 chambers. Well, it turns out that by completing these black tasks (by tying and tying bamboo sticks), he acquires the skills to become a kung-fu expert! It's like a child in karate, when Mr. Miagie teaches Daniel the basics of karate, forcing him to do household chores - “Wax, wax” and so on. There are many great comedies from start to finish, and a lot of action at the end, when Gordon Liu again faces his Manchurian tormentors. “This time it's not just tricks, it's a real thing!” Liu says, proudly pounding on his chest. If you like classic Kung Fu movies, you don't want to miss this one!
