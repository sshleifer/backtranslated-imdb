Kudos to Cesar Montano for the revival of the film Cebuano! Panaghoy sa Suba is very good - there is drama, action, romance and scene that will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Although the story is not as original (a love triangle - or love with four corners, Japanese occupation, rebellion, an American as a lord), his presentation is something cool, especially he uses the original language - Bisaya for Filipino , nipongo for japanese and english for american. <br /> <br /> This film will be one of the best Pinna films this year. <br /> <br /> Go see it!
