I must say, I was surprised at the quality of the film. It was much better than I expected. The script and acting is pretty good. The director also did a good job. Although some scenes look a little awkward, overall this is not a bad film. The idea was definitely brilliant, and the truth was not revealed until the very end. The atmosphere in the mental hospital was pretty good. The plot was clear, consistent and thoughtful. This may seem a bit boring to some people, because the storyline is very focused and they spend time developing characters and stories. Moral of the story is a worthy film for its genre, and it is surprisingly good.
