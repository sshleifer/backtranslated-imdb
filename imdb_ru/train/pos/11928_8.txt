Although this film appears to be based on the film with the same title in 1951, released by MGM and starring Janet Lee, it still remains an excellent film. Danny Glover in one of his best performances revives George Knox, a loser for the baseball manager. As for the fact that this film is “complicated”, how about adding Christopher Lloyd (his stage experience works and shows in his performances on the screen of a wonderful actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (“The Third Stone from the Sun”), Brenda Fricher (charming and well-experienced Irish actress), Tony Danza (yes, even he is good at this movie), Matthew McConaughey (he stole the show in Dazed and Lost), and his role may not be so important in this movie, but he got exposed ), Adrien Brody (what I said about Matthew McConaughey, carry and Adrien, with the exception of “Stunned and Confused”, some great actors such as Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Rancho Wilder), Neil McDonough (Witt Bass) and the experienced a veteran in one of his last performances, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, owner of California Angels), and the rest of the cast do an excellent job, as well as a great storyline that cheers up pretty everyone, I don’t care what depressions of depression are you in? I liked this movie as a child, and it brings back memories when I watch it today. I need it on DVD. I recommend this to any parent who is looking for something that their children have not seen, and everyone else, for that matter.
