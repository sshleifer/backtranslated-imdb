I find it very intriguing that Lee Radziwill, the sister of Jackie Kennedy and the cousin of these women, prompts Males to make Big Edie and Little Edie the subject of the film. They can certainly be considered "skeletons" in the family closet. Additional features on the DVD include several modern fashion designers, attributing their ideas to these wonderful women. I would say that everyone who is interested in fashion finds the discussion of these designers fascinating. (i.e. "Are they crazy? Or did I miss something?"). This film is hard to find. Netflix doesn't have it. Granite though.
