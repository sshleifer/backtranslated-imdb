As a longtime Red Sox fan, I just needed to watch a movie. That was great! While there may never be enough live performances from the wonderful 2004 Red Sox season, there were great shots of some of my favorite Red Sox players. Although the film is certainly very interesting, he has enough baseball material from the terrific return of the 2004 Red Sox to make it one of the top 10 films of all time. I especially liked the Red Sox fans who were part of Ben's baseball family. The scene where Ben meets up with his buddies on a rough day to determine who will get places in certain games is fun! Be sure to see if you are looking for a useful movie to watch with your spouse, date or other significant person ... especially if you are a baseball fan ... and even more especially if you are a Red Sox fan !!!
