It should be the best adaptation I have ever seen, she is my favorite, and I think she is very close to the book. What really makes it a must-see, although it is the casting of two main actors. The beautiful Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester, whom I saw on the screen thoughtfulness and tragedy, while Zela Clark is the perfect combination of strength, courage, shyness and gentleness, like Jane. The story (as I am sure most people know) is that the young and simple Jane Eyre is a teacher at a girls â€™charity school in the 1800s that advertises its services as a governess in newspapers. She is offered the position of the Governess in the large mansion of Thornfield Hall to instruct Adele the young ward of the mysterious and respected owner of the halls of Mr. Rochester. After a few months, he falls in love with Jane and runs a few situations to try to find out if Jane is in love with him as madly as she is. and when it is, its effects are devastating. It is a touching and well-played drama with beautiful locations and gorgeous costumes, as well as, as I said earlier, an excellent acting game, especially from Zel and Timothy.
