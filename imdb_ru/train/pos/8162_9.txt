Like Dr. Alan Feynston, Corbin Bernsen turns an amazingly crazy play into "Dentist." <br /> <br /> With his already obsessive obsessive tendencies in full swing, the IRS is pursuing him, and a very suspicious acting wife; Dr. Alan Finestone is losing common sense more and more each day. <br /> <br /> When Doc truly realizes that his wife has an affair with a local boy, he begins a series of events that torture, kill, and destroy! "Dentist" is a solid movie! Bernsen makes Dr. Fineston's character attractive and hateful at the same time. Even though he is completely out of his pumpkin, the audience will still sympathize with him. That my friends ..... damn good at acting. <br /> <br /> A good cast of supporting actors completes this jewel of the film. Excellent direction, good killings and bloodshed, as well as effective stimulation will entertain you throughout the film. <br /> <br /> STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!
