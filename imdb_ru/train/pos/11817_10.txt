I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young. I did not know who any of the actors was, and I did not know that the film would turn out different from what its preview was. I, of course, loved it. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty stars as detective Dick Tracy, who fought crime in the 1930s and who pursues the biggest bosses in the city. This time Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) killed a very influential man and is about to capture the city with his girlfriend, singer Heartless Mahoni (Madonna), who is following Tracy. It gets worse because the new criminal is intruding, and the worst thing is that this criminal has no face. He or she is very unknown. In addition, famous villains returned from the comic book collection. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was very colorful and creative. It was interesting and fun to watch, especially in childhood. Warren Beaty was like the James Bond of the 1930s, as he played Dick Tracy. <br /> <br /> The film featured ensembles: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headley, William Forsyth, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Ed O Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin, Charles Derning. Plus more! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a movie for all ages, and it's a fun movie for the whole family. Believe me.
