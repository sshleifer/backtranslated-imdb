The question is, can this entertainment film be considered "bad"? My husband and I took it to the video store for 99 cents simply because of the name and the fact that Vestron Pictures was written on the box (Vestron was highly valued as a sign of quality since I first acquired the legendary Suburb and "Class 1984"). We did not expect the film to be full of victory, like this one. Your main plot is as follows: Grange, this gangster thug from planet Earth, robs the “shore of the moon” and is sentenced to a colony on a remote planet (I don't even remember the name of the planet) for mining for bauxite and other minerals. The “governor” of this colony and the owner of the mine exploit prisoners for labor. Walker, the bounty hunter (apparently one of the three on the entire planet), reminds the prisoners that there is no salvation, because of the entire planet there is only one shuttle, and they will have to deal with it. Then there is the nameless “colonel,” a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting recurring nightmare. Most of the film centers around "futuristic" car chases (dunes with plywood slamming around) with an abundance of explosions. The planet itself looks suspicious, like Hemet, California or one of those other dusty outposts of the Inner Empire. But what makes the film really shine is an amazingly amazing soundtrack featuring some of the mid-80s Los Angeles punk bands. I seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pinned to vinyl, but definitely worth buying a movie just for the soundtrack. I can’t even remember the names of the groups (they are listed in the credits), except for “Exploding White Mice”, because it was the only thing I heard about before seeing this movie, but I definitely learn <br /> <br / > Essentially, the movie is definitely not a waste of your time, and it’s best to get it with 12 packets of beer and a few of your closest friends.
