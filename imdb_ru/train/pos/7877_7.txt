Write the word <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. Not really! What makes the brave and brilliant Madhur Bhandarkar "Page 3", it destroys the myth associated with glamor and brilliance that color the pages of our newspapers and whose lives (read party habits) we accompany with such manic zeal that only our inner can explain the voyeur trait, <br /> <br /> Phenomenon page 3 is just as pitiable as it is mysterious. How exactly he obtained such control over the printed word and when he began to penetrate the front page is the subject of another discussion. Bhandarkar deftly avoids this. He deals only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. And at the same time, he brings together the various elements of this lifestyle. Like Robert Altman (although I do not compare Bhandarkar with the genius of Altman), Bhandarkar uses many characters to promote his motive. Whether it is a NRI page, a recently hated gatekeeper, a future model, a secular politician, or an author of erotic stories; All characters are entered with a goal, and each of them has a separate character sketch, even if their parts may be insignificant. And therein lies the appeal of the film. <br /> <br /> Concona Saint Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 for Nation Today. Initially pleased with her work, she soon begins to see the deformity of this abdomen, which is covered with his fake and cosmetic waste. But Bhandarkar resists the temptation to turn this story into a film about morality and avoids focusing on only one character. Consequently, the film is not only about Madhavi, but equally about Deepak Suri (Boman Irani), the editor of Madhavi, who passively takes on his role as a gear wheel of a larger mechanism, Anjali Tapar (Sonya Razdan) is a layman choking on social , Abhijit (Rehan the Engineer) - a makeup artist-homosexual and roommates Madhavi Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) - a cheeky stewardess and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - an aspiring actress. It seems impossible to assimilate so many characters (and even more) in one story, but this is the complete merit of Nina Arora and Manoj Traction in writing a stressful script. The conversations Sanjiv Datta and Bhandarkar were written with great attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Any story, no matter how good, may not succeed. Fortunately, “Page 3” is full of actors, not stars. Konkona fulfills its role, supported by the author with light ease. The same boman. Sandhya Mridul gets the best writing, but almost overdo it. Atul Kulkarni wasted, albeit with a signed character. At times, the director seems too interested to include as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts in which they are used do not make them look hasty. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Bhandarkar’s attempt to saturate our voyeurism, but he takes another step forward. He takes us inside the photos and shows the terrible realities of this sect of humanity, which, oddly enough, lives in a different and distant world. These are the same people who indulged in New Year's fun, while a few hundred kilometers from them their countrymen were devastated by the ferocity of nature! Clever writing, skillfully combined songs, skillful performances and a sincere feeling of sincerity - this is what makes this film worthy, despite the lack of sophistication and low production value. "Page 3" is the best way to start the new year in the cinema. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Rating - **** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very good ** *** Excellent! <br /> <br /> January 29, 2005
