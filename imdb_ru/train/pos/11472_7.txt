Being a fan of the further study of the phenomenon of school filming, this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea. Presented as a series of videos made by two concerned men (I cannot refer to those who kill as boys or teenagers) months of preparation leading up to the zero day (the code name of the day they will attack), which the film tries to present situation from the opposite end of the gun. It seems, intending to depict the pain they are experiencing, yet the focus is on literal preparation. The problem is that few emotions are delivered directly. The only moment when emotions became overwhelming was the final, as expected. But, coming to this point, it is never clear why they are planning this. They tell us the obligatory story that they were ridiculed, but the film also seems to contradict this. Without destroying the film, it is easy to say that it was a great attempt, and she had the same good intentions, but she did not pay off because of careless filmmaking. All filmmakers are amateurs to promote a home-made video concept, but the story and continuity are weak. The film seems to want the audience to decide a lot, but is also unable to provide information for such an event. The ending is harsh, and it doesn't look like it finishes everything that the film began.
