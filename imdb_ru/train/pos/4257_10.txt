This film is about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family, just great! <br /> <br /> This is not an idealistic film, I would say, it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s, when the main story takes place. The characters are very cute, but there are also “dark” sides, which makes you believe that they are real people. A great movie with great actors to show that life is not always fun, but that you can find happiness with “fire and passion,” as the main character Gigi would say.
