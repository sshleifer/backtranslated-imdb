Short, but long enough, Cat Soup is a very wild ride to watch. Once I just looked through my “On Demand” list in the anime section and came across it and decided to watch it. I spent the whole time mostly sitting with agape jaw. All this time I either was free from thoughts, or had a fleeting one who shouted "TURN IT OFF !!!". But I did not. And actually, I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> The animation is awesome. Very artistic, strange and dark. I personally loved it for an amazing animation, but the seemingly vacant story behind it is equally compelling to me. <br /> <br /> A young boy - well, a cat - goes in search of the soul of his sister. In the first part, she lies in a sick bed, and soon a kind of grim reaper visits her. Her soul is split in half. One was returned by the cat boy, and the other half is lost. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the rest of the film is a bit lost for me. I expect them to return, and their world ... perhaps falling apart slowly? Perhaps her lack of soul is the answer for this, because the rest of the film contains various stages in which the world is. First there is a gigantic flood, and then it dries up in the gloomy desert, and then everything freezes (thanks to what is god or fate, as you will see). Then I believe that they find the sister's soul in the shape of an orange flower. After that, the whole world disappears. Haha, completely misunderstood, but it makes me shiver every time. <br /> <br /> Despite seemingly random scenes, I’m sure that there is a deeper message behind it, if you look at it enough and do some research. Personally, I LOVE little things like this, and would like to take the time to figure it out. But for some people, this is probably not their cup of tea. This sounds very disturbing, so if you like your live anime, this is not a movie for you. However, if you have an unbiased opinion, I highly recommend this film.
