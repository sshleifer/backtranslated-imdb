This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen in my life. This is not just a fun movie or a well-made movie. This is a milestone in the art of animation, and even if it were not so, only the technical skills that led to its creation would give it a place in the history of animation. <br /> <br /> Vladislav Starevich created a stop-video about the secret life of beetles. It represented a holistic world of insects with workplaces, houses, nightclubs, cinemas, even small props, such as posters, bicycles and paintings. <br /> <br /> In this film, he tells a simple story about hypocrisy and revenge. Mr. Zhuk has a romance with a dancing dragonfly, much to the chagrin of a grasshopper; but he is the operator and decides to take the shot. Mr. Beetle returns home and discovers that Mrs Beetle has her own romance. Mr. Beetle chases away her lover, but forgives his wife. Two make up and go to the movies. And the movie they watch is Mr. Beetle and Dragonfly. Described in this way it sounds trite, but once seen it becomes an exciting piece of cinema. Together with Emil Kohl and Jiri Trnka, Vladislav Starevich largely invented everything that future animators will use in their work. For this reason, it should not remain forgotten.
