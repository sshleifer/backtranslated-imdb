John Carpenter's Halloween is, frankly, a masterpiece of horror. It tells the immortal story of a runaway mentally ill Michael Myers, who returns to his hometown on Halloween night to stalk and kill a group of nannies. <br /> <br /> This was the first and undoubtedly the best Halloween franchise. Carpenter shows great restraint in slowly advancing the story and shaping cute characters; unusual for a horror picture. <br /> <br /> Even more unusual is the lack of blood and blood, and yet this is the worst Halloween ever. Get it! <br /> <br /> Halloween marked the debut of a Jamie Lee Curtis film and a certain point in the career of the late great Donald Pleasans. This is a classic.
