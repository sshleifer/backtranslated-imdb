It seems that Hal Hartley's films are a hit or a miss with most viewers. This film is no exception to this rule. Fay Grim has been serving as a continuation of Hartley's Henry Fula since 1998. This time, the focus is on Henry's ex-wife (who is always honored by the always-desired Parker Posey), whom the CIA talk about the unpublished book of Henry about all his shady relationships. Meanwhile, Fay gets into an odyssey, dealing with international spies, etc. The film is a little stuck in the second half. If you have been a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, then this is not to be missed. For the novice Hartley Timer, who only heard about his film making technique, you can check out his earlier films before shooting this one (especially if you havenâ€™t seen Henry yet). I admired the camera work, which at times reminded me of some early photographs of Man Ray.
