The first was good and original. I was a good horror / comedy movie. So I heard that the second one was made, and I had to watch it. <br /> <br /> What really makes this film work is Judd Nelson’s character and sometimes a clever script. A pretty good script for a man who wrote movies with “Final Destination”, and the direction was fine. Sometimes there are scenes where it looks as if it was filmed on a home video camera with a grainy appearance. <br /> <br /> Great movie for television. It was worth the rent and probably worth buying, just to feel this pleasant eerie feeling and see how Stanley Judd Nelson does what he does best. <br /> <br /> I invite newcomers to see the first one before watching the sequel, you just have an idea of ​​what Stanley looks like and a bit of history.
