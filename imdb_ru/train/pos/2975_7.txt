Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park, are returning with something completely different. They create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball. This sport is called baseball. He looks like a basketball, except that the rules of baseball are involved and there is another letter e in the title. Here's how you play: you just shoot the ball, while these two guys are trying to distract you from hitting. It sounds easy. In fact, I can try it once. Once the game hits the streets, it soon becomes a huge success. Who would know that 2 immature friends can invent a sport that has become so successful? <br /> <br /> My opinion <br /> <br /> “Baseball” is a very rough and stupid parody filled with a lot of cruelty, but in fact it delivers a bit of laughter and a lot of entertainment. A definite recommendation for those of you who love slaps and rough humor.
