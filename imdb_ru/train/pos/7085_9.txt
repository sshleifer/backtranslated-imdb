I just bought a DVD and I have to say (after seeing Brazil and Fear hate in Las Vegas), Terry does it again. In addition to being a fan of Monty Python films, this fantastic thriller is played by Terry Gilliam, whom Bruce Willis plays a remarkable role in the role of James Cole, as well as (possibly my favorite character) Brad Pitt, who played the madness of Jeffrey Goins. It is necessary to have for fans of science fiction or a movie lover of any type, because it includes suspense, drama, action, etc. intended to destroy the human race, which in the past was unleashed by the "army of twelve monkeys." James Cole (Bruce Willis) sent in 1996 (when the virus was launched) to find out about the disease, so scientists could find a cure. Before moving on, James Cole lives in an underground society, and animals rule the world on the surface because of an illness that will kill people. in any case, when he is sent back in time, he is actually sent back to 1990, where he is sent to a psychiatric hospital because of his messages to people about the virus. During his stay, he meets Jeffrey Goins (Brad Pitt), who later has primary responsibility for the destruction of the human race. He also meets his psychiatrist ((Madeleine Stowe), who eventually unites with Bruce to save the world (because she sees that he is right in his statements), he is sent back and forth from his time to the past and eventually sent in 1996, where he then questions his own sanity, but later stops to show the tense final quarter of the film, and later brings to some shocking climax where he tries to stop the person carrying the virus (not actually Brad Pitt) and the place of this is shot by the police as the killer leaves.
