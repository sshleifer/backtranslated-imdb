Elmer Fadd laughs, lounging in his chair and reading a comic book, his dog comfortably sleeps next to the fireplace. Everything is calm until a flea passes by. (The flea is dressed in the costume of a farmer with a large sombrero and bears a knapsack with the name “A. Flea”.) He pulls out his telescope and notices the dog. (We see a big shot of dog ass and fleas whistling in excitement, shouting "T-Bone!" Then he sings: "There is food around the corner, food is around the corner!") <br /> <br /> This creates a storyline this cute but disgusting flea tormenting a poor dog. A fool is hilarious when he reacts to fleas. <br /> <br /> The drawings of his huge teeth, fierce right next to the fleeing flea, are smart, and the dialogue of the dog made me laugh loudly several times. This may be the funniest dog I've ever seen in a cartoon! Poor dog, under the threat of having to take a bath to NOT respond when a stupid flea hurts him. Watching the sick is almost painful, as fleas on the dog use picks, jackhammers and the like. He puts the petards behind the dog. It's cruel!
