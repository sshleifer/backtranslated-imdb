Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw this in a movie at 4 years old, and I have very vivid memories of this. Seeing this as an adult, you can catch references that are far above the heads of the target audience - for example, a piece where the gray wig of the witch Jimmy is torn off, and the witch Hazel (Cass) grins: "I KNEW that she has brown roots!". This, of course, strongly depends on the culture of the floral power of the time, and in some respects quite progressively. For example, the track “Miscellaneous” sends a clear message to young viewers that you must be yourself, do not run around with the pack and take care that you are different. This could be a hymn for the gay community, it should be a great track. <br /> <br /> Martha Ray, Cass Elliot and Billy Hayes are all great as witches, and the actors of Living Island give all their strength to the limits of their character costumes (including Billy Barty, Felix Silla and other famous names). There is a LOT of excessive action in this film - there’s nothing subtle about it, and when little Jack Wilde has to express his concern for the abducted inhabitants of Living Island, it’s really a little more than screaming. This is a drama and comedy smeared with a trowel. Although I think about it - I could never endure a flute. <br /> <br /> I like the soundtrack, especially the aforementioned “Miscellaneous”, but also “Zap The World”, “Pufnstuf” and even the touching Jack Wilde, “If I Could.” Moreover, it has already been released on CD with the taste of people from El Records in London.
