When I saw the short "Batman Dead End", I did not know what to really expect from World's Finest. Of course, Superman And Batman. All comics in my "Best World" contain them as a team. <br /> <br /> After watching the three and a half minute trailer, I wanted someone to make a serialized fan-movie for “The Best in the World”, if not for a real full-length movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the Superman stuff was crappy, but movie theater trailers are always teasers, giving you only some aspects of the whole product. It seems that this requires a finished product. <br /> <br /> Aside from relative director Sandy Collers, who plays the terribly poor Perry White, most of the actors were unknown. If a real film were made, the actors would be chosen according to the requirements of the film, although I think Nina Kaczorowski would be able to create a good Lois Lane, especially if she were closer to the character. <br /> <br /> Nice to see Clark Bartram wearing a Batman costume from the Dead End, but he should update a little more, and not look like Batman 40s with a 80s-90s leather cape and hood. His behavior is reminiscent of Batman, but I'm still wondering about the credibility of the white contact lenses, instead of just letting his eyes shine through the mask. I believe the goal was to make him as close as possible to the comic character than to the character of the film. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hirn can't play Superman, period. He stands around with a silly expression on his face, which simply says: “Slam me”. And line delivery seems to be a problem for him. <br /> <br /> In general, I would like to see the full story and film based on this brilliant work. There were rumors about the creation of the film "The Best in the World", and with the correct additions to the script it could be. Hope that more like this done.
