When I heard that the film was made by Ang Lee, I definitely watched it. Several years ago, this Taiwanese director became famous for his “Wedding Banquet” and “Eat, Drink, Male Woman”, and then moved on to “Feeling and Sensitivity” and “Ice Storm”. Now he turns his attention to another American icon - the Civil War. <br /> <br /> This story takes place in Missouri, a union state with southern sympathies. They never officially joined the Confederation army. Instead, they formed criminal groups, called “bush hackers,” their hair grew long, and sometimes they confiscated Union uniforms, which they wore over their regular clothes. <br /> <br /> The film shows their moral dilemma, high drama of the times, and their supposedly heroic missions of killing storekeepers and farmers who helped the Union. There are no stars in this film, unless you consider the singer to be a “Gemstone”, which is considered a star in the role of a young union widow. <br /> <br /> Toby McQuire is a young German farmer boy who is ridiculed for his legacy because the Germans were considered allies of sympathizers. This young man is an excellent actor, full of youth with a new face, whose performance includes his surprise and subtle realizations, as he is exposed to the horror of war. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Wright is a freed slave who travels with bushes because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him freedom. He gives excellent and understated views. <br /> <br /> However, some of the acting skills are wooden, especially in long conversations about morality. And their costumes are too new. And the topic of the “southern gentleman” about manners, chapcha and politeness towards women is a little more common - especially because they aim to kill all the men they pull out of their women’s hands and then burn stores and houses. <br /> <br /> Although I don’t think it will go as one of Lee Eng’s “great” films, I was still fascinated by this, despite the slow parts and the excessive length of 140 minutes. I was interested in what was happening next, and felt sympathy for each of the characters, who all seemed real and imperfect people captured by historical forces. <br /> <br /> Not so much action as in a normal war movie, but still recommended - especially for fans of the civil war. <br /> <br />
