“Till the Sunrise” is a wonderful love story, and it should be among my 5 favorite films. The dialogue and acting is great. I love characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, the romantic Vienna presented in the film does not exist (you will not find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night) and it’s impossible to get to all places in one night or (especially if you are a stranger and this is your first night in Vienna). But it's not that. The relationship of the two characters is much more important, and this part of the story is not at all unreal. Although nothing really happens, the film never gets boring. The ending is really sad, not being a “Titanic” or something else. Even if you don't like love stories, you should watch this movie! I am a bit skeptical about the continuation that will be released in the summer. The first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.
