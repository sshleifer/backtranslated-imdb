This is a wonderful, revitalizing film. From the use of the villa itself, which inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write a novel in the 1920s, to inspired casting, every choice was absolutely right! The calm joy of this film will not become obsolete after repeated screenings. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Pleight seem to have been born to play these roles! I would really like Enchanted April to go on DVD in widescreen format.
