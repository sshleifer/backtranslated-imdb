Hey guys, I'm actually in this movie! I didn't even know what it was on this site until I looked a few years ago, and I was so surprised! I played Pete, the son of the main characters. It was a great experience, and I loved every minute of it. During filming, they needed me to be in two places at the same time, so they used my twin sister as a double! The finger that presses the radio button in the car belongs to me, not to me. I still play and make TV, but not so much. Yes, and if you need proof, my name is the first one at the top of the scroll. <br /> <br /> Review: I thought the film was fine, but if I hadnâ€™t shot it, it would not be one of my favorites. I thought the game was really good, but the storyline was just so-so.
