If this film were shot just a few years later, I would have knocked the score down by one or two points, because the sound quality was pretty bad. At times, the film seemed to be a quiet film between the scenes (there are no normal surrounding sounds). But, given that it was 1931 and a French film, it is quite excusable. Moreover, it also occurs in later French films - by this time sound difficulties should have been fully worked out (for example, in L'Atalante from 1934). <br /> <br /> Good, apart from some minor audio issues. This is a cute little film about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it. And during the search there are a lot of funny little songs that can not help but like. Good charming film in general.
