When I watch a low-budget film, I know what to expect. I expect that the game will not be so good (budget reasons), I expect that the lighting will not be so good (budget reasons), I expect that the sound will not be so good (budget again). Stop judging these low-budget films like a big budget movie !!! I myself am a director, so I understand the budget limitations for a low-budget film. Theft of locations, shots, etc ... the list goes on and on. I do not want to say that all actions were bad. Jose Rosette, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez natural. Not yet sold on Carl Washington. He should understand that each line is not important, some of them are discarded. I say that if a movie makes you want to see what happens next, this is a good movie. I like this movie. I gave him 8. I wanted to see what would happen next. Excellent work of the Kirozov brothers!
