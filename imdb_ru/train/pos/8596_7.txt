I thought the Guard would be a mediocre movie. When I finally saw him, I was surprised by a good movie. The film is not very good, but it is very funny, and the action films are very well made. This movie reminded me of a TV serial like 24 or Alias. This is very similar to this series, and he also reminded me of Wolfgang Petersen’s thriller “In the Line of Fire”. If you expect one of the most original and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of cinema will disappoint you. But if you go with little expectations, you will like the Guardian. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
