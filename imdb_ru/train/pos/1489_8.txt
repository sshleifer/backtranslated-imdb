In general, the film is in order. I think that he is better than Sepet, and much better than Gubra, in terms of its history, its sentimental value. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that touch me. Yes, I agree that the boy (Muhsin) played his part very well. Brilliant. I can say that his acting is almost natural. <br /> <br /> However, Nina Simoneâ€™s song "Ne Me Quitte Pas" is truly "menaikkan" my "bulu" "roma". <br /> <I love the song. Both songs. "Ne Me Quitte Pas" and "Hujan". I just downloaded a song. Perfectly. <br /> <br /> And Yasmin's salute. The end of the film loan makes me move again. We see how Yasmin truly appreciated her parents in a unique way. <br /> <br /> I think the film deserves a Grand Prix at the International Jury of the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I give 8.5 points out of 10 stars.
