There must be a joking joke around Bonanza about how fatal for women was to be in contact with the male cardwrights. In the end, Ben Cartwright was a widower with a son from every marriage. And any woman who was associated with Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe was going to die eventually, because we could not get rid of the widower’s formula and the three sons who started this classic western television. <br /> <br /> It would be possible if Bonanza did today, the authors would have rotating female characters who entered and left the life of Cartwright. People have relationships, some are good, some are not so good, this is just life. And today we are less demanding of our heroes, so if the relationship with one of them goes to the south, we don’t need to kill the character in order to preserve the nobility of the survivor. But that would be if Bonanza were made today. <br /> <br /> But we still expected a lot from our Western heroes and Bonanza, although it took some time to change time, and the change in viewing time from NBC definitely helped, the secret of Bonanza Success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his persistent sons. Ben Cartwright was the perfect TV dad in any genre you want to name. His whole life was spent on hard work building this huge Ponderos for his three children. All the children were different in nature, but all gathered as a last resort. <br /> <br /> Cartwrights have become and remain an American institution. I believe more people cared for this family than Kennedy. This is evidenced only by the popularity of Bonanza in syndication. <br /> <br /> Pernell Roberts as the eldest son Adam was excluded from the show. It is rumored that he did not care about the noble characters of Cartwright, whom he considered bordering on bigotry. Perhaps, if it had been done now, he would have liked it better, as I describe. <br /> <br /> It was only the beginning for Michael Landon, how many people get three popular television shows on credit. Landon also has a Highway to Heaven and the Little House on the Prairie, where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, hottest, but most romantic of Cartwright. <br /> <br /> When Roberts is gone. The show went on with two younger sons, but when the big Dan Blocker left, Bonanza's heart disappeared. By that time, other characters were added, David Canary, Tim Matson and Ben Cartwright adopted young Mitch Vogel. But the big, loyal, but slightly fat Hoss was easily the most attractive of the Cartwrights. His sudden demise after the operation left too big a hole in this family. <br /> <br /> So the Cartrater Ponderos have made history. I felt a real taste of how America took Cartwright to heart when I visited the real Virginia City. This is not like what you see in Bonanza. But next to Lake Tahoe, approximately where you see Ponderos on the map at the opening credits, is the Cartwright house, the complex is maintained and opened as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for fans of Sherlock Holmes, the ranch and Cartwright are real. <br /> <br /> And if they were not real, they should have been.
