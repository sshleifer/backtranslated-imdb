The devil's game is my second attempt at the production of Joseph Sarno - and although I will say that it is much nicer than the painfully boring and non-erotic Swedish WILDCATS, for my taste it is still a bit slow and implicit. <br /> <br /> This group is centered around a group of female vampires who live in a castle who want to resurrect their previously killed "leader." To do this, girls should dance naked, kiss each other and sing strange things - and, of course, drink some blood. When the doctor and her brother’s car breaks down and they have to stop at the castle for an overnight stay - they provide the perfect blood bank for excited vampires ... but they may not be as helpless as they seem ... <br /> PLAYTHING DEVIL'S - a pretty good example of the feat of forgery of the early 70s. Many nudes - including some completely frontal, some sloppy shades - including incest and, of course, the bloodsucking of lesbians ... but these scenes are still quite tame by today's standards. Some pretty hot women in this would benefit from more outspoken sex, but I think you can't have all that. I would also benefit from heavier violence / bloodshed, as this is a film about vampires, but I think the goal of the game “The Devil” was to show the skin more, not blood. Still a little slow - and the action is for the most part completely wooden - but this can be expected from something from this era and this budget. It is worth looking at the fans - others may find it too boring to their liking. 7/10
