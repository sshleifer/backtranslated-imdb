This is my first IMDb review, I didn’t really want to write it, but since now there are only 2 for this wonderful film, I have to add my point of view ... and no, I’m not connected to the directors anyway (yes, yes, how often have you been here before ;-)) For your information, I’m already over twenty, <br /> <br /> First, I have to admit that I really like animated films, because you see, it is limited only by the imagination of the creators and they were quite creative in this. Not so much in terms of history as in achieving a very unique and fresh visual style. The characters look good, but far from reality, and it works well for the film, because this is a fairy-tale world. But the background and the world as a whole are filled with amazing visual effects that my jaw lowered several times while watching. The blue bunny-like mini-dragon plays a role in the show and easily captures some of the funniest moments of the movie, it instantly becomes a classic, almost like the Scrat from Ice Age. The story is not too amazing (a bunch of anti-heroes should go out and kill the biggest dragon you can imagine), but who cares if the film looks and sounds THAT good ;-) 1 thing I have to say, The film is not suitable for VERY young children, because there are darker scenes in it and, maybe, frightening for children up to 6-8 years old, I would say, these are very few scenes, but it is worth mentioning imo. In any case, I had a great time watching this, and I can’t wait for him to get to the stores in high resolution to watch it again and again, just for the sake of its beauty. <br /> <br /> 8.5 for me
