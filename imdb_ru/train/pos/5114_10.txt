Although Urban Cowboy didn’t exude the same testosterone that you could find on a rodeo, it did give an accurate idea of ​​that day and age in downtown Texas. I also think that in order to really criticize this film, one would have to live in the place and time in which it was made. There was good music, fun times and, yes, a few "fuss" in expensive homes. The relationship between Bad and Sissy, as "two ships passing at night," was well thought out. When Pam broke the note that Sissy had written to Bud, it reflected the tragedy of many true life novels. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the cast and crew did a great job. I thought the script was well written and directed. Scott Glenn should have won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
