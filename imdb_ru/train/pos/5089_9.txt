True, he is not very closely following the book, but it is still a very interesting look at history. Swayze was much better in this role than I expected. And Dudi avoided showing “a stupid woman from the depths of her desert” that most of us probably expected (see Kate Capshaw in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). <br /> <br /> In any case, this is surprisingly better than Richard Chamberlain’s terrible couple from Quatermain. <br /> <br /> In many ways, it is very reminiscent of the western. The only thing that didn’t bother me was mysticism, but I think it’s an integral part of the genre. For example: “How can you create an African adventure story without witch teachers and supernatural wise wandering tribesmen?” Heh.
