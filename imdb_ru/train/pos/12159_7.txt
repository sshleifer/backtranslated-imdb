â€œAfter their sons have been sentenced to life imprisonment, Adele (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) begin to receive threatening telephone calls because someone feels that their sons are easily gone. The couple decides to move to California to avoid publicity of the trial and start a new life. They start a dance school, which is soon very successful. One of the students has a rich unmarried father, in whom Adele quickly falls in love. Meanwhile, Helen is busy raising rabbits and is becoming too keen on the evangelist on the radio. This is just a moment in time when everything will fall apart, and women will enter the world of madness and murder. <br /> <br /> - I can't help but compare what is with Helen? The one who killed Aunt Roo is also starring Shelley Winters. Where this film seemed almost restrained in the insanity of Aunt Roux, nothing is holding back Helen in this film. It may take a lot of time during the film, but as soon as she snaps, Helen becomes a Bad Mad Mut. You do not want to mess with her. Winters is so deliciously crazy that I couldn't help but enjoy her playing. I'm not going to spoil the movie, but the things that Helen is capable of are completely overwhelming. <br /> <br /> - No matter how good Winters is, Reynolds is completely ridiculous in her role as a gold dancer. I got the impression that she thought she was acting in a film in which she was nominated for some kind of award. This is not a citizen of Kane! Stop acting so serious. Hey, Debbie, don't you understand that your main goal is to fall prey to the madness of Winters? <br /> <br /> - I just like these former star women at dusk. from their career horror movies. What happened to Elena? it's as much fun as any.
