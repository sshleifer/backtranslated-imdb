Homelessness (or Homelessness, as stated by George Carlin) was a problem for many years, but never planned to help those on the street who were once considered people who did everything from attending school, working or voting on this issue. Most people think of homeless people as a hopeless business, worrying about things like racism, the war in Iraq, putting pressure on children to succeed, technology, elections, inflation or anxiety if they are close to the streets. <br /> <br /> But what to do if you are offered to spend a month on the street without the luxury you once had at home, with entertainment kits, a bathroom, pictures on the wall, a computer, and everything you ever then appreciated to see what it feels like to be homeless? This is a lesson from Goddard Bolt. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks (director), who starred in the role of Bolt, plays a rich man who has everything in the world, until he decided to bet with his rival (Jeffrey Tambor) to see if he could live on a street of thirty days without luxury; if Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with a future project to build more buildings. A bet on where the Bolt is thrown out onto the street with a bracelet on his leg to keep track of his every movement, when he cannot get off the sidewalk. He got the nickname Pepto from the tramp after it is written on his forehead, where Bolt meets other characters, including a woman named Molly (Lesley Ann Warren), a former dancer who divorced before losing the house, and her pals Sailor (Howard) Morris ) and Fiames (Teddy Wilson), who are already used to the streets. They survived. Bolt no. He was not accustomed to reaching mutual agreements, as he had once achieved, when he became rich where he fought or ran, killed, or would be killed. <br /> <br /> Although the love relationship between Molly and Bolt was not necessary for the conspiracy, I discovered “Life Stinks” to be one of Mel Brooks’s watch films, where, before becoming a comedy, it shows a tender side compared with his farce works, such as Burning Saddles, Young Frankenstein or Cosmic Balls, to show what it is like to have something valuable before losing it the next day or, on the other hand, make a stupid bet how all rich people do when they don’t know what to do with their den Gami. Perhaps they should give it to the homeless, and not use it as monopoly money. <br /> <br /> Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others.
