I first saw this film in the eighties, but now I have revised this thriller. Some new films focus on similar topics, but they do not correspond to this French milestone. <br /> <br /> President - apparently JF Kennedy - was shot dead in an open car during a public show. As a result of a large-scale investigation, it was established that the “Lee Harvey Oswald” figure in this film is to blame, but one of the jury members insists on further investigation. He reveals some amazing evidence ... <br /> <br /> Unlike the Oliver Stone film - a film with the same plot - this film does not play with emotions, but concentrates on a fascinating description of the plot and how everything fits together. by drawing a new killing picture. Even a real psychological experiment is used to explain this crime scene. Compared to JFK, this film is more intelligent, clever and exciting. Parts of the plot can be found in many new films, in the cinema of which I sometimes sat like a deja vu. <br /> <br /> “I ... com, I care” is “must see”. It is unique and gorgeous, and Ennio Morricone’s music is wonderful. This film deserves a very good rating, if it was a Hollywood film, it would surely be famous. <br /> <br />
