the only word that sums up this film is fancy. it is carefree fuss over an existential concept. peppy (more than one) and a little crazy. I definitely would not call it a great and unforgettable movie theater, and it does not seem as memorable as the first film of the director "cube", but itâ€™s a good bunch of fluff to watch on Sunday morning. acting is sometimes from respectable to annoying, but I believe that it was written that way. made as a serious film, it could possibly be great or could well go into a state of pretense. a bit like the "matrix" meets "the head" meets the "human nature". <br /> <br /> 6.8 out of ten
