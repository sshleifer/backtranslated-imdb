This work of Oliver masterfully shows the layers of evil in the human soul. What makes the story remarkable is the brilliantly bright Invisible Character that pierces this darkness as he leads an innocent boy through the most serious dangers into the hands of his own relative. Yes, although Oliver is walking along the valley of the shadow of death, he is not afraid of evil. The staff and staff are there to console him. In the end, he was saved from the dregs of humanity. Below Fagin, the most evil of all. Fagin considers repentance in his ways not once, but twice, but refuses, because he does not want to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sykes because he picks up little pickpockets who become killers. In the middle of Oliver. His innocence is spotless, but not tested. Best Nancy. With no judgment, she ignores the violent nature of Bill Sykes because of her deep need for love. And yet, unlike Fagin, at the cost of her own life, she repents of her sins, saving Oliver from Bill. It's not what it seems. In my opinion, it is this quality that makes art worthwhile - unpredictability. I would give this film "10", but the 70s soundtrack for television and the atmosphere were distracting. In general, a beautiful parable and a perfectly suitable story for all viewers.
