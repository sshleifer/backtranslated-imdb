"Footlight Parade" is just one of several amazingly funny musicals that Warner Bros. Produced in the early 1930s to reflect the depression. 42nd Street and the Golddiggers series were also filmed in this era, and they literally made millions of Americans forget their troubles for a while and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Although most of the films produced had great talents Joan Blondel, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, only incomparable James Cagney was in the "Front Light". Almost ten years before his most famous musical "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Here he dances in this most original dance style: his hands are usually lowered on the sides, and his legs make all kinds of wave-like movements and kicks. It is easy to see that he is enjoying himself, and this makes us enjoy him even more. <br /> <br /> Although almost all musical sequences appear at the end of the film, they are worth it. I believe that this film was made shortly before the installation of the production code, so some costumes and scenes are a bit risky. But all this is fun. <br /> <br /> No matter what the plot of the film is, just know that there is a lot of laughter and excellent lineup. Besides those already mentioned, Guy Kibby feels better here than anyone. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
