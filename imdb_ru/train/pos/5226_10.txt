What with all the European (especially in England) comments here? All I have to say is that when I first saw this film, when I was 13, I thought it was great. Of course it's stupid. That's the thing. You need to watch the film "Doctor Strangelove" and "Men in Black" to understand the whole joke of this film, but come on, people, what did you expect to see? I can recall many films that are much worse than this, and these were expensive Hallwood films with real actors in them. In any case, “People in White” is a very silly, ridiculous mockery of the film. And with all these silly funny things that England has done over the past half century, I am shocked by all the negative comments. We stupid Americans like our stupid humor. See “Team America: World Police”, where you can find real laughter that Europeans will especially like. HA!
