Seriously, can you imagine such a distribution of talent in one film without a huge budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray Macanally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor And Fiona Shaw? There is no doubt that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their awards: but it would be justifiable to see O'Conor (as Young Christie) and McAnally: the cliche is true here: they do not fulfill the role, they inhabit them. The Day-Lewis performance is a power tour — a transformation that causes awe, but in fact it was a distinctive feature of the Academy’s intelligence that, along with this performance, they also received the honor of Brenda Fricker’s perfectly discreet, heart-breaking work as Christie’s mother. By the way, if you have not seen this magnificent actress in Swann, this is another film that is worth checking out for her contribution (and great Miranda Richardson).
