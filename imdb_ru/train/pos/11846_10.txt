I really liked this movie. The animation was well done and the novel was cute. I liked most of the Brian Adams songs, and Hans Zimmer’s score was excellent. Many people do not understand how well they are connected with the themes of the “Heart of Darkness” / “Apocalypse Now” (what happens when the so-called “civilization” invades someone’s home, what it means to be “civilized”, etc.) and the music was very exciting. The film mourns America, which was once beautiful.
