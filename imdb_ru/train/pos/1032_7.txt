A movie with messages, but pretty good. Outstanding cast, top to bottom. Interestingly, the storyline of Bette Davis is essentially a story back! Extremely negative reviews (casting a name in a script / playwright, associating it with extremely negative comments about Angles in America, etc., etc.) Objection to the fact that the film was too preaching about Germany in World War II the war. Gosh, this is too complicated an understanding of morality for me. <br /> <br /> Theater and cinema, as well as acting skills change over time, and, of course, in 70 years this particular film will not be shot in here. Yes, Casablanca is the best film (I guess), but although it was shot in the same year and there are Nazis in it, Casablanca is first and foremost a love story. The love story in this film takes the second place in the spy story - more than a thriller. Both have a rather large number of delicate accents and wonderful characters. Kids are a bit tedious and could be edited.
