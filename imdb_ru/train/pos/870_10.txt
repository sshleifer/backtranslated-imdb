“Read My Lips (Sur mes lèvres)” (which probably has an idiomatic resonance in the French title) is an elegant, winding modern story about office politics that suddenly becomes a criminal as the unusually selected characters slide up and down the ethical and sensual slippery slope. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are Emmanuel Devos (whom I had never seen before, despite her long summary in French films) and even more disheveled than usual Vincent Cassel (who brought a sexy and / or threatening look and voice in some American films). <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is located on its territory in a competitive real estate office, and he is a neophyte. The second half is on his lawn as a former swindler, and her excruciating adaptation to this environment. <br /> <br /> Scriptwriter / director Jacques Audiar very cleverly uses the woman’s isolated hearing impairment as a basis for us in his perception, turning the sound up and down so that we can hear her (so this is even more annoying, than usual when viewers speak), using visual effects as sensory reactors. <br /> <br /> None of the characters act as expected (it does not look like this flexible sacrifice from “In the Company of Men”, not in separate interactions, not in the scenes and not in the general arc of the unpredictable storyline ( well, until the last frame, but, damn it, the audience was waiting for this performance), when we move from the restless modern office, to the restless disco, to romantic and criminal banquets. <br /> <br /> There is a side story, which thematically redundant and unnecessary, but just gives us a few minutes to catch our breath. < br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites this year! <br /> <br /> (originally written on 07/28/2002)
