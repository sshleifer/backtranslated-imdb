Young Hendir and her tyrannical Grandmother provide a great fantasy from the new world. Gabriel García Márquez’s interpretation of “Incredible and historical history and Candida Erendir, ...” may not rub Marquez the Purist in the right way, despite the fact that the story remains intact and still carries the full force of the work. The strength of this film is that it plays especially dad as a grandmother. Marquez fans and novices Marquez will love this film for its real sandy brand of wit.
