Directed by Douglas Sirk again clogs with this, the grandfather of all dysfunctional family films. This lush, dirty saga is a masterpiece that perfectly unites all the elements of Sirk's fraudsters and strategically unites them in one film. “Written in the wind” very clearly influenced the 1980s Dallas and Dynasty series, as this is basically the full-length version of these late night soaps. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall, surprisingly and delicately playing Lucy Moore, secretary of New York, who marries oil baron Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unnoticed by both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the quiet but sexy secretary. They all return to the mansion of the Kyle family in Texas, where we meet his white trash sister, Marily (Dorothy Malone in the Oscar-winning turn). Yipee! Sparks begin to fly - from romances to fights, this is a camping trip. Mitch not only has to fight the feelings he feels for his best friend's wife, but Marilye tries to sleep with everyone, because she cannot have her only true love - Mitch. Concluding all this, Kyle finds out that he is impotent, but somehow, Lucy is pregnant. <br /> <br /> This is a pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love it? This film is one of the most popular Universal films and one of the best works of director Sirk. Some dialogues are simply hissing, and visual metaphors are scattered in all directions - the theme of the wind is gorgeous everywhere. The cast is great, although Bacall is completely undervalued, despite the fact that he gets top billing behind Hudson. The loss of Oscar Stack reportedly devastated him. He considered this his best performance and, obviously, was not too happy to lose. And he got an incredible performance, like a nicked alcoholic. What a great movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for ages - Sirk is a master of classical melodrama. Where is his oscar? <br /> <br />
