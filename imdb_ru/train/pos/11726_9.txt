when my sister said that this film would be good, I had second thoughts, but I watched it and it was really funny. Basically the film is made from a strange girl who goes to a small town where nobody likes her, and she just wants to go there and get her aunts reading, so she won't be able to go. but not so simple. In this film, you will find cheerful humor, a witch, a book of spells / recipes, an uncle with mental problems, and a dog. You will understand the meaning of the word freak a after all, anyway, I hope you run out right now and try to find this really old film. I hope you will like it as a whole, I will have to give him 0 .... no, I am joking badly, give him 9, I hope you understand that you will laugh, you will scream and you may just be offended. <br /> <br /> love yours truly: Dakota, you can write me at dakota_loves_it @ hot mail.com if you want
