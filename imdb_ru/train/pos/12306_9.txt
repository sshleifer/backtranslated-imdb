In China's Ghost Story, the late Leslie Chung plays the role of Lin Choi Xing, a penniless tax collector who decides to spend the night in an abandoned temple where she meets and falls in love with a beautiful woman named Qing (Joey Wang). When Lin discovers that Qing is in fact a ghost who was forced to seduce the victims by the evil spirit of the tree that feeds on chi (life force), he decides to try to free the girl, leaving her a proper burial. Enlisting the support of Mychnik Yin (Wu Ma), a crazy Taoist monk, Lin successfully defeats the spirit of the tree, but he must also fight in hell against the evil Lord Black, whom Qing should marry. <br /> The first Hong Kong film that I saw, which was not purely martial art, “The History of Chinese Ghosts” opened my eyes to the incredible world of Asian fantasy horror, a magical kingdom populated by beautiful ghosts of a female, awkward innocent heroes , wielding Taoist monks, monstrous spirits and dark lords of the underworld with a sword; I immediately fell in love with the abundance, energy, humor, ingenuity and visual superiority of the film. <br /> <br /> Two decades later, and this amazing film still remains one of the best examples of the genre that I've seen? a luxurious, breathtaking masterpiece in which horror, comedy, fantasy and romance are brilliantly combined. Thanks to superb directing from Siu-Tung Ching, excellent editing from David Wu, stunning cinematography and a variety of original special effects (including a huge killer language, many monster tentacles and many flying heads!), The History of Chinese Ghosts from the beginning to the end.
