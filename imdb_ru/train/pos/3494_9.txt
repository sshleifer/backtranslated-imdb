“Raising Victor Vargas” is as close to perfection as possible for the film. Either an obvious genius of a novice author, or just one of those happy mixes where everything clicked (probably each one of them), this simple little click of ethnic first love, an excerpt from city life, highlights its young characters with such depth that you can almost read their minds. The film begins with the strong flavor of the “street”, but gradually turns into a Latin American family romance, and then focuses on a story that talks a lot about the youth’s insecurity and the deeply natural desire to love another. In my experience, there has never been so much done with such a small one (actors Tyros, novice director, etc.). Praised by critics, but not for everyone, “Educating Victor Vargas” is recommended for indie lovers and realists in simple fairy tales, rich in humanity. (BUT)
