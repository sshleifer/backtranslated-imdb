That was incredible! Photography, editing, cinematography, music together take us into the dangerous direction of the tourist destination. It was a pleasure to “doze” without going through danger. We were there! The sequences of dreams and the finale of memories were fresh. It spoke to me. Keep up the good work! Another of this genre is the City of God. Also - do not laugh! - comedy, desperately looking for Susan. Good ensemble types, with excellent performances of all. Sorry, I think Training Day also fits this genre with fantastic cast performances. I had to switch the channel to some episodes, but overall, a great movie!
