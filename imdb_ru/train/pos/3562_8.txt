Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the manager of New York's longest-running floating craps game and needs $ 1,000 to find a new place. Confident of his chances, he relies on the city’s highest roller, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), that he cannot seduce the anxious missionary Sarah Brown (Gene Simmons). “Guys and Dolls” (1955) is such a wonderful musical because it cleverly combines contrasting styles of cinema and scenes. During the dazzling opening sequence, crowds of pedestrians move in rhythm, stopping and winding up, as if reacting to backstage cues. Even the walking movements themselves are stylized and angular, halfway between walking and dancing. New York Mankiewicz is a sparkling stream of colors and movements in the art deco style, a fantastic world so completely distant from reality that even the business of underground gambling and criminal gangsterism seems completely ingenious. <br /> <br /> When I write this review, I just received a message that Gene Simmons passed away, 80 years old. This, incredibly, was the first time I saw her in the film, but she was blinded from the very beginning. Her idealistic and sexually depressed Sarah comes out of her shell after an alcoholic rampage in Havana, releasing with a delightfully playful performance “If I were a bell”. Despite the fact that Simmons and Brando were not vocalists, producer Sam Goldwyn decided not to duplicate their vocals, arguing that "you may not sound so good, but at least you are." Despite Goldwyn's secretive confidence, the couple copes well with the performance of entire musical numbers. Simmons assumes the same childlike vitality Audrey Hepburn could bring to the role, and Brando radiates such self-confidence and charisma that it does not matter that his singing voice is not exactly there.
