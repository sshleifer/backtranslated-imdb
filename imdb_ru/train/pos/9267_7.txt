A good movie. Somehow I was made to root for the Iranians for winning the game played in the film, although I don’t know anything about football and I’m not a fan. The end on the bus was thrilling. <br /> <br /> The film itself tells about the problem of women in Iran and how they are not allowed to go to the sports grounds among men, because their abuse is not suitable for women to hear. Despite this law, some women try to get inside, but many of them will be caught and delayed. It is truly amazing that any society can have such outdated gender concepts. In an interview, Panahi says that his films are documents of history and injustice, and that one day in the future we will be able to watch these films and see how Iran once lived. Hopefully, the future will come sooner rather than later.
