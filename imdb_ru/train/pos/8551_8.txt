Ti% s and As *, a lot of boobies. Some great characters, funny jokes and well-collected teenage action games in this series of Amercan Pie franchises. It looks like a really old school. This is similar to the Porkys for the 2000s. Some wonderful funny characters combined with very humorous situations make me a real surprise. <br /> <br /> Although the original cast is almost eliminated, except for one, this film seemed to me really interesting. Let's not be too excited, you have to take it for a youthful comedy comedy, which is, but for what it is, it is excellent. The characters are nice and funny, the girls are hotter than hell. Fun and games are fun, with some things I've never seen in comedies before, they make me cringe, but at the same time laugh. <br /> <br /> So ignore the haters and do it and see what you think. Do not wait for the classic American cake, but expect something that will make you laugh and spark your attention for an hour or so.
