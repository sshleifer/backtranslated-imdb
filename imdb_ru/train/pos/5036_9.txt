Bill Paxton, from Aliens, Near Dark and Terminator, surprises me with his debut as director of Frailty. He hits all the cylinders, but at the end there is one improbability in which the FBI agent (Powers Booth) is involved, who subtracts the point from this otherwise frightening and thought-provoking thriller. In addition, this film was just great. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton plays dad. He is never given a name, but it is not a weakness of the film. It actually enhances the film, allowing the viewer to see it as a kind of symbol. One day he has a vision, which he says was sent from God telling him that the world is coming to an end, and he and his two sons Fenton Makes (Matt OLeary) and Adam Makes (Jeremy Sumpter) should penalize demons and kill them, the Demons look like normal people they kill, and it makes the viewer think about whether the Pope is crazy or he is really doing God's work. There are scenes that reflect both points, which adds confusion and gives the film more expectation. <br /> <br /> The story is told in the memoirs by one of the sons who has now grown up (Matthew McConaughey) and speaks to the FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth), who is very skeptical and fair. In the end, not every day someone comes to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is. <br /> <br /> The film takes a lot of turns, and Bill Paxton superbly manages, making us guess without losing interest. The game is incredible. The two young leaders and Paxton work well together, looking like a normal family, although they are all involved in the murder. As I said, there is one implausibility associated with the character of Powers Booth, but in fact it is not so important. It was an extremely well-made film involving faith and family.
