This is an extensive (4 hours) remake of the history of Rider Haggard, with the usual added woman and an extraneous storyline in which Russian soldiers are searching for the “Power Stone” buried along with the treasure of King Solomon. It is a very good shot, giving a vivid idea of ​​the vast expanses of Africa, and acted very well. Patrick Swayze is the superb Alan Quatermain, and Alison Doody is attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who hires Quatermain to help save her father. Sidede Onyulo in the role of Umbops, Gavin Good in the role of McNabb and the leader of the Russian soldiers (not mentioned in the IMDb list) were also remembered. Although Hollywood cannot leave a good story alone when they adapt it, the story is well told, and, with the exception that it is too long, I liked it. 6/10.
