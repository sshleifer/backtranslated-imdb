I saw this movie many years ago on TV late at night. Then he was called "Stairway to Heaven." Even as a little boy, I remember being deeply moved by history and amazed at the visual effects of the legal process (those who saw him know what I'm talking about). Such an imagination! This film perfectly combines romance, drama, humor and fantasy. It presents the greatest classic works of all time: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone With the Wind. This film was highly appreciated by IMDB voters, and this is true - more than 51% of voters rated it as 10 out of 10; more than 84% rated him as 8 or higher out of 10. I was surprised that he was not on the list of the 250 best films, until I realized that I watched / rated this film so little compared to those on the list. What a pity. I hope that this film will be released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so 1) I can buy it, and 2) others will find this hidden treasure.
