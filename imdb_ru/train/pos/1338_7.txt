2000 was a bad year for Indian films due to the lack of quality and imagination of the directors. In addition to Mohabbatein and Kakho Naa Pyar Khai, nothing stood out. CCCC had a lot of controversy because of the financing of the film, and this was due to the fact that he didn’t know what the film was about, caused good advertising and sold tickets to the film in India and abroad. The only information that was given was that it was an unknown thriller. The film was released in 2001, and the film was surprisingly quite good. The main plot is connected with surrogacy and well processed. Salman And Preiti give a good idea in which Salman does not take off his shirt at all .. it must be special effects !! Rani plays Salman's wife, but this is a bit less demanding role compared to Prey, who plays the Prostitute, who eventually becomes a surrogate mother. Three main units confirm that after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega they have solid chemistry on the screen and off-screen (apparently). Salman Khan, who plays a great role in the film as a successful businessman, and is very sorry that he is used as a copycat in his other films, as he is underestimated in the Mumbai film industry in part because of the films he chooses. Rani’s character doesn’t know that Prey is a prostitute until the end ... it’s hidden from her and the whole family ... you have to find out the rest, since it will destroy the film if I tell you. All songs are well depicted, especially Dehne Walon and the main title song. Other actors maintain a minimal but excellent job, like the Salmanov loving family. Abbas Mastan produced the hit and tactfully processed the plot of the film. I say: go and see or rent anything you want!
