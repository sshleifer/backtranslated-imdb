I like this movie. You must respect the dwarfs who dress up like tiny Martians. Of course, the story was sometimes thin, but you can’t give up on how it was done. I used to watch it again and again when I was 8. It’s a kid’s movie, and besides, it has some of the biggest quotes ever. The performance of "House on the landfill" Blanzi is awesome. <br /> <br /> very well done, if you ask me, 8 out of 10.
