My wife, Kate, and I absolutely loved the show and can't wait for the next one (I hope the sequel!). I would like to know the name of this memorable song and who wrote it, perhaps because I am “old and gray” and still interested in life :-). If anyone has the full text, please send it. <br /> <br /> Of course, one of the main reasons why my wife and I loved this series so much was that we are 75 years old and we are retired, but we are still very active intellectually. It is good to see a show that emphasizes social contributions that older people with special skills and experience can still make. An interesting aspect showing the interaction of characters and young people around them is an important part of the show. <br /> <br /> This series is very interesting and very complex, along with some of our other favorites, Spooks and Hustle.
