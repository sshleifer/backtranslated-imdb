Barbra Streisand is a force tour in this Hollywood story. Her performances and songs are unique and special in the halls of great films. The scene where Christofferson presents her to an unsuspecting public against her wishes and the desires of the audience, but only to turn them with his magnificent performance Women on the Moon, is one of the best examples in the film about how well a performer can win an audience . This is real. The scene where she records Evergreen is considered the best in the business ... all alive, without lip-syncing, very special. Streisand is often criticized for being diva, but she copes with it. She sings majestically, "Another Look at You." She deserved an Oscar, which she and Paul Williams received for Evergreen. Christofferson also had his own moments, far exceeding most of his film appearances. This version of the Born franchise ranks first in 1937 (Janet Gaynor, Frederick March), although I will always enjoy the musical remake of Judy Garland and James Mason in 1954. I have not seen the DVD yet and I donâ€™t know about its quality.
