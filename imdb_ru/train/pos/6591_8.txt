The Invisible Man is a show that everyone should love! It reminds me of the 80s series of the old school (team, airwolf, knight). Special effects are small, but very effective! but most importantly, it was fun when they filmed the show. It really shows! the whole cast is perfect in these roles, and it looks like they can do whatever they want !! especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventreska. The ventress really shines in it! for me itâ€™s incredible that an actor with so much sarcasm is his acting style. Not filmed in the big movie. show me if you can. worth it !!!
