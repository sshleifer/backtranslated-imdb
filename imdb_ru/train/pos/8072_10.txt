Magnificent and unforgettable, incredibly atmospheric and brilliantly played by all. <br /> <br /> I really can't understand what kind of people prepare this masterpiece and get the prevalence of votes like 8 (and nine)! <Br /> <br /> This, along with Grapes of Wrath, is John Fordâ€™s greatest film. I would say that Long Voyage Home is the next in line, although quite far away. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10. It deserves 12.
