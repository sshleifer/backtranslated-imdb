I really liked this version of “Vanishing Point,” not the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version rather boring. If I can get up in the middle of a movie several times (as I did with the 1971 version), than for me, it's not so great. Of course, this may be due to the fact that I was only nine years old when the 1971 version was released. However, I saw a lot of remakes, where I liked the original and the older one more. I found that the plot of the 1997 version was clearer and basically corresponded to the original, without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt that the 1997 version was more exciting and not so fiery. (Boring)
