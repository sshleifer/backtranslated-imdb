I read other reviews and found that some of them compare the film with real life (for example, what it takes to get into a music school), Britney Beshing, etc. Etc. . <Br /> <br /> I rated this movie 7 out of 10 for ages 8 to 14 and for a family movie. For an average adult man .... 2 out of 10. I like pop / rock music, I'm 45 years old. I know about Britney Spears, but I never understood that she really sang Stronger until I read the credits and these reviews. I did not recognize her poster on the wall, so I did not care about self-advertisement. <br /> <br /> I watch movies that can be entertained. I don't care about the actors, the lighting, the producers, the directors, etc. What is a film, and does it entertain me. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and watched his message. The biggest epidemic in the world is low self-esteem (which is a completely different story), so it is followed, keeping this in mind, because it is of interest. The film is light, bright and fresh, great for kids. I found that Texan sounds began to fade throughout the entire film, and, of course, there are only so many ways to convey the message “give up / don't give up”, so yes, it was a bit predictable. Great news ... although there should be more. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great family movie, but for a guy who is watching himself, take Hannibal.
