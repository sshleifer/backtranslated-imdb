This is one military drama that I really like! Tom Berenger plays the military assassin of Thomas Beckett. This marine is nonsense, in your face, and no questions are asked by the person who does his job. There you have Billy Zane ("Ghost" and others), who plays Richard Miller, a former special forces officer from the District of Columbia, works for the government and accepts orders only from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I do not! When these two paired, sparks should fly. And How. However, Beckett teaches a young official how it works. When another sniper strikes, it is wit against wit, a cat against a mouse, a fighter against an action movie. And when an experienced sniper is caught, Miller must put off politics and save him. Who needs a policy, when you are such a professional as Beckett, he takes orders from no one but himself, plays by the rules, not by the book, and mutual respect is manifested, despite the policy. The film was a direct hit. Watch it Rated 4 out of 5 Stars.
