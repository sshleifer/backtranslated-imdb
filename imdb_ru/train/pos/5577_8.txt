I haven't laughed at the movie for so long. The rubbish that Hollywood has recently released makes me climb a wall! This one was definitely new and witty. If you look at the demographic rating figures, only a few women voted! I don’t want to spoil the movie for you, but I’m sure that every guy who saw it used his computer to rate it and gave it a bad rating, why? Because the film puts men in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this film because of its actual meaning of humor, and not because it harms men ... it could be a movie with a rating of "7"!
