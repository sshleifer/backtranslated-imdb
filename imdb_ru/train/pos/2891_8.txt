Last night we watched this in ABC's “The Wonderful World of Disney”, and I came to the conclusion that everything should be denser than usual in Mouse. <br /> <br /> Since this film lasts only 74 minutes, and they had to add 2 hours of on-air television, they had, and I don’t think up, commercial breaks that lasted from 6 to 7 hours. minutes And during these commercial breaks, they had another ad under the guise of a “TV show” organized by the terribly annoying Kelly Ripp, who loudly proclaimed the magic wonders of “Cinderella 2: dreams come true” <br /> <Again and again, intermission after recess, Disney did not hurry with the real film to tell us, loyal viewers, that we needed to get a copy of the sequel. Thank you, Disney, for providing us with the service to create the sequel to your favorite film gem. <br /> <br /> In any case, all this commercialism and calls from cash registers complicated the task of the real movie “Cinderella”, because by the time the commercials ended, I forgot where the story ended. <br /> <br /> But, of course, the original “Cinderella” still retains its magic, and History is still good, although we all have seen it countless times. It is a pity that they had to reduce the cost of it with all the marketing for what looks like an unfortunate continuation.
