If only ALL the animation was so great. This film is classic because it is strong, these are two simple aspects: history and character. The characters in this film are beautifully personified. I felt all the characters, and the relationship between man and animal in the film works great. Beautiful animation and three-dimensional computer animation did not work better in any other film. This is a great film for children and for adults who want to travel classic hero. 8 out of 10.
