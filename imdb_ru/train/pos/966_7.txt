Toronto Film Festival Report 2005 Officially, Takasi Miike is amazed. <br /> <br /> Annual midnight show of the new film “Takashi Miike”, “The War of the Big Ghost”, “The Great Yokai War” or “Yokai Daisenso”. Call it what you will, this is a fanatical ride. <br /> <br /> A fearless programmer, Colin Geddes, said that this film was originally aimed at children in Japan. Think of the "Lord of the Rings" or "Infinite History" for Japan. After the show, I can understand where they were going with this, but damn, this is “Takashi Miike”, after all. He shot the film “Ichi the Killer” in 2001, when his show at the festival distributed bags with barf. And no, it was not just a marketing ploy. <br /> <br /> Short description of the plot: a boy with a problematic family life becomes “chosen”, and he stumbles in the middle of the Great Spiritual War, where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions on his journey. <br /> <br /> This is not exactly for children, well, not too "young." Of course, see them scared to shit with some of these spirits (even friendly ones) on display. This is not like what I have seen in the cinema before. Naturally, fantasy, some very funny (but dark) material. You will not be bored, you can guarantee it. Will it ever hit North America? It is doubtful. <br /> <br /> My rating = B
