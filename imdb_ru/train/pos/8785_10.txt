None of them is more appropriate than Gentleman Jim (Warner Brothers, 1942). <br /> <br /> The film also received another award, being named Errol Flynn's favorite among his own star cars. This clearly gives on-screen evidence that viewers sitting in a darkened theater or watching it on their home TV or DVD can easily come to the same conclusion. <br /> <br /> Of course, this story is a half-serious Biopic that takes some of the actual material and mixes it with a liberal dose of old imagination to bring us very satisfying, albeit somewhat fictional (what is Biopik not?) Events. <br /> <br /> Casting is excellent, as he makes good use of our leader’s natural athleticism, Mr. Errol Flynn. This gentlemanly Jim, although not the executioner, nor the Western, nor the military picture, perhaps, is the main role, the most suitable for the harsh Australian. <br /> <br /> Errol was a member of the Australian Olympic boxing team. 1928 or 1932.

Two of his brothers - Harry and George (Pat Flaherty and James Flavin), two "blue collars" from the family, their professions - "Longshore". <br /> <br /> The great Jack Carson does his work as an ordinary masterful comic strip comic in support of friend and colleague Jim Corbett. The rest of those whom we can recognize and remember are: John Loder, William Frawley, Madeleine Lebo, Minor Watson, Rees Williams, Arthur Shields, Dorothy Vaughn, and others. <br /> <br /> Director Walsh also used a number of professional wrestlers in the roles of different boxers. Consequently, we have Ed "The Strangler" Lewis and the unknown Grapler *, who are presented as two pugs on the waterfront in the first scenes. Others were Sammy Stein, Mike Mazurki (Ever heard of him?) And "Wee Willie" Davis. These guys had a strong, but unbalanced look at them that the old fighters of Pierre 9 might have. <br /> <br /> We have not forgotten the leading lady Alexis Smith. She is strong in her characterization of an “independent” woman, but retains enough true abilities as a comic player in many scenes. In her poor little rich girl Victoria Lodge she demonstrates a wide range of possibilities. <br /> <br /> With all these ingredients in hand, the trick is how to mix the elements in the right proportions to give them the “right” mix.

If this is the first time, or if you see it again: <br /> <br /> “KORBETY ABOVE IT AGAIN!” <br /> <br /> * In my humble opinion of the historian both in films and in Pro Wrestling, it seems that Thor Johnson, who years later was a favorite of director Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> ** “Livery” is a somewhat archaic term for a car that can be rented for locals. urban transport. <br /> <br /> *** This is true. Mr. Raul Walsh was a veteran of Griffith. He was an actor to portray John Wilkes Booth in the film The Birth of a Nation (1915). <br /> <br /> **** Born in 1887, Raoul Walsh was old enough to have his own memories of the 1890s and the battle at the Sullivan-Corbett Championship and what it meant for sports in America of those days.
