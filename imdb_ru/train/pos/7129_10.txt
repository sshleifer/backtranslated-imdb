This film has been on my wish list for ten years, and I just recently found it on DVD when my grandson received it from a partner. He watched this and was excited to learn that it was about my generation — born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939, and he wanted to know more about this — and about me. Fortunately, I borrowed it from him, he looked and wept. He not only caught the emotions, class differences, difficulties and warmth of human relationships of those years (as well as cruelty (spoken and unspoken), but was accurate! I am also a little anorak when it comes to the ARP uniform, ambulance car (LCC) the right color (white) and all the obstacles to the management of the bombs and the work of the Heavy Rescue Brigade. I could not blame it of my memories, and the sandbags of Anderson's Shelter and the WVS canteens brought all of this back. and isterz London was also abruptly represented by this war, I survived 1939/40 and my own evacuation from London with this production! I know Jack Of course, Gold’s work, and no more could be expected from him than this meticulous detail, but it went far beyond The framework of accurate presentation of the facts and affected the deep feedback about human reactions and the only underestimated value judgments of those years. Inli was one of the main achievements in the acting career of John Tou and director Gold and deserves to be better known . This is a great movie, and I have already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends.
