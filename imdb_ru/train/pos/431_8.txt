It begins slowly, showing the boring life of two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy in April, but do not give it up. Nothing special happens, but time passes exquisitely, and there are many cunning jokes (my favorite is a carriage ride during a storm, which I find funny). The film is surprisingly romantic in many ways, the landscape is beautiful (as is Polly Walker), and the resolution in the film is very satisfactory. <br /> <br /> The film takes a few freedoms from the book, Arbuthnot / Briggs / Desterâ€™s biggest creature in the business, but I really preferred the version of this film (it may be more sentimental, but I felt it was more in tune with the story , and in any case, I like the feelings when everything will be fine). <br /> <br /> Great movie, especially dating movie in lousy weather.
