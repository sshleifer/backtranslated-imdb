Kenneth Brann's Hamlet hits all marks. The game is gorgeous, 70-millimeter cinematography is gorgeous, the costumes and decorations nominated for Oscar are amazing, and the Patrick Doyle rating (also nominated for Oscar) is sensitive and touching. Oh yes - the script made by a certain guy named Will S. is also not bad. Film critics blamed Branah for receiving the fourth nod from Oscar for “adapting” the script, but his decision to use the full text was a bold one. I can't think of many better ways to make it fly four hours. <br /> <br /> Almost every decision Bran makes works brilliantly: using English Blenheim Palace for exteriors, Edwardian clothing and staging "To be or not to be" in the hall of mirrors to name a few. Casting Hollywood luminaries such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in minor roles may be distracting, but it is picky. The main cast of actors surpasses: Derek Jacobi reflects the conflicting nature of Claudius; Kate Winslet sharply portrays Ophelia in insanity; Julie Christie brings passion to her portrayal of Gertrude; Richard Brier is perfectly perfect as the cunning Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell is building the potentially ungrateful role of Horatio in the apotheosis of true friendship. Every speech, every line, every word is pronounced with passion and conviction; There is no lost moment in the whole film. The final scenes reinforce the extent of Shakespeare’s tragedy in ways that are impossible with theatrical adaptations. <br /> <br /> Branet's “Hamlet” is a bold, ambitious and ultimately successful attempt to match the greatness and poetry of the Shakespeare language with equally eloquent images. Perhaps this is the greatest Shakespearean adaptation ever shot ?? Strong praise, but well deserved.
