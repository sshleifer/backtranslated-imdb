Tea Leoni is played by Nora Wilde, a serious photographer who is experiencing an unfortunate divorce. She wants her freedom, but it is expensive. She wants a legitimate photograph, but she is hired to work in tabloids as paparazzi. Her boss plays the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor. The show was well written most of the time. Nora from TEa began to develop into a rather memorable character, but the network simply did not support comedy, and they still do not support it. Even when they brought George Wendt from the Cheers, they made unnecessary changes to the cast and characters. At the beginning of the show it was wonderful, and the audience got used to it, but then the network spoiled it, like a bad plastic surgery.
