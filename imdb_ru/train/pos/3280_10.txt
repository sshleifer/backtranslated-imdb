I only saw this movie once, about ten years ago. I bought a DVD two days ago, and, having watched it, I think it is even better than I remembered. <br /> <br /> Paperhouse is more than horror. He had such an amazing level of emotions and a great characteristic. I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really excellent here. It is a pity that she did nothing else, because in general she was an excellent actress. Her image of emotion throughout the film was perfect, with enough subtlety to convey the message, especially at the end when she realized that although Mark was dead, she knew that he would be fine. <br /> <br /> Several scenes made me jump (which is rare for me in modern horror movies), especially the bathroom scene, the scene in which Annaâ€™s father chased her with a strange radio in the background, and bits where feet fell apart and crumbled to dust. <br /> <br /> In general, an excellent and very touching film.
