I gave this film 10 not because it is a great consistent film, but because it is the pure ability to evoke the emotions of the audience. The history of the struggle “one woman against all” has long become a cliche, but very few films have sustained it with such warmth and sincerity as “Purple”. <br /> <br /> It also showed the other side of the African American experience - showing that after slaves got their freedom, many got in the way of the hated “white man” and insulted their own people. I find this an important point, because it goes against the tendency to "portray white on black violence and victory in the Oscars." <br /> <br /> In addition, the acting is excellent - especially Oprah, which I now found a new respect. <br /> <br /> Worth a look - but keep some cloth on hand.
