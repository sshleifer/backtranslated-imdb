A few years ago, I added a comment to the IMDB commentary on The Real McCoys. I said then and will repeat now that it was a charming, funny and interesting show, well played with wonderful characteristics. <br /> <br /> I recently saw four old episodes of PLUS on the DVD Reunion of 2000 with Richard Krenna, Katie. Nolan and Tony Martinez. As another writer mentioned, it is curious that Lydia Reed (Hussey) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) were not referred to, but perhaps they can be tracked using SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> Reunion Show was well done and gave us many unknown ideas about the show. One piece of inside information we did NOT get was whether Katy Nolan regretted leaving the show in an unpleasant contract dispute that left Luke widow last year, which was not very good. Nolan went on to make a comedy called Broadside about women nurses in the Pacific in World War II. Take it Volley? No, not funny. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the vile, obscene and cruel TIPS on television, which are so much undermining our values, “Real MacCoys” entertain worthy values ​​and good people. And I thank all the participants, including the creator, Irving Pincus, for bringing it to my family. We never missed it.
