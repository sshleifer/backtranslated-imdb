A long film about a very important character from South Africa, Stephen Biko. He is one of those blacks who did not survive apartheid, who actually died long before his usual time. Although already an old film does not show how important Biko was, what he really represented. His life and his teaching are minimized, at best, with a few witty remarks. The film, shot in 1987, was aimed at putting South Africa on the edge that would lead to her release. Thus, the film aims to show how irrational apartheid supporters in South Africa are in 1987. To show this, the film must look not only at Bikoâ€™s death, and therefore, focus not on Biko, but on the white liberal journalist and his departure from the absurd. the system in which he lives. His escape is necessary because of the victimization, from which he became a victim with his family, and also because he wants to publish the first book about Biko after his death, and this can only happen in England. The film shows a way to escape South Africa, while apartheid is still standing and killing. Therefore, do not expect this method to be realistic and truthful. It can not be. But the film is very old, because there is no historical alienation from South Africa, the very alienation that took place under the chairmanship of Nelson Mandela and which is called forgiveness if those who want to be forgiven express their opinions. The film is strong and emotional, but this historical limit makes it rather weak today, especially since the film does not mention the third racial community, the Indians. All panegyric books or films have such a flaw: they look at the person they should portray from only one point of view. This explains why the film has aged so much, it seems to have come so long, as if nothing has changed. Need a remake. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University of Versailles, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, CEGID
