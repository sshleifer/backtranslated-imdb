Kimi wa petto is a cute story about a girl who once finds a boy in a box that once is outside her apartment. She decides to insert him and fix his cuts. Then she leaves him a note so she can eat some of the food she prepared and go home because she had to go to work. However, when she comes home, she discovers that he is still there. He tells her that he wants to live there with her, like a brother or cousin. In desperation to make him leave, she tells him that if he becomes her pet, he can stay. And as a pet, she says that he will not have any rights and will do everything she tells him. (not in such a perverse way!) To her surprise, he agrees, and since then he has been called Momo, her pet.
