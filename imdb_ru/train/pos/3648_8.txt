"Pandora's Watch" is an exciting thriller, which is a cross between a movie about viruses and a movie about a catastrophe. This film, which was shown in two parts on the NBC channel in its debut show in 1996, talks about flying on an airplane that becomes infected with a virus when one of the passengers accidentally fell ill with the disease. The US government is arguing about whether the aircraft should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) are trying to figure out something to avoid a crash. I am not a very big fan of television films and mini-series, but I liked Pandora's Watch. It's a damn cool ride. Jane Livs (“Frasier”), Robert Loggia and Edward Herrmann (as president) also play a major role. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
