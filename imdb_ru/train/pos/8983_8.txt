They shoot at the car through the windshield, someone plays their last song to someone, someone else has not responded, according to the voice-over statement. I just wonder how it happened. There were too many scenes in this film, and I was surprised how the camera appeared. If the scenes shot where Warhol went down to the BJM post party are true, then it was unpardonable exploitation to the maximum, if not, it was a complete fabrication, in any case, I was uncomfortable if that was the goal? Throughout this film, I continued to wonder how these shots appeared. Taken at face value, a beautiful portrait of (tortured) genius, whom we all consider ourselves.
