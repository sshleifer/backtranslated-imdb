Melvin Douglas and Joan Blondell star in The Amazing Mr. Williams, a 1939 riddle / comedy that is pretty good, though forgotten, probably because of the number of incredible films that came out in 1939. <br /> <br /> Douglas plays a talented police detective who is married to his work, while his girlfriend is waiting for a wedding, which is constantly being postponed. What happens in this film is no exception — he is called to the scene of the murder when he is about to walk down the aisle again. <br /> <br /> Both stars were excellent in comedy, worked well together (and often), and help make this battle of sexes fun. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are always ready to provide excellent support. <br /> <br /> As you can read in other reviews, Melvin Douglas is not very good for a woman. <br /> <br /> Entertaining, if a little along the long side. <br /> <br /> One of the comments here crushed Melvin Douglas, one of our greatest actors. He literally effortlessly sailed through dozens of films in the role of another person and best friend, before plunging into a movie as an old man. He was not lazy, but rather a very hard-working actor (who made it look easy), who made a career on Broadway at the same time as his movie career. He simply wasn’t cast as a lead man in films and didn’t give very complex roles in the studio system. I urge anyone to see his destructive actions in “Hud” and “I have never sang for my father” and call him lazy or refer to his smirk.
