Errol Flynn - "The Gentleman Jim" in this 1942 film about boxer Jim Corbett, known as the man who defeated John L. Sullivan. Alexey Smith, Jack Carson, Alan Hale, Sr., William Frawley and Ward Bond also starred in the film with the good hands of Flynn's good friend, Raoul Walsh. Flynn plays an ambitious, selfish young man who has a natural talent for boxing and is sponsored by the exclusive Olympic Club in San Francisco in the late 1800s. Although he is good-natured, the fact that he is a “slum Irishman” and a social climber, causes discontent among members of the Olympic Club; most of them cannot wait for him to lose the battle, and they bet against him. Despite this, he rises to fame, even working as an actor. Finally, he gets the chance he was waiting for, a match with world champion, John L. Sullivan (Ward Bond). Sullivan requires a deposit of $ 10,000 to ensure that Corbett will fight for a wallet of $ 25,000. Corbett and his manager (Frawley) are desperate for money. However, assistance is provided in the form of a very unlikely person. <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting film, and Jim Corbett is a great role for Flynn, who at one time was a professional fighter. He has the necessary charm, beautiful appearance and athleticism for this role. Alexis Smith plays Victoria Ware, his romantic interest, which insists that she hates him. In real life, she does not seem to exist; Corbett was married to Olive Lake Morris from 1886 to 1895. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Corbett and his career, not on boxing history. Corbett used scientific methods and innovations and is considered to be the man who made the prize fight an art form. In the film, Corbett is a fleet of legs and avoids being hit by his opponents; It is believed that he so exhausted John L. Sullivan. <br /> <br /> A good movie to catch Flynn at the peak of his too short time as a superstar.
