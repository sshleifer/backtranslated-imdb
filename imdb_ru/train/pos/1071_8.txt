definitely needed some work in the second season. For example, Virus between Max and Logan, Ames White and his ancient supercult. However, in the second season, the only thing that made me watch was to see if Max and Logan could ever get rid of the unpleasant virus infecting Max. Very good drama in the second season. But, of course, as in all serials, if something is wrong with this, the broadcasting company removes it from the air. I seriously hoped for the third and last season. The second season leaves you alone, if you donâ€™t read the books of Max Allan Collins, then you will know what will happen. <br /> <br /> Dark Angel has to be put on air for another season, even if it may cost a lot to get all the original actors again. since Jessica Alba's sky has taken off after the show. If so, then there must be a film to complete it. just like the Firefly show, which, of course, FOX canceled.
