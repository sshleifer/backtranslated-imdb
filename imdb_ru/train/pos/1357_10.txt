Wow what an episode! After last week, when Mellis constantly starred in the comedies about the friendship of Annie and Brandy, I almost broke out. But it was nothing until I saw the tirade of Mellisa after the dismissal. Seeing her everywhere on the set ejaculate obscenities and screaming for someone to take her purse, it was absolutely the most fun thing to ever have on reality shows. She kept screaming at people outside the set to get her "everything" as if someone else would wear her hideous outfit. Mellis, are you 40 years old and are you still hysterical? Then Joan starts calling Annie and Brandi with all the names in the book, and then gets up and leaves the show! Both rivers are spoiled guys who were left on the show for so long to maintain their rating. Mellisa cries and refuses to give an on-site interview, simply proving to America that everyone thought you were a spoiled child. WAH WAH I can't get my way! I love how Annie told the cameras that she could manipulate Mellisa to think about her, and then did just that. Mellis is definitely the smartest opponent and clearly deserves the victory in the whole game.
