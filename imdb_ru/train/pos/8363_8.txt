This is one of the best classic films of Edgar Wallace from the German TV series - it has all the basics for a very nice crime movie from Wallace since the 60s: although his majesty, Mr. Kinsky, is bored, you still have a young Joachim Blacky “Fuchsberger, Once again, he played the role of a typical smart American "womanizer", you have a young Eddie Arendt in his best (and equally typical) role - a cool, sophisticated British butler - and you have (already not so young) Lovitsa as melancholic, but very “Dry” ironic (and, therefore, very interesting) police investigator. In addition, you will be offered a strange and very kind "evil guy" under the mask of a frog (hence the name of the movie!), You will get a crazy swinging soundtrack, classic scenes of action films, partially shot from the wildest perspectives (please remind him when he was born!), screaming queens of screams, and so on, and all ... All these ingredients are well shaken in the sweet tasty cocktail of pure German Edgar Wallace - highly recommended !!
