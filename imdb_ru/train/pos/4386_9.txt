This is one powerful movie. The first time I saw this, the Scottish accents made it difficult for me to understand, and this spoiled the viewing experience. I refused it, but then I bought a DVD, used English subtitles when I needed them, and really got into this film, figuring out how good it is. It is excellent. <br /> <br /> The widescreen image makes it spectacular in parts, with some beautiful rocky landscapes, and the story reminds me of Braveheart telling the story of good and evil. Here is Liam Neeson (good) against Tim Roth (evil). Both do their job well. <br /> <br /> Few actors are as disgusting as Mouth. Dude, you really want to hit this guy with your arrogant, annoying pussy. (He is so nasty and ugly that sick critics love his character more than anyone else here). Neeson is a man of man and a solid hero, like Gibson in the movie "Braveheart". Jessica Lange is strong here as a leading woman. The film attracts you and involves you completely, so you are ready to experience an emotional experience while watching.
