I agree with Jerry. This is a very underestimated space film (of course, how many good low-budget films are not underestimated?) If I remember correctly, the mystery was a kind of variation (but not “robbery”) of 2001 because the computer controlling the spacecraft was in fact which somehow turned into a computer. And, like HAL, they tried to turn off its “mind”, but not its mechanical parts, and, as in the case of HAL, this led to a catastrophe. There is at least one funny moment. When the character of Christopher Carey, who cannot find food, finds an abandoned poultry, some ominous moment arises, but then the obvious does not happen in the end.
