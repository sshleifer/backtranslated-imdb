I first saw this film in 1980 at noon. After many follow-up views (and video purchases), it still makes me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a relic of a different age - a home comedy in a wealthy American middle class - but a well-executed one is well executed. But this is also a document of his age — a celebration of post-war optimism, the baby boom and the nascent consumer age. This film is not a "guilty" pleasure. <br /> <br /> Three remarkable sophisticated protagonists of the actor - urbanist Melvin Douglas; stunned by cary grant; The terribly defined Mirna Loy - complement each other and memorable team of characters. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes are “This means we have to blow up,” as well as “Miss Stellwaggen” and “This Little Pig.” <br /> <br /> Love it.
