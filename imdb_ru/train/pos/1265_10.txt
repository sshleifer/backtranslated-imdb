Hi .. I think Just Cause is one of my favorite films of Sean Connery, this is a tense psychological thriller with great performances by actors, especially Connery. He also has one of the best lines Iâ€™ve seen in films, so the dialogue is pretty good at it .. He also has one of the best scenes in the movie ever when Sean interviews Ed Harris in prison, just fantasy. I really liked it, and I can not recommend it enough, really do not miss this one! Do not pay attention to the negative reviews that the last 30 minutes - sucks, it was just as intense as the whole movie, I really think Just Cause is a very interesting movie.
