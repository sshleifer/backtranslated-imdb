I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and the incredibly talented Jack Wild, and now my daughters also love Jack Wild fans. This film is exactly what films should be: funny and entertaining. This film is not just for kids. Most of the dialogue is aimed at adults, and you donâ€™t want to miss out on Witchiepoo. The music in this film perfectly suited Jack Wild and Mom Cass. And as a fan of Jack Wilde, I would never have missed the chance to see him dance, or hear him sing. The knowledge of the hard life that Jack endured makes this film even more remarkable, especially when he sings the introductory song "If I Could." It makes me stop lovingly adoring him because it gave me wonderful childhood memories that I now pass on to my children. Let's all go to the Living Island, where friendship and fun reigns! And save the memory of Jack Wild, passing Pufnstuff to others.
