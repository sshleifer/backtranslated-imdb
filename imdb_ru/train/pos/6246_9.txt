It’s not a brilliant idea to watch Hundstage if you are not 100% sure of your mental stability, because this film will be put to the test, no matter how normal you are. I have to say that Hundstage is more of a feature film than an entertainment film, so most viewers would not have the level of “maturity” to achieve its delightful side. It seems like Tarkovsky films, but different in their own way. I myself cannot say that I had a lot of fun watching it. But this is an outstanding and very interesting experience for those who are tormented only by the cliché of Hollywood. Hundstage pushes a finger right into your brain and scratches your mind. You can’t just sit back and watch it, you’ll use exclamation marks or watch your eyes wide open throughout the film. A film similar to this one in style is called “Nachtgestalten,” but it was much better and much less cruel. This, for example, is not for children or those who are mentally unstable or quick-tempered. Most viewers are likely to give 10 or 1 to this film. I give him 9 because I saw the “multiple stories in one movie” phenomenon in another movie, and it was better. But this is an outstanding piece in itself. Worth seeing, but be prepared to see something disturbing.
