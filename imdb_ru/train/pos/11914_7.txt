You know, this film is not so good, but, I mean, come on, it's about angels helping the baseball team. I find that the storyline is fun anyway, the dad of this child says he will take him back if the angels win the pennant (because he knows that they will not). The kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win, God helps all the time (through the angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) And in the end, his dad does not take him and rides a motorcycle right in the face of children. it's fun until Danny Glover accepts him and becomes his friend. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the positive thing is that the old woman was left alone to die with her projects and stories. The real winner here is god. Because later he got a job as a writer for numerous practical jokes. <br /> <br /> As a children's film, he gets 7. Like a film about the secrets of a blind, stupid faith and the nature of "God." he gets 10.
