I voted well on how good the game was, not on the content. It still makes me chill after reading a book and watching a movie. Two former minuses go to the destination to rob a family of money from one of the minuses, which they learned in prison. During the trip, the tension begins to increase, as the soundtrack in the film adds to the general expectation. After the murderers had finished their work on the farm, the next morning the remains of the family were found as a friend to the daughter's church. A horrified cry from the blood, when the scene shows a phone with a cut cord, really made my blood run cold and made me catch a cold. That the murderers met their just fates is a small consolation for this doomed family. Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith. The book was also superbly written by Truman Capote.
