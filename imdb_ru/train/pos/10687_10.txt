I have to admit that I was completely shocked by this movie. On the one hand, I went for it on a whim, expecting something mediocre, but, considering this, the most shocking thing was that it was generally in populist American cinema. This is the best British comedy - dark, whimsical and fun than American films have never been. I must stop, however, sincerely recommend it to everyone; I went to see him with a few people, a little English, Europeans and Americans, and although some of us loved him (mostly from the first two groups), some hated him and found him useless. If you think you are in such a thing, then go. If not, do not. 10/10
