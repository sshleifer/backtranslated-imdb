That would be my number one movie in 1991, except that the brilliant JFK won it. This is such a wonderful movie! I like it. I like stories where the lives of different characters intersect with others and how to cope with their lives. Kevin Kline is good here, but overshadowed by Danny Glover and, especially, Steve Martin. I never liked Martin or his style, but here he is great. I liked the whole speech he gave to Klein near the end of the Grand Canyon. The letter was excellent. Larry Casdan, IMO, the great author of the dialogues, following the example of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here he formed several three-dimensional characters and well-designed plot lines, as well as messages that give a positive sense of our life. Really great movie. 4 out of 4 stars
