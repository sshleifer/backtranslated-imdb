This show is beautifully done. When it just came out, I thought it was nothing more than a carefree family comedy with a few good commercials. It seemed that it was really good for many families, with different concepts of both parent and child, however, as I said, I never thought of it as good hours in the evening. However, my eyes were shot through another window, when the fantastically amusing John Ritter died tragically. The program stood still and really very sensitively appreciated the life of the characters, which also touched the hearts of all the admired characters of John Ritter, a fantastic actor who could do anything. When the show went on the air after Ritters was broadcast, I really wanted to just hug Dad and tell him how much he means to me. I thought this glow cast the acting talents of three children, in particular, the character of Bridget, who was worried about the last words she said to him. It reminded me that no matter what horrible things I say to my father, I do not mean them, and it is very important that he know this. Great show
