Everything, my name may sound strange, but there was nothing else! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I didn’t see anything like that, so it was insane! Of course it is good. This is a fun interesting movie, and my favorite thing is how they are intertwined into one! Like a little chicken, a fish pretending to be King Kong and Runt, a pig saying, “Beautiful Twas that killed the beast,” the War of the Worlds scene and more. The Walt Disney Company did NOT lose touch, maybe not because of this. Also, how they did it, how they watched the movie, and it looked like a home theater. <br /> <br /> However, some parts do not fit. Like the original lion king, weren't Timon and Pumba with Simba when he defeated Scar? In this film, they are not! they fought hyenas behind the scenes. Moreover, the reason is that Pumba is not so sure that other animals pushed him, as well as just Timon, Timon, Timon. Does anyone realize that only the story of Timonn was told, whereas Pumba only had memories? <br /> <br /> But besides this, THIS IS EXCELLENT!
