No hidden agenda. Pure fiction. It's all fun. <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV and was very scared. I was a child :) <br /> <br /> The original can be assessed more than the new one that I saw and forgot. The original, in which the great movie star Steve McQueen (BOOLET) starred, is definitely the best and only version that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> Production of the film is dated, but Rex was used to create Blob stands. the test of time. I was convinced that this thing was moving by itself. 10/10 <br /> <br /> Zapoid
