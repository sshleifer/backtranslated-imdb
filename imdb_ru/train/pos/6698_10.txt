I used to love Sabrina the teenage witch and saw every episode. I remember how I sat every evening at 6:00 pm and waited for him to come to Nickelodeon, however, when Sabrina left high school, the show started to go down. The best TV show should be when she was friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one it is). From there, the next episode (Friends with Dreama) was still really good, but when she finished high school, it just didn't seem right. All the main characters seem to have left, which meant that there was not so much the old “sparkle” in it, but the first episode in which Sabrina goes to college is still relatively good and watchable, however, when her aunt leaves and Sabrina moves in their house is just not right. She is no longer a teenager, so the name of the show is wrong, and without Hilda, Zelda and Josh the show seems wrong, especially when Sabrina almost marries someone who is not Harvey. Thank God, he went through the last five minutes of the last episode to pick it up. In general, I still love to watch the old episodes of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, but I think the writers have gone too far and should have left her when Sabrina left school. Because after this show definitely lost some of its magic
