It was a great movie. How these women tried to save their husbands. I thought the performances of the actors were great. I had to think about the film for a long time. I think every student should watch this film so that they can think about war, relationships, friendship and love. I liked the movie because he told and showed me how strong love can be. I would like to be as strong as a woman. I really liked it because it told me something about relationships, and this is what I like to see in the movie. I think you can compare the film with Der Untergang, The Pianist. If you put these three films together, you will have a wonderful idea of ​​what happened during the war. We must remember something like a war forever.
