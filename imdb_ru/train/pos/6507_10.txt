This series, probably created in the most favorable time after the events of the Second World War, has a scale of value that is much higher than any personâ€™s presumption to criticize. <br /> <br /> The time for the World to produce war in 1974, which is about three decades after the military events, makes it possible to accurately relate events in a manner not colored by residual propaganda and bias. The thirty-year period makes it possible to back up this information with impressive and fascinating protection for all those who participate in it: from the highest military and political figures to field soldiers, civilians and such survivors in death camps, as they remain witnesses to the unimaginable inhumanities that civilized people are capable of. Interviewed subjects who were closest to or were at this level had enough time to reflect on their experience, and in most cases they had enough time for propaganda and ardor that could affect them in the past to recede, leaving only memories. about what they saw and what they did. <br /> <br /> The information these survivors give is strikingly supported by the positions and expressions they show, telling their role, gives their stories even greater effect. Names like Ira Iker, Adolf Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer, Gertrude Junge (Hitler's personal secretary) ... the list is too long to be linked. <br /> <br /> Today, during the life of those who have experienced this huge lesson associated with the disgusting price of political ambitions, young people who repeat the military and nationalist propaganda of the same kind as during World War II. The DVD series discussed here should form the core of the compulsory subject of history in schools, so that lessons bought for such terrible money in those days are not wasted, but must be taken to heart by those who have not seen the terrible price with their own eyes. <br /> <br /> I almost finished watching the 11-disc set when I saw most of the series when the local TV station broadcast it more than 10 years ago. He did not lose any of his poignancy for me, it really became an even more magnificent chronicle of some of the darkest days of human times. <br /> <br /> The highest possible rating seems unworthy to apply to this presentation. , I think the value of this series is incalculable.
