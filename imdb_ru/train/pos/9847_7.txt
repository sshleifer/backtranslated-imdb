It was fun to watch this movie ... even though I had the feeling that this movie almost copies Monsters Inc. There are quite a few things that are very similar between the two, the relationship between the animal / monster and the little child, other animals trying to break this relationship, etc. It seemed to me that this was the case throughout the entire film. <br /> <br /> One of the distinguishing features is Scrat :) A very funny character, even if it does not make sense :)
