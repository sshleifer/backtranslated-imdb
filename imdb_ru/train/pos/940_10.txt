OK. I am prejudiced. I live not far from Shrewsbury in England where they shot this wonderful film. Now it looks the same. I remember how they shot here quite brightly, and fake snow on the streets all day. Often, when I walk along Shrewsbury, I see a street or a house, and it will remind me of this movie. <br /> <br /> Scrooge George S. Scott is a more realistic character than many other screen versions. His appearance is not a typical miser. Scott is big and impressive. A person who believes that those who are smaller than him are inferior. <br /> <br /> We all know the history and quotes. The book is one of the most cherished works in English. And I do not believe that there are many cynics who would say that people are not capable of change and redemption. This version of the film shows all this quite beautifully. George S. Scott may be American, but he plays the role of an English miser with remarkable skill. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. If you have not seen this version, I strongly urge you to do so. Usually he is available for a very small amount of money ... or are you too angry?
