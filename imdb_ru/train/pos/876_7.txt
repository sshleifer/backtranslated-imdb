Audiard's extraordinary movie Read My Lips is a thriller with a lonely heart. It is perfect for the charming charisma of Vincent Cassel and has a surprisingly discreet presentation from Emanuel Devos. Devos is a recurring feature of Audiard, just like KArin Viard appears in Jean-Pierre Jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (in this film, everyone calls it unattractive), universal and able to subdue the profile. <br /> This is almost a definition of her role as Carla, a service dog worn at, mocking colleagues who exploit her deafness. And yet she finds ami d'expitation, if you like in the former prisoner Cassel Paul. Each uses the unconventional talents of the other (theft and lip reading) to overcome their situations and form an unconventional romantic rendezvous. Devos / Audiard is controlled by the deafness of Carla and her attendant twisted inner world with discreet, stylish intuition. <br /> <br /> In this movie (2001), Audiard already clearly controls its control of voltage, actions and puts its frame. with a truly intuitive experience that will be a great hit - the Prophet - nine years later. 7/10
