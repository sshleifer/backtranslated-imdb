I have to say that this is one of the best films I've ever seen! I was bored and I watched TV. and found the “Home Room”, and it was already after 5 minutes, but I got hooked. It was so interesting and touching. It shows what can happen in someone's life. I give him 10, more if possible. The director / screenwriter and actors did an amazing job. I think teenagers should watch this movie and learn from it. It was great drama, mystery and more. I cried for hours! I think the director / screenwriter should write more films like this. I like it! I didn't even know about this movie, which is sad because it was so good. I would like it to go to the cinema for more people to see.
