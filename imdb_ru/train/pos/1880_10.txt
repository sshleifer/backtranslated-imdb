Dudley Moore is fantastic in this complex unknown classic. This film is a very witty film that depends very much on the talent of the actors. Without Dudley Moore, John Gilgud, Lisa Minnelli and some others, this film could be a disaster. This is not always well taken, and sometimes there is some very banal music that tries to evoke a mood ("psycho" -like music at a wedding fight), but the acting game overcomes this. The character Arthur is cheerful, with his drunken comments. But he develops well and becomes a more mature, well-rounded character when he learns to live his own free will. The end is pretty trite, though. I will not give it up, but it can be improved. Worth seeing many times.
