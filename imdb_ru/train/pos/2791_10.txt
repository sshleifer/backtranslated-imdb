This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and I recommend it to everyone. On my list of favorite films (mental list, mind), the only ones on a par with him are films such as the TV series “The Lord of the Rings”, “Spirited Away” and “Departed Home”. <br /> <br /> main character Jess. At the beginning of the film she is a shy girl with a bit of a strange past, who has much more friends — boys than girls. She really draws you into her life. I also, of course, cannot blame any of the main characters, or someone else in the film. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to watch football even for people like me who have no idea about the rules. The film is never boring. Romance is really sweet and does not make me blush too much! One thing that really did it, although it was an Indian factor. Jess's parents are Indians, and throughout the film there are many bright Indian conventions that provide very interesting cultural information and everything else. Indian people are fun too! In fact, this is a film of the age of majority about choosing the right path and fighting for it. <br /> <br /> Feel good, comedies become my favorite movie genre thanks to this film. They are funny, they are refreshing and make you feel good! ^ _ ~
