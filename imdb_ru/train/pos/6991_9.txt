This is a great movie. The cast is a great combination of characters, and the story is decent. The film is mainly about how a well-proven doctor kidnapped the bodies of dead brides and brought them to his home. Once the bodies are in his house, he removes things (I do not want to use such a general term, but I forget what he deleted) and puts it in his wife to keep her young. Then journalist Patricia Hunter investigates the situation and begins to look for answers about why brides die. She goes to the doctors' house, and interesting things start to happen. Definitely follow this old man, but a positive hero, if you can.
