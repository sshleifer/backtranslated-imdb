“Cuban Blood” is one of those sleeping films that has something to tell about life in a very traditional way. I actually watched it while sailing around Cuba on a western Caribbean cruise. It details the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Little time is spent on the revolution until the very end, when the socialist regime came and took away the property of the boy’s father. Most of the film - the age of the boy and the relationship that occurs in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are several powerful scenes with which everyone can relate. Class A film with excellent acting and directing. This is a film that tells the story without any special effects, grandiose schemes or real turns. This is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes and their victories. A good movie is worth watching several times a year.
