This film - an interesting look at the killer scarecrow genre - surprisingly, he manages to rise to become more than the sum of his parts. Medium scenes, a 30-year-old teen, and some great facial expressions come together to become one of the “new wave” of modern classics. As a spectator, I left the film with the same sense of “shock and fear” as the first time I saw The Godfather for the first time in 1969. The striking depiction of Tiffany Gardner, the morally bankrupt Judy, deserved her nomination for the Grammy, which was well documented stolen by Ricky Martin and his restless hips. Unfortunately, none of the continuations can justify the expectation of the original (in contrast to the series “The Godfather”, which improved with each release and should be completed in 2012 with “The Godfather 4: Eat My Fury”).
