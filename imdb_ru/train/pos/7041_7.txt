WAR, INC. (2008) ** 1/2 John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergey Trifunovich, Lyubomir Neykov, Ned Bellamy, (Montel Williams Voice) <br /> <br /> Cunning and 21st Century Slip "Stranger" <br /> <br /> John Cusack ?? Who wrote the script with Mark Leiner and Jeremy Pikser? The stars are like a tortured bounty hunter named Brand Hauser, who is burned, but decides to do one of the last tasks, freezing a Middle Eastern oil minister named Omar Sharif (yes, this is not Omar Sharif, but you get the tone here from this misfire for laughter) under the command former vice-president of the United States (Aykroyd, old comrade Cusack of Grosse Pointe Blank, committing Dick Cheney's vicious maneuver), recruiting Brand to do business under the guise of the Trade Show Producer in the mythical Turakistan (read: Iraq / Afghanistan) for an American private th corporation Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). <br /> <br /> During the briefing, Brand is faced with a moment of clarity when confronted with the fearless journalist Natalie Hegalhusen (Tomei) and eventually falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Tamerlane is sponsoring the unlikely alliance of Eastern European teenage sensation Yoniki Bebiya (surprisingly decent Duff, imitating her celebrity with a pronounced language) and the idiot, the son of the country's leader. <br /> <br /> This is followed by a bold attempt at a black comedy of the 21st century in the spirit of “Doctor Strangeloff”, but, despite all the difficulties and goals, unfortunately, in this broad attempt to mix more than hits in this broad attempt laugh (unfair war) by testing it on the outsourcing of American capitalism!) <br /> <br /> Although Cusack reefs his Martin Blank from the above-mentioned “Pointe”, he adds a few nice touches of his man in black (he takes pictures of Tabasco sauce to take the rest of the cast makes up for the missed he (except for sister Joan, who is a riot as Hauser’s high-level adjutant and has one of the funniest ridiculous lines in the film: “My mass communication skills are finally paying the price”) for the most part. <br /> <br /> Cusack visited the war in In Iraq at the beginning of this year in 180-degree Grace Disappeared, and here he allows his political views to be worn on his sleeve; Although the overall pace and rhythms of the film as a whole do not coincide - due to the fact that director Joshua Seftel first filmed here his directorial debut (and this ametno), with the exception, perhaps, well-organized fights in which Hauser participates in an environment idiotic groom Babei. <br /> <br /> Nice try, but bad luck; maybe next time Cusack won't try so hard, and let the idiocy of war speak for itself, instead of doing the hard work on its own.
