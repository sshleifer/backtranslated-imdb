"The secret of the lens", perhaps, rather my dear favorite. The best and funniest of Kajawari Yoshiaki, which is known as anime splashes and dirty hentae ecchi anime. I would like him to be even more impolite. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes are the psychedelic sequence of computer graphics, the parts where Lord Helamis blows up his unfortunate minions, the parties that Bill (one of the funniest scenes) causes and whenever my favorite character appears Worsl. <br /> <br /> Check it out. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION: This is not for serious sophisticated anime fans!
