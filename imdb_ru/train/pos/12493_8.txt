After all the shit that happened in Hollywood and India, we finally got a movie that delivers some scary moments. There are some cliché moments, but I'm not sure that it is currently possible to make a completely original film. There is not much new here ... just everything is done well. <br /> <br /> Be sure and be careful, as “subtle” fears arise quickly and often. This film can not be watched while you eat pizza. <br /> <br /> In this film there is one very well-written red herring and, unfortunately, one very badly played role. Cherie Christian simply does not make an effective Julia (wife / mother). First, she is not at all sympathetic. I know, I know ... she just went through a traumatic experience. But the viewer will never recognize her as she is “usually”, and the relationship between her and her husband is rather uncomfortable (unintentionally). I think the director wanted us to show sympathy for her, but I did not. <br /> <br /> Finally, thank you very much for the final, which is both disturbing and satisfying. It could easily be cheapened with a sound effect at the beginning of the final credits, but the director wisely resisted. <br /> <br /> This is by no means a masterpiece, but it is a good, old-fashioned Scary film ... something rather rare these days.
