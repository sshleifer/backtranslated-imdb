I love horses and admire the hand-drawn animation, so I did not expect anything but surprise from the new animated picture Dreamworks Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron. I think you could say that I was a little disappointed. You have a beautiful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story. The story is about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature. Animals do not sing cute songs and do not even talk - the main plus. Unfortunately, there is no narration in the film for Matt Damon; Brian Adams' juicy soundtrack; and enough battle scenes to compare it with the staging of Jerry Bruckheimer. If the filmmakers would have simply remained with simplicity, we would have a masterpiece here. This is not a very good movie, but it is good fun for young children. I would recommend this film to families, because his heart is in the right place and the only thing that does not offend young children. Not bad, but it could be much better. Very beautiful visual effects.
