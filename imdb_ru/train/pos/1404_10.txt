HOLLOW MAN - one of the best horror films of the past decade. The subtitle is original, and the main story is even better. The special effects are brilliant and perhaps the best I've ever seen in horror movies. Kevin Bacon once again proves that he can cope with any role that he falls. <br /> <br /> Claude Rains shook the world with an INVISIBLE MAN in 1933, and now Kevin Bacon shocked * us * with a KNIFE MAN. One of the most exciting horror movies. The action is intense, and chills are true. In fact, you may find yourself jumping if you watch it in the dark on a stormy night. The cast includes Elizabeth Shu, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slotnik, Greg Grünberg and Mary Randle. All of which do exceptional work. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- <br /> <br /> Dr. Sebastian Kane (Kevin Bacon) and his team revealed the secret of how to make someone invisible. After animal testing, they move to human testing. But someone must be the subject. Voiting, Kane becomes invisible. But when his team cannot return to visibility, Kane goes berserk because of his condition when he seeks revenge ... * end of the spoiler * <br /> <br /> The film created unforgettable shock episodes and is intended to become a classic in The next century. This film, which became the basis for a parody joke in “The Terrible Cinema 2”, captures you by the throat and never lets go. The first 45 minutes or so go slowly, developing characters and showing how their experiments work. The second half is exciting and attractive to most fans of action and horror. Think of the deep blue sea. Then change the sharks into a crazy invisible person. And then change the water to fire and explosions. Paraphrasing the movie shark killer. Interesting ... HOLLOW MAN gets 5/5.
