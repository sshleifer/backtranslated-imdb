But the most interesting in this journey. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me that this film is very pleasant. Not only are both roles extremely easy on the eyes, the humor from the cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is predictable, and yes, this is a clich√© romantic comedy. But the fact is that it is a pleasant story, and the message that you have found your only true love sounds true in many ways. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is stumped, and the acting is well done in all parts, and beyond for a comic effect. Scene Bulgari worth its weight in gold, the actress deserves praise! For those who conceived it for predictability - if you want a movie with turns and twists that make you guess ... then you need a thriller. This is a romantic comedy ... she touched my heart and made me realize that I was fortunate enough to find my true love in life, and she was worth all the efforts along the way. <br /> <br /> A great movie date, a great movie for a happy cry ...
