It seems I never write a review on IMDb, unless I'm very surprised at how good or bad the film is. This film falls into the first category. Every year I try to see all the nominees for the best foreign film on the Oscars, even those that I know I don’t like. "As in heaven" seems to meet all the requirements. The plot sounds sweet, sentimental and slow ... For my taste, which is more suited to the original, dark and / or bold foreign cinema (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozon, a lot of modern Japanese / Korean cinema) Heaven "does not seem particularly interesting ... They were not released in the United States, so I sat down to watch a VCD that I found in Singapore, preparing to “remove it from the list.” After a boring start, “How it is in heaven,” it becomes a rare film where you are really inspired by what is happening on the screen. Weak Torons: The characters in the film are pure "serial" characters - Wounded Dreamer, Urban Hooligan, Shabby Wife, Free Woman, Longing for Love, Repressed Minister .... Fortunately, they are pretty much a pretty group, and also be well written and well-acting. Ingela Olsson, as the wife of Minister Inger, would be nominated for an Oscar if her performance were in English. Strengths: the music is beautiful, and the main song performed by Gabriella is truly dramatic and memorable. And watch the angry 87-year-old actress playing Olga, who keeps up with the dancing steps as much as the young ladies! I will not discuss the ending, but I will say that it makes sense. This is a lot of emotional events happening in the last hour of the movie, and you are not quite sure why they happen. Although nothing is explained in the words, it all makes sense, as the films approach the crescendo. **** outside *****. Probably the strongest Swedish film I've ever seen.
