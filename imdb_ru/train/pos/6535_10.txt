It was a great movie! Although there were only about 15 people, including me, it was great! My friend and I laughed a lot. My mom even enjoyed it. There were two middle-aged women and about 20 years old, and they seemed to like it. I like the part where Corky and Ned are like Nancy, and it's all sweet. And when she gets her roadster and Ned there. Yes, it was a great movie, even if people underestimated it, lol. Go look, bet you will like it !! I really liked it and my friend too. <br /> <br /> People were so cool in this movie that they didn't even see him. I bet next time they give a chance to movies and actresses. They all did a great job, in my opinion. But if you have small children, it is still appropriate. I'll probably take my 7-year-old niece to watch her too.
