A great movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are beautiful, the songs are beautiful, the dances with a special mention of Portobello Ballet are great. As for the animation section, the match between animals has become an instant classic; The climax in attacking rebar is intimidating and exciting. I recommend watching the recovered 134-minute version or at least a 112-minute video. Here in Italy, we only have a 98-minute version, although the film was presented in the original release with a duration of 117 minutes. If possible, also watch the German video tape: it was generated in 98 minutes, but it lacks all references to the Second World War and all the scenes between the British and their Nazi invaders!
