And my kids love it now! Of course, I can now see and understand that the animation was not so good, and that the plot is banal. Hey, if every villain introduced himself, saying, “I’m mmmm DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT,” I think you can laugh at them, but for young children it’s a moral story with catchy music. <br /> <br /> The music is so catchy. I remembered the words after not watching this film in twenty years. I definitely recommend this one for younger children.
