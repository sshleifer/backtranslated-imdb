I thought it was an absolutely fascinating film that tells about the lives of the characters Mary-Kate and Ashley Sam and Emma Stanton. They both try to make themselves and their parents happy, but; Unfortunately, it is simply not so easy for them to do this! I thought it was a very charming and cute movie, and if you are a real fan of these amazing girls, Iâ€™m sure you will agree with me here! If you have not seen this movie, then I say that you really missed it; Great time, and that you should definitely take the time to see it now! This film is a real winner! Regards, Rick Morris
