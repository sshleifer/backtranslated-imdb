I have loved this movie since it first came out. I was about nine years old, and now I am 27. I remember playing a video game on the Sega Genisis. I had so much fun, I would like to show my son this film. He also likes Michael Jackson, and I know that he will love this film just like when I was a kid. Although he is much younger than me when I first saw it. I can't wait to get it on DVD! I hope this goes on DVD! Please give it a DVD! I am eager to see it again !!! Well, this is my comment, I hope that one day I will be able to watch this movie again. I love all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini video Badder!
