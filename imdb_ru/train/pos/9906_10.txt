YES, the plot is hardly believable and very thin. YES, acting ranges from medium to funny. Yes, it was done many times before. However, we are dealing with a film that does not shy away from these facts and claims to be nothing more than it. There are indeed some original scenes of death, and the tension does increase throughout the entire film. In addition, you are never a few minutes from a bloody murder. I urge everyone to watch this film with an unbiased look and see it the way it was; Terrible, funny slasher with a unique theme.
