Cinderella is one of the greatest Disney films, one of those films that I think you value more as you get older. Disney creates a magical version of the classic fairy tale. I believe that the film was the greatest of his films at the time of its release. Characters have become more voluminous than earlier films, creating more depth to appreciate the characters more. Cinderella herself, in my opinion, is one of the greatest characters ever created by Disney. With her kindness and dash of dry humor, she is extremely pretty; however, this inspiration that she provides makes her unforgettable. Like many people, she is an endless dreamer, and she keeps her dreams, never giving up. Even in the most adverse situations her dreams come true, and she will not allow anyone to take it away from her. Her example should serve as an inspiration for everyone and an inspiration never to part with their dreams.
