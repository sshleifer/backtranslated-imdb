I caught it on a platter last night. I liked the movie. I went to Russia 3 times (adoption of our 2 children). I can't understand why I liked this particular movie, except that I see “bad”, “good” and “good”, “semi-silly”. I liked the look of Ben Chaplin on the whole movie. For example, “I cannot believe that this is happening to me,” is it good or bad, everything looks the same (and it works). Great end. 7/10. Rent it or catch it on a platter, as I did.
