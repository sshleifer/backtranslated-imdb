This movie is rated as one of my favorite top 10 movies. Many people who see it for the first time and know little about many topics of the film will probably not understand why I find it so fascinating, so I will try to explain ... <br /> <br /> The film is very rich in historical details and cultural insights, and although there are a few minor anachronisms, they are completely excusable. This story is a retelling of the famous duel between the monk Benkei and the young prince Yoshitsune on the Gojo bridge. During the battle, according to legend, Yoshitsune defeats Benkei, and the monk becomes a faithful servant of the prince. However, this film is a revision of this story and includes war, dark prophecies and political maneuvers. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes of the film is “Mappo”, the prophecy of Buddha, which after 1000 years of his teachings will fail, and the world will be plunged into chaos. In Heian, Japan, after the eruption of Mount Fuji and the civil war between Taira (Heike) and Minamoto (Genji), the world would fall into anarchy and everything would collapse. This is the time of the demons. <br /> <br /> Then you have the way the film resolves the issue of training the Yoshitsune sword with Tenku (Voronov goblins) Karums. The defeated clans often fled to the mountains and disguised themselves as demons to scare away the local inhabitants. They say it is here that historically arose clan ninja. Description Yoshitsune in Gojo fits perfectly into all of this. <br /> <br /> Next, there is Bankey and various varieties of Buddhism, including many esoteric Buddhism of the Shingon sect. They are all depicted fairly accurately, and to add a little more, the film managed to convey the power of meditation and Ki's energy so that it becomes an integral part of the story, that is, it uses magical realism to add an extra dimension to the film, but it does so. to make it tactical and menacing. <br /> <br /> In general, it is filled with exciting tidbits and surprisingly realistic rings for this period. The scenery and costumes are also completely unacceptable and very authentic. The soundtrack is excellent, very thoughtful and sinister. I also thought that the actual acting was surprisingly good. Bankey is a great brooding antihero, Shanao (Yoshitsune) is depicted as a young man checking his limits and increasingly drunk with his own strength, and Tetsukichi, mining the blacksmith, makes both an interesting description of the “common man” and his less than complimentary opinion about killers who see themselves as his best social partners. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, to understand why it’s so good, I really advise you to dig in an old book on Japanese history and see how this retelling transforms the almost carefree story of Robin Hood against Little John into a bloody story about intrigue, violence and hellish karma.
