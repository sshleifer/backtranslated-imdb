I really liked this drama from Sydney Lumet. The best word I can think of to describe it is insanity. He drops the viewer for an hour and fifty minutes and does not allow breathing until the captions start rolling at the very end. Believe me, this movie will help you guess the whole way. <br /> <br /> The story is very well developed and almost brilliant. This is almost like a more complicated story like Tarantino. The acting skills amaze with all the leading and even small details, an excellent cast. I also loved cinematography, it gave the feeling that it was an independent film. Everything was great. <br /> <br /> This film is exciting, tedious and heartbreaking. It's almost hard to watch, but you'll be glad you did.
