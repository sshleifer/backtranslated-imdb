After reading some other comments here, I was expecting something really awful, but I was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CHECK: The original series was not so good. I think that some people remember it with more love than it deserved, but besides the car and legs of Daisy Duke, the scenarios were weak and acted poorly. The guys from Herzog were too smart and smart for backyards, the shriveled Hog Boss was too stupid to be angry, and Roscoe was hyperactive throughout the entire screen. Surprisingly, the series lasted as long as it did before, because there were no plot lines in the first series. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. If you watch this movie by itself, and not as a direct comparison with how you remember the series, then this is not bad at all. The real star is, of course, General Lee. Car chases and stunts are superb, and this is really what D.O.H. it's all about. Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric personality, and together with Sean William Scott in the role of Bo's cousin, they make this film really funny, while the series has never been achieved. Beautiful Jessica Simpson, of course, Miss Daisy, Bert Reynolds does much better Boss Hog and MS Guiney makes the believable nasty Roscoe P. Coltrane as he should have always been. <br /> <br /> If you don’t like humor and crazy car stunts, you won’t watch this movie anyway, because you have to know what to expect. Otherwise, if you need a fascinating car fighter with a few good laughs that don't strain your brain too much, then look at this nice romp with an open mind.
