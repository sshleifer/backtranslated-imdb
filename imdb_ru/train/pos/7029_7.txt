I would highly recommend this film for any musical fan who was eager to see the musical make the right transition from stage to screen. Of course, it is long, but its length indicates how true the original musical scenario of the film is. The sets and the cast really make Sweet Apple, Ohio, a place to be. Protégé Fosse Anne Reinking also does an excellent choreography, giving the dance a nice little city, feeling like it was. <br /> <br /> Casting at first glance may seem strange, but in fact they are quite amazing “Comments about the speech of Jason Alexander made me sick). In fact, his performance literally steals the show. Like Albert, he mixes his own unique blend of manic nervousness with Dick Van Dyke's charm to create a new and improved Albert. The fact that he can dance and sing like no other, also does not hurt. George Wend is another distinguished person who improves Paul Lind's gaze on Harry McAffe, making him less manic, more mundane and stern. His whole character and body language scream "over my dead body." Mark Kudish raises the aspect of Elvis Conrad Birdie to a new height, adding “many thanks” to “Honestly sincere.” Although his physical form is more like a young Elvis than a bloated, stubborn Conrad from the original film. The fact is that this film is so different from the original film (which added painted happy faces, high-speed turtles and Russian ballet !!!) I wonder what someone had to do with Bye Bye Bye? The only possible advantage the original version has is Ann Margret. Otherwise, the update is best in all possible ways. Where the old version cut off many songs and increased the dance breaks where they were not needed (and, in fact, the film ended in the middle of the play), the new version restored the original musical score and added some wonderful new material (“Giant step” is outstanding in this category). We know that we live in difficult times, but if you want to escape from problems and find a happy face, it’s worth checking out.
