I thought it was a great showcase for Mandy's body. If you do not expect anything else, such as clever plot twists and believable character development, you will not be disappointed. Consider this shooting by Sports Illustrated, whose character kills people, especially those who threaten to stand between her and her “mother” (Suzanne Arquette, who clearly does not want to play sex kitten - she leaves it to her daughter’s discretion). <br /> <br /> Mandy's face is a little perfect, but her body is a complete fire with 5 alarms, there, in the ranks of Sophia Loren, when it comes to natural bustiness, an ideal 7 to 10 ratio of waist to hips and perfectly tuned legs, down to her feet. (There should be an ideal configuration from the hips to the knees, from the calves to the ankles, which generally pleases the eye; Mandy is certainly the model for this idealized ratio). <br /> <br /> And there is no flat ass for the boot, which seems to destroy many busty babes with curves around, except for the "lower hemispheres." Mandy might have used a double body in the back snapshot of her losing her towels when she went down to the candlelit Jacuzzi with her Victim German guy blindfolded, but from all I could see from her bikini shots she had a bum for it didn't need a double to prove it. <br /> <br /> Mandy’s acting skills had nothing to do with her impression of the psychotic “Mother’s Girl” with a clear erotic lesbian overtones. Her bisexual nature (allowing herself to be untied in a hot bath after a long flirting with German boy No. 2, who also turned out to be her mother's lover) added an extra dimension to another one-dimensional caricature of female sexual orientation, conflicting with pathological deadly impulses (always in water with men - the ultimate the fate of the Latin housekeeper was edited in the television version for some obscure reason). <br /> <br /> Mandy's Uber-Nordic facial features combined with her Uber. Voluptuous body can be both a blessing and a curse. If Mandy really wants to continue her career as an actress, I would advise her to immerse herself in Romance languages, especially Italian and Spanish - and perhaps French, although I don't know if they will go to her type. But that would allow her to reconcile Bo Derek’s face with Vida Guerra’s body — but perhaps her face is too Scandinavian, and she showed too much of her unusual body in a hilarious film to allow her to move on to any more fame Michelle Johnson enjoyed 1980 -years, whose early glory in "Blame it on Rio" was accompanied by a series of skin clicks that could not get off the ground. <br /> <br /> Wambo Druhle.
