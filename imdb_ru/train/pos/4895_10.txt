Rarely, I sit in front of the TV specifically to watch a specific program. This is even less so when I finally enjoy the program, but “The Last of the Blondes” was one of the best films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A wonderful cast, led by Dame Judy Dench and Jan Holm, and a great, witty and poignant script, combined to make it a truly rewarding experience. I cannot express how well I thought it was, so I will not try, I will just say, if you have the opportunity, PLEASE SEE IT !!!! I only hope this video comes out.
