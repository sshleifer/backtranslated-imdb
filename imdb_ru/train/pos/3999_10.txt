I am ashamed to say that I missed Mother when she was in theaters. I saw it tonight on DVD. I gave him 10 votes, one of the few that I gave here. This English independent shot with such great care and quality. It attracted me tirelessly. The story, modest and purely human, ruthlessly honest and completely exciting thanks to the acting roles of Anna Reed, Daniel Craig and Katherine Bradshaw. The cinematography is awesome. The score is closely related to the plot. The storyline is epic, brilliantly dressed by the writer Hanif Kureishi in worldly lives. This story raises major problems with the subtlety of the impressionist paintings. And some of these big problems are very controversial, which probably explains the lack of awards won, despite the many nominations. This is just one of my favorite movies.
