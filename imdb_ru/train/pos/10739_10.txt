Amazing documentary. Over the past few years I have seen it on the original broadcast date and on DVD several times. I was shocked that he was not even nominated for Best Documentary Oscar for 2002, the year he was released. No other documentary even comes close. <br /> <br /> It was on television recently for the 5th anniversary, but I missed the added “where are they now” segment at the end, except that I realized that Tony is now working for the Hazmat division. <br /> <br /> I have seen criticism in the documentary film production of several of this list. I do not see how it could be done otherwise. They had less than 6 months to collect it and air it. The DVD contains more material and reference information. <br /> <br /> I’m also surprised that, according to IMDb.com, my brother hasn’t had any projects for four years since. What are they doing?
