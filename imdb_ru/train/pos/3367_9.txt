This film has a great acting, a great photo and a very strong storyline that really makes you think about who you are, how you define yourself, how you approach, whether you agree to play the role or break free ... Already have excellent comments regarding these aspects. I want to comment on the official situation of the film. Basically these are two people on the roof. There is a unity of place and time with two main characters and a radio acting as a choir. Many directors turned Greek tragedies into a film, many directors filmed modern stories as if they were a Greek tragedy, but not a single director, in my opinion, did not succeed as remarkable as Ettore Scola in achieving the purity and power of the great Greek tragedies as in the plot line and formal setting. Masterpiece.
