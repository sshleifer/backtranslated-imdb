A great effort for an Australian show. which is probably not surprising, because it seems like a kind of rebirth in quality Australian drama. Do I dare to compare this show with the glitter of love on my way? not. but it is reminiscent of the early secret life of us. The cast is great, Gibney creates his magic in the first two episodes that I saw, the British cast is strong, especially the characters Callum and Lizzy. but abe forsythe can be a saving light (not what you need to save) if this show gets another season. I was not a fan of his performance on a surprisingly steep mini-series about labeling time a few years ago, but he was great as always in more green. also nice to see Brooke Setchwell again. let's hope the show will improve with each episode.
