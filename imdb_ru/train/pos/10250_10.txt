Guinea pig: The devil's experiment is, without a doubt, ***** stars at first glance, this is a rough, realistic, creepy and disturbing look at the dark side of human nature. This film is relevant, you might think, what's the point? The point is to satisfy fans of just extreme violence and blood. In this film there is blood, more or less cruel torture of a woman. In fact, there are only 3 scenes that can be considered bloody. I will tell you one thing, although “Guinea Pig: The Devil’s Experiment” makes the Hostile look like Sesame Street. If you thought “Hostile” is a crazy, cruel, disturbing film about torture, then you didn’t see half of it until you saw “Guinea pig: The Devil’s Experiment”. <br /> <br /> Movie Rating 0-5, Gore 0-10 <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: Devil's Experiment (Uncut) ***** (7)
