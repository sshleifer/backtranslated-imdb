I went to a small preview of this film on July 19th, knowing nothing more than the names of several actors and that it was some kind of fantastic / adventure quest. <br /> <br /> The storyline is actually not at all what I saw, and the unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or will soon appear in cinemas. Despite the fact that they can give first impressions, it is not stupid, not trite, not sticky and not funny, but in fact it is very funny and amusing. The stream is pretty well made, nothing seems torn or stretched. The soundtrack, because of the lack of better words, is magical and adds a lot to the film, and not just fills the silence, as often happens in movies or on television. And although I could know what was happening at the points, I still could not stop looking at the screen; As far as I know, not a single person left the cinema for the entire movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that worries me is that there’s almost no marketing in this film, and I’m not as brilliant as I find out why.
