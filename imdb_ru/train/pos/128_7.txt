Von Trier once explained how he created such a strong viewer participation in his films, placing his cinematic world in the middle of the real world and the imaginary world. Therefore, as spectators, we think that we are seeing a “true” story, although in reality we carefully manipulate them, often to the extent that the film works anxiously (“Dancer in the Dark”) or painfully (“Idiots / Idiot”) . Of course, Dogme films acted only as a vehicle for this theory (besides creating some desired focus on Trier). <br /> <br /> The story is typical of Von Trier: our hero is idealistic, seems to balance his relationship with everyone else, but soon he becomes a victim of the problems that others have created for themselves in the past. An idealist must inevitably reject society in order to remain an idealist and become a terrorist. Humanity is spoiled, and purity leads only to (self) destruction. (These elements were also ubiquitous in the movie "Break the Waves" and "The Dancer in the Dark.") The film is also full of cynical (even humorous) subtexts about the role of the Germans and Americans in post-war Germany. <br /> <br /> As a technical achievement, the film is beautifully designed: shifting and fading out of blurry colors, overlaying on the screen, acting on various overlays (the most interesting is shooting the future mayor). In this film, we see how well Von Trier treats the film as a technical tool. In his later works, he seems to be moving away from it (as if he is no longer interested in technical advances, because they are becoming so easily accessible).
