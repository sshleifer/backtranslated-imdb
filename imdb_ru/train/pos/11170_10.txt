There is something in Pet Sematary that I have never felt anywhere else. Perhaps the fact that I was a child when I first saw it made this experience so unforgettable. But as I continue to watch him again and again, he never gets old, and I never get bored. From the initial credits of this terrible introductory song to a very chaotic finale, there is something crazy, sad and terrible at the same time, and it continues to sound in your head: sometimes dead is better! <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t think it would be useful to tell the whole story again. All you need to know is that everything starts from point A (the most ideal situation for a happy American family) and gradually sinks at point B (which, believe me, is the very end of all joy). The music is perfect, the story makes sense, the special effects are great, and Pet Sematary is the last place on earth where I would be. As I said, sometimes the dead are better!
