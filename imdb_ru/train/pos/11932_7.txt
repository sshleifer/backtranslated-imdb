I saw this movie on TV many years ago, and I saw this movie when I received it on tape. I thought it was quite well done. It was not the best movie, but it was good enough. The film has enough talent to inspire many people, especially young children. The game was good, with Danny Glover leading the cast. The storyline was not very plausible, but the script was well written. This movie may also be of interest to baseball fans. He has no direct relation to the sports film. This is directly related to a good movie that you can watch with your family and find out some of the messages that are hidden in this movie. Overall, the film was good, but not great. I give this film 7/10.
