This film is very funny. What makes it great, especially two things: firstly, it is the direct way in which characters take stereotypes when discussing their costumes and superpowers. In parody, seriousness is very attractive; The second is the main sweetness of the characters and the quality of chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves special mention as an object of Mr. Forrius desires. There are lots of talents here. I understand that some with high expectations may have been disappointed, but this film is very funny and rather pleasant.
