I found this movie available for streaming to Netflix and thought I would try. <br /> <br /> The plot unfolds around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Fehr and David Qubitt), who finally saw each other after their father passed away. Ryan and Theo argue first about who did what. But later, Theo learns that his brother Ryan is not only gay, but he is dying from an incurable disease. So, Ryan and Theo spend time correcting their differences. <br /> <br /> This is such an incredible movie. I only saw Colma Fira in season 7 out of 24, but he was phenomenal in that. David Qubitt, the actor I have never heard of, did a phenomenal job. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to those who are interested in the gay and lesbian genre. This is one movie you do not want to miss. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10 stars out of 10. Great movie!
