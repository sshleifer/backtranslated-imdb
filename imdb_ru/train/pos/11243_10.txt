I first saw Breaking Glass when it was released in England in 1980. Then I really liked him, and I just saw him in August 2005 at the Canadian station, and he is still great. The only thing I regret is that I cannot find a soundtrack or DVD in stores ?? ... someone wants to shed light, or should I order it from some overvalued Internet company. But, returning to the film, the music stands the test of time, Hazel / Kate had something to say about Britain in the 80s. In fact, it was the same decade when I moved to Canada for the same reasons, one of which was Thatcher, which she was doing with the country at that time. Please, if you have the opportunity to watch this film, you will not regret it!
