Gene Kelly came up with some really great ideas for musicals at MGM. Here he is at the top of his creative abilities, working with the Arthur Freed music division. It's hard to believe when you watch “American in Paris” that players never left the back lot in MGM. <br /> <br /> The magic of “American in Paris” is associated with creative editing under the direction of Vincent Minnelli and the scenery designed by MGM, in combination with some background pictures. The idea of ​​the film came from Kelly, who wanted to just make a film with a long ballet scene, including George Gershwin’s poem American in Paris. That sounded good to Arthur Fried, who approached Ira Gershwin, who spoke well with him if they used other Gershwin material. <br /> <br /> Gershwin received such a deal for Gershwin's music, which was usually received by Irving Berlin. In “American in Paris”, not a single note of non-Gershwin music is heard. Listen to some background music and you will hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me that are not real musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Another guy who wrote lyrics well, Alan Jay Lerner, wrote a story that is admittedly fine. Everything about the ex-GI, played by Gene Kelly, who after World War II never left France, just settled in an apartment on the Left Bank and became a starving artist. He lives with eccentric composer Oscar Levant, and it sounds like redundancy. <br /> <br /> Two women are interested in it. Another American expatriate is Nina Foch, who wants to sponsor him as an artist if he reciprocates on other issues. But Kelly falls in love with the shop girl Leslie Caron plays in her movie debut. The star of the musical comedy Georges Guberial is also interested here. <br /> <br /> Of course, the plot is just a reason to sing and dance to the music of George Gershwin. An American in Paris happens to be the first movie I ever saw as an in-flight movie on my first plane trip. I still remember the flight from Phoenix, Arizona, to Kennedy Airport, where Gene Kelly played "I Have a Beat." My favorite number in the film, however, is Tra-La-La, in which Kelly sings and dances throughout the apartment, and Oscar Levant plays the piano. At some point, Kelly is dancing on top of a baby piano. <br /> <br /> In the book about Arthur Fried, I read a quote in which he said that in the ballet “Americans in Paris” there had to be made against the background of French Impressionists, which he felt would include the public rather than a realistic setting on the streets or in the distance. And so it happened. Kelly made long ballet episodes of “Words and Music”, “Pirate” and “About the City”. But this one led them all. Still, in my opinion, this also applies to some of Gene Kelly’s later films. <br /> <br /> In an unexpected disappointment at the Oscars, the film “American in Paris” was chosen as the best film of 1951, beating the favorite tram named Desire. I think that fantasy surpassed realism this year. Large budgets also have an advantage in these things. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, an American in Paris is one of the best cinema musicals ever created, and since the studios no longer have all this creative talent under one roof, something less likely to be repeated.
