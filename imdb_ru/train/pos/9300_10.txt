I don’t know much about the Pack of Rats, and Frank Sinatra always seemed to me too shy, full of myself. So when I call this one of my favorites for all time, this has nothing to do with the tribute group mentality. As another reviewer says, “Mad Dog Time” is symbolism, not realism. This is a kafkaesque (sorry Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of the very strong crowd when he was as good as Joseph K), he is stylish, knowledgeable, sardonic and clever. Jeff Goldblum deals with many characters, trying not to fall into the trap and acting deftly, not unceremoniously, trying to keep up with what he knows, while others do not know who he can shoot and who not. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (his best performance) have the ball, and the support roll looks accurate. Symbols, settings (one open frame with Jeff Goldblum going down the stairs seems really strange after so many launries in the living room), dialogue (style, not practicality is the order of the day), it's all about the interaction of characters, not exactly gangsterism. Fun to watch, must have been fun to do. What the critics intended was actually a mystery ...
