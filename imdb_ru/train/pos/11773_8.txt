In his earlier cartoon, Bugs Bunny, Bugs acts as a performer on display in a local department store. After he finished that day, a manager comes in to tell him that he will soon translate. Bugs happily agrees that he understands that new work in taxidermy ... and that taxidermy needs to be done with animal stuffing. Animals, like, say, a certain rabbit. This triggers a mind battle between the rascal rabbit and his now former employer. I found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the best in the early 1940s. It still remains funny almost 60+ years later. This animated short film can be seen on the 1st disc of the Looney Tunes Gold compilation, volume 2. <br /> <br /> My rating: A-
