A real comedic farce with a flashy situation in the mid-70s, this film was a HUGE hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared from the face of the earth. I am constantly amazed at some comedy films that come out once a week and then disappear: HIGH ALARM, CHEAP DETECTIVE, BLACK BIRD, DON'T LOOK, NOW WE'RE MADE ......... and have no profile today. NORMAN was the comedy of the month in 1976, and everyone seemed to see it, laughed at it and never mentioned it again. Known for being filmed and transferred to a film, while it was an experiment, NORMAN is a hoarse, politically incorrect farce with a bulky closet that the Farrelli Brothers should look at today. If they had done this in the first place, there would have been no complaints about its content and inclination. This is very funny, and YES, very rude and funny. As it should be. In fact, as an excellent 1976 film with all these terrible colors and clothes, today it really works better.
