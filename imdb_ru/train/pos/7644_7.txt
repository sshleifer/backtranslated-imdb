Jim Belushi is awesome as “Medium Joe”, who gets his 15 minutes in the Twilight Zone. Michael Caine is a mysterious barman who not only listens to the “story” of Belushi, but also “heals” all the problems of the middle class of Belushi: a magic potion that can cause an avalanche of changes in Belushi’s life. <br /> Memories show the 15-year-old is terribly embarrassed that he was defeated in the Baseball Team Championship. Belushi continues his “miserable life”, seemingly happy, but always wondering “what if ...” For several days Belushi experiences a “different” life, which is a huge success, which is admired and hated by others in equal measure. <br /> <br /> This is not exactly “This is a wonderful life,” but some elements are similar and very cute. The “end” is predictable, but still satisfactory. Watch the very young Courtney Cox in some part as a “fatal attraction”, like another woman. Very nice movie!
