Insanely romantic comedy with intertwining scenes that are beautifully combined, and the actors who bounce the lines from each other with precise comic synchronization, a feat that is pleasant to watch When the spineless bridegroom Sher asks her to help him reconcile with his estranged, capricious younger brother, nobody could dream about the consequences of this. Operatic symbolism, confessions of the Catholic Church, love bites and falling snow ... "Moonstruck" is timeless and smooth. The rhythm of the picture begins in about 15 minutes (the early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs in the cemetery is a bit rough, and the next scene with Cosmo and the elderly man at the gate, which seems dull), patchwork attire is intertwined with a deft skill, and the shaky tone of the film and a strange spirit both are infectious. *** 1/2 of ****
