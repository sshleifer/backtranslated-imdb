I was very surprised by this click. Despite the fact that their script was clearly not enough, you should still be impressed that it took 7 years to create this film, and it turned out to be good. The acting was pretty impressive, and the story really fascinated me. My only complaint is that the final was really too sharp for my taste. But hey, if your audience wants more, then this film is a success. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend anyone in Hollywood to look at Antonella Rios, who is an excellent Spanish talent (something hard to find now with all the bad news about acting. Antonella Rios is really a star on the rise.
