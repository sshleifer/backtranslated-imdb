One of the best Kung Fu movies, but not as perfect as I had hoped, given the glowing reviews. The film starts well enough, the jokes are visual enough to translate the language barrier (which is more rare than you think in this era), and to make conversational sequences without a fight passable (for a Kung Fu movie this is a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese militants, who have always been historical plays or (following Jackie Chan's Police Story of Police Story) police dramas, the Pedicab Driver gives us a look at modern rural China. Unfortunately, in the last 1/3 of the film, it turns into the tragedy of a dark melodrama, which, it seemed to me, was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The action is generally good, the duel is between Sammo and 1/2 Only 2 stars Shaw Brothers, Kar-Leung Lau, and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays the bad guy Jet Li. There is only 20 minutes of combat, which is standard, but the apparent acceleration of camera frames annoys me. I understand that they should shoot at half speed so as not to hurt each other, but there are smooth edits, and there is. It really takes away a fight, when it’s obvious that the shots were spoiled. <br /> <br /> However, if you like Kung Fu movies, my opinion here will not discourage you, and if you don’t, you just spent 2 minutes of your life reading this.
