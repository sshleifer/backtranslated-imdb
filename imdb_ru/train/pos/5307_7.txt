Pecker is a young, unknown photographer from Baltimore who becomes a big star in society, the media and on the local art scene. His photographs show the dirty reality of everyday life, like dirty laundry or human excrement. This is a typical theme of John Waters' independent comedy films in Baltimore, showing the odd side of the American way of life between politically correct fashion and conservative negative reactions, exploring the background of the middle-class society in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong from Terminator 2 plays Pecker with the support of Christina Ricky, photographer Cindy Sherman, the legendary Patricia Hearst and long-time actress Water Mink Stole. Although the plot tempo sometimes becomes a big flaw and cannot compete with the fast and furious playful attacks of Water's brilliant “Serial Mom”, there is still a good laugh and some unforgettable scenes like a former drug addict girl who became a vegetarian, sniffing peas from vegetables dishes ... "Pecker" is a wonderful comedy about the arrogance of the art scene, the rush in the media, the middle class sexual anxiety and strange ways to become a pop star without realizing it. Recommended!
