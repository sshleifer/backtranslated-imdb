I really liked this movie. I have seen a few Gene Kelly films, and this is one of his best. I would actually put him above my more famous American in Paris. Sometimes it seems that the story was lost in Gene Kelly's films with wonderful dance numbers and songs, but not in this film. It is definitely worth renting.
