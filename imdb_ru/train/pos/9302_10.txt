Most of the comments were positive, but I would like to add that viewers should also focus on the set. The decorator used many beautiful Art Deco procedures, as well as beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture, and so on. It is worth paying attention to. The film is based on characteristics and symbolism, which is very rich. All the gangster actors were played - it was like meeting old friends, and it was a pleasure. The dialogue was at times amusing, but at times it hung out, and I believe that it should have been. This is a movie lover movie. It was made by people, for people who love the environment. Do not miss it.
