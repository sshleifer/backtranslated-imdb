Despite the excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky, I expected the film to be disappointed because I heard that it did not receive good reviews. Nevertheless, I left the cinema in complete delight at how good Vanilla Sky was. <br /> <br /> There were no bad roles throughout the film, every character is believable. Romantic moments between Cruise's character, David Ames and Cruise's character, Sophia, are realistic and intimate to tears with vomiting (probably due to the fact that they will soon become a real couple). <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky's storyline confuses you in the last third of the film, and you have very little chance of guessing the final. However, the goals are tied to the end, leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness, shock, and sympathy for David Ames. <br /> <br /> The film is intelligent and you should pay attention everywhere. It's not so difficult, because there is a chance that you will be completely drawn into the film and will not take your eyes off the screen for a second. <br /> <br /> I usually forget about movie theaters, forgetting about a movie I just watch. But Vanilla Sky still remains in my memory for several days after viewing. I recommend it to anyone who wants to move from simple, shallow films.
