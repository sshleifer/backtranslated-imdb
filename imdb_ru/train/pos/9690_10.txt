Paulie was cute, cool, pleasant and quite satisfying. I went to this film, expecting to see a typical “family” film that would have found me unconscious in an instant and drooled on the floor. My thinking changed immediately when I was quickly fascinated by the health of the film. It is rare to find a family film that is complete and can be coined as “useful.” Most of them are made cheaply, written and created solely in order to attract young family members, who will then drag the unfortunate elders to the conclusion of a stunned 65 minutes of overly tied shows and stories. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, Poly has a plot. It told about a young girl (Marie) and her best friend Paulie, a parrot who knew how to talk incredibly and quite often communicated with her. The disgusting moron of her father Marie found this incredible and thought that Poli was detrimental to the mental health of his 4-year-old daughter, and quickly separated them. We follow the adventures (and misfortunes) of Pauli, when he tries to reunite with his beloved owner, meeting many memorable characters on his way. Oh, yes, Paulie really knew how to (intelligently) speak and had a quick accent in New Jersey. Great. The plot was rich and fascinating, which attracted me. Pauley is the best family movie I have found and enjoyed wholeheartedly. Ever Seriously. Take a copy, sit back and enjoy a real family movie for the whole family. Do not sleep. I promise.
