I remember for the first time how I saw it in the 70s when it was shown on nightly television. Scared the hell out of me. But then, when I was a teenager, in those days I was not as exhausted in the movies as it is now. <br /> <br /> CASTLE OF BLOOD (aka DANSE MACABRE) is a great example of the Italian horror genre of the 60s, along with BLACK SUNDAY of Mario Bava (1960), THE COURSE OF THE LIVE DEAD (otherwise: KILL BABY KILL) (1966) and the NIGHT CASTLE of Mario Caiano (1965). If you want the atmosphere to look like a ghost and a great composition, check it out. I also rate them along with those early Poe films that Roger Corman was shooting in the same period. <br /> <br /> I saw the new Synapse DVD taken from the French press, and it is much better than this old pan. - and a scanned print that has made crawls on television over the years. He adds a couple of minutes of dialogue (in French), which actually adds little to the film as a whole, but it's nice to see that it is completed without cuts. Unfortunately, the DVD is really nothing superfluous, except for the frames from the film. <br /> <br /> One flash, which I noticed, was at the opening of the scene, where a man with smoke effects next to the camera was reflected on the glass. front door of the hotel. I think the editors didn't catch it at the time, or maybe they didn't care, but this is something that I didn't notice the first time. This is a miracle dvd. You see all the errors, errors and details that were not obvious the first time. But no matter. <br /> <br /> But no matter, he still gets 7 at the IMDB counter <br /> <br />
