I like this movie! This is really strange, incredibly funny, painful, witty ... It makes no sense to talk about the content of the film, because then I will distribute the result! You should see it without knowing what it is about! Everything is connected and has its reasons and why. It starts quietly, and then everything starts to roll faster and faster, until it ends with the most insane explosion that you can imagine! Even more interesting to watch the movie the second time when you learn all the "tricks". The actors are great, especially Ivan Troyan, whose final scenes are a real masterpiece! I highly recommend this film, it is one of the most original films I have ever seen!
