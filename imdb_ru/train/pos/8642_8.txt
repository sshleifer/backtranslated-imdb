This is an amazingly effective thriller. <br /> <br /> David Duchovny and Michel Ensign Ro Forbes is a successful, professional couple, he is a writer, she is a photographer. Forbes is desperate to move to California, and as a result of a compromise, Mulder agrees to the move, provided they visit places of historical interest in relation to well-known serial killers along the way. His idea: he writes words, she takes pictures, and the result is a best seller for a coffee table that sets them for life. To help fund the trip, they decide to share a car and advertise the fact. Since they are unlucky, Brad Pitt sees an advertisement, and soon after the murder of his master, he and his girlfriend Juliette Lewis meet a couple of writers and begin their cross-country hike. Inevitably, trouble follows. <br /> <br /> Pitt is outstanding as a really cool inspirational Early Grace and skillfully supported by Lewis playing her usual white trash character who seems to be her default setting. Spiritual and Forbes also perform a convincing double act, and when events get out of control, you, as a spectator, are plunged into their plight and feel how the tension is increasing. <br /> <br /> An intelligent, sinister and beautiful shot that deserves recognition beyond its current status. Best movie.
