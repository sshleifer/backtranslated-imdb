One of the best shorts is Three Stooges. A spooky house full of evil guys and "The Goon" challenges the best people from Alert Detective Agency. Shemp is in great shape on the famous scene in the dark. Emil Sitka provides excellent support in his role as Mr. Goodrich as the target of a plot to kill. Before it ends, Scamp's "reliable little shovel" is used with great effect. This 16-minute gem moves about as fast as any Rough, and gains twice as much. Highly recommended.
