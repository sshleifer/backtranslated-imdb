So finally, I know it exists. Together with other participants from the UK, I saw this on the fact that it HAS TO BE, it was only a UK show in the 70s. I remembered the name, but got nothing when I mentioned it to people. It shocked me (it's 2 hours), but when you go to bed with doom, whistling through your brain and listening all around for impending terror, isn't this a terrible movie TRULY CLASSIC? I can hardly remember the subtleties of the film, but I am reminded of my quivering flesh and heightened feelings. Can anyone confirm my suspicions that this is black and white? Again, if someone has information on how to get this copy, please contact ...
