I was not alive in the 60s, so I can not guarantee that this film was an absolutely accurate representation of that period, but this is certainly an exciting and intense experience. There are some great performances, in particular, Josh Hamilton (with honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), who play brothers, separated by war. Bill Smitrovich, a character actor that many have ignored for a long time, gives a spiritual idea, because their strict father, who has to question his own beliefs and values, because one of his sons makes him proud, going to Vietnam, but returns empty inside, and the other exactly the opposite. In general, this is a powerful and touching film, which I hope everyone can see.
