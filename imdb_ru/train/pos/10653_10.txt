I know that now it is fashionable to hate this movie. I have seen hundreds of films about films, including his 1963 Ghosts, as well as most of the Hammer films. This film is not limited and not restrained at all, therefore, probably, many modern viewers did not like it. However, many viewers can take out of control films, such as Scream, because knife-killers are easier to believe for most people than demons or ghosts. In fact, there were many great scenes in this film, and the acting and special effects were great. I have seen it 15 times, and each time everything is better. The director of this film made a number of interesting and stylish films and did not strive for realism of the 6th sense. The ghost lets go and, of course, not boring. Perhaps this film may be more like the fans of John Carpenter, but rather the traditional plot structure. The Old Ghost has also been a good movie since 1963. It was even more scary. See both, as well as “The Innocent” and “The Legend of Hell” with Pamela Franklin.
