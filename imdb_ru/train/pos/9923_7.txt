I read several mixed reviews, and several of them directly destroyed the film. Initially, I became interested in this project, because it was led by Tony Scott, and I became very interested in his work after Man On Fire had such a profound influence on me. Before I begin my review, let me first say this ... it's great to see that this film could have been told in a boring and usual way, but the writers and Scott took a different approach. <br /> <br /> Story: <br /> <br /> Simply put, it's not boring. Most Hollywood films provide “proven and truthful” stories that they know will link people, often giving the audience recognition of the film and creating a higher probability of making a profit. This story was one of the most interesting that I saw recently. Just for reference, I recently watched "The Weather Man" and "Lord of War", and although I will say that these films are great and I both liked them very much, both of the stories in these films are boring and they are told exactly how you are expect them to be told. They are not at risk, and they are extremely predictable after you have watched a fair amount of American films. Domino's plot is interesting, and is told in a way that makes you think, "Oh, hell, now they screwed up." And I feel that this was missing in many recent films. In my opinion, there is a lot of depth in it, and you have a lot of questions that can be questioned while watching. In general, this is what interested me so much. <br /> <br /> Characters: <br /> <br /> I felt that the characters were accurate. Knightley did a wonderful job portraying a beautiful woman who was not at all from the inside and wanted to be thought of as who she was. It was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and used all possible means to achieve this goal. <br /> <br /> Choco was very believable, he used Spanish in inappropriate situations, his reaction to Domino’s lack of affection, as well as his jealousy problems in the team ... they all sounded believable to me, which made me feel that his character was much more realistic. <br /> <br /> Rourke's character was the least interesting to me, but it still sounded believable to me. He seemed like an ordinary guy trying to make ends meet. I hope that this is what the filmmakers tried to achieve with it, because this is what I got from it. He did an excellent job of showing Ed in the style of an ordinary Joe, who made his mistakes, but still trying to live. <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies: I believe that they have provided a much-needed heart to the story. It was not just people who received money to buy Bentley, they were real people who had a real problem, and they were looking for other ways to achieve this goal. You could empathize with them because for them the illness of this child was a problem without another solution. These characters were supposed to show real people who were less fortunate, who fell into this mess, because they needed help. <br /> <br /> Gangsters: they made the story sinister in a way that only a crowd can do. And I really liked this part. They also complemented the plot with small intricacies that made the plot even more interesting. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken / 90210 guys: <br /> <br /> They provided a comic relief in a very serious film. , From Wawken's clumsy statements to the incessant references that 90210 guys were former. Their participation in the film only made it even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Cinematography .... yes .... cinematography. This is where this film seems to have lost a lot of potential fans. But, in my opinion, I thought it was brilliant, in my opinion, using the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective. I considered this a method that was correctly implemented, but could always use improvements, like everything else. I applaud and congratulate Scott, the editor, cinematographer and director of photography for getting real chances with this film. Not only did they go far and higher with their presentation, they went much further. Using colors, both extremely light and very dark, gives the film's “look” an ominous and grungy look that accurately reflects the lives of the crowd, bounty hunters and those less fortunate in such a way as to show that their life is not that. ” the same peach or "clean", like everyone else. If you noticed during times of less stress or conflict, there were very few camera tricks, if any. This shows that Scott and his team were trying to achieve something with this look, and they did it for a reason. I understand that most of the people who watched this movie did not expect it, and because of this, many of them were turned off for this film, but I think it was great that Scott accepted this approach. Hollywood films have become predictable and soft. Most of them shoot the same with the same turns. And I'm glad Scott was trying to do something else. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film is not for everyone, but to say that it is rubbish and can offer nothing, there is absolutely no sense in it. I really liked this film, and I'm glad I spent the money on it. I would recommend it to everyone, but I am sure that only a few will respond to it. I have to agree with the earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the “MTV realm” will not appreciate this film, but I think many people will appreciate it. We should all try to enjoy it for being Scott and Co. ventured and tried to create something special and unique. And with that in mind, I think he succeeded tremendously.
