I have to say that I was impressed that the cinema was awesome, shots that are close to perfection, and the way it created tension around a subject that sounds more like a terrible bore, cannot be. <br /> <br /> A film about two narrators, one seen, one invisible. They are both trying to explain a significant series of paintings that caused a scandal a long time ago. The film is about theories and explanations of views, but I must say that the conclusion is quite shocking. Definitely a film that deserves more than 171 votes. <br /> <br /> Just 66 minutes before the end of the plot, the film still feels like a finished work. Fantastic direction! I have to say that it is much better than the “poet’s blood”, and for some reason it reminds me a little. <br /> <br /> I suppose you can call it slang "fancy." It's just a lot of professional talk about various theories and stunning visual effects, but the team and Ruiz really did manage. At least for me. Awesome movie.
