Hardcastle and McCormick is a great TV show. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is predictable in many ways like in the Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, A-Team, etc., etc., etc. br /> This show is just good clean tv. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is quite amusing. They often inject each other several times in an episode that adds a lot of humor to the series. It contains several car chases in almost every episode, but who doesn't like a good car chase? Especially with the coyote! <br /> <br /> I would just like them to make clean tv like this today, I highly recommend it!
