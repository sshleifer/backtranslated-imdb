If I had ever been asked to recall a song from a movie of previous years, it would have to be “Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo” in the sense that it is sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd. Rafi, the words of Kaif Bhopali and not to mention the filming, when the sailing boat goes out on a black background and shining stars. The other one was to be "Chalte Chalte". Pakeezah was Mina Kumari's last movie before she died, and the amount of time it took can be seen on the screen. In each of the presented songs, she looks young, but after that - no. But one actor who did not change his appearance was the late Raj Kumar, who falls in love with her, and especially with her legs, after he accidentally enters her train cabin and, seeing them, leaves a note describing how beautiful they are. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that, if at all possible, should be viewed on the big screen for the sake of filming and songs. The film starred Mina Kumari, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar. Directed by Kamal Amrohi. <br /> <br /> The grandson of Kamala Amrohi began to revive the studio of his grandfather, creating a comedy film.
