This, in my opinion, is one of the best action films of the 1970s. This is not only a great cast, but also many wild skirmishes and explosions, which are still impressive. The story that his brother (Ian-Michael Vincent) recruited a veterinarian from Vietnam (Chris Christopherson) to help clear the criminal element in a small town, and what happens when Chris starts using his position and becomes as bad as the criminals, from whom he was hired to get rid of. It's great to see Chris play against type. Bernadette Peters and Victoria Principal have been very supportive of the respective ladies of the two male stars. Jan-Michael shows the real movie star in this film. I don't think the Vigilante Force is in the video, but sometimes it appears on television. This is a great movie for guys who love movies.
