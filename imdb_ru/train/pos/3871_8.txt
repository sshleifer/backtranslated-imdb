Esther Kahn is a young Jewish woman who lives in a crowded Jewish ghetto in 19th century England. It is surrounded by impending, depressing, dreary, faceless, worn-out brick architecture, narrow sidewalks and streets, darkened windows and crowds of people in black and brown jackets. <br /> <br /> She lives in a tiny apartment with her big family, who runs a clothing store in the apartment. As a child, she worked, had no privacy, wore colorless clothes, shared a bed and was silent to prevent mockery of her mother and brothers and sisters, who ridiculed her for imitating them from boredom. <br /> <br /> As a young woman, her life remains the same - she has no personal life, she lives in a state of mental and physical discord, lethargy and inertness, exudes an empty, faceless facial expression, dressed in a simple, unremarkable clothes and constantly oppressed and dwarfed by the gray, mundane, imposing massive buildings, narrow streets, narrow corridors and narrow doorways, her loud mother and brothers and sisters, as well as the prosaic, banal lifestyle of her family. <br /> <br /> Her only form of mental escape is Yiddish theater. Sitting on the balcony in the first row, leaning over the railing, between her mind and the stage there is a huge space that allows her to breathe, think, feel and yearn. <br /> <br /> Despite this freedom of thought, which the open scene provides Esther, her face and body remain sluggish, soulless, passionless, passionless. <br /> <br /> A simple and generally accepted Summer Phoenix brilliantly conveys Esther's impassive behavior - Summer / Esther does not convey any desire to want something or to foresee something. <br /> <br /> After an unusual explosive confrontation with her mother, Esther finally decides to escape from the dismal life in which she found herself. <br /> <br /> She ends up playing minor roles in several stage plays and meets Nathan Kellen, who is portrayed by typical British actor Jan Holm, who begins to teach Ester the technical skills of acting. <br /> <br /> From now on, Esther begins a grueling double journey â€” learning to act and learn to feel. <br /> She begins to experience emotions that she had never experienced before, and she begins to get the experience she needs to fully understand and master the technical aspects of acting. <br /> <br /> Nathan leads her around the scene through a physical and emotional state. steps of surprise, indecision, anger, disgust, self-hatred, etc .; Then she begins to go through these emotions in her personal life. <br /> <br /> Nathan says there are three truths - the truth about how the character reacts, the truth about how the actor reacts, and the truth that the character and the actor are not the same person. <br /> <br /> These technical steps and three truths slowly destroy the defense of Esther and lead her to two instructive events in the interchange of the film, which mark the beginning of her freedom of thought. , movement and emotions. <br /> <br /> Esther Kahn is a technically challenging film to watch because of his weird and narrow camera shots, the dull direction of a photo that conveys a realistic dim ghetto setting, and a faceless and impersonal Summer Phoenix. a tasteless and unattractive image that brilliantly conveys Kahn's mental and physical inclination, lethargy and vague nature. <br /> <br /> A film that is a must-see for people who want to learn the technical skills of acting, and for people who appreciate minimalist style. ilms and learning character.
