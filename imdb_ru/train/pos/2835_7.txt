Thanks to the Hong Kong VCD / DVD distributors for paying only $ 1.4, and I can get such amazing pleasure. <br /> <br /> Adultery? How often these days. Eva grabbed her two children and kidnapped Nick to chase Louis and Charlotte in Italy. She wants her revenge to be committed, but in the end she also commits the same crime with Louis: she had sex with Nick. <br /> <br /> In this short film, Viviane Naf√© was solving teeth problems in a modern marriage with a light heart. How can you decide to take marriage seriously at this time of fast food when people are now more mobile in the physical, mental and technical areas? The marital obligation requires too high a price for most people to choose to give in to the circumstances. Nick once trusted Charlotte, but he fell in love with Eve after the abduction that caused him to experience significant growth. <br /> <br /> Most viewers can be happy with the ending, because Eve and Nick get together, well, this should be the biggest retribution to the wrong actions of their spouses. Nevertheless, I want a sequel, I want to see how the four will develop after this exchange. Perhaps they can exchange opinions, how to be confident in a shaky love relationship. <br /> <br /> Good game and good scenery. Two young child actors, especially the boy, should not be neglected when he cries at the hotel reception in Venice. And, of course, how can we forget "Bella, Bella" landscapes of the city.
