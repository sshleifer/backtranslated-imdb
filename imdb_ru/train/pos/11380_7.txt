Although the word "megalmania" is often used to describe Gene Kelly, and sometimes his dances are too hard, you have to admit that the guy knows how to make a show. In the film “An American in Paris,” he puts on several prominent numbers, some of which slow down the plot, but are nonetheless amazing. (Look for Gene Kelly "Getting Out of Bed" for a start.) <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly plays in GI, living in Paris, he stayed there to draw, soon he will become a rich woman gigolo but he really loves someone else! The storyline, of course, but the musical numbers keep the show here! I really liked the voice of George Gutari in this. His "Stairway to Heaven" and his duet with Le Jen in "S Wonderful" is "amazing." Oscar Levant and Leslie Karon I can take or leave. In general, a pretty good, but not a dynamite film.
