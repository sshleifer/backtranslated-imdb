I was usherette in an old theater in Northern California when this film came out. No matter how good it is on a DVD, it's even more creepy and scary on the big screen. Although 9 years have passed since I saw him, he is still one of my favorite ones. The risk sounds banal: “They just don't make them like that anymore!” If the “Sixth Sense” has enraged you, this film is definitely for you! Excellent storyline, an incredible set of characters, ominous environment; even the soundtrack has haunting quality. I highly recommend you not to watch it alone. For the fact that the apartment of brown stone was rented only in 1977, you will suffocate (it will be at least 10 times more than today).
