I did not place very high hopes on this film, which pleasantly surprised me. This story is sometimes a bit strange, but in general I think it is trustworthy. The plots are quite pleasant, and the accompanying music is used to evoke some patriotic feelings common to American films. This may not be the best movie ever, but this is unusual for Sweden and I hope to see more of them in the future.
