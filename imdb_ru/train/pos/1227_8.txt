I caught this movie on my local channel and I quite enjoyed watching the movie. It contains all the elements of a good teen film, and moreover - in this film, in addition to the relationship between boys and girls, sex and the like, the problem of using steroids by young people is also considered. <br /> <br /> The film has a feeling of real life - without loud music, without special effects and without outrageous scenes - what was right for this film. This feeling facilitates communication with the characters of the film - some of which we probably know from the place where we live. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good movie that is fun to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
