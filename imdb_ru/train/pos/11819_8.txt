Just took it on a DVD and looked again. I love bright colors against dark images. Not a big Beatty fan, but this is a great popcorn movie. As always, Pacino is astounding, and this film marked the period when Madonna was her sexiest. I wish it would be stuck with a "breathless" view for a while. The first really big role is Charlie Korsmo, except for “How about Bob?”. The effects of cosmetics were then the most advanced and still preserved for the most part. Beautiful landscapes and mood will take you directly to the environment of comics. Cars, wardrobe, buildings, and even street lights and a great tone, not to mention the perfect lighting, although scenes with lots of red can be a bit annoying, as they tend to blur a little. Just a pity that Beatty did not have the opportunity to make a sequel. In general, a few hours of fun.
