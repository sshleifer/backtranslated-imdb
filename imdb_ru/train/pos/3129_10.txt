This is one of the best reunion events when Adam West and Burt Ward parody themselves and have fun doing it. It's amazing how much effort was devoted to details, in particular, to recreating the sensations of the 1960s era, the scenery of Batcave, Wayne Manor, costumes and actors chosen to play in the younger versions of West, Ward, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero. and Frank Gorshin! These 90 minutes are worth your time and will delight all fans of the classic 1960s television series Batman. I note that the clips from “Batman” were from the film, and not from the series itself, probably due to legal restrictions. Let's hope that the three seasons of the series will appear on DVD.
