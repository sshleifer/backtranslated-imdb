Tell me what you want from Andy Milligan - but if his family was 10% deranged, as in this film, I think it could be worse. Unfortunately, the video of this film contains inserts of the sex scene, originally shot by the distributor, to increase the attractiveness of the box office. Several times during the film, the ugly cinematography and the silent music of Milligan's film suddenly ended, and suddenly attractive shots for Milligan's home actors take over and start doing it for the psychedelic guitar rock of the 60s. Fast forward is quite simple if you try to draw attention to the original Milligan film, which unfortunately lacks quite a lot of action that was cut out to make room for added sex scenes. What remains, however, are still compelling things. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with a more hated mother.
