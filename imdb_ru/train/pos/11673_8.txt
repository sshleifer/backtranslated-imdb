After seeing Charlie Boorman in the Long Way Round with Evan McGregor, I was very interested to see what Charlie would be in his own show. I thought Charlie was a lovely guy, very down to earth and down to earth. It's nice to see celebrities struggling with their weight and fitness, it just shows that they are people too! I don't know much about bicycles, but this show has swept me from the very beginning. The preparation and organization of this event seems immense. The event itself seems very dangerous, and I admire why Charlie and everyone else do it and how far he gets. I like the tempo of the show and the fast, optimistic music. I can not believe that he broke his collarbone, I really hope that this is not the end, I can not wait to see the next episode ...
