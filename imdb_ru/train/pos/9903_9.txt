Wow, praise IMDb and Google, because for more than 15 years I have been trying to remember the name of this amazing movie. Slaughter Hi, dude! Hell yes! <br /> <br /> I'm not going to bore you with the plot, the actors and the poison, the poison, the poison, because you all know what it is. That's why you don't care here. What I will do, however, I will explain what a warm memory I have of this typical D-Movie slasher of the 80s. <br /> <br /> In 1987, when I was about 7 years old, my father rented all these horror films. Will he take care of his children to look at them with him? Not. So, at this young age, I saw the Sloters Height. What I saw in this movie stuck in me. Since then, I have not seen this, but I still remember most of the absurd murders in the film. For example, a scene after sex (why does the school have a metal bed?) Shocked by an electric current. Or the guy drowned in the pool for sess. Come on! Although my personal favorite is ... an exploding stomach from spoiled beer. Amazing How can you truly hate a movie in which one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school, for example, after 10 or 15 years, and thinks that it would be a good idea to drink it? Then his stomach will explode? What kind!? And this wonderful line: let's take my car ... it always starts. Classic crap completely. <br /> <br /> I mean, I look back almost 20 years later and laugh about it. But when I was 7 years old, I was scared! This hat of the jester (or was it a mask?), Who is swaying the killer everywhere, it pisses me off! <br /> <br /> In general, yes, a lousy movie. But for nostalgia and for humor, this film gets 9 out of 10 from me. Either go to bed very late every night and hope to catch it at the same late late movie screening, or look for a copy of the VHS and shake it off your VCR.
