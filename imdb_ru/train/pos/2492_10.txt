This is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. it is really refreshing to watch, and I have been in stitches many times. I think that there is a factor in social awareness that makes it quite interesting. if they were white girls, would they get the same reaction? maybe, maybe not? the characters know no boundaries (check my texts) and do not exclude anyone from their perverse sense of fun! There are so many funny sketches. my favorite is bob the builder one. it's so stupid, it's a genius. if you like black comedy, then this is for you. if you like to follow your appearance, it is probably not so. 3 "not blonde" - another cheerful British comedy BBC, shown on TV! This is such a fun show, and the characters unleashed on the unsuspecting public laugh at loudly funny! It would be impossible to keep straightness, watching the crazy characters and the reaction of the public! This series easily adds to great comedies!
