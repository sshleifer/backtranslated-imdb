I am a big fan of Jane Austen, and besides being a full-length film (a real fan wants to see as little as possible left, and this can only be achieved in a mini-series), he was really great. Gwyneth Paltrow really captures the slightly ignorant, but well-intentioned, rich girl, and Jeremy Northam is Mr. Knightley with his equilibrium and nobility. I wasn’t thrilled with Evan McGregor, although I really liked him as an actor, but I didn’t feel that it ruined the movie at all. As I said, as a fan of Jane Austen, I would like to see what I don’t want, but it would have made it much longer than is acceptable for a full-length film, and it seemed to me that they really encapsulated the story. Well. I saw all the variants of this book and felt that it was the best!
