This film is available from David Shepard and Kino in the movie “Before Hollywood was Fort Lee,” New Jersey, although this is a shortened version that has only behind-the-scenes fragments of films. I'm not sure that in the Blackhawk films there was only a film to print out these parts, or they edited other scenes. The original version of the Blackhawk was renamed the “Film”. The full feature was preserved, but the preprint for this version had some decomposition of nitrates, and the pair of sections looked bad, so perhaps that is why the Blackhawk edition was edited. <br /> <br /> Director Maurice Tourneur, in the film Turner, plays himself, or rather, a caricature of himself. Presumably, director Emil Shothard and future director Joseph von Sternberg may also be Local girl Mary (Doris Kenyon) longs for a romantic man to remove her from his feet. She dreams of a troubadour who achieves her, but is constantly interrupted by the only available local boy, Johnny Apple Bloom. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the film company from New York (actually New Jersey) shoots westerns in the countryside. Mary sees an Indian (wearing a full headdress) and is alarmed - it spoils the scene that the film company is shooting. She is immediately attracted by the dashing movie star Kenneth Driscoll (Robert Warwick). He urges her to leave home and try to become an actress in a big city. <br /> <br /> When she comes to the studio, she discovers that everything in the films is fake. Doors and walls - just apartments, quickly assembled for a set. This lanky walk of the western hero or a happy jump of the heroine is also just acting. The sets are on a large rotating stage, so that the angle of the sun can even be manipulated. Black Duty in the studio signs all the photos autographed by movie stars. The inscriptions on the wall say: "Positive, do not smoke," but still smoke. Even the titles of the films (which are well illustrated) emphasize all the fakes in the life of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Movie star Driscoll is also disappointed by the noise of everyday filmmaking. He makes a temporary break with his girlfriend Vivian (June Alvidzh) to pursue this "exciting" village girl. His plans fall apart when the screen test is Mary disgusting. We can not see the film itself, but only the painful reaction of the audience. <br /> <br /> Mary is devastated, but she does not want to admit to everyone that she failed, so she continues to see Driscoll, and we have lunch with him in the studio’s dining room along with other police officers dressed as police officers, soldiers, cowboys and etc. <br /> <br /> Mary decides to stay with Driscoll. At a party with their film “Friends,” she agrees to marry him, although there is not much love between them. Surprisingly, her mother appears with a cake, especially for Maria's birthday. This makes Mary reassess her future. <br /> <br /> In this film there are many different exciting scenes from studios, film sets, make-up rooms, editing rooms, etc. If you were always wondering what was happening behind the scenes when shooting a silent film, this film looks in. backstage.
