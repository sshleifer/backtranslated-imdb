Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) - the owner of a cheap horror show. After she learns that her dead aunt has left her something, Elvira goes to England to pick him up, hoping that it will be money. But, to her dismay, Elvira learns that all that her aunt left was her house, her dog, and her cookbook. In any case, Elvira decides to settle in the house, but with her amazing dark looks and stunning facial features, she will not be able to live in peace. All the neighbors are now turning the whole city against her, and with the outrageous attitude and views of Elvira, it is better to beware, because Elvira is on fire! I really liked this film, it is very interesting to watch how Elvira participates in all these adventures, she is simply gorgeous. The whole movie puts you in the mood of Halloween, of course, it's stupid and the jokes are cheap, but it's nice to watch. I would give Elvira, Mistress of Darkness 8/10
