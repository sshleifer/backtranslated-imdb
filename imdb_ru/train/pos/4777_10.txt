Perhaps the most personal of the works of David Lynch - his most accessible. This time, instead of mysterious thematic structures that may or may not include the plot or represent something more than vivid nightmares, Lynch offers reflections, fragile meditation on universal subjects of aging and family and finds confidence in both. The simple, true story of a farmer from Iowa (Richard Farnsworth) who rides a lawn-mower to Wisconsin to visit his estranged, stricken brother still has many unique and original visual dreams made from some veteran cinematographer Freddie Freren who dreams of some pretty bright aerial pictures of the heart taken from Veteran Cinematographer and Frender Freren Frender Freren to make it an undisputed lynch effort and characteristics that are among its most unforgettable. Farnsworth is excellent in the stoic, but representatively, allowing the articles of his life stories he hears on his journey, and Sissy Spacek turns some of her best work into a smaller role as his mentally retarded but observant daughter (whose painful secret is revealed in acute a gentle turn in the sensitive screenplay of John Roach and Mary Sweeney), but the rest of the small cast gives the man indelible performances, one of the most notable of which is Barbara Rob rtson whose accidental killing of a deer at the same time and noisy, and sad. But this is Lynch's vintage with his ability to engage and upset you at his best. For those who are not familiar with Lynch or only know him from his cruel, disturbing reputation, this is a great place to start; for those who know his work, this is one of the best in his repertoire.
