<br /> <br /> I just bought this movie on DVD and watched it for the first time last night. I have been a fan of Tolkien’s work for about 4 years since I graduated from high school. I didn't grow up in this movie ... maybe my mom kept me away from him. This is definitely not for kids. Not that it was bad in a graphic sense, but that the topics would fit the heads of most 10-year-olds. Overall, the animation was excellent, considering that it was done in 1978/1979. I thought the story followed the book quite well in a free way. But what worries me is that Baski didn’t just add another 40 minutes or so and headed for the Return of the King. That would make it a better movie. I was worried about his sudden end, and then when I heard that the Return of the King sucks, I was even more worried. It is a pity that it was not one great animated film. It might get a higher voice from me. I give him 7. I can only hope that Peter Jackson will pay homage to the books with the new LOTR.
