It's easy 9. Michel Serrault, better known for his comic roles at the beginning of his acting career, does an amazing, even anxiously awesome job of imitating Dr. Petiot, the legendary French serial killer. <br /> <br /> He is just so believable in every moment of the movie that the actor completely disappears behind the character - only the best of all who ever achieved this feat, and when they do, at best only a few parts. <Br /> <br /> The whole story (the real story that took place in France of the 20th century) is so powerful, so ominous, that it makes the film very strong, which is remembered for a long time.
