I saw this series when I was a child, and I liked the details in which she entered, and I never forgot about it. I finally acquired a DVD collection, and that's how I remembered it. It's just what the document should be, impartial and factual. The frames of the film are incredible, and the interviews are fantastic. The only other show I have found equal to this is Die Diechen Panzer. <br /> <br /> I just wanted Hollywood to sit down and watch this series, then they could make some great war movies. > <br /> Note. Group of brothers, Saving Private Ryan, Letters from Iwo Jima, Flags of Our Fathers and When the pipes disappear, I would recommend
