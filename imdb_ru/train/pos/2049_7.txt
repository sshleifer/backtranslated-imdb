This film is rather stupid, but I give it its due, at least, trying to give some description of its principles. There are some great moments in the film, and there are some great moments in the dialogue. <br /> <br /> The sequence of air attacks is probably the best part of the film. I really like the idea of ​​how much a veteran will go to the same veteran. Of course, everything is not so well done, but the premise is not so bad. <br /> <br /> tom
