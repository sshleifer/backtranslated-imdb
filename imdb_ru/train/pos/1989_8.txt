I admit I didn’t like Oliver! like a small child, it's a long time, and the story is a little slow because of all the musical numbers. As a teenager, I found the experience itself to be the fun of this film. Instead of thinking of it as an adaptation of Oliver Twist, think of it as a celebration of a classic story. Adaptation is free at best, but in reality, if you are watching a musical, you are not interested in history. <br /> <br /> Music is the essence of this film, and the vast majority of it is stellar and very catchy. Most or all of the actors participated in the stage version of the musical, and this is manifested in their performances - and I think this is a plus. All performances are performed in a more “stage” style typical of older films, and they are very interesting. The exception is the child playing Oliver, whose work seemed cute and kept away from the real performers. <br /> <br /> Fagin and Dodger are the real stars of this film. Oliver Reed also does a fantastic job supporting a scary presence on the screen, like the formidable Bill Sykes. Even the Sykes Bullseye dog shows good results. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone. People who hate musicals will despise him, as will those who are too serious about musicals. Neglecting erroneous historical details or taking exaggerated acting skills for a bad game will spoil someone’s pleasure. Just sit back and enjoy the fun - much better if you remember that for a musical it is a fantasy freely distributed around the book, and not a strict adaptation.
