I think that one of the reasons this film was made ... and is aimed at us, gamers, who actually play all Nancy Drew computer games. There have been a lot of movies based on video games lately, and I think this is one of them. <br /> <br /> So this film does not follow a single book. But it follows the parts of the games. I buy and play every Nancy Drew game as soon as it comes out. A game from HerInteractive for "girls who are not afraid of the mouse!" And some of these games actually won the Parent's Choice Gold Award. They are not only fun, but you can learn something one or two during the game. <br /> <br /> I took with me two of my stepbrothers to watch them, and they liked it! For 10 years, the Old Woman started playing her first game, Nancy Drew, the day before I invited her to watch a movie, and she had so much fun playing this game that I thought she would also like the movie. And I was right ... she not only loved this film, but also could not wait to return home to finish her first game and start another one. <br /> <br /> My step-daughter is only 7 years old, and she also loves the movie, but she is still too small to play games, but she likes to watch her sister play, just to see what happens. <br /> <br /> Games are designed for children from 10 years and older. All games usually get pretty good reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information about games, just check out the HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So personally, I thought the movie was pretty good, and I will buy it when it comes out on DVD.
