This film tells about the uprising in Ireland in the 1920s and, in particular, about the life of one person after he tells a friend about the reward for his head and the ensuing consequences. When I saw the film, I felt that you could take the script and just repeat it with small updates, and, unfortunately, it will still be up to date with current events. But the remake will not be so good. Great performance by Victor McLaglen (for which he deservedly won an Oscar) and a wonderful ensemble of actors, which included most, if not all of the actors with brogs in Hollywood at the time, most of whom were recognizable character actors of the time or just starting out. Very good movie worth watching. Highly recommended.
