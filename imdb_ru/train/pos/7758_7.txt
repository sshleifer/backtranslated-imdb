A bloated melodrama, typical of its period (mid-1950s) and suitable morning meal. Rock Hudson, the hulk everyone always falls in love with, plays his usual stereotypical role, but at the same time appeared in Giant the same year that his material and colleagues in the film (Taylor and Dean) were above average, the film is just not good enough to raise the caliber beyond the soft story of how hard it is to be rich and happy. The self-destructive brother and sister (Robert Stack, reeling in a drunken stupor, and Dorothy Malone playing the vampire poor little rich girl completely merciless) eventually lose, and Hudson gets Bacoll - who is rather wooden in this piece that lacks character or ingenuity to make it work. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, a good ending is fortunate, and a bad one is unfortunately, this is the meaning of fiction. However, it was interesting for me to read that the film is based on a true story that confirmed the plot. Like other films of the period, homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms. Perhaps the film could have been redone: the Staka character would have sounded more truthful if he had hidden his homosexual feelings for Mitch by marrying. Todd Haynes's Far Away from Heaven was greatly enhanced by Everything That is Possible in Heaven, also directed by Sirk. Perhaps Haynes could remake “Written in the Wind” and give us a truly memorable film.
