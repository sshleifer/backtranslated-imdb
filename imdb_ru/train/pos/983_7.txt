I think that this film can recommend a lot, especially the sinister performance of David Morse and more than a tolerable presentation of Mr. Fox who is always worth seeing. Despite the fact that there are many holes in the plot, and in some cases it is very difficult to follow the motivation, in general, it makes a pleasant pastime in front of the pipe.
