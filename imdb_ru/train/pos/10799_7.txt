Ah, 1970s The time when you had to be a swinger. To be honest, today is also a good time for swingers, but then it was much bolder. <br /> <br /> Joe Sarno offers a pretty good movie with a soft core. In fact, like today, some of the actors are famous hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors, and these films had a plot and character development. <br /> <br /> This is pretty much what you expect from a swingers movie. Two couples with an open relationship once again rekindle the passion for traveling from the MILF to one of the women who came to visit. Not much more. <br /> <br /> Of course, when the MILF is Jennifer Wells, that's another story. Not many 40-year-olds look as delightfully stripped as Miss Wells. It costs only one price to see Miss Wells looking at herself in the mirror, as if she were Aphrodite. She's not "Stifler's mom." She is much sexier. <br /> <br /> I also dug Anna Chris Jordan. Jordan looks and sounds so much like Elaine Joyce, that I thought she might be her twin "separated at birth" or even Elaine herself. Anna always eat, but must have an incredible metabolism. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the soft core porn of the 1990s, the 70-rag porn preserve realism (something of a hardcore film that the 2000s brought a soft core in some cases, instead of the 90s music and canned orgasms) and it is here in full force. This is not real, but it seems real. <br /> <br /> For those who like to produce "Deux Femmes En Or" in Quebec, you will like it. Another classic movie just for Drive-In Classics, the best CAN $ 2.50 per month you can spend.
