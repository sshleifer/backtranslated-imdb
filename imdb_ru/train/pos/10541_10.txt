I thought it was a terrific movie. Theme of the song is sweet! :) In any case, the only thing that bothered me a little was the beginning, when everything was supposed to be normal. It was very strange and unreal. A big cable company is basically what I'm talking about. In addition, the film was very creative. I think that all acting skills were well done, the actors played the characters of their characters perfectly. All go well with each other. It's a shame that this is not a soundtrack. It would be great! Because it is a Canadian film, and since it is one of my favorites, I give this film 10 out of 10!
