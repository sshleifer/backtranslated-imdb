Immediately after I watched the movie, a real magical feeling of Walt Disney films arose in me, and I realized that a long time ago I saw “real” magic in the film. <br /> <br /> The combination of right music, speeches, and magical effects again brings a feeling of Disney in your body. The very special things that I saw when the unconscious effects in the film began with the transformation of the Disney logo into Cinderella's castle and ended with a story telling your grandparents. <br /> <br /> The magic is back in me. I rate this movie 8 out of 10.
