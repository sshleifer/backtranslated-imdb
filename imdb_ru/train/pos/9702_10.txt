Royston Vasya city is a strange but wonderful place. Characters would simply be wrong and too disturbing, but a fantastically brilliant writing means that it works, and it works very well. Most people will recognize others with a touch of character, but hopefully no one knows people with extreme personalities, such as Tubbs and Edward, the local store owners who are hateful of a stranger, or the penny-obsessed Polina who treats the scum with great contempt. It was only a few strange inhabitants. Television works consist of 3 episodes and a Christmas special. There are links to many horror films, such as the braided man. A more recent addition to a number of works is the film “Apocalypse of the League of Gentlemen,” about which I will not talk much, but I highly recommend it. In general, the League of Gentlemen is a fun comedy show with brilliant writing and brilliant crazy characters. I would definitely say that it’s worth seeing how you will not regret it!
