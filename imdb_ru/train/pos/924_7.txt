The father of pride is a pleasant surprise: he is funny, witty and has an excellent voice acting. The show tells about the family of Leo, which serves as rides show Siegfried and Roy. Indeed, they are all stereotypes, but this is what makes them so funny. FOTP is not a children's cartoon, it includes rough humor for adults, but very soft. He is full of references to pop culture and cameo celebrities, and most of them are very well executed. I would say that I will give a show of 7 out of 10, because it is quite well executed, but not very original, I have seen most of these stereotypes many times before, even in this particular order!
