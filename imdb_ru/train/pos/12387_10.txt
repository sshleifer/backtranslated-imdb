Of all the films of the seventies, none of them captured the true essence of the battle between good and evil, like the Guardian. I mean, yes, there were films like The Exorcist and others; but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist, like this one. If you have time, check it out. You may not be able to circumvent outdated devices as such, but this is a story worth exploring. Then there are all the stars and future stars. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith. Then there are subtle clues that lead to what is going on as well. Pay close attention. I had to watch it four times in order to catch all the strange expressions, such as “black and white cat, black and white cake”. Plus, the books are really good. I just wish they were going to turn the second book into a movie. It is so scary that will surpass this film.
