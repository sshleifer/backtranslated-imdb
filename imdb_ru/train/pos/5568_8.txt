A typical reality game of Chicha and Chong, which includes drugs, singing, more drugs, cars and driving, even more drugs, Pee Wee, aliens, gasoline, laundry, comedy, surprisingly more drugs and SPACE KOKSUHU !! It's not as cohesive or believable as Up in Smoke, but it's still incredibly funny, not becoming as weird as Nice Dreams. There are several classic scenes that include the starting scene, where they get gas for their car and drive to work. Also funny is the song Chicha (Mexican-Americans) and the song Chong. Another noteworthy scene is the scene in the social security office with Jones (a machine for human noise) from the Police Academy series and an old laughing man. In general, this is a great continuation of Up Up in the Smoke and is quite watchable when sober or not. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
