This modest, rather routine series deserves praise in books on the history of television for two reasons: he was the first to receive an Emmy Award for the best syndicated series, and it was the very first show that came from the legendary Republic Pictures studios, known for its low-budget but powerful shooting in the 30s and 40s. <br /> <br /> Republic was one of the first Hollywood studios to jump onto a small screen that was still in its infancy. But the tenure of studios as a producer of television fiction will not be long. After this show, they will later indulge with another format known to them, an adventure series with “Commando Cody”, as well as other TV shows, but, like this one, they lasted no more than 39 episodes. In addition, the Republic was in the final stages as a studio; he will complete his stay in Hollywood as a rental stage for several Revue Studio series, such as Soldiers of Fortune, the original Dragnet and Kit Carson, before finally closing their doors in 1959. <br /> <br /> In any case, “Stories of the Century” are not as bad as a business card, they were stories based on authentic figures in Western history, mostly outlaws, such as Black Bart, Johnny Ringo , John Wesley Hardin, The Dalton Bros. and similar, similar, similar. The late Jim Davis, best known for his role as Patriarch Ewing in Dallas, got a friendly job in the role of Matt Clark, a fictional train detective who must deal with the aforementioned criminals played by the veteran and soon ... future actors-characters. <br /> <br /> Two surprising facts: incidents would occur at different times, some in the 1880s, some at the turn of the century, but Clark never gets old. And also, Matt was lucky to saddle himself with two wonderful female detectives in the role of assistants, Frankie Adams, played by Mary Castle, and her replacement, Margaret "Johns" Jones, Christine Miller. A lone Ranger could only wish a friendly relationship with a lady. Such a time can be spent with Tonto for so long. <br /> <br /> “Stories of the Century” is the “Studio City” telecast from Republic Pictures Corp. In 1954, 39 episodes were filmed, all 39 of which are in the public domain and on DVD.
