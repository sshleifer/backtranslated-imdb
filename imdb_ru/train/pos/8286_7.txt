Larry Fessenden was beaten by most comments on this forum. Well, obviously, the worst mistake is the marketing of the film and the way the DVD was targeted. Obviously, this is not a real horror film, at least not for people waiting for something that will be terrible and instantly satisfying. <br /> <br /> “Wendigo” is a film that young Miles seems to be talking about. Things that children do not always understand, as a rule, remain in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the threatening world that they cannot comprehend. Obviously, Kim is a mother, a psychologist, but she has no idea what is happening in the mind of her son. This is also a story of alienation. It is clear that the father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic, who seems to be living in another world. <br /> <br /> Miles's concerns reach a critical point at the end of the week in the country. That part of New York State, with its winter landscape, barren trees, destroys the imagination of a little boy. It does not help that he meets a strange figure in the city, it causes even more doubts in his young mind. Ultimately, the world of Miles collapses, and he can do nothing, even evoking the spirit of Wendigo. <br /> <br /> The film is well developed and removed. Patricia Clarkson is great wherever she appears. Jake Weber is beautiful as a distant father, who has the opportunity to approach the son, whom he does not understand. Eric Per Sullivan, like Miles, conveys the inner turmoil within him. I thought it was extremely effective, because the whole film is Miles's own opinion about what is going on around him. Finally, John Spredakos is as beautiful as the formidable Otis, a man who takes offense at the world for how he turned out to be. <br /> <br /> Instead of shooting this film, future viewers should approach it with an open mind.
