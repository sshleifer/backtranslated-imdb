when you put all the aspects of the film together - dancing, singing, acting - the only one that stands out as the best in the cast, it's Vanessa Williams ... her dedication, energy and eternal beauty make Rosie an ideal role for her. I have never seen anyone portray a rose with such brightness! Vanessa's singing talent perfectly shows all the songs that she plays in the role of Rose, and her acting skills never cease to amaze me! Her dances are incredible, even if, as some people say, the choreography was bad - her dancing skills were shown better than ever before! I would recommend this version over the 63rd just because I think that although Vanessaâ€™s playing time is excellent, not to mention that Jason Alexander and the rest of the actors are also very impressive (with the exception of Chinn Phillips ... that what the hell did they think when they shot it?) <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that this version is great and I recommend everyone to see this version!
