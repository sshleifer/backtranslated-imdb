I just watched this movie by mistake. What a little gem. This film, shot in 1956, looks and feels like a film of the late seventies. And in fact, he is better, more discreet and correct than, say, Blue Soldier. Ecological, anthropological shades are far ahead of their time. The understated cinematography is superb and terribly realistic. The “last hunt” is much more than “Dancing with wolves”, conveys the appearance of the “killing fields” of buffaloes of the late 1800s. Probably because those in the film were the real fields of death. The film was shot during a legal logging buffalo, so the animals you see are really killing, the bones are real. In conclusion, a very underrated western masterpiece, superbly acted, directed and shot.
