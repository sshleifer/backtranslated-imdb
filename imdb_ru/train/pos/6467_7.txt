Two films in a row dedicated to Indian prisoners of war; Fan Zaara and Deuar. Although Vir Zara was a love story for a guy who gives everything away to someone, Deewaar focuses on the core subject. It's no secret that many Indian prisoners of war have been rotting in Pakistani prisons for many years, for which neither the Indian government. there is time or sympathy for the other side. I'm sure some of the Pakistani prisoners of war are also in India, but let's focus on the film. Full of actors. Some were stage actors, such as Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, and so on. D. Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the role of a major, acted well. Akshaya Hannah did her part well. Amrita Rao had nothing to do except a few giggles and a couple of songs. I think that the role of Sanjay Datta was the most solid, although it was not too long. Here he acted very well, and his dialogues were impressive. If you compare it with LOC, which was nothing more than a one-day film with a story going in all directions (if it had a story) - Deewaar is a well-directed film that keeps a good pace and does justice to all the actors. 7.5 / 10
