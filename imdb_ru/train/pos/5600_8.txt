This is my kind of movie. I'm fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares, and this film is just that. But this is also a dark comedy. While I see it mostly as a horror / thriller, there will be others who might see it as a black dramatic comedy. <br /> <br /> But in any case, this is an exciting immersion into insanity. The ending caught me by surprise, but what a finale! It makes the viewer think. <br /> <br /> Powerful performances, a complex and detailed plot, an excellent script filled with horror and humor, and an eerie atmosphere make this film worth seeing. <br /> Personally, I think that I will need to look at it a few more times in order to understand and understand all the subtleties that are inside. But this is such a film that it will be a pleasure, not a routine.
