There is something special in the Austrian films not only of Zaydla, but also Spielmann and other directors. This is a piercing sense of reality that never leaves the viewer throughout the entire film. Hundstage is no exception. This effect is achieved not only by the depicted stories, but also by actors playing. In Hundstage, I have never had the feeling that these are actors, but real people. The intuitive feeling of the viewer is so real ... Almost as if a grumpy pensioner or a single lady in a movie live under you in your quarter. <br /> <br /> Anyone living in Vienna can painfully recognize the people in the film with their meckern / sudern (complaining), their hidden sexual urges and macho guys. This is reinforced by the Viennese dialect, which, according to many, is specially created to complain as a way of life. The special locality and arrogance characteristic of Vienna are also very well depicted. <br /> <br /> The suburbs of Vienna are vividly present in the film with their own stupor and drowsiness, where nothing happens. Moreover, they turned into a celebration of materialism with shopping centers and huge department stores. Between them there are houses of people, where they indulge in that which, in their opinion, is a pleasure, trying to keep in touch with himself, but in vain. Examples include the sexual game of an old woman with men bordering on rape, a proletarian losing her nerves and hitting her friend, and a girl who hitchhikers and annoys her drivers. <br /> <br /> There is no soundtrack in the film, as it focuses only on the normality / abnormality of its images. Another typical feature of Zeidl (and other Austrian directors) is his showing of disturbing sexual images. These include stripping an old woman for her husband, sex scenes in the bath, the sexual game of a lady with two men in her apartment, etc. <br /> <br /> In Hundstage Seild depicted the lives of people who ultimately can be like crowns as well as citizens of Paris, New York or Madrid. Viewers should not despise or feel sorry for the crowns in the film, since they themselves may become victims of the same alienation and alienation of the person, although in other circumstances. In the end, I believe that Zeidlaâ€™s film is a warning to us about the terrible state of human relationships that is so brutally revealed in Hundstage. And if the viewer defies the reasons for this evil transformation, Zaydl achieved his goal.
