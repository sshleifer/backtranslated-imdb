Wonderful James Stewart, the car of Vera Miles. What makes this historic FBI film so good is the family element involved in a 35-year career, as shown by Stewart in the film. <br /> <br /> The film shows the story of a great investigative agency. He deals with the conspiracy of bombs, the killing of Indians in Oklahoma to acquire real estate, the fight against organized crime, the Nazis and the Communists in that order. The human factor will never be left behind, as Stuart marries Vera Miles. They raise three children when Miles's heart goes out every time Stewart leaves work. <br /> <br /> Look for Murray Hamilton’s short but memorable presentation. Years later, he appeared in the role of Mr. Robinson in the 1967 film The Graduate. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in the film except praise to J. Edgar Hoover. He certainly brought the FBI to par. <br /> <br /> True, this can be seen as right propaganda, especially considering Stuart’s real views on Republicans, but this is well done, historically informative, and from the point of view the family is so well depicted.
