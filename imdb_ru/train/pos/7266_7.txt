I remember how little I appreciated such an enterprise when it was first released. James "Not Jim" Belushi, Hammy, an actress, and a stupid title in John Hughes' formula. You could not pay me to see it 15 years ago. But I caught myself watching this when I wasted Sunday afternoon, and it amazes me on several levels. A fairy tale (partly Beauty, partly reverse Beauty), very vulnerable, similar to Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street, Kelly Lynch, escapism. In the end, he gently pulls a very good string. It's hard enough not to fall into the story, develop a crush on Kelly Lynch, identify yourself with James Belushi, dislike the guy with the bad guy and laugh at the Curly Sue lines. It has all the ups and downs, with a happy ending and the type of message you want to hear. Come on, spend your time on this film, it's worth it.
