What people do not understand in this film is that it is not the beginning, the middle and the end, but merely the end of a series of 26 episodes. Therefore, remember that when you all say that the world is not enough studied. All this was done in a television show. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that itâ€™s great and amazing, I think the *** SPOILERS *** argument between Lian-Chu and Gvizdo at the end of the film was what really made me love this film. Seeing the characters I was following in 26 episodes of the battle, as if it was painful, and see how Guizdo, unfortunately, goes off by itself among the floating ruins, while Lien-Chu sharpened his blade, almost twitching from tears <br /> <br /> Then we got a complete contrast with Lian-Chu, who was fighting these insanely amazing dragons (which we had previously talked about in the series), while Gwizdo babbles insanely and indirectly threatens to kill Zoe. * Shudders * I'm surprised that this particular scene was not mentioned more in the warnings. Any child who has common sense will be able to see that Gvizdo was not himself and fully intended to strangle this little girl. That was enough to bother me, and I'm 15. <br /> <br /> The world is amazing, the plot is much better than that of most multi-million blockbusters, and it was a good way to see some of my favorite characters go. Check this. :)
