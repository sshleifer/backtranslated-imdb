I have to be honest, I was expecting failure so badly, because it really sounded like they were trying to milk the original film to get money. But this was not the case with this rather funny (sometimes strange) movie. I liked how they told the story of Timon and Pumba, the story of Simba and his sleep problems was funny. Bubble whirlpool, and when Pumba leaves, the bubbles stop. It is all harmless fun, good for children and some adults. I think this film will last for a while, because it is pretty good for direct video and DVD movie. Although the film seems a bit strange and subsides a bit by the end, it works. 8 out of 10
