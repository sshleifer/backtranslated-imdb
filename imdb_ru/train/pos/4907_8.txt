A well-made and creative production, refreshingly free from clich√©s, this rather amusing story tells the story of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy in far from ideal conditions: the man who escaped the convict who kidnapped the youth for his value as a hostage. The film, masterfully filmed by Alan Gibson and possessing a wonderful sense of a balanced narrative movement, provides freshness in almost every scene, since the criminal Martin Stechert (Richard Harris), believing that his refusal of parole was particularly undeserved, he designs an elaborate, but in the end the result is a successful escape plan, after which his spontaneous nature comes to the fore when he runs to the residence on the shores of the lake of his childhood. Often breaking into a song or dancing a few steps, capricious Shtekert gradually gains the trust and affection of his captive, and as the police approach the inevitable confrontation, the tied couple appears to be very similar in their responses to forms of deviation, as found by the psychiatrist (Lindsay Wagner) , assigned to assist the zealous police lieutenant (James Coburn), who is responsible for the hunt for Shtekker and his "prisoners". This is a fascinating story to tell, a fast-paced and new adventure that benefits from Harris' main show, beautiful twists from Wagner, Coburn and Karen Black along with Justin Henry as a torn-out guy with a suitable fancy score. courtesy of Wilfred Josephs and Frank Watts' first-class cinematography with all shots taken in the beautiful autumn province of Ontario.
