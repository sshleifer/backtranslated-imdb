Pleasant animated movie Batman. Not at the level of "Return of the Joker" or "Mask of Phantasm", but nonetheless. I liked how the film made you guess who Batman was. There was a nice twist. Good action sequences. I have always been of the opinion that the Batman cartoons are better than any pathetic sequels with the live Batman fighter. The trend continues here. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10
