I used this film in a religion class that I taught. A goldfish swims happily in its bowl in an apartment on the top floor. A young boy and his mother away from home. The boy was given money to buy milk. On the way home, he stops at a carnival to play a game. Next to him is a man in a black suit, looking a bit scary. The boy drops a bottle of milk. It breaks. A man in a black suit gives him money to replace the milk. This scene alternates with what is happening at home. A black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment. He (?) Discovers the aquarium and looks at it. Fish vigorously swims and flies out of the bowl. By now a group of teens in my class and I fell in love with fish. The cat takes the fish in its mouth, and we all hold our breath. Cat throws fish in a bowl. The double storyline includes a suspicious man in a black and a suspicious black cat. Both are biased. Both are innocent. It was a great discussion in my class.
