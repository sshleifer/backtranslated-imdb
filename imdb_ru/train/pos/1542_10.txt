Well done, considering the perspective of the other side, Dr. Fralein captures both the value and the futility of war. great game, especially when the German High Command refuses in the name of knighthood to hand a medal to the Kaiser on the orders of the stricken. bloodshed scenes are probably too intense for weak US minds, who would probably prefer some silly speeches and meaningless abstractions such as 14 points or leagues of nations. Real Americans can appreciate storyline and action. Fraulin doctor compares Favo (and) rabies with Jacob's ladder, despite all the actions and intrigues.
