Dark Angel is a futuristic sci-fi series created in post-apocalyptic Seattle, in the center of which is Max (Jessica Alba), a genetically developed young woman, on the run from her creators. <br /> <br /> The Universe of the Dark Angel carries away (not as much as, say, Buffy, but nonetheless, carries away) with an interesting and believable set of characters. Of course, this is not for everyone, but those who devote time to this will find themselves watching one of the most enjoyable TV shows. Dark Angel is criminally missed and underestimated, and, unfortunately, was canceled only after 2 episodes. It was a great shame, as he had the potential to become a great TV series, although his 42 episodes are just 10 of the long-time science fiction comedy BBC Red Dwarf. As the Dark Angel remains unfinished, look for him, and if you want more, lobby Fox to do another series.
