As the creator of "This Darkness", I recognize that we have neglected 3 very important confirmations in our final captions. Omissions were omissions that could not be corrected after the commission, and the parties involved — who saw the movie — did not mention this at the time. On behalf of the excellent line-up and film crew, I apologize to them. Obviously, some of the criticisms posted here are sharp in the light of their randomness. Our production values ​​were insignificant, and our "special effects" were really special, but the plot is very strong, and John MacLeod's cinematography is excellent. We hope that you, the reader, will enjoy “This Darkness” and the efforts of those who worked their asses for free. Thank you, Dylan O'Leary, director.
