An updated version of the story, which was turned into a film in 1938 in England (“The Return of the Frog”), about the prosecution by police of the main criminal, known as the frog, because of the frog, how to stand up (bulging eyes, etc.), which he wears. <br /> <br /> One of the good Wallace films of the 1960s is little entertainment. Obviously, influenced (or influenced by this) by restarting Dr. Mabouz’s films, Frog seems to be more of a super villain than a master thief. Although not the best Wallace film, it’s worth a look. This would make an interesting double feature with an excellent early film. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 out of 10.
