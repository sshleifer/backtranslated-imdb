I just watched this movie and fell in love with it. There is something for everyone, and it's completely free for everyone when it comes to romance between Lachlan and Leal. When they are on the beach, I almost cried ... there is an unspoken realization that time is the most valuable commodity, and this is most obvious when they are together. This idea is taken from several points of view, from marriage to brothers and sisters, to the search for love in the least ordinary places. The film almost makes you crave for such despair when you know that tomorrow may well be your last. Crowe was particularly remarkable in his role as Lachlan. I always had a weak spot for emphasis, but I almost melted with his image of his character. The way this film was shot is also beautiful, with music, open field backgrounds and great gameplay. All together, this is a wonderful film that shakes human emotions.
