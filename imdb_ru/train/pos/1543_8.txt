I remember watching this movie many years ago on BBC2. I would really like to look again - does anyone know how I can get a copy? As I recall, it was a particularly powerful film, especially the outstanding scene with horses in gas masks. Also, I really can't remember too much about the story — that’s why I want to see it again! I wandered around the network, but I can't find a copy, which is unusual for me - maybe there is no DVD or VHS on this market. I would be grateful for any help, anyone can help me with this. Thanks in advance for your help. Regards, Albany234@googlemail.com
