I always knew that Anne DeSalvo was a great actor, and now I know that she is also a great writer / director. I have been a fan since I first saw her in the films Ideal, My Favorite Year, DC Booth and Memories of Star Dust. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, it is so rare to see Lee Grant in anything. She had been absent from the screen for too long. It is also great to see Cloris Lichman in something other than sit-coma. This is her best work since the “Last Picture Shows”. If you grew up in an Italian American family, you will love this movie. I did not expect much when I started watching this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this film. If you have a chance, take a look.
