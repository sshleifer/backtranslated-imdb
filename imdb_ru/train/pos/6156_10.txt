This movie has always been my favorite Disney movie. Then on November 21, 2001, I saw the 30th film of this film on DVD. Wow, I remembered why I liked this movie. The DVD is so good, it has an extra 30 minutes that the original did not have. I did not know this when I first began to look. Since then, the film has done a lot more. The music they cut out should have been abandoned. You did not see this movie until you watched the full 131-minute version. Many people say that music is forgotten. I remember every song in this movie by heart, every song has its own charm by itself and makes up a hole. I remember when I was younger, I had the song "Eglantine" in my head for several days in a row. And also "Briny Sea" (this song was intended to marry Poppen, but was cut from the film). Please watch the new uncut 30th aneurysia film and vote for it. 10 what it really is.
