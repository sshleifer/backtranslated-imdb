The Nightmare of Insomnia is a story about immersing a person into insanity. In chronic insomnia, Jack suffers from hallucinations; forcing him to try to determine what is real and what is not. <br /> <br /> We will learn interesting things about Jack near the end and we think that by the end of the film we will be “happy”. after the "hollywood finale". Wrong. This is New York, a place where nobody sleeps. <br /> <br /> Tess Nanawati (screenwriter and director) starred in a good movie “Nightmare of Insomnia”. A talented director and writer (she made this film right after graduating from high school), she has real potential and I will watch it in the future. <br /> <br /> While I was watching this short film, I was constantly uncomfortable; between music, the bleak landscape and the realistic depiction of Dominic Monaghan's insomnia (as Jack), I desperately wanted to turn it off from time to time just to avoid it.
