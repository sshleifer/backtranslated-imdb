“Mother's Night” is one of my favorite novels, and when I saw this, I expected tremendous disappointment. Instead, I received a film that perfectly describes the irony, humor, expressiveness and, above all, the crushing sadness of Vonnegut's novel. <br /> <br /> This is by far the best Nolte premiere to date. He captures the defeat and dislike of Howard Campbell Jr. consistently from the subtle intonations of his speech to the restrained tears in his eyes. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is absolutely cheerful, like George Kraft. Sherril Lee pursues in his removal from reality, a young lover Campbell. John Goodman is understated and more than effective as the Blue Fairy Cambell. <br /> <br /> This story of Campbell's Pinnazzioesque, trying to be his own ideal hero and unwittingly becoming his ideal tragic villain, is a mature and lively look. who we are like people And besides, this is one of the most romantic films I've ever seen. Cambell is the embodiment of foolish and wise love. And in the frustratingly painful conclusion of the film, he finally finds out what it means to be a real boy, as his Blue Fairy fulfills his desire. And he understands that ... well, watch the movie and you will see. <br /> <br /> Mother's Night is without a doubt one of the best films ever made. This is a beautiful poetic story that penetrates deep into our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author.
