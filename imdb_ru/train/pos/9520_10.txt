This is a beautiful film. The true story of the connection between father and son. This is definitely Tom Hanks in all its glory. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this film. He usually has good guy roles. And yet in this film, he appears in this film as a bit gritty, but it still appears smelling like a rose, even to the very last scene, of the killing of his character. The cast of this film was well composed. I also like the role when there is complete silence, when the Tom Hanks character shoots and kills all the men in Mr. Rooneyâ€™s group. In this scene there is something frightening, but at the same time deep, without emotions, just emotions. I like the expression on the face of John Rooney, the character of Paul Newman, when he understands, even before he sees him, that this is the character of Tom Hanks, who takes revenge, and he knows that his fate has come. When I first saw this film, I was amazed and knew that I needed to go out and get a video, and I added it to my collection of my favorite films of all time. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, so this film has a special place in me.
