I had never heard of this film before watching it, I wondered if it was an independent film, and I was right, but with a good line-up I decided to risk it. Mostly tramp Michael W. Williams (Nicolas Cage) in Red Rock, Wyoming, is looking for a job and meets with bar owner Wayne Brown (J. Walsh from Pleasantville), he is given a large amount of money taken for a killer hired to kill him Suzanne's unfaithful wife (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not fix it, takes the money and goes to warn Susanna, and after she makes him a counter offer, he decides that he needs to leave. When Wayne knows his real identity, he pursues Michael shooting big weapons until he gets into the car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But everything gets complicated when Michael realizes that Lyle is a hired killer for whom he was accepted, and he quickly retreats. He returns to Susanna, and, knowing that they are both in danger, they plan to leave the city together and add another complication, falling in love with each other. However, before leaving, Suzanne insists that they go and steal a large amount of money in a safe. Of course things will not go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle catch up with them, and Lyle makes them and now Wayne bound to go and collect the buried money. In the end, Lyle and Wayne both get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne get on a moving train, but itâ€™s obvious that she cares more about money and she also gets what she deserves. Also starring Craig Ray in the role of Jim, Vance Johnson in the role of Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart in the role of Deputy Matt Greytak, Dwight Yokam in the role of truck driver and Robert Apel in the role of Howard. The performances, with the possible exception of the lame Boyle, are all good and beautiful, and he has a pretty good film noir feeling for a black comedy thriller. Fine!
