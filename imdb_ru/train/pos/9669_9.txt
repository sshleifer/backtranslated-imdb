After reading the original play, I thought that adapting it to the screen would be much more difficult than it turned out. Donal McCann is a great performance in the role of Public Gar, a repressed antagonist, which his extreme-power (but invisible to others) alter ego, Private Gar, openly demonstrates. Imonn Kelly also plays excellent talkers, whose inability to convey their feelings coincides only with Gar. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth renting if you can find it. (Probably not available outside of Ireland and the UK)
