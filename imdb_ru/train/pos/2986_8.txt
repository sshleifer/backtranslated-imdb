I am amazed that we see how even a skeptic criticizes this old film. Usually we do not get good opera films, but the real grand opera performance. It is clear that the visual effects are not great. Its from. But as an opera can not be blamed; and I am an opera lover. I can't even detect one lip sync; if we did not know that it was Tebaldi in audio, nothing would have convinced me that it was not Sophia Loren. She does EVERYTHING with talent! Her dark makeup is fine; and she brought the role of a great life! The rest of the cast is beautiful, as is this amazing ballet troupe. Most actors are superb; Lauren is really amazing. Her rival Amneris is also awesome. Those who did not care for this work in 1953 are shamefully missed. Verdi would love it! Naturally, Renata Tebaldi in the role of Aida is a backstage engine. I love this old movie!
