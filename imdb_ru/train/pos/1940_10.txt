I was really impressed with this movie. The letter was fantastic, and all the characters were rich and simple. It is very easy to become emotionally attached to everyone. The creators of this film really hit the head when it comes to creating real characters and engaging the viewer right into their world. Besides, the music is awesome. They hired a few independent for creating the score and soundtrack, and they do a fantastic job by adding a movie. If you have the opportunity to watch this film in a small theater or film festival (as I did), I strongly recommend that you watch it. In addition, in person, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this film. This is reason enough to go check it out.
