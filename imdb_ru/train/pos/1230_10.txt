After watching this movie for the third time, I think this is almost the worst Adam movie. Punch-drunk love is bad compared to this, I have to say that at the end, when Dickey is thrown out of the boat, it's so funny (his hair is different from him and I like it when it distracts everyone. in case you are a real fan of Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> The characters are bad compared to his funny movies, such as “Waterboy”, which has the same people in it (Peter Dante), which is one of the murderers trying to kill the Australian bird. <br /> <br /> this film lacks depth and a decent storyline lines and he deserves to be among the first 100
