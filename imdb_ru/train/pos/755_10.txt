Dirty Sanchez - the more extreme British version of Jackass, in which four guys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joysey and Pancho) go to great lengths to hurt and humiliate each other. The reason why this show is better than that of Jackass is that most of the tricks are not planned, which makes the reaction a lot more fun. There are 3 series of shows, the first follows them and looks at their lives for a long time, for example. there is an episode about their personal life, work, etc. The second series sends the boys to different professions. The third follows their European tour. It seems that the boys are becoming more and more insolent as the series goes on in the series. In my opinion, the third series is the best, but believe me, when I say that if you have a weekly stomach, DO NOT LOOK, since you can easily see enough blood and vomiting in each episode.
