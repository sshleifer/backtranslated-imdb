When I heard that in this film Adrian Pasdar was in difficulty, my expectations that I would watch the entire film were low. The only reasons I gave him a chance were the gorgeous Julie Walters and the recommendation of a friend. <br /> <br /> What I thought was a broad farce like Mrs. Doutfire, which turned out to be a gentle and insightful comedy. Pasdar is completely trustworthy and empathetic, as an ambitious business man who needs to get out of the female part of his being by dressing up in some cases. He conveys these needs to the audience perfectly believable. Julie Walters is gorgeous, like her habit, as the mistress who teaches him unconditional love.
