First of all, this film lasts 34 minutes, which means that you can watch it three times in a row and at the same time spend less time than most other films. Secondly, you need to do this. This sensational short film reveals the potential of animation in the world of playful or terrifying, but always powerful images. Cats ride and drink from a water elephant, a circus with a bird eating the sky, and pigs that eat their roast flesh is just the beginning. Scenes and images, themselves unusual, flow together without obvious causal relationships that require re-viewing. In addition, the DVD contains an amazing commentary by the director, who, given the extremely modest dialogue, only improves the viewing. The commentary provides several interpretations of the scenes, but also invaluable quotes about the creation of “Cat Soup” are given: “the artists asked us what to do in this scene, but I didn’t know myself, so it's hard to say why it happened” (by the way, this is a bad rephrasing.) In addition, the sound throughout the entire film is very high quality, very accurate and very capricious. In general, the absolute minimum viewing level should look like this: <br /> <br /> First Watch: Watch the DVD without comment. Second Watch : watch DVD with comments iyami third view:. re-read without comment <br /> <br /> However, if you watched it three times, on this you do not stop ....
