Being a fan of giant monsters, I definitely saw the Yeti, especially after hearing a lot about it. Thanks to a good bootleg market, I managed to find a copy quite easily, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film was really, I dare say, decent. <br /> <br /> Decent for what it is, in fact, namely the cheesy giant monster flick. It turns on pretty quickly, as the Yeti shows up pretty quickly, and we get to know different characters. They consist of lousy, nice guys and a girl who is definitely one of the most frankly amazingly beautiful girls in any fun sci-fi movie, of course. <br /> <br /> The Yeti looks like a long guy right from the original Woodstock concert, and indeed, he’s not such a bad dude, especially after being introduced to the world in some scared cage. He is not a Godzilla - despite his rude awakening, he is not even furious (in fact he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture), but just looks puzzled, trying to figure it out. It seems that the Yeti understands English very well (my copy is duplicated in English), and he knows who the good and bad guys are. <br /> <br /> However, we want the Yeti giant to do its job, and it is largely in the whole film, and in the typical low-budget style, it seems to change size greatly depending on the scene, and there is even a bunch "Fake legs" where he just stands. <br /> <br /> Yes, the special effects are not the best, but there are definitely some good ones. The scene where the Yeti breaks through the warehouse is done very well, and in the other he uses the windows of the building as “stair steps” to come down from its top - breaking each window with his foot and often shocking the inhabitants inside - in one sequence that really looks much better. than in such a "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> “Yeti” never drops as low as, say, “APE” does. In fact, the only time that it comes to true stupidity is when a beautiful girl makes the Yeti's nipple straighten up and he raises an eyebrow in the manner of “oh yeah baby.” But even this is not so bad, and even makes the viewer laugh. <br /> <br /> The film is quite long for this sort of thing, but surprisingly, it doesn’t get boring - the story is really good, and just watching this absolutely gorgeous actress on the screen will make any viewer happy. <br /> <br /> The Yeti may not be in the top echelon of giant monster films, but this is definitely better than other King Kong 76 looting, such as APE and Queen Kong, is very far away.
