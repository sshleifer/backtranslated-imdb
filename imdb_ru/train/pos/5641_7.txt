Yes, the plot is predictable; Yes, there are a few holes in the plot; yes, it has quality for television; and yes, Britney Spears "wrote" a book with obvious self-promotion. <br /> <br /> But forget about all this ... this movie is funny. <br /> <br /> Fun after school A special way, but nonetheless fun. <br /> <br /> Virginia Madsen, as a mother, does an excellent job ... so good that I'm going to start watching her movies. She reminded me of Diane Lane for all good reasons. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast also does an excellent job. If I were an agent for the selection of actors, I would be looking for some of these young actors. <br /> <br /> The production value is higher than normal television standards, and the music was really great ... better than a few high-budget films I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you have the mood for a German noir, this film is not for you. If you want a safe, fun and misunderstood movie, this is a good movie. This is the one that you could show your 10-year-old daughter, but enjoy it too.
