Really cool movie. A must for any musical snob. You donâ€™t need to know about groups to enjoy the film. Before the movie, I heard only two songs from Dandy Warhols. Only impartiality is required. <br /> <br /> Movie center around the slaughterhouse of Brian Johnstown. Dandy Warhols plays a role in the film as a "rival band", but they are the second violin for BJM. Dandy Warhols do not play such a big role in the film, as I initially guessed, but again, there was no element of excitement and unpredictability of BJM. You can't help but be enchanted by the band and its very charismatic frontman Anton Newcomb. In itself, this is an insightful film and study of the music industry. Just watch this movie and enjoy.
