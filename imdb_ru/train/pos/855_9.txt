This movie is fantastic. Finally, well-written characters can be loved for all good and bad. Pierce Brosnan went into hysterics in this self-deprecating role. I think this is the best thing he ever did. He performed other roles that demonstrated shades of ability for such a full-fledged work, but this role finally gave him the opportunity to work with her. I almost died when he walked through the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots. Both Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis are also the couple they aspire to, and the actors they also aspire to. Kinnear is so stupid that his move in the end is really good. You give good actors good work, and they give us something else.
