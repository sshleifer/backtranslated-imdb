One of the greatest science fiction works of all time, as ghostly and thought-provoking as Blade Runner or even Gilliamâ€™s own Brazil. Willis shows his best results here, but he is surpassed by the incredibly insane turn of Pitt, who does not look like anything he did before or after. Even Stow is not from her league here, though. The story is very multi-layered and offers a lot to think about. The climate scene is gorgeous, and the last lines are perfect. Scenes in a psychiatric hospital in their own creepy and funny. There is a lot of dark humor. Fantastic production design and, accordingly, strange cinematography. In my top ten.
