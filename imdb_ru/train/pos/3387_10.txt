A truly amazing film, the concept of a possible prophetic vision of the future is frightening. The world is extremely overcrowded, unbearable heat due to a damaged ozone layer and all of our natural resources. In this nightmarish degenerative society, we see the great Charlton Heston as a cute noir-style detective in a film trying to comprehend the truth of the murder, opposite the noir film legend Edward J. Robinson, who plays a beautiful last role. <br /> <br /> One of the images that will always remain with me in this film is the masses of people inhabiting the stairwells, and the way Thorn (Heston) has to jump over them every time he uses them. <br /> <br /> The music used in the film also deserves attention, although in the usual sense it does not contain points. The opening theme is good, and the subsequent fragments of music that we have here in Simonson’s apartment, and especially Beethoven’s plays at the euthanasia clinic, are outstanding. atmospheric.
