I did not expect much from this movie. I was given a ticket for an advanced show. I just got off work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait 40 minutes in the cinema, and there seemed to be no cool air through the corridors of the theater complex. <br /> <br /> Once sitting in a theater, tired and upset, the film began. I didn't recognize any of the actors at the beginning, but the flow of the film was perfect. From the very beginning I was carried away by the film, with every minute becoming more and more excited. I think this movie is intended for fantasy / fairytale classics. The actors were great, the tempo was perfect, and the final was magical.
