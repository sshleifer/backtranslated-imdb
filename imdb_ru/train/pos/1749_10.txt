Steve Carrell proved to be a great lead man in this wonderful, original, bawdy breath of fresh air. I talk about how brilliantly fun it was. <br /> <br /> Basically, the name of the film speaks for itself: Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old man who works in an electronics store. He's a little nerd who loves video games and comics, and he has the largest collection. His peers, who work with him in the store, find out that he is a Virgo during a pretty poker game filled with sexual dialogue, and then Andy must go through a rather funny, hellish, Odyssey about gross sexual awakenings, but always screw up, he does not lose his virginity, but in the end he is lucky. <br /> <br /> Leave the little ones at home, but take the whole family to see this amazing romantic comedy for adults. This will cause you to get caught and cracked from the very beginning, and by the time it's over, you'll want to wear underwear with a very thick absorbent material. The only thing I can say about this is that it is very unfortunate that Steve Carrell was not recognized as a leaving man 20 years ago. He will definitely win the best breakthrough male performance next year at the MTV Movie Awards. You can bet this hard-earned dollar, people! <br /> <br /> I give it 10 perfect points!
