The catastrophe causes a deplorable social situation: impoverished Giovanna was in the ditch, but still has an ace in the sleeve: beauty and youth. Bragana, a pot-bellied tenant of a gas station who has been dragging her for several years, lifts her from the street and offers her a bed and a house with her clumsy love. But the physical contact that Giovanna is facing now only causes her disgust, and therefore she sees in him not a benefactor, but a torturer, from which she must get rid of. <br /> <br /> Gino's arrival A young migrant worker finally gives her a welcome opportunity. And you do not need to ask her twice: at the first meeting, she gives him a feeling of physical desire, and a little later she allows him to seduce her without providing any resistance. <br /> <br /> The development of the partnership must obey the strict rules developed by Giovanna. Gino's desire for freedom is suppressed, his desire to leave the place with Giovanna and start a new life away from the fat man is discarded. Giovanna sets another goal: to kill Bragana, to inherit and, in addition, to collect the insurance premium. In her hands, Gino degenerates into a selfless instrument. Being completely at the mercy of this woman, he turns into a cold-blooded killer. <br /> <br /> But unlike Giovanna, he calls into question the committed crime at the moral level. The very occupation of Braganaâ€™s place, which includes sleeping on the bed of a dead person, causes deep hatred towards him. And later, after he learned about the upcoming payment of insurance money and, it seems, checked Giovanna's ingenious plan, he also conducts a physical separation from his lover and finds solace in the arms of a prostitute. <br /> <If the Visconti film ended at this moment, it could easily be classified as a judgmental portrait of a cool, calculating and unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism. But then the last sequences destroy this carefully constructed construction of ideas. Finally, Giovanna regrets what she did, and thanks to the uncompromising disclosure of her most intimate feelings, she manages to rekindle Gino's love again. Her violent death as a result of an absurd traffic accident not only leaves him helpless to the mercy of fate. This also affects us, while we understand that none of the acting characters should be held responsible for their disaster. A criminal is simply a state of society, which from the very beginning has always determined the path of the individual. <br /> <br />
