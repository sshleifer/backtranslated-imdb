It was directed by Ruggiero Deodato, a true symbol for many horror film fans after he directed the original and notorious Cannibal Holocaust. However, do not expect to find such fame in the film reviewed here, as it turns out to be incredibly tame compared to and plays more like an outlet inspired by Conan for a young audience. <br /> <br /> Such a description can instantly alienate most fans of the Sword & Sorcery genre inspired by Conan, but before you think about it, you need to say that this film is very funny! <br /> <br /> He basically plays for laughs and shows two HUGE and very cute characters in the form of David and Peter Paul aka. barbaric brothers who seem to both play a ball with their characters. <br /> <br /> Favorite in B-Movie Richard Lynch turns out to be the main villain in the film, and it's also great to see roles for Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, the ladies contemplate stunningly and dress poorly throughout the film (the main and very desirable ingredient in the genre!) <br /> <br /> What can I say is simply very cheerful and carefree look at the genre, and I recommend it with all my heart!
