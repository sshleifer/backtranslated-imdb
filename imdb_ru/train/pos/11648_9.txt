There are people who claim that this is another “bad language” of a Mexican film about violence. They are right, but more than that, this film is a call for the realization of who we have become. The terrible truth hurts or tires when you have already accepted the paradigm of the life of the third world as the only possible goal. One of the most important things about “Cero y van cuatro” is an open invitation to deep reflection on our current identity. Is that what we all are? Is that all we want to be? I am abroad, and I realized how spoiled Mexican society was when the Tlauac incident came to light. I still can not understand the audience who witnessed the massacres. I almost burst out when I saw some images. It was not Iraq or Rwanda, but just a tiny village near Mexico City, when the frenzy was committed with the indulgence of the media and government. Recreating a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply. Other stories were good, depicting other situations of corruption, dishonesty, betrayal and violence, but I think that Tamales de Chivo is the best. <br /> <br /> The film is deeper than some Kabron and Pendejo. screams. It is meaningless compared to the actions of people. With a few exceptions, they are all excellent examples of human garbage. As in real life, honesty in our country becomes the exception rather than the rule. Moreover, honesty is rewarded only in a miraculous way.
