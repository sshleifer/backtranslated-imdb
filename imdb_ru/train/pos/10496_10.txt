Great actors, nominal actress Oscar, awesome scenery, a good strong storyline and more laughter than you can fit in my new purse (and it's pretty big). This film was brilliant. It was beautifully played in more serious scenes and there were funny moments. . good, lateral separation. I have never heard the audience laugh so loudly, and tears flowed down my cheeks during the scene with "burnt ladies in the tea room." Well done by the British film industry and Craig Ferguson, whose magic ingredients made this film one of my favorites this year, if not forever.
