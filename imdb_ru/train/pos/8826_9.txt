If you are amused by the action with direct faces that are logical in this illogical situation, you will like this fancy 8-minute Spanish film. <br /> <br /> A woman enters a small cafe. The scene looks normal, but the counter, customers and two musicians seem strangely submissive. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the musicians play, and one person begins to sing the title song, dancing through the tabletops with a musical comedy gestures. Clients, initially still, from time to time turn on (badly, but playfully) with phrases from the song, read sheets of paper on their palms. From time to time they bounce and dance (awkwardly, but sincerely) in choreographic movements, like backup singers. <br /> <br /> But why ??? the woman is surprised. The answer is revealed when the soloist's jacket opens, and she sees what is stretched across his chest - just before the explosive climax ... <br /> <br /> Even if you do not catch the lyrics (perhaps ironic), the perfect The presentation should give you a smile and chuckle ... I would like to see it again!
