This remarkable 1983 BBC television production (and not the film, as others wrote here) of the classic Jane Eyre love story with Timothy Dalton as Rochester and Zella Clark as Jane, is the best version that was made today. day, as he is the most loyal novel by Charlotte Bronte, both in concept and in dialogue. <br /> <br /> Classics become classics for very specific reasons; when film producers begin to interfere with the life of the classic itself, then this classic is destroyed. Fortunately, the producers of ITO “Jane Eyre” approached the story with respect and loyalty to the original, which led to an incredibly exciting mix, which is worth seeing several times to enjoy its multi-layered sweetness, admiration and expectation. The performances are amazing, the music is just right, even the gothic design of the house and the street shots are beautiful and set the right tone for the production. <br /> <br /> My only criticism, albeit minor, is that this version, like any other version ever made about Jane Eyre, ignores the Christian influence that shaped Jane's character and influenced her moral choice. In today's modern world, a woman in a situation of Jane would not have thought twice, but remained with Rochester, having learned that he has a mad wife and she is still married to her. “Oh, just divorce,” she told her man, or she would live with him in sin. But Jane Eyre knew that she could not agree to this way of life and respect herself. What for? This decision was based on the foundations of the Christian faith, which she had been taught from childhood, not from the cruel Calvinistic institute of Loud, but from the Christian example of a true friend of Helen Burns, who was martyred rather than turned the other cheek. Someday I would like to see some version portray these influences a little more fully in adaptation. A classic novel that ends with the heroine writing "Even so, go to the Lord Jesus!" should not be without the foundations of this faith.
