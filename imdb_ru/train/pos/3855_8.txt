The morbid Catholic writer Gerard Reeve (Jeroen Krabbe), a homosexual, an alcoholic and often seeing death, is invited to give a lecture at the literary club Vlissingen. Being at the train station in Amsterdam, he feels an inappropriate attraction to a handsome man who takes another train. Gerard is represented by the club’s treasurer and cosmetologist Christina Halslag (René Southendijk), a wealthy widow who owns the Sphinx beauty salon, and they have one night stand. who saw at the station. He invites her to take Herman to his home to spend a couple of days together, but with the secret intention to seduce a man. Christina goes to Cologne to bring her boyfriend, and Gerard is left alone in her house. He drinks whiskey and picks up her safe, finding three films with the names of men; He decides to watch the stories and find out that Christina married three guys, and they all died as a result of tragic accidents. Later, Gerard believes that Christina is a witch, and asks if Herman or he will be her doomed fourth husband. <br /> <br /> The ambiguous "Wierde Man" is another great feature of Paul Verhoeven in his Dutch phase. The story is supported by a great script that uses Catholic characters to create tension associated with smart dialogues; the magnificent performance of Jeroen Krabbe as a worried alcoholic writer; and awesome cinematography. The inconclusive resolution is open to interpretation, as in many European films that explore the common sense and intelligence of viewers. There are mediocre directors who use the nudity of men to promote their films; however, Paul Verhoeven uses Gerard Riva's nudity as part of the plot and is never aggressive or seeking sensationalism. Last but not least; Sexy androgynous beauty Rene Soutendijk is perfect for her role as a woman who appeals to a gay writer. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “About 4o Home” (“Fourth Man”)
