Apparently, this is one of the first shorts Shempa with Stooges. (This rules out his much earlier vaudeville team years). But the comedy time the three of us here are best sharpened. In addition to the intense scenes of farce, there are other, more subtle, but equally funny. Watch Larry as Shemp asks him to look at the camera for a shot. Or look at a real object that prompts Moe's exclamation: “Oh ... beautifully polished mahogany!” <br /> <br /> Emil Sitka in his astonished stupidity And this fool may look scary, but he is somehow funny. He seems to be just as disappointed and puzzled by the puppets, like the "ordinary" people in other shorts. <br /> <br /> For the fans of Schempe, this episode must be. It will not disappoint.
