Hello from the dark again. A stunning photograph emphasizes this Disney documentary and gives an insight into some of the harsh animals that live in the desert. For those over 40, Disney and Mutual of the Omaha's Wild Kingdom told us about wild animals since childhood ... when there was no channel dedicated to National Geographic, Nature or Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> What always fascinates is how complex the circumstances are for many of these magnificent creatures. Watching elephants that roam for several days is almost delirious due to lack of water, it hurts so much. But their night battle with the lions is exciting. <br /> <br /> Some underwater shots held their breath. Humpback mummies and babes are beautiful, and they watch how the great white shark attacks its prey, as scary as the "Jaws". The most amazing scenery for me was breathtaking views of the Himalayas. I have never seen such a detail of the vastness of the range. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t think that most young children today will be too excited about this, but this is definitely one of the most beautifully photographed documentaries I have. ever seen.
