What happens when someone has so much social anxiety that it stops functioning? How can one person get one? What happens when the worldly crap we have to do to become part of society becomes too big? Frownland explores these issues. Definitely a terrific original debut from Bronstein. The tone is strange and claustrophobic when we get into the mind of a guy named Keith, who is so confused that he can hardly make a correct sentence. We follow him everywhere, as he tries to establish contact with people and function from day to day. Most of us have people like people who say too much “excuse me” or “I appreciate it” when there is nothing to appreciate. So, we know that there are such people, but why would someone make a film about them? Well, because it's interesting, and Bronstein and the main actor, Dore Mann, do an excellent job. This film is about as non-commercial as the film can get. Several friends shot it for several years while they were saving money. It was shot at 16 mm, and the scratched film looks beautiful with a low budget. Without a distributor, it may not be easy to find, I think it was randomly checked during the last year or so. Hope this will be on DVD at some point. I saw it at the Pacific Cinema here in Los Angeles. There were 10 people in the audience, including Crispin Glover, if that says anything about how strange this film is. Highly recommended.
