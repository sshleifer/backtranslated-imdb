**** SPOILERS **** The film "Sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploits of the legendary US Marine sniper Carlos "Gunny" Hetcock. A modest, quiet Mr. Rogers, similar to the other, who collected up to 300 confirmed and unconfirmed military killings of the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese in two rounds in Nam. Which shows how deadly and effective a trained military sniper actually is. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenguer is as calm and deadly as Sergeant Thomas Beckett, who at the end of his career was the best sniper of the US Marine Corps, but who later in the film realizes that life as a civilian will be meaningless. Because for him there is nothing to do with his skills, which he learned in the US Marines, unless he decides to become a hired killer. Buckett reluctantly accepts his fate as a life-long professional killer in his own country. <br /> <br /> The story of the film "Sniper" focuses on Sergeant Beckett with the help of former silver medalist and US government agent Richard. Miller, Billy Zane, is sent deep into the Panamanian jungle. Two snipers must destroy the rebel general Miguel Alveraz, Frederik Miraglito and the Colombian drug lord Raoul Ochoa, Carlos Alveraz, who is supporting him in the planned military seizure of the country. <br /> <br /> We see earlier in the film Sergeant. Beckett sight and take away the rebel leader, who, I believe, was the best scene in the "Sniper". For step by step shows as a sergeant. Beckett with the help of his supervisor Cpt. Papic, Aden Young, does his job. There is also a plot that was later interrupted in a film about the rebel sniper DeSilva, Eward Wiley, who chased Beckett and later killed Papic when they both waited for them to be pulled out of the jungle by a military helicopter. You might think that between them a deadly cat and mouse is played, the culmination of which will be the end of the film, except for the sergeant. Beckett had no problems sending DeSilva at the beginning of the movie using the unsuspecting Miller as bait. <br /> <br /> What harmed the film the most was, ironically, the last fifteen or so minutes when the story came from a single film. He made one film "The Sniper-Killer" in the final in the style of Rambo with a sergeant. Beckett and Agent Miller are fighting a whole battalion of rebels with bullets flying as thick as the London fog. <br /> <br /> “The Sniper” is still worth watching as he tells the story of a man who, until now, was no glamor in war films: a lone killer who kills with the precision and skill of a master cutter or an experienced neurosurgeon and who does this in complete secrecy.
