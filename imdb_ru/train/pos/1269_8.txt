Sullivan reveals to Armstrong the truth about the monstrous murder of Joanie Shriver and why he was Bob Earl, a psychopathic killer, and he really raped and killed Joanie Shriver. He just made a deal with the angry psycho Sullivan. To free himself so that he could kill again for the sake of revenge. On the beautiful wife and daughter of Armstrong. Now Sullivan is executed before his death. Armstrong and strong, kindly fellow Brown are chasing the evil villain on the Everglades to prevent him. When they arrive, Armstrong learns that mentally ill Bobby Earl plans to kill his wife and daughter during the former rape trial, which inevitably caused him to endure excruciating pain and castration. But the good, virtuous policeman Brown appears and interferes with the cruel villain. He was slaughtered and eaten by the ruthless, human-eating alligators. Paul Armstrong, Tanny Brown, his wife and daughter survive and live happily ever after. Good thriller that works. Allows you to reveal secrets and tricks. Like reluctant blacks hate racist jurists. Caused by unjust punishments. Even if innocently innocently convicted, an innocent, friendly black person can actually be a vicious villain. Sean Connery is great as forgetful, more holy than you, a hero. Laurence Fishburn is amazingly amazing, like an angry, arrogant but good cop guy. Underwood and Harris are vigorous and cheerful as evil psychos. Kape≈°aw is all right. Ruby Dee is gorgeous as a tenacious grandmother. The rest of the cast is also great.
