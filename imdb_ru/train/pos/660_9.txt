9 / 10- 30 minutes of pure holiday terror. Okay, this is not so scary. But it is really fun. <br /> <br /> The crypt keeper (John Kassir) tells the tale of the holiday FEAR, giving us all the Christmas goose ... GosseBUMPS That is. Bwahahahahha. You really have to be careful what you AX Santa for. Merry Christmas and New Fear. Ok, I'll stop. <br /> <br /> Well, in this story, the greedy wife (the world's best screamer, Mary Ellen Traynor) kills her husband (Marshall Bell, a trainer who is toweled to death). in ANOES 2) for money. BUT, her plan collapses when a crazy killer dressed in Santa's costume (Larry "Dr. Jiggles" Drake) is on her way. <br /> <br /> If you watch it on YouTube, you can watch it for free, but most of you have already seen it (my third viewing). But if you have not seen it, I suggest you do it.
