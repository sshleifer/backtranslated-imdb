Antonioni really showed a few “cojones” when he made this film. He went to America, working under contract with the most generous studio (MGM), and made the most terrible portrait of American society that I have ever seen. Seeing LA first-hand is the most accurate depiction of a crowded, overheated and impersonal city. If only Antonioni met Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> The subsequent burial in the studio is understandable after such a colossal investment and a grim return. Sadly, people no longer see this film, since I believe that Antonioni was right. Here he predicts the end of the hippie / civil rights movement in American politics. All are much more interested in what goes into their pockets, and the constant expansion of living space in the inhospitable (but beautiful) desert and beyond. I wish that the interest in this film could be inflamed in the luxurious release of the DVD. <br /> <br /> I beg people to watch Zabriskie Point with an open heart and an open heart. We have a truly unique film about the turning point in the history of the most powerful nation of the planet, and we have forgotten it. <br /> <br /> An unexpected gem.
