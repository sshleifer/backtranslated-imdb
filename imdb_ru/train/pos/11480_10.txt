Short cut to the chase: this is one of the most amazing, most intense films I've seen in a long time. The first film in years that left me in shock. I could barely feel my way out of the theater, I was so stunned. <br /> <br /> I looked at the screen for about fifteen minutes, trying to find a way to describe the power of this film, and just fails. Underlining any one aspect - the format of video days in the documentary style, the unshakable depiction of events, the strength of the characters - it seems that all this is trivialized. It may seem ridiculous to some that any killer can be described as normal. But then not all killers rave about crazy, foaming on the lips. Many quite ordinary, modest people. They are simply connected in different ways. <br /> <br /> And this is perhaps the most frightening thought of all.
