I recently watched it, but when it started, I had no idea what this concept was about, what was discussed ... in short - I had no idea what it was. Was this a documentary, was it a comedic affair ..... Well, it was BOTH. <br /> <br /> It started a little slow, but I think it was because I didn’t know at all what program I was watching. But it quickly sucked me up. In the episode I watched, Robert Woole discussed the facts and fiction in history. Mostly, how we (Americans) study history, which is actually untrue - and how we learned what we did. He did it in such a way that the viewer was completely entertained and interested. I really learned a few things, and this is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be. <br /> <br /> I would really like it to be shot in a series for HBO. I believe that this can be as fun and effective with different themes, especially if they are “taught” in the same manner as this episode.
