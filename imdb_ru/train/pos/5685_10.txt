Glory to the director and cast for such a realistic film. Sandiness, lack of glamor and despair involved me in the film and kept it there. I was really impressed with how the dates and information were broadcast in the film; that is, newspapers, letters, etc. This made the film move at such a fast pace that I did not feel prompted to fast-forward. Personally, I thought all the principles did a great job ... it was great to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult roles. It made me want to cry from time to time. Val Kilmer did not surprise me ... his speeches usually cause me fear. Overall, this is a brilliant movie that should not be missed!
