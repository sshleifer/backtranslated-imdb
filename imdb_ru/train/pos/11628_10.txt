“I didn't want this to get complicated, Liz. I must assume that she will read it. " Fear flies 30,000 feet in this tight action movie. A night flight to Miami quickly turns into a battle for survival, when Lisa (Rachel McAdams) realizes that her roommate (Cillian Murphy) plans to use her as part of the frightening murder plot. After a few minutes, she struggles with the time to warn potential victims before it’s too late. <br /> <br /> One of the many reasons why I love this film is because of the chemistry between two stars, McAdams and Murphy, who are also two of my favorite actors. For example, the early scenes at the airport are more like a romantic comedy: two people continue to collide with each other ... I also gave it to two to create a film similar to this work. Especially, the character of Murphy ... Jackson, who does seem rather complicated in that he acts charmingly and innocently, but he tries to do her job and make Lisa feel trapped physically and mentally. I mean in some places he really cares for Lisa. <br /> <br /> A magnificent thrilling ride. In many films I would not like to see a prequel or a sequel, but in reality I would not mind a prequel to this that will happen to Jackson, who is filming Lisa. Favorite scene, probably the same scene with his head, because she was so unexpected. There was also that good build-up to the famous 'pen' scene. When is she going to make her move? There was also a pleasant change in Liza McAdam, where she turned from a victim into a fight. I also liked the scene where she sits in a food court and pretends to ask a poll about food court from some women. How big was Murphy with his whole weekend .....
