There are so many things in Aro Tolbukhin that you can fall into. En la mente del asesino (inside the mind of the murderer), that it is very difficult to talk about it without any warning. Let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in the movies, but in fact is very well done. It is made with super 8, black and white shots, 35 millimeters, color, interview, memories. Aro Tolbukhin, this is like a film shot in a documentary or vice versa, what is the most specific aspect associated with the doubt that makes you wonder if it really existed? The film tells about the later life of a Hungarian sailor who arrived in Guatemala, worked in a religious mission and then killed some people. The act for which he was caught and sentenced to death. The film begins because some French documentary filmmakers are interested in this character, so they interview him before his death. Currently, several more people have connected to it and conducted a more in-depth study of the character. The film, which we witness. <br /> <br /> For the main part of the story, we are guided by the half-witted phase to look into Aro's mind, mainly to understand why he did it. what did he do. However, it is important that the filmmakers never give us a one-sided point of view; they left the judge for us all, and although we can understand his actions, we obviously never justify them. So, the first half is based on gathering information; later everything turns into Aro's childhood, giving the film such an incredible new power (even tough, never became weak or boring). <br /> <br /> I do not mean - and do not want - to spoil anything; so the only thing left to say is that if for any reason you find yourself close to this film, believe me, going to see it is more than worthy.
