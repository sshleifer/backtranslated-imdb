This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I am very touched by the theme that the film intends to convey. I recall one sentence: “history repeats itself”. Life is what is shown in the film: when people are young, they do not seem to understand their parents, their own spouses; people have every reason not to share the most precious time with their children until it is too late; people should always work hard to support the whole family, but only the responsibility to neglect the delicate feeling of their partners; people always change their views at different stages of their lives; people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for the beloved; There is nothing more important than the blood relationships that people share in this world, and it’s never too late to talk to their families about what they feel in their hearts to achieve a better understanding between themselves so that People should not regret or regret anything, because they have kept their words, and there is always hope - a new life. Actors and actresses are fantastic. They perfectly understood the director's intention. The charm of the film lies in the fact that I brought into the audience a skillful and delightful combination of joy and tears.
