The first ever viewing: July 21, 2008 <br /> <br /> A very impressive script, comedy and timekeeping in this film. Now 40 years old, he has not lost any of his strength. Neil Simon demonstrates an excellent understanding of human nature and relationships, as well as how to create a real comedy from unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau give great comedy performances. Neil Simon was inspired by real events in his own life to write a play on which this film is based. <br /> <br /> One of the best Hollywood comedies of all time! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, he was nominated only for 2 Oscars: “The Best Adapted Screenplay” and “The Best Film Editing”. Hollywood rarely awards comedies, no matter how well they are made.
