Arthur Bach needs to grow up, but this, unfortunately, is not the only thing he needs to do. According to his extremely rich father, Arthur must marry a certain rich Susan Johnson, or he is cut off from family money (in the amount of $ 750 million). The problem is that Arthur does not like Susan (although I heard that she makes a good chicken) and has just fallen from head to foot to the waitress and part-time saleswoman Linda Marolla. Arthur is an interesting guy. He is really just a big child, born in wealth, at least one person looks after him every second of every day. Work just loses Arthur in that direction - he likes to have fun, give shape to a woman and, of course, to drink. Drunkenness gives Arthur a kind of Jekyll and Hyde complex; and although this leads to all sorts of trouble, itâ€™s fun to watch the screen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore plays great in this film of Arthur, he gets an Oscar and Golden Globe nomination for his work. Moore is fantastic with the comedic aspects of the film, turning the already funny lines into unforgettable comedic gold, but he is also great at bringing Arthur to a decent level and making the character enjoyable. Moore has some help in the department of a film colleague - Lisa Minnelli is gorgeous, like Lina, an energetic man that Arthur can't get enough of, and John Gilgud is stunning like Arthur Hobson. Gilgud won the best supporting actor Oscar for his role in this film, and there is no doubt why. Hobson has a solid dry wit and a frozen attitude, but he always looks after Arthur - and Gilgud is perfect in this role. The 1981 Steve Gordon film Arthur is short and simple, but delivers a lot of laughter.
