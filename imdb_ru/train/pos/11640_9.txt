What I liked most about this movie is that, like Hitchcock’s films, it's a thriller that doesn’t take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock understood that people go to the movies to have a good time. What Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years. This is a thriller, but there is a lot of laughter in it and always one eye winks at the camera. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams is wonderful as always. Cillian Murphy is worse than he was in Batman Begins. In the old days there were guys who always played the bad guy. We don't see it these days, because I suspect that Hollywood agents consider this a bad career move, but Cillian Murphy is really good at being bad. <br /> <br /> Directing is amazingly stylish. The story is good, but in the dialogue it would be possible to blush a little. <br /> <br /> “Red Eye” is a really funny movie, and people applauded when the final credits began. If you are in the mood for a nice escapist action movie, Red Eye can be your ticket.
