PAGE 3 **** of 4 stars <br /> <br /> Madhvi (Concona Sen) enters her boyfriend’s house and is empty. She looks here and there, and then goes to her bedroom, and you get a picture - “Ah! other girl ?? this double villain and yes, indeed, he is her two times, but this time it is a GUY. And I say: “Brilliant!” <br /> <br /> END OF SPOILERS (The above scene is not really a spoiler ... but for me it was so that I did not want to risk it) <br /> <br /> When I asked how this film went, my friend replied: “Oh, this is just exposing P3 people,” which made me believe that I would watch a stupid film, if not more. When I went to the theater, I thought to myself: “I better get a pen and paper to write down the bad things about this film,” but I was completely wrong? and then some, because I could only collect goods. This movie was great. Great, not because it is an extraordinary and non-commercial cinema, similar to the plotline, but because of the cunning of the script and how this film tells you how to brilliantly deal with a film that could be stupid and meaningless, if given in other people's hands. /> <br /> Concon Saint Charme is grace. She is so damn beautiful that she coped well with her role, as if she was born to play that role. One of the most charming actresses I've ever seen. But this is not the only performance that is good in the film, there are Sandhya Mridul, Boman Iran and Atul Kulkarni. Especially Sandhya Mridul, who simply launches the screen. (And guess what even the unusually accented Tara Sharma usually talks about) <br /> <br /> The films are filmed with the old silly parties of celebrities of the film industry, etc. And you will understand what this film will be about. And for about half an hour of the movie, you feel about the same thing. But then the film picks up the pace, captures a good storyline and never lets it go. Even Boman Irani agrees with this statement ?? "It was a good story, Madhvi." (Thank). The great thing is that he solves the question of how stupid these people are with style, and cannot cope with this, and also solves social problems and does not make them boring. In the end, it's all a rollercoaster ride, and Madhvi tells us about it, just smiling at all these people. Just the reason why I like to watch movies. Enthusiastic filmmaking. The script is beautiful, smart and witty.
