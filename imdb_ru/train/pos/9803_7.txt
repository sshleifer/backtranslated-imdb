This film about Batman is not as good as the Batman mask from Ghost, Batman and Mr. Freeze, but it is still a good addition to the Batman cartoons. This film is good for the same reasons. The plotline is not as good as the other one, but still quite good, there is a lot of action in it. The effects of the cartoon are good. The voice of the actors is really good, such as Kevin Conroy as Batman Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Mariental as Robin. The villains are good, such as Cyrus Sedgwick in the role of Batman, David Ogden Stiers in the role of Pekwina, Hector Elizondo in the role of Bane. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed with Mystery of The Batwomen Batman. So make sure you rent or buy the movie “Batman Mystery of The Batwoman” because it’s really good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ******* of ********* * <br /> <br /> *** of *****
