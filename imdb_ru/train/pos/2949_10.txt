This is the funniest talk I've ever seen, and I think that's the funniest thing I've ever seen. If you do not choke with laughter with absolute fun, then this is not your cup of tea. But I honestly do not know anyone who saw it, who would not like it. It's been 17 years, and my friends and I still quote everything: from Guni Gu Gu to farting game, from Aunt Bunny to ice cream, Ralph and Ed, to QUIT !! There are so many individual and collective fun scenes that, if you honestly have not seen this movie, then you are missing one of the best races in history. Take any of Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, Bones, George Carlin, or even such great people as Richard Pryor or Red Fox, and it will surpass him. I don’t know how and where Murphy got some of his stuff, but it works. That's what it comes down to. It's damn funny. <br /> <br /> Could you imagine how this show must have shocked people who are used to Eddie playing Buckwheat and Mr. Rogers and so on in SNL? If you are listening to an audience, when it makes its first joke or when it first speaks an F-word, they are completely shocked. <br /> <br /> His first time when he utters an F-word is when he makes a parody of the fact that Mr. T is a homosexual. <br /> <br /> "Hey man, hey man. You look very cute in these jeans. Now come here, and, damn it, my ass"! <br /> <br /> The crowd bursts out laughing. Nobody expected the dirty mouth that he imposed on them. But the results were amazing. I have never come across a merciless comedy as I was in this battle. In fact, the next time when my stomach was so sick with laughter, it was not until 1999, when I saw SOUTH PARK: GREAT, GREAT AND CUT. This comedy was rough and not regrettable, and it went on a jugular, like DELIRIOUS. I do not think that you can watch this piece of comic history and not laugh. Almost twenty years have passed, and this is still the funniest damn thing on the video. <br /> <br /> “Last week I took your children to go fishing. And I put the worm on the hook, and the children put the bait back. ” in a boat and for two minutes they threw their heads into the water. Gus Normal kids don't do shit like Gus. Then they started moving their heads like this, and m with fish. Then they looked at each other and said: “Guni, Gu, Gu!” I said, can you believe it, damn it, crap ?! "<br /> <br /> See it again and get ready to laugh at your fucking ass off. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
