It is very rare to find a literary work adequately translated to the screen, and I rated this film higher than it deserves, but not by much. As a long-time student of Vonnegut’s works, I would not hesitate to recommend the film to his readers, at least to those who love him as much as I love him. Casting inspired: Nolte is understated in triumph, bewildered by defeat, decisive in judgment. Cheryl Lee is juicy everywhere, but her appeal to the treacherous Resy and her tragic crescendo almost makes you forget about her beauty. Alan Arkin offers a very nice, but no less insidious Soviet spy. <br /> <br /> Don't think that you need to read “Mother's Night” to appreciate the film; However, if you have not read Mother's Night, you will probably want to watch it after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the transition from color to black and white and back and do not miss the final symbolism of the Campbell loop. Also note Kurt Vonnegut's cameo near the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby's White Christmas will never sound the same (I write in mid-December when the song becomes a heavy broadcast and it drives me crazy).
