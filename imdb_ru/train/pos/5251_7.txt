Well, “The World of Wayne” is long gone, and the years have since been difficult for skill. from such a cinematic subtitle as “This is Pat”, to the recent 80-minute yawn of “The Night at Roxbury”, many, no doubt, have lost the belief that any other parody will ever make a successful transition to a silver screen. Do not be afraid, because Tim Meadows penetrates the spikes. a well-written story supports the interest of the audience to the very end, and, although it remains true to the character of Leon Phelps, presented in a five-minute sketch, the storyline allows the character to evolve. humor (consisting mainly of sexual jokes) is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than in any film of recent memory. This is just a great time if you don't want to take yourself too seriously. Tiffany-Amber Thyssen, known as "Saved by the Bell", appears in the film and looks incredible. Finally, Billy Dee Williams, who survived his Colt 45 days, gives the film a sense of classiness. and for those who are meaningless authors of films like me, you will find this film very worthy of mention: “Oh, this is a lady!”
