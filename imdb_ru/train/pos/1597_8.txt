This is a kind of film for a snowy Sunday, when the rest of the world can go about its business, when you go down into a big chair and relax for a few hours. The wonderful performances of Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) gently promote the plot. There are no thresholds to cross, no dangerous waters, just warm and witty fun in New York life at its best. Family film in all senses and praiseworthy.
