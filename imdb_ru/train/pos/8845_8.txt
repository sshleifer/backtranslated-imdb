The beginning of this film is a little awkward, and also confusing, but sit back because you are on a trip of your life. The concept is convincing, with interesting devices used to tell a general story. Around the wonderful performances, with Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who was the best of the actors - not surprising. Ethan Hawke also deserves praise for a very strong game. The leadership of Mr. Lumet is outstanding. The film has the feeling of the seventies regarding the fact that the risk is in the story of this story, but unlike most banal films that inhabit the landscape today, it is a thriller that is genuinely based on relationships, not on special effects or products. You will be greatly rewarded for the time spent on this film.
