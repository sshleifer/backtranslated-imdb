I was not going to watch this show. But I'm glad I did. Critics simply do not understand! This is one of the most fun and interesting things on TV at the moment! Although, when interviews were conducted with ordinary people, they probably seemed useless; but put them in the mouth of animals and insects, and this is a riot of laughter. I was laughing so hard, I had tears in my eyes. A pig with a baby and her mother is priceless. The husband and wife bird talks about health problems, and the male bird takes the shit after the wife said she was constipated, completely upset me! Creature Comforts is the most original show I've ever seen! Hopefully he will be back next summer when this race is over.
