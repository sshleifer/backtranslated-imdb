The first and second seasons began shakily, with good episodes, sandwiched between averages, and sometimes resorting to cliches. But as soon as he began to tune the universe in which he exists, and began to develop his characters more, he became much more fun and exciting. <br /> <br /> The main reason why this show is a success is due to four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzi and Paul Malley The episode is much more exciting, and Joe and Paul always make a funny and interesting episode together. <br /> <br /> As soon as you understand what is being said and learn the characters, I doubt that you will not like the show. For those on the show, I offer the episodes “The Other Side,” a good serious episode, and “The Window of Opportunity,” a classic comic episode with relief.
