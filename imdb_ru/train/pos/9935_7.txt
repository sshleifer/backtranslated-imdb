My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * dizziness * CHOP} My ... my - my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {EDIT. CUT. Reproduction} <br /> <br /> I never before saw a director rooting for his style so much. By now, it’s obvious that most people don’t appreciate Tony Scott’s volatile, bright, dizzy editing technique. If I had to choose between love and hate, I would say that I like it. Sometimes it distracted from the border, but the end result was quite good, and it's nice to see the director with a creative advantage in his style and some originality (even if it is borrowed from an MTV video). <br /> <br /> This stylistic advantage is manifested in the fact that Keira Knightley plays the role of the daring, evil headhunter Domino Harvey, and even her dialogue seems strangely changeable. Otherwise, she plays her badly, because I pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize with her for anything, no matter how much she suffered. We follow Domino through her life when she joins other bounty hunters Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew got entangled in the FBI and unexpectedly got a contract for a reality show as part of Christopher Walken’s television production company (by the way, what does Christopher Walken do in each film?). I guess this is a smart movie technique, because now Tony Scott is free to use as many bright videos for editing the MTV / Reality Show as he likes. At this point, it becomes a fake MTV culture. <br /> <br /> It follows from this that the story is told at an amazingly fast pace, with a lot of rude, strong statements and gun violence. There are a few funny jokes; it's all very modern and surreal at the same time. This is a mess, but a rather pleasant mess. Ultimately, it has flaws in many ways (for example, the actors try too hard to make their characters cool), but it works. I give him a weak 7/10, which may seem generous compared with the general opinion of viewers who rated this movie ?? but I feel that he had good ideas and they implemented them well. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
