This is one of those westerns who, well, in general, are almost alone in the dissatisfied quality of their dialogue. Very few can stand it for a long time. However, everything else is pretty bad. Nevertheless, I give him eight, because there is no other western with such a consistently good dialogue, perhaps with the exception of The Wild Bunch, Junior Bonner, and perhaps a few more. <br /> <br /> This is riddled with weaknesses, the most striking is John Drew Barrymore. However, he has one really memorable scene. Nothing like this. This is right after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff and goes to Jack Elam's place, trying to push him into a fight. Wonderful things. Up to the best in any western.
