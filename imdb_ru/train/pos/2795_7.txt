I love to play football, and I thought that this film is great because there is a lot of football in it. It was a good Hollywood / Bollywood film, and I'm glad he won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were as good as Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rice Meyers played great on the coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves to play football, but her parents want her to learn how to cook, they want her to get married. When Jazz begins to secretly play for the football team, she meets Juliet (Kiera Knightleti) and Jo (Jonathon Rice Meyers), who is her coach. When her parents find trouble, her father allows her to play a large part at the wedding of her sisters Pinky (Archie Punjabi). In the end, her parents understand how much she loves football and let her play abroad.
