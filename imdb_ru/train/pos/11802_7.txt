This is not the best Bigfoot ever made, but according to the latest standards of the films “Nature” went awry, it is mainly shown on the Sci-Fi channel, it is a quality material. He has some actions, some humor, a decent F / X and a snowman. CG is used, but I also like some practical F / X that I like. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is worth seeing if you are a B horror / sci-fi fan and you need to fix it. This is better than the Sasquatch movie and not the sequel, so don't be fooled. <br /> <br /> Acting is better than you would expect in such a film, and the direction is more than adequate. Expect a little lul, as the characters are "developed", but know that things will understand. If you are watching a DVD, you can skip one or two chapters.
