In 1990, the Disney TV cartoon world was certainly in his prime. Shows like Chip n Dale, Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummi Bears were already popular, and now Disney has shot another great cartoon, and this cartoon brought the birth of Disney Afternoon. This cartoon is called TaleSpin. This is the old character of the Book of the Jungle, Balu Bear, when he gets a job on an airplane. In the series, he meets Keith Cloudkiker, a former air pirate and a good cloud surfer, business woman Rebecca Cunningham and her hyperactive daughter Molly. This series is very funny and contains a lot of great puns that you may not have understood as a child, but understood later. This is one of the cleverly written series, and it's great to add to your DVD collection. Parents, buy this for your children, rather than letting them watch all these horrible Nickelodeon cartoons. If you like the TaleSpin, then check out the Dark Wing Duck and the Fool Forces. Twist!
