An excellent film from Thaddeus O'Sullivan, featuring strong performances by a variety of British and Irish actors. The film reveals well the difficult topics and effectively reflects the hopelessness and gloomy atmosphere of the Belfast of the 1970s. Surprisingly realistic, it does nothing to glorify any side in this conflict. On the one hand, it depicts a young Catholic father trying to raise a family without getting into trouble. On the other hand, we are talking about a gang of loyalists who intend to promote violence. Very interesting and, fortunately, interesting. Do not wait for laughter. 7 out of 10.
