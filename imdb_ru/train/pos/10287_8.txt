This is one of those films for which they have done too much advertising. If you watch T.V., you can not watch the movie. Almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the preview, except for the case when Jennifer Ennisten was the most ridiculous. This is Jim Carrey’s typical humor, and it’s really fun. Just do not go watch this movie, waiting for surprise. In general, if you like Jim Carrey or comedy, you definitely need to see it, otherwise just watch the preview and you will be satisfied.
