This film makes the intellectual mind think and try to analyze the story. I also can not understand why people throw this film. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Jerry Bruckheimer, this movie may not be for you. <br /> <br /> This film shows a high degree of realism. Representation of actors and actresses is a trial. Not fake, just natural. <br /> <br /> No special sound effects, so no special side effects. <br /> <br /> The camera is excellent, the music is very good. I can't wait to get the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> It leaves your body numb, like Konstantin Garderner. He has a rude talent, and, of course, he is not a follower.
