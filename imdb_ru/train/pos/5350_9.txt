I have seen “The Running Man” several times, as I am a fan of Stephen King and I have all his films, but now it’s even better, because 2 days ago I didn’t know about this site and didn’t realize that Paul Michael Glazer which was associated with this film was the same Paul Michael Glazer, whom I raised while watching Starsky and Hutch on TV. For me, this is a pleasant surprise, because I cannot tell you how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch suffered. In the episode when Starsky (Kill Starsky) almost died, I cried so much that my father had to turn away from the show. What do you expect from a child at the age of 12? Now I am deliberately looking for films and programs with Paul or David Soul and everything that Stephen King has in my hands, I'm there! !!!!!!!! Just gotta say Happy Birthday, Paul !!!!!
