“Magic” is not a strong word for the spell that weaves this film. You relax and see others in a more benevolent light ... Any film that has a civilizational effect on viewers deserves serious attention. Rarely do we absorb beauty like this. As if this were not enough, it is ridiculous. Performances, without exception, are exceptional, but special mention should be made of the wonderful Miranda Richardson and the magnificent Josie Walker - both are open like roses. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie not on DVD? It deserves to live forever.
