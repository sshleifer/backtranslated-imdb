I think that when Bit Street acquired a nationwide character, Flashdance appeared simultaneously. The problem with “Flashdance” is that there was only one scene for break dancing, and the rest is jazz and ballet. This was one of the reasons why Bit Street was better. The only film that can compete with “Beat Street” seems to be “Footloose”, because both films are about how people used dance to express their ultimate feelings. <br /> <br /> A breakdance scene in the movie “Beat Street” comes just before the middle and at the end of the flick. And I loved them all. Almost all the tricks of the break were shown in break-jam scenes: jackhammer, rockets, unwinding of the head, sitting a suicide, crazy legs, mortal, throwing forward, the number four - almost everything. /> <br /> Like “Warriors”, “Bit Street” has violence associated with gang life in the hip-hop world ... but in a far less brutal way than in the first. The only big fight scene on “Beat Street” was when the graffiti artist Ramon (who in the film was called “Rameau”) was chased by a rival gang member on the New York railroad tracks ... fighting each other on the third rail and both die current on this rail. Well, although this chase scene ended tragically, it would be better if they died in this way than the blood that exploded from a gang shot. <br /> <br /> Most of the gangster plots in the movie were graffiti related to hip-hop culture and rap. There was a lot of rap music in rap because hip-hop members used rap music as a distraction to negative aspects of gangster life. Even the main song of the film, which closed the curtain for the film, was not just a tribute to hip-hop culture, but a tribute to Ramon’s death. <br /> <br /> By the way, during the dance scene called “Tango, Tango”, I think that the woman drummer in the pit orchestra under the baton of actress Ray Don Chong was Sheila E., who plays a cameo role.
