This documentary drama is what you expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us Gandhi: beautifully photographed, convincingly thrown, well written in a measured, competent manner, thrown off by Hollywood in the 30s, and scrupulously accurate. It stands out as a genre film, surpassing native American (or, “First Nations”, more suitable for its Canadian environment) culture and standing with “Black Clothing” as a wonderfully photographed piece of the Country of Canoe and its culture (here, circa 1934). ). This idyllic portrait comes from the plot of the drama: Archie “Gray Owl” Belani, a Scotsman raised in Hastings (England) by girlish aunts who were so involved with the “red Indian” tales of his childhood that he went to Canada, disappeared into Woods and became a catcher and adopted son of the Ojibway group. He was a vain man with the habit of marrying and abandoning Indian brides, it seems that none of them thought about him less, because he was also an extraordinarily charming and frightening character. One of his wives (one smarter than him, according to many sources) promoted him as a writer and early defender of the wild country of the North, and this is the focus of Attenborough's story. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipo (as the wife of Gray Owl of the Pony) is interesting and, if not fiery, nonetheless very touching. Good movie when you need time from the crazy crowd.
