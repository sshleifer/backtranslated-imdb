What a loss was the death of director Emile Ardolino! He could take a light script and, with the right selection and editing, add flicker to it and make it shine like a star. This particular star may not be the brightest in the sky, like great romances, but it definitely keeps you updated. You really want to know how things will work. <br /> <br /> The script is perfect for Sybil Shepard, who at that time needed to capitalize on her success in Moonlight for a new generation that (fortunately) for her is probably unsuspecting about how many big balls on the big screen she had after a very promising start. In this film, she still returns to form as a still bored widow, living through her daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson on the threshold of fame, who reached the peak of "Fried Green Tomatoes" two years later). She may have looked too young for this role, but it works well for how the story unfolds. This is her film, but she does not overstep her frontiers as a presenter. <br /> <br /> Shepherd graciously allows Robert Downey Jr. to carry most of the film and shows a more mature comic talent than he has in his film. previous films by this point. And there is a lot of support from Ryan O'Neal (in his best role in recent years) and Christopher MacDonald. Masterson's natural charm pretty much justifies itself, or she has a way to make her character seem like a breath of fresh air with every word. <br /> <br /> Ardolino makes good use of the sex appeal of his cast. Just like he did with Dirty Dancing, but this film is not so sizzling that you can still watch it with your parents if they are in the room. (Listen to your opinion, because they are your parents.) I appreciate this film because it is very user friendly, fans of the romantic comedy will find it excellent, and those who just watch them together should find plenty of humor to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Again, thanks to Emil Ardolino for playing the charming script of Randy and Perry Howes. (Where are they now?) Ardolino’s next film will be a ringing sequel, “Three Men and a Baby,” but his latest theatrical release (“The Sister Actor”) will finally give him the successful nine-digit hit he deserves. Mr. Ardolino, your cinematic touch is missing!
