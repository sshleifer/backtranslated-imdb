This film will go down in history as one of the great people, next to Citizen Kane, Casablanca and On The Waterfront. Someone please convince Leno to do the sequel! Leno and Morita are a comedic duet, the likes of which have not been since Abbot and Costello. The evil that comes from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan and Randall "Tex" Cobb will give you a chill. The character of Dingman as a jester deer dates back to the days of Shakespeare's comedies. And the climax. Oh my god, the climax. I won't spoil it for you, but it makes the Death Star Blast pale in comparison. If you can find this hard-to-reach stone, do yourself and your family a favor and buy it immediately. I still hope to release a special DVD the other day.
