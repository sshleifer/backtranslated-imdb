I found myself at six and seven while watching this. Altman's touch with the zoom in and out was there, and I expected these devices to comment on the characters and the situation. Unfortunately, as far as I could see, they were sometimes unreasonable, sometimes witty, often fruitless due to their inability to point to some ironic or other connection. In particular, two zooms from a gilded dome in the savannah are simply puzzled. To be fair, however, a few increases (ups and downs) to Branagu were heightened by the growing perplexity of his character, like that of Puja McCabe or Philip Marlow. In general, scaling was, well, inconsistent, and sometimes even trivial. <br /> <br /> Other Almanessian devices, such as several glass panels between the camera and the object, were able to offer solipsis, narcissism, or opacity of characters. state of knowledge. I felt that car windshields, house windows, and other screens were used efficiently and fairly consistently, returning to the PLAYER and even LONG TIME. A few catchy jumps, especially for suggestive television advertising, reminded me of this use of short films with a sardonic effect. <br /> <br /> But finally, the discrepancy between the very personal style of Altman and the weight of the impulse of the Grisham genre could not excite me. The masterpieces of this director of the 1970s were revised and deconstructed various classical genres, including Chandler's detective film, which somewhat resembled him; this time, the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytic trembling to deal any significant blow to the soft belly of this brutal genre. Perhaps he was involved in the production of the Mammonists? Or am I missing something because of my poor knowledge of the genre that he plays here? <br /> <br /> However, the cast was excellent: Tom Berenguer (because of his terrifying recklessness), Brana because of his (bloated) Hubris, pheromonal haze of Robert Downey Jr. David's lurking doom was almost an ideal choice for everyone. And with the exception of a few departures from Georgia to Chicago from (brunette?) Daryl Hannah, the accents were convincingly southern. <br /> <br /> Suspension and mood were exciting, even if the story was not completely riveted by the audience. The mood of the barometric diving in the coastal zone before the hurricane was elegant, painstakingly conveyed - I wanted to shout at Usher to turn on the swamp cooler without delay. <br /> <br /> In the end, I rated it as 7. <br /> <br />
