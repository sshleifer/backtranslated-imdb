Well, I finally caught up with Rock and Roll High School, almost 30 years after it first became the midnight movie sensation for the first time in 1979 (I was late, I’ll probably see a new documentary this summer for the first time "Patti Smith"). "The Dream of Life" somewhere in 2040!) And no, the film does not look outdated, and yes, it was worth the wait. This is a very energetic comedy, in which a lot of great music and some amazing moments. He tells the story of Riff Randall, who was admired by PJ. Soules, and the battle that she and her fellow students at Vince Lombardi High are leading against their new repressive director, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary in his book "The Cult Films" quite accurately describes the performance of Maria Voronova as "the evil Eve Arden"). The typical “teenagers versus establishment” storyline here is enhanced by some kind of absurd humor (these exploding mice, this giant mouse, Hansel and Gretel monitors) and some really incendiary tunes. Riff, of course, is the No. 1 fan of this original punk band The Ramones, and this band performs a dozen of his best baker songs throughout the film, including five in a concert, which is a complete blast. Indeed, the sight of Riff furiously dancing "Teenage Lobotomy" in this explosion can be the most fun moment of the picture. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and then making their way along the street singing “I just want to do something” is quite exciting. The film ends with an explosive confrontation, which, I believe, is the wet dream of every high school student. Really fun stuff. By the way, The Ramones was one of the loudest bands I've ever seen at a concert, so I was very pleased to note that the DVD for this film comes with additional English subtitles for people with hearing impairments. I wonder how many old punks found these subtitles necessary ...
