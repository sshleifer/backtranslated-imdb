This movie made me cry at the end! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I've seen lots of great movies, even more shit. But when the scene ended - cathartic in its essence - came, I cried! And if not - you have serious problems! Archetypal history - nothing new or original. But it is real - because this kind of thing really happened and people do exist. Glam is not my music, but I really admire everything that they went through in the early 70s ... At some point, this sent me to the Velvet Goldmine! Precautions never work very well. But this film really made us believe all this ... Because they are not trying to turn it into a way full of glorious concerts, they are superhero musicians, group girls who are stupid and emotionally numb, they do not glorify drugs and alcohol, they contribute rehabilitation and redemption, which comes even 20 years later ... Once again, an excellent film. Since I left Las Vegas, I have never been so touched by the movie.
