I wanted to see Valentine since I saw Denise Richards and Marley Shelton in him, because they played some of my favorite films. When I watched Valentine, I was amazed at how wonderful this storyline was. It kills me when I see that he has a low rating, because he was not at all terrible. Actors and actresses played the role wonderfully, and how it ended was so brilliant and cunning. Some scenes were a bit unbelievable and / or bad, and I admit that in some minor episodes it was a bit boring, but overall it was non-stop interesting and tense. He had a breathtaking storyline that made you guess the whole way, and he doesn't deserve all the crap he gets. I recommend watching this movie at any time, but especially on Valentine's Day, because it will definitely give you a lot of cold. Oh, and do not even pay attention to the trailer OR rating, please DO NOT ...
