Following the comedy series plot is so frivolous that its character simultaneously works both inside and outside the context, and the rest of the cast is an experiment that comedians can really use. Supporting characters base the show in the reality of a comedy series, which provides contextual counterpoint to Sarah’s erroneous person, who, in addition to general insensitivity, does not have specific recurring features on which behavioral expectations are based, which makes her not just a repaint episode if not the scene. Sarah’s ability to see everything from the outside allows her to parody aspects of social behavior that are thin enough to usually go unnoticed. Every time she speaks, it’s like a stand-alone 5-second parody. She overestimates a lot, demonstrating countless things that can mean a smile or a change in vocal height, but she never sticks to one idea long enough for you to feel comfortable and to form expectations that will be met. This may be the most creative, original and experimental TV program in history.
