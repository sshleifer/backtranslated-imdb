As a guy who has seen all seasons, I can say that JG constantly surprises me. I mean, after you saw how he instantly went from laughing to paranoia, and after every little gesture that made you believe that he was a gangster, you thought, “Well, he's a good actor, and he can get in skin gangster, But, seeing how he opens his eyes and fighting for his life, I mean, I almost felt the pain he “made” us to believe that he was going through. I was so touched by his performance that I immediately thought of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely the best in their generations and more. But now they are either old or dead (Brando), and it’s normal that they shoot fewer films and their performances are "easier" than they were before. I can't wait to see Gandolfini in other films where he performs a completely different role. Can you recommend me some of his old films where he gives an unforgettable performance?
