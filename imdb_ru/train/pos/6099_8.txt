I still have a grainy, late night, no cable television, cheap VHS of this show from waaaaaayyyy back when, late night commercials and all that, when I sleep at any strange hour, when they spank this show - just so I could tape it. <br /> <br /> The series was not really about Freddie Kreuger - only the first couple of episodes actually involved him as anything other than the announcer Rod Serling-Esquire. Instead, each episode was a separate nightmare that used the traditional horrible themes of terrible childhood, dating, cannibalism, dating, money, death, dating, and ... hmm ... dating. <br /> <br /> From the episode in which a teenager accidentally says “I will love you forever” to the wrong girl and stuck with her (literally, at least for a moment, they have grown together ...), to the one where the young the flight attendant goes home with a strange man, only to be in his cabin, where he has a trophy room full of other flight attendants, and one that I only vaguely remember, who compared blind dates with ice hockey (and the injuries and fines that accompany it) - dating was definitely the scariest thing in the series. <br /> <br /> In one episode, Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, etc.) was a motivated pizza seller with a new tasty secret ingredient. Not original, but still terribly and fun .... <br /> <br /> Despite this, some episodes were great. My personal favorite was “This is a miserable life,” where a young man was trapped working in his parents' burger when he wanted to go to college. He got stuck talking to himself and arranging small puppet shows with old cheeseburgers - until late at night, when a strange guy walks across the road, and suddenly his life is not the same. No, not Freddie, just a gangster with a gun - it turns out that this whole amazing episode is just the last thoughts that run through the head of a child ... along with the bullet. <br /> <br /> The second half of the same episode (many of the episodes of Freddie's Nightmares were, in fact, two stories with vague connections) followed his girlfriend, who was also injured but not killed during the trip, and which was taken to the “hospital with the hell” - they are squeezed into all the most terrible cliches of hospital nightmares, and then some - from accidentally stitching the mouth - or waking up during the operation - to the point that your dead boyfriend will try to lure you to the morgue to embrace. /> <br /> Again, this was my favorite. <br /> <br /> Some episodes were much dumber, as ALMOST ALL OF THE ONE THAT MADE IN VIDEO. They put the nasty in as a representative of the series, and then no one loves them, thinks that the show is smelly, and then they no longer put on the video. This miserable life is only available on a PAL DVD in England, but I'm still going to buy it.
