Perhaps not the best entry in the series “The House of the Hammer of Terror”, but it will certainly win the award for the most ingeniously titled episode! "House that has bled to death" ?? I could shout out that name all day, without even getting tired of it! And besides the amazing title, this short film also benefits from a well-written script and a handful of really tense moments. This may require additional viewing before you fully understand the peculiar twist, but this is definitely an original idea for a brief horror. The story begins with images of an elderly couple drinking tea in their middle-class home. The husband kills his wife sadistically, and in a few years the “damned” house is still for sale. A young couple and their cherubim daughter approach and begin to restore it, but mysterious events occur, especially affecting young Sophie. Her beloved cat is killed, even when her birthday is destroyed, when one of the pipes at home suddenly splashes blood on the guests (especially the frightening sequence, this one!). Is an old house really frequented? Or maybe all these horrible neighbors are terrifying? The answers to these questions are given in an original and rather unpredictable climax, and even at the very end there is a place for real shock. Tension masterfully increases, and the title house is filled with eerie landscapes, like a pair of rusty machetes, used by her husband to kill his wife. A little warning though, the sequence with the cat is difficult to observe when you are an animal lover. In conclusion, another winner of the short series Hummer!
