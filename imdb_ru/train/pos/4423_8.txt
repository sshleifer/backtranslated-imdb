First, GOJOE needs a little getting used to, but the end result is very pleasing. The story of the murderous samurai, who is trying to redeem himself, speaking against effeminate, but dangerous samurai, is worth more than a watch. Here much is at stake, from physical survival to spiritual salvation. At first, the film may seem a bit like other Samurai-inspired anime films, but it soon ends up delving into more mature / adult territory. <br /> <br /> Don't miss. GOJOE - one of the best films about samurai, which appeared after Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (more detailed review of films and reviews of other foreign films)
