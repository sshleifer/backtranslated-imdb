I think the team of this film did an excellent job with the limitations that they had. just Â£ 300,000 and 7 weeks to write, remove and edit everything that I consider an achievement in itself. Although this film is not for the masses (since a young innocent teenage girl is killed and homoeroticism is involved in the story), I think this film is a heartbreaking tragedy, and the more deeply you are involved in the story, the more sad you feel. all the more to Heaton because of the love he feels, but does not return. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite British films that I really liked, and I would watch it again. I think it is a shame that the film is not well heard at all.
