If I watch a porn movie, I prefer to have some kind of plot and dialogue of descent. The bedroom doors are one of the few that I've come across with these attributes. <br /> <br /> A new neighbor deceives the human nature of the neighbor and his weaknesses in relation to seduction and sex. Chelsea Blue (I mean Brooke LaVelle) is the best actress who plays the role of a blackmailer seductress and plays a great role. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress. The film received 10 points just because it is in it. Her partner in the film, Monique Alexander, a certain cutie. Two need to do more collaboration. In this film, however, Monica, who plays Gigi, does not have much to say or do. This is very bad. She seems to have more talents to share. I like the girl who was the next DA (possibly) wife. I forgot what her name is, but she looks good and a good actress. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to understand what has so excited some people. Obviously, there are parts bought for money. What is good, but she finished? Sorry, but come on! I am afraid that her performance here could have lowered the rating, with the exception of the talent and beauty of Chelsea, who reject any negatives. In general, this film is good.
