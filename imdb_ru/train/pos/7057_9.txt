As an adult, I really enjoyed it. I watched him with my two granddaughters, and he was three and a half years old, he was fascinated, and the 15-month-old chuckled at mice. <br /> <br /> The music is fun, and the animation is great. This sequel does what Return to Neverland failed. A good continuation of the story of Cinderella; but what will become of Drusilla? Another sequel? I hope so!
