Comment? Like my comment is needed? It is a masterpiece of all times, all seasons and all generations. This is the only type of film that I still have the patience to watch. In this, as in other Disney films, there is some kind of magic. All characters are in some way “living” and “real”, so it’s easy to understand the message even if you don’t understand the language (as if I didn’t understand when I first watched the movie because I was about six years old). Maybe my English is not very good, but I learned what I know, mainly from this kind of films, and this is another big dimension of this kind of films that are currently rare. But there is one big shame. In my country it is now impossible to watch this or any other Disney movie! We do not have copyright, so our children can not enjoy and learn from this kind of films. So, we will again watch this movie "Once Upon a Time" or ...?
