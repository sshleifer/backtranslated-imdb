20 of 10 This is a truly wonderful story about the evacuee during the war and the insidious carpenter Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beach) is put up for auction with Tom, and it is immediately clear that he has serious problems when he urinates into bed on the first night. William is illiterate and scared, but somehow both find solace in each other's solitude. It turns out that William has the talent of an artist, and we see Tomâ€™s talent as a choirmaster in the amusing performance of Jerusalem. William befriended Zechariah Ranch, a young Jewish boy from London, and with Tom and Zachariah, he finally learns to read, write and feel part of this small friendly community. As soon as he calms down, his mother recalled William back to London, and it is here that we see why he was so screwed up. His mother is clearly mentally ill, and when Tom does not hear from William, he goes to London to find him. Finally, he finds that he is holding his dead little sister, where he was bound in the basement. After a period in the hospital, Tom realizes that he must kidnap him and take him home with him. The climax is a bitter-sweet end, when William is told that he must be adopted by Tom, at the same time, having learned that his best friend Zechariah was killed during an air raid in London. For me, one of the most touching scenes was when Tom was talking to an official from the Ministry of the Interior. <br /> <br /> I love him, because it's worth it, I think he loves me too. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't get better, what does it do?
