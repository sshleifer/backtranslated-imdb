I, like many horror fans, have been force-fed on the same trite big budget Hollywood remakes and jokes from MTV High School over the past 20 years. Here, finally, is the original horror film in the horror genre, in which all the correct frames are marked. <br /> <br /> You need a hot actress, vampires, cool weapons, cool cars and blood. A lot of this, despite the load, you got it. <br /> <br /> With the excellent choreography of the battle and the supporting role of the queen of the screams Hummer. <br /> <br /> Despite the small budget, choosing a 35mm blank and adding quality computer graphics effects to the composition, director James Eves created something much more. <br /> <br /> A must for horror old school fans.
