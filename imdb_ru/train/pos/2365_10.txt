Jeff Wincott is not only Hank, he can kick ass! In this film, some of the best martial arts that I have seen in a very long time. So, perhaps Bridget Nilsson is not the first person I hire to be the ruthless politician, however, she did a GREAT job! And let's not forget that Wincott has a partner in this film, played by martial arts expert / stuntman Karen Shepherd. So she is not Cynthia Rothrock, who cares ?! She is just as good, if not BETTER! (just watch her fight scene at the end of the film, in one word: OH!). My suggestion would be to buy this film as soon as possible, because if you havenâ€™t seen it yet, you really are missing out on some great martial art.
