Woman in Black (1989) is a television adaptation of the modern classic ghost story of Susan Hill, published just a few years before the film was made. Unfortunately, this film was not released on DVD, and as far as I know, it was removed on VHS. Its availability is the exact opposite of its popularity among those who know about horror movies. The story revolves around events in the seaside community at the beginning of the 20th century, when its firm sent a young lawyer to complete the affairs of a recently deceased widow who died in her isolated marsh estate. What he considered a chore, and probably a tedious task, turns into a nightmare when he discovers that the old woman has pursued her to death and that the ghosts of her past are not satisfied with the rest. The story is told in a subtle, but concise manner, never being self-indulgent, catchy, or excessive exposure. Obviously, a limited budget may have contributed to the nonsense approach, but this is exactly what history needs and why it works so well. This is what you do not see what scares. Having said that, there is one particularly horrifying scene that relies on the visual, and it works to perfection. I watched this movie during the day and it still gave me nightmares almost a week later. If you like to be terrified, do whatever you need to get and see a copy of The Woman In Black.
