This film caused tears in my eyes; John Roberts really knew how to get to the heart of the audience, directing this wonderful picture, where life is viewed by Paulie’s eyes and heart. From time to time we discover, with the help of sensitive and talented directors like John, that even small creatures like Paulie have a heart. I just could not stop the tears, although the film has a happy ending. It's great, after the thousands of films I've seen in my life, “Poly” really touched me deeply. This, after The Ugly Duckling, is the second picture that really turned me upside down.
