Since both musicals are out of fashion and incredibly expensive to create without all the talent needed to create a contract contract with the studio, I doubt that we will ever get a real story about Enrico Caruso. <br /> <br /> But if everything else was in place, then it was not by chance that no Hollywood studio attempted to perform this task until Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer signed a contract with Mario Lanza. No one else could do this, I doubt that it will ever be repeated. <br /> <br /> And why do it. I think that Enrico Caruso himself would be satisfied with the way his singing was portrayed on the screen. Because his tenor was his life, his reason for being on earth. <br /> <br /> To say that freedom took his life is to be modest. Caruso, like the man who portrayed him, was a man with a big appetite, albeit with a much greater self-discipline. He had multiple relationships with several women and had two illegitimate sons who are not in this film. <br /> <br /> His contribution to the record industry is perceived as an afterthought. He is shown in a recording studio at the end of his life. In fact, he began recording music around the turn of the last century, and together with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA, Victor made the recording industry what it became. <br /> <br /> When Caruso and McCormack reached their heights, you almost had to inherit a ticket in order to see any of them perform live. But many immigrant Italian and Irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of these men. That is why both have become the legends they are. <br /> <br /> In the film there are several beautifully staged opera arias performed by Mario Lanza, a taste of what he could become if he disciplined Caruso. stick to the opera. The Great Caruso received an Oscar for recording and received nominations for costume and set design. <br /> <br /> Mario himself helped popularize the movie with the RCA Red Seal album with the songs of “The Great Caruso”. Unfortunately, due to contractual obligations, we could not get a real acting album with Ann Blythe, Dorothy Kirsten and Jarmil Novotnaya. <br /> <br /> Although Blyth sang it in the film, Lanzi had a hit record with great success. Beautiful Night of the Year even more contributes to the popularization of the Great Caruso. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the life of Enrico Caruso, it is not. If you are looking for a great artist, singing in the midst of his career, then you should not miss The Great Caruso.
