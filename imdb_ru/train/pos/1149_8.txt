A quick and funny satire about that original reality TV show, the soap opera. The script of the playwright Robert Harling is filled with some inserts and ridiculous situations. The best of these is the climax, the live broadcast, which quickly turns into poor improvisation and brain transplantation. The killing of his lines by Keven Cline due to not wearing glasses is ridiculous. "Her brain will be explored in the next few houses." The brilliant cast is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shu, Katie Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Harry Marshall and Katie Najimi are all fine. Pleasure to see the click of the actors, as in this film. This is a classic that somehow slipped through the cracks. <br /> <br /> P.S. Alan Silvestri's account is an added bonus. It fits the soap opera with its bright and melodramatic air.
