I was curious to find out how critics reacted to this inspiring film, so I went to Rotten Tomatoes and was horrified to find that a pompous peanut gallery, which is a film critic of our country, gave the film an average of 43% (or Rotten). ) rating. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if this film does not touch you, you have no heart. (It is interesting to note that the same film on the same site received a 74% rating from the audience.) <br /> <br /> It’s not that the opinion of critics was so important to me. In the end, I can't think of a more worthless, overpaid profession. Some schmuck pay for going to the movies (what a hard life) and doing the same thing that everyone else on the planet does: form an opinion. But these boobies have a way to face the fact that their opinion is somehow more important than yours, and, even worse, they love to hate. <br /> <br /> I admit that this film is old-fashioned (well, except for f-bombs), syrupy and a bit predictable ... after all, you know from the very beginning that Cuba Gooding Jr., depicting a hero Karl Braschier’s Navy will triumph (at the end) at every step simply by the way it comes across: resolute and courageous; strong-willed and optimistic. <br /> <br /> But his performance and the performance of De Niro (like Billy Sunday, the composite character of several real people) is so strong, so inspiring that you will welcome many scenes of the film on your feet, especially the culmination of the courtroom. You have to be a real stick in the mud to avoid these scenes. Like film critics of our country. Michael Rappoport is superb, as well as a good-natured, stuttering student who is friends with Goods Brashear. If someone saw "Higher Education", this character completely redeems him. <br /> <br /> In any case, this confirms what I have always felt: do not listen to critics. Watch this movie and get inspired.
