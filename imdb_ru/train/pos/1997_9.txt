As a lifelong admirer of Dickens, I have always been disappointed by the adaptation of his novels. <br /> <br /> Although his work was an extremely accurate retelling of human life at all levels in Victorian Britain, throughout their entire thread of humor, which can be both playful and sarcastic, as dictated by the narrative. In a sense, he was a literary cartoonist and cartoonist. He can be serious and ridiculous in one sentence. He stabbed pride, let out arrogance, praised modesty and sympathized with loneliness and poverty. This may be a cliché, but he was a national writer. <br /> <br /> And this comedy is so often absent in its interpretations. At the time of the writing of the film, Oliver Twist is being dramatized on the BBC television series. All suffering and cruelty belong to them, but not to humor, irony and wild infantry. The result was a dark, gloomy experience: the story was written by a journalist, not a writer. This is not Dickens at all. <br /> <br /> “Oliver!”, on the other hand, is much closer to the goal. The mockery of bureaucracy is beautifully interpreted, from a seething biddle to a drunken magistrate. The classic confrontation between beadle and Mr. Brownlow, in which the law is described as “an ass, an idiot,” could not be better. Harry Secombe is the perfect choice. <br /> <br /> But here there is dazzling cruelty, and the soulless indifference of the state, and cold, and hunger, and poverty, and loneliness. . <br /> <br /> And then there's the crime. Ron Moody is a treasure, like a vile Jewish fence, while Oliver Reed brings Bill Sykes to perfection. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps not surprising that Lionel Barth - himself a Jew from the London East End - takes on the courage with Fagin. rethink him as a much kinder guy than the original Dicken. In the novel, he was completely ruthless, sending some of his boys to the gallows to protect themselves (although he was also caught and hanged). Considering that in the film he is presented as something like the wayward figure of a father, a kind of merciful thief, not corrupting children, the latter is a long-standing anti-Semitic mood. Otherwise, very few liberties are taken with the original Dickens. All the most memorable items included. Enough threat and violence is enough to ensure the loyalty of the story and at the same time take into account the feelings of the children. Nancy is still beaten to death, Bullseye can barely escape drowning, and Bill Sykes will get a truly graphic animation. <br /> <br /> Each song is gorgeous, although it leans towards Schmalz. Mark Lester imitates him wonderfully. Both his and my favorite scene is the one in which the world comes to life for “who buys”. This is schmuck, but this is Dickens to the end. <br /> <br /> I could go on. I could praise the beautiful scenery, the contrast of the rich and the poor. In high-quality acting, there are more British regulars than you could shake with a stick. <br /> <br /> I have to give her 10 points, but today I feel more like Scrooge. Soak it up with your Christmas dinner. None of the original was better implemented.
