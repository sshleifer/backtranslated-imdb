A fascinating, wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent Martin Scorsese. Many of the films he talks about are easily correlated with his works, especially early ones, the era of silence. Very pleasant, albeit a bit long, I found this one of the best documentaries at the moment. A must see if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work.
