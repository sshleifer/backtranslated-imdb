The main problem of the first film "Vampires" is that none of the characters showed sympathy. Carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a handsome vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. The female vampire Una is undoubtedly the coolest vampire since the “Deacon of Frost” Blade. Unfortunately, although there are some good concepts, such as a cool scene in a slow-motion restaurant (why didn't Carpenter use this anymore?), This film is not as good as it could be. I expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one longer, beautifully staged episode of the battle (for example, inside the city), and was somewhat disappointed. While “Los Muertos” is going faster than its predecessor, in some places it still stretches a bit (although not as bad as in “Vampires”). As in the case of “Vampires”, the climax of this film is not very intense at the end. <br /> <br /> Most of the above may seem like “Los Muertos” is a bad movie, but this is definitely not the case. As a rule, it is pleasant and is among the best entries in the genre. This is not the original remake of Dracula (like almost any other vampire film), and it’s not an unreasonable action movie like Blade II. He could just use a little more excitement. <br /> <br /> I would really like to see the third installment made by Carpenter, but this probably will not happen. <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILER ending was too predictable. Una had to run away - that would make the film rather unusual.
