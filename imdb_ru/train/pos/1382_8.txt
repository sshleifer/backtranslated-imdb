Not everything is said in this beautiful first function of Celine Skiamma. Friendship, “desire to fit in”, first sexual feelings ... All this and much more is sublimated in scenes of underwater synchronized swimming. <br /> <br /> All three girls in the film try to find and express their personality in a completely different way. This is a much less cruel approach to understanding adolescence compared to, say, Thirteen, but, nevertheless, this is a very worthwhile journey. <br /> <br /> Be sure to take a look, and please leave all American cinematic biases at the door. By the way, the soundtrack is A +. <br /> <br /> Enjoy your viewing!
