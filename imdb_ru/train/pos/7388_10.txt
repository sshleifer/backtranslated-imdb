The 74th Oscar was very good. Whoopie's job as EmCee was very fun and easy. I personally loved her last appearance, which received some cold feedback due to rude expressions and obscene jokes, but this is normal. The audience seemed to like it. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen and Sidney Poitier made this TV show with Oscar as a souvenir. <br /> <br />
