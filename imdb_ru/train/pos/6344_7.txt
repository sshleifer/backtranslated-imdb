I am amazed at the work of Jim Carrey. I keep getting this movie stuck in my head. Grinch likes Martha May, Cindy Lou (who is very annoying; her sweet innocence), who tries to get Grinch in the spirit of Christmas, Grinchâ€™s childhood (very funny!), And, moreover, a weak obvious ending with Christmas is all about gifts. I have to say that I felt stupid when leaving the theater with a bunch of babies and toddlers laughing and so on, but this film was a good full-length adaptation of Dr. Suze and IS for short films for all ages.
