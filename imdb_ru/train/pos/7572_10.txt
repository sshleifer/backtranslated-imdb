I just can not believe that these games can get much better, but they do. Unfortunately, I had to rent a dreamcast to play, but despite this, I can't wait to buy it for PS2. This is the only series of games in which I must own all of them, even if I beat them many times. I hope that they will never stop doing this type of game, even if the series should end. <br /> <br />
