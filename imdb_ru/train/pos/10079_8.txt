I enjoyed the cinematic holidays in China in the 1930s in this beautiful film. The story is simple. An elderly man wants to transfer his art to a young man, although he has no living children. The faces of the actors are amazing to see. The story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well, and their desire to be treated well. The operas in the film remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more complex and confusing. This story reminds me of the story of Dickens about the days when children almost did not communicate. The plot is a bit predictable and too sentimental for me, but worth it to look at heroism, humanity and history.
