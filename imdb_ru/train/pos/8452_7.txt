Heavy-Duty Mobile Costumes That Can Destroy Entire Armies - Check! Weapons that hardly need to be targeted and still destroy - check! Angels-based mobile costumes - check! <br /> <br /> OK is a Gundam series. In this, Gundam Wing, there is a good character development, complexity in the real world, interesting ideas and pleasant icing. <br /> <br /> With characters, initially weak Relena Dorlan (later Peacecraft, then back to Dorlan) becomes stronger and more independent (although Hero Yu, the main character of the series, is still completely woozy). The aforementioned Heero, originally a cold, tough butcher, is becoming more and more humane, still remaining in character. And the vision of the lost Millardo Peacecraft (whose name is Zechs Marquise) between the OZ, the freelancer and the command of White Fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their creations. <br /> <br /> The complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good, which reflects the real world. However, in 49 half-hour episodes, this becomes a kind of responsibility, since this complexity is not fully utilized. <br /> <br /> The ideas behind the series - the need to struggle, the desire for peace, etc. - those that resonate even today. Looking back, the series was ahead of its time, with regard to the “War on Terrorism” and all that. But his exploration of these ideas, especially the Treze Kushrenade monologues, is an incredible dramatic work that is one of the best works in the series. <br /> <br /> But sometimes a good composition is sometimes very bad. that dramatically causes it to lose some of its edge. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of eye candy, which this one has in buckets, everything from mobile suits to Libra battleship (No, you are not tampons, idiot!) is well designed, and explodes with large orange balls (which is bad, because the best animation would have the best explosions). But who cares? The material explodes, and that's all that matters. In short, the very complexity of the series means that if you miss a few episodes, you missed a lot. A bad letter can cause you to cringe, and sometimes the animation makes you say "WTF?!?!" But this is complemented by his classic animated style, scale, sparks of incredible dialogue and more mature research that can be expected from such Japanese animations.
