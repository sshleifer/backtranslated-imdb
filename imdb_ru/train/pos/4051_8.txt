Eric Rohmer "Lady and Duke". could use better translation for title. "The Englishwoman and the Duke", perhaps, would be more accurate. Although it is obvious that this film is not for everyone, judging by the comments on this forum, it is worth seeing, because, despite the complex picture of the story, Mr. Romer created a film that could be seen as an art exhibition in a museum. The mixed technology used in the film ultimately works well. <br /> <br /> The strange story of Grace Elliott, a noble lady who was the mistress of the King of England and the French Duke of Orleans, holds our attention The scene of action is Paris in the days following the French Revolution. The country was in turmoil, and power was in the hands of people who didn't give a damn about aristocrats. The pictures show how agitators run with the heads of famous people immediately after a trip to the guillotine. <br /> <br /> The gracious bond with the duke is over, but she remains a faithful friend of a great man who is in danger of losing his head. Grace passes through all the horrors around her, not being able to escape. She even has an enemy in her own house, in the form of a cook, Pulcheri, who would not hesitate to condemn her at the slightest provocation. <br /> <br /> Sometimes watching the movie gives the viewer the impression that you are going on a trip to the Louvre, watching these huge canvases that depict this crucial era of French history. Instead of finding the digitization process distracting, we found that it improves the film in many ways. <br /> <br /> Lucy Russell, like Grace Elliott, copes with the image of this woman, who saw a lot in life. It seems that she speaks excellent French, as she speaks it fluently. As Duke of Orleans, Jean-Claude Dreyfus made a fantastic contribution by making us believe that he was a nobleman himself without any effort. The cast was also great. As an ensemble, Mr. Romer gets great performances around the world. <br /> <br /> For lovers of history, “The Lady and the Duke” will be an interesting film that is worth seeing thanks to the vision of Eric Rohmer.
