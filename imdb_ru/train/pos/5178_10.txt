Before the "Tuscan sky" I saw the gentle performance of Diane Lane in this film. Tourists are invited to the camp of their youth and experience it as adults. It seems that each of those who return, looking for something lost, which makes it so realistic. You might have had to be a camper to really get it, but according to one character who noticed that all her clothes were wet, “this is so camp!” From practical jokes and battles for guys to scary dining lady and early morning call ... this is an amplifier. Once exciting events now seem mundane. Awesome cast makes the best of one-dimensional roles and makes them believable. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Mrs. Brad Paisley (probably when he first fell in love with her !!) You can pull over and over again like searching for an old friend.
