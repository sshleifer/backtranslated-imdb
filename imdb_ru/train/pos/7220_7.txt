There is nothing more pleasant for me than a story about who the hell is or the suspense that makes you guess how it will end. And this is exactly what happens in DEATHTRAP, based on the play of Ira Levin (Rosemary's Baby). <br /> <br /> In it, Michael Kane and Christopher Reeve do the trick that Kane and In this extraordinarily clever game Lawrence Olivier performed himself in SLEUTH - with the same skill and many puzzles that have ever existed. <br /> <br /> But because it should scare you, surprise you and guess As for the result, it is difficult to write a review about the plot. Let's just say that what we know at the beginning is all you need to know about the movie at the moment. Michael Caine is a madly jealous playwright whose last play failed miserably. When the young novice writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sends him the manuscript of his play, Kane realizes that passing it on as his own will solve all his problems and return his reputation. <br /> <br /> From this point on, this is fun and games for the audience, as Ira Levinaâ€™s story unfolds, she manages to surpass Agatha Christie in the number of turns. <br /> <br /> Kane and Reeve play brilliantly with each other, each of which introduces a certain dynamic tension to the plot, as well as some humorous touches that come from the script that connects the drama with humor. <br /> <br /> Summing up: worth a look - but not everyone is happy with the final.
