I bring only one apology for this film: too many, too many widescreen close-ups, and if they annoy you to the limit, fair enough. They drove me trembling for the first ten minutes or so. But after that, I made some kind of truce with terrible cinematography; and long before the end of the movie I stopped worrying. This is too rich comedy to destroy it so easily. This fun, witty, comic transfer of ALL actors is impeccable, and no matter how much Asher would look at his characters through cold fish eye lenses - he may not care about them - he manages to give them warmth. "Mystery Men", in fact, is not only funnier, not only smarter, but also deeper than anyone, apparently, thinks so. For example, the jokes in the films of Austin Powers, as well as the fact that they are less funny than the jokes here, are also much more toothless. The Satire of "Mysterious People" bites when there is something worth biting, and gently nibbles when it is not. It does not mock any old thing. That is why, despite the fact that some (I should consider them unobservable) critics, never end with ideas. <br /> <br /> Superheroes are an attractive group. Of course, they are second-rate, but they are not just second-rate. The Blue Raja, for example, does nothing except throwing cutlery at people, and he is not very good at it. On the other hand, he is also not comically bad. He is better in his limited field than most people, and he diligently practices. He is not a clown, which makes him a more funny character than he would have been. If Superman is Christ in the Cape, then Secret People are all secondary demigods at the foot of Mount Olympus, in capes. Much funnier; also much sweeter.
