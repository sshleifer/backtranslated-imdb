Usually I don’t have to write a review of a film, but for now the only comment on this film is rather unfair, so I consider it necessary to share my point of view. <br /> <br /> “Krisana” (or as it was called in the theater, I saw it, “Fallen”) follows Matisse, a lonely Latvian archivist, when he tries to find out about a woman he did not try to stop by jumping from the bridge as well as its reasons for this. This is a story in two words, but this film is not related to the story, but tells about the guilt of a person who could not act. As the detective who investigates the incident tells him, we usually don’t care about the anonymous people we see every day until they die. <br /> <br /> Comparison with Michaelango Antonioni and his "Blowup" Most likely, in any review you read about "Krisana" The influence of Antonioni’s philosophical and strict style and the history of “Blowup” are obvious, and in fact the writer director Fred Kelemen makes an obvious reference to this film in scenes in which Matisse is trying to recognize a woman who jumped off of Bridge, or at least who, in his opinion, did it. <br /> <br /> The only other person who shares his views on the film distracts the gaze and the sound of the film "College of the Cinematic Class." He or she ignores the budgetary constraints that the existentialist Latvian film most likely faces, but atmospheric black-and-white cinematography and ambient sound succeed on an artistic level to portray Matisse’s loneliness. The background sound of wind and street noise creates an ominous aura and resembles one of Fellini’s films, regardless of whether this was Kelemen’s intention. The filmmakers certainly had little money, but this restriction was used in the interests of the film. <br /> <br /> “Krisana” succeeds as a character study with enough humor so that it is not too serious. He could easily fall into the trap of a mysterious story, but avoids it and becomes an intellectual film about solitude and guilt. If you are more interested in the plot, this film and its end can upset you. Otherwise, take the time to get involved in it. It is worth looking for.
