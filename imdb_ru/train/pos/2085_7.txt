"Good Land" Sidney Franklin has achieved a classic status due to timeless history and an excellent game, especially from Louis Ranier, who received the Oscar for the image of O-Lana. Rainers' performance is so perfect that it is almost impossible to recognize. With very few conversations throughout the film (and itâ€™s a long one), Rainer relies on face and body language instead. She looks and behaves in Chinese so that anyone who is not familiar with her work can easily be mistaken in her as such. <br /> <br /> The film remains relevant today, because it tells the story of rags to riches and the universal themes that are associated with it, When Lung and his wife O-Lan finally achieved financial success after many years of hunger and poverty, they find a life full of property, but devoid of meaning. Only when they return to the earth after fighting a swarm of locusts (the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to observe), they again find satisfaction. The general formula, told from the unique point of view of the Chinese family (especially in 1937), makes the film a classic. Money without friends and family costs nothing, and in the last 10 minutes the film shows itself perfectly home with an emotionally concluding conclusion.
