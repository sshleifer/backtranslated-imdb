“The man with the gun” is largely forgotten now, but caused a small storm of interest in the media in 1955, when Robert Mitchum abandoned Jett Rink in “Giant” (which was actually written for him and which was subsequently substantially reworked) and intentions Charles Lawton's version of The Naked and the Dead to do it instead. Despite some obvious production problems and some harsh lighting that Mitch and Ian Sterling sometimes make unflattering tones, this is a terrific dark western that more than compares with his earlier Blood on the Moon when his “urban tamer” starts working on a city that never had the opportunity to grow up before the local villain ran away, and then it turned out to be possible ?? to be almost as bad as the people he sends. Of course, his way of dealing with the news of death in the family? burn the parlor on the ground and push his manager to try to kill him ?? does not inspire much confidence in its stability. Along with a good script and a surprisingly good supporting turn from the usually annoying, but Henry Hull played well here, he also boasts an amazingly good early Alex Alex score, which even includes an early workout for one of his tormenting emotional cues that later appear in Spartacus.
