This film was very good. If you like to watch horror movies, I recommend it. The game was very good, although I thought that the actress playing Julia could have more emotions behind her lines. Allan was very good, and I thought the cinematography was amazing. I was on the edge of my seat all the time while my friends were worried and screaming. In my opinion, it was a complete success, and he had to go on the big screen. I give him two thumbs up! I would definitely say that if you have not seen it, then go rent it. If you saw it and did not like it, then go and look at it again, because there are parts that were completely unreal. I also liked how much of the film was shot around and on my schoolâ€™s campus.
