This film has raised me beyond recognition, it is and will remain my favorite film of all time, mainly because almost all the emotions met its 157 minutes. What is most difficult for me is that when I want to hear amazing music and songs from a movie, I have to insert it into my DVD player, so I was wondering if anyone knows who sings the songs in the movie? and where they can be found, as I have searched everywhere, I can think from time to time for the last 5 years. My favorite quote from the film is when a lawyer in court says: “But your own words require direct confrontation, isn't this a direct call for violence?” Biko replies: “Well, you and I are in confrontation now, but I don't see violence! »<br /> <br /> Craig Robertson Fife, Scotland
