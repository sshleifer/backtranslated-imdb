I have some DVDs until I just don't need to go out and buy it. It was one of those films. Like many here, I remember seeing it as a child and I loved it. I never knew that scenes and musical numbers were cut out, so I was intrigued to see what they could be. I agree that the Portabellow Road sequence is now a bit long (as is the game of football), but other than that, I found no doubt about the remaining scenes that were returned to their respectful place. Perhaps Disney should have had the original version (that is, the restored version) on the same side as the restored version on the back, then people could choose what they wanted to see. In general, this is still an entertaining film that still manages to bring back some of my childhood memories.
