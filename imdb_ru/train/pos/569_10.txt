A true story of two brothers fly fishing, Norman and Paul (Brad Pitt and Craig Scheffer), whose reverend father (Tom Skerritt) is a strict man, whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing, for him and his sons have a fine line between them. This story describes the slow development of the life of the brothers and how their life is divided into two different ways. This is a touching film, directed by Robert Redford. He plays the elderly Norman and reflects on long past times and long dead people. <br /> <br /> The film repeats certain topics such as memory, death, eternity, and dreams. Most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero Paul. He is capable, charming and courageous man, but has his own fatal flaws. <br /> <br /> The final lines summarize the “points” of the film: “Then in the arctic twilight of the canyon, the whole existence disappears into being with my soul, memories, sounds of the Great Blackfoot River, the rhythm of four graphs and the hope that the fish will increase. In the end, all things merge into one, and the river flows through it. The river was carved by the strongest flood in the world and flows over the rocks from the basement of time. On some of these rocks are eternal raindrops. Under the rocks - the words, and some - them. I am haunted by the waters. "
