From the very beginning of the show, Carmen was there. She was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of her ?! The show is not the same as before. Even worse. <br /> <br /> The best episodes were with Carmen in them. You can not replace someone from the beginning! It's like South Park without Kyle or Kids game without Chucky! It is not right! Niece, who replaced her, just, ugh! Awful. It does not fit into the storyline at all. She was one of the main characters, and the niece could not replace her. She was a terrific actress. Much better than niece. Return it, otherwise you will lose a ton of viewers.
