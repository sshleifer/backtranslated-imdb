Halloween is one of the best examples of independent cinema. It is very well made and has more psychological elements than you can imagine at first glance. This is a simple film, narrated very well. The music is beautiful and is one of the most intrusive points ... If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should check it out. All the actors are amazing. I would like them to never do a sequel after a sequel. The first was certainly the best and should have ended, as without a sequel. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. It seems that she is not aging (today she is just as gorgeous, without hairstyle and clothes of the seventies). Scenes through the mask - one of the worst things in history!
