As a man against football, I (at first glance) reluctantly took my younger brother to watch this film, although in secret I hoped that this could be East - this is East II. The trailers looked funny, so I decided to try. <br /> <br /> It took about ten minutes, but after that I was glued to the screen, and it had nothing to do with cramps in my neck. caused by sitting too close to the front due to a crowded hall. The acting was fresh and vibrant, the characters were attractive, and the jokes were really funny. The whole room laughed every minute or so. A football fan or not a football fan, sport has become irrelevant to the basic principles of love, friendship, family, independence and rivalry. Add a touch of Sikh culture, and you get a formula for the best British comedy that I have seen in a long time, I dare say that it is better than the East - this is East. <br /> <br /> This film is thrilled at a pleasant pace, never stopping at anything more than necessary, and not leaving anything unfinished, entertaining the viewer to entertain and mentally engage. Although it is not a characteristic film in which they spin and unfold, there are some pleasant surprises along the way, and not everything is as you expect. <br /> <br /> Having said this, there were elements of predictability, but they were exploited satirically more than is used as script fillers. I suppose, depending on your inclination towards happy ends, you may either be delighted / disappointed towards the end. Personally, if there was any other result, I would write a strictly worded letter to the authors of the script. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I would have to say that Juliet Stevenson (Paula) played the best part. I never knew that such people existed, but her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts convinced me that they were possible! The prize for the most inconclusive (main characters) goes, unfortunately, to Keira Knightley (Jules), but don't get me wrong, even she offered a great performance, just someone should be the last of the best and regret Kiera, this time you. <br /> <br /> Advice: do not leave before the credits. As soon as the light came on again, I realized with horror that perhaps I should not have watched this movie at all. My favorite, but forgotten Ice Junkie, melted into sweet blue juice. Oh, what I am saying is that it was absolutely brilliant and I cannot recommend it enough. I will definitely buy it when it comes out, and add it to my collection of 3 videos. I am a student. I just splash it out if it's really worth it.
