This magnificently elastic melodrama presents Douglas Sirk at his highest voltage. He avoids the soft thoughtfulness of “All That Allows Heaven” and the sad sentimentality of “Imitation of Life” and instead goes to a feverish anxiety and overheated tension. And, of course, all this is imprinted in the bright Technicolor. <br /> <br /> The cornball story is about the friendship between Rock Hudson and Robert Stack, who becomes a rival when Hudson loses affection to Lauren Bacall, but who really cares about history? Dorothy Malone won the Best Supporting Actress Award for her excellent performance as Stack's sister, who takes the family business into her own hands when no one else does. The culmination of the film is that this energetic wild child begins to dance wildly in his bedroom, unable to withstand the restrictions imposed on her due to the propriety of the middle class. As often happens in Sirk films, the scene is unintentionally ridiculous and absurd, but still moves in a strange way with its effectiveness. <br /> <br /> Sirk, like no one else, approached the transformation of a pure camp into high art, satisfying ordinary people and high eyebrows at the same time in the same films. He was a unique talent, and I do not know that since then there was still a director like him. <br /> <br /> Rating: A-
