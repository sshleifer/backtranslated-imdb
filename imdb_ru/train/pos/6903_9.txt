This little value film is one of my favorites. I can watch it again and again. Dreyfus and Braga workshops, but Raul Julia steals the show! Crafty, menacingly humorous Gomez Addams, with the right sound for this disrespectful parody of this often told story. <br /> <br /> Lunar Parador, without exaggeration and underestimated, allows you to test reality and join the fun on the screen. Two thumbs up!
