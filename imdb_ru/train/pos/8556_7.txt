This film is very funny. I have nothing to do with the original “American Pie,” but it's interesting to watch it. <br /> <br /> Another attempt, but better than in Camp Gangs and the Naked Mile, at least funnier. <br /> After the first five minutes, I was laughing at my ass, so I decided to call my friend, and we would watch him together. We had some beer and we had fun. <br /> <br /> In this film you will not find a deep message, but it is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> So sit back and just enjoy.
