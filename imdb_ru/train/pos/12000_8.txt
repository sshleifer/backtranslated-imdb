I think the film is educational. However, it cannot solve the problem that caused so many disputes: polygamy. In addition, the film does not reveal what the LDS church supports. A great opportunity was missed to tell the world what they really believed. I could not get a clear idea of ​​what the SPD views are about the central themes of religion. <br /> <br /> I have many LDS friends, and they are good people. It would be nice to have a clearer picture of how they look at the more contradictory statements of their prophet. Perhaps these statements are too controversial to be viewed in film format, but it would be great to hear the whole story of the really interesting life of Joseph Smith. In the end, it gives an insight into American thought about religion in the 18th century. Hopefully they are making documentaries on this exciting topic, allowing historians to comment on Smith’s life. Maybe someday we will have a Mormon president. After all, Smith ran for president.
