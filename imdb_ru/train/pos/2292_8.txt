Just watched this early Bugs Bunny (it was first named here) and Elmer Fudd’s cartoon in ThadBlog via a link from YouTube. It was the first time that Chuck Jones led the “abusive mind,” and as a result, Mel Blank gave Bugs a different voice than the one we are familiar with in Brooklyn / Bronx. In fact, according to Ted, he directs Jimmy Stewart (his shy-boy type personality of the time). In any case, after Elmer buys his pet, Bugs takes offense at him, turning the radio very loud, pretending to die after his master repeatedly throws him out of the shower, and saying: “Turn those lights off!” time Elmer catches him in his bed. Even with a different voice, Bugs is definitely his mischievous character, and I was always laughing at myself! According to Ted, at the end of Elmer there was another scene in which he simply gave Bugs a house after the hellish path he went through, but it was probably considered too sad because at that moment he had a mental breakdown that the exact same scene is lost. Anyway, I highly recommend Rabbit Elmer.
