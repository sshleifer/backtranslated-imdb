Bourne Ultimatum Review (2007): After an exciting set of two, we get the latest installment. Here is my opinion: <br /> <br /> Born's ultimatum has it all. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the coat of those who know everything. He ran too long. This time it's over. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum is distinguished by a magnificent plot, stunning writing, fantastic direction, tension and some of the best events of the summer. Matt Damon may have the best performance to date. He has the conviction and increasing desire of a restless killer. <br /> <br /> There is some kind of intelligent humor and some good expectation. Reaction to certain events will make you laugh (in a good sense of the word) or cheer you up. (or both) I heard a lot of clever laughter in the theater and a lot of pops. The audience really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Bourna Ultimatum offers everything in a beautiful gift box. All goods, and then some. This, in my opinion, the best film of this summer. <br /> <br /> Last word: excellent conclusion. The best of the trilogy. This is how summer movies should be made. I love the Born trilogy.
