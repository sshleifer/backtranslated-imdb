Tommy Jones and Matt Dillon are proud of the game world. Different wrist moves needed to be learned, since throwing the dice is a skill in itself. <br /> <br /> There are several surprises. As cynically as we are today, I fully expected that the “good girl” would cry over his grave, not his boyfriend. Especially with her remarks about “her best friend's funeral march” when she first meets Matt. And then, of course, you expect Matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in Mr. Allen's face, blinding him (the interesting role of Bruce Dern). WRRROOONNNNGGG !!! Some of the other Hollywood endings do happen, but the script is so excellent, the acting skills are so carefully thought out that you are not thrilled. <br /> <br /> And music outside of this world. Returning us to the 50s, when our “family hobbies” were first revealed by the music of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley. Even a little racism pierced his ugly head in Chicago, but in a club called “Biloxi” with the amazing Confederation flag in support of racist statements. I will watch it again just to hear the music. Good thing I have a FACTOTUM soundtrack, so I can listen to it in the car. See both together, and you will see how Matt matured .... playing bar characters in both. Now that he owns a bar at Paramount HOtel in New York, he probably has a great opportunity to learn. A great actor who just comes into his own. He shows subtle nuances ... good and bad in his characters. His "young boy from the farm" is an excellent study, especially shrill because of his eyes, a basset hound. He also makes love, convincingly. Since he was in several films with Diane Lane as a teenager, I wonder how it is ... making love to an actress with whom you sort of grew up. Adds a conviction, I will say it.
