I have to say, I thought I saw it all. I am an extremely exhausted movie lover. This film has by no means shocked me. I have gone far this moment. But this led me to certain emotional places where I did not know that I could go. I had no idea that I could ever find (ick) the idea of ​​eroticism of the beast. Never Never. Ever Ever But here you are. He did it. I have to give credit to the director. He took it off. <br /> <br /> The first 40 minutes of this film - TOTAL. We will start with some very explicit videos of two horses having sex. After five minutes of this, I began to wonder if the purchase of this film was a mistake. Then an old man in a wheelchair is talking to some other old man about how two people marry. Then some nervous guy shaves. Then we see (briefly) a hot chick wearing a butler (but this is very brief). At this point, I cursed the movie out loud, trying not to fall asleep. In fact, I fell asleep at about the 40-minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next night. <br /> <br /> We finally got some good things when a girl (who knows who she is or who is in this film) dreams of a Victorian era, ravaged by a monster in the forest. The scene has been going on for quite a while and is actually the meat (hehe) of the whole deal. It is beautifully filmed, superbly edited, and really delivers the goods. They try to complete the plot at the end, and it makes sense, but in some ways it also does not make sense. Well. I definitely recommend this movie. The first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself (and my TV), but the last 50 minutes completely bought it out.
