It was an extremely good historical drama. John Turturro is superb as the tormented genius Luzhin and brilliantly depicts the character's manic effects, such as his strange dance. Emily Watson perfectly copes with the role of Natalia's supporting mistress. <br /> <br /> Gorris and intimate madnesses are well-versed in the relationship between chess and near madmen, such as “eternal innocence” (that is, “Lolita”) are evident in this film. I think now I will continue to read the novel. It was a touching and tragic finale, and it was difficult to keep a dry eye. Brilliant movie!
