Like others on this forum, when the Forbidden Planet was proposed in 1956, I hurried to see it. This story is an interesting phenomenon that I propose because young, old, men, women, science fiction experts and people who find such a way out can all follow and enjoy the plot and plot of this film very well. This is the first film set on a planet other than Earth in the 20th century, other than TV shows such as Flash Gordon. Leslie Nielsen was a little weak for his role, but Walter Pigeon, Marvin Miller, Ann Francis, Richard Anderson, Earl Holliman and especially Warren Stevens have all proven themselves. There are so many visual glories in this film that it is difficult to choose a favorite from the scenes of the film. Approach to Altairu-4, the starship itself, landing on the alien surface of the planet, descending the ramble road The last approach ch from the invisible destroyer, the flight from the doomed planet - all these scenes crashed into the consciousness of the viewer, because we open them together with the participants. The veteran Cyril Humeâ€™s literate script was cleverly cleared by director Fred Macleod Wilcox for a long time with clarity and fantasy. it is a shock when you realize that there is no music at all; The film is made with words, actors and a mysterious plot. This can be observed again and again with pleasure - I have been doing this for almost fifty years. While this famous and beloved film was not created, not a single film tried to imagine a world outside the Earth; and for decades the ships continued to fall back onto the planet - as if the authors' imagination was destroyed and caused disasters. Many say they are still the best. It speaks about something negative about the imagination of the so-called intellectual leaders of this country - and about something very positive, I suppose, about those who created this gem.
