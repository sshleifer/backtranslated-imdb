Thanks to the Warner Archive, I can again see this grand variety show, which includes everything except the kitchen sink. (The bath, however, is present.) This film gives the show time to every person who had a contract with Warners at the time. If some of the artists seem to be some strangers, it is because they were great on silent days, and most of them disappeared due to the popularity of talkers. There are really wonderful artists of the vaudeville era. You are most impressed by Winnie Lightner, who performs two numbers. There is also that French star, Irene Bordoni, who sings a love song in a sexual manner. Perhaps one of the highlights is the Chinese Fantasy two-color Technicolor, which has been restored for this version. It's really beautiful, and these are the stars of Mirna Loy and Nika Lucas. Finally, there is the grand finale of "Lady Luck", which lasts almost a quarter of an hour. This is really the epic of the era of early talk. Any fan of old movies will love this.
