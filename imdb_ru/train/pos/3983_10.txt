Fully honored in his prestigious nomination for Hollywood, this is a fun little gem with lots of pizaz and some amazing surprises. Unusually funny scenes include a funny shooting (and re-shooting) of the WW1 trench scene with Australian comedian Clyde Cook in the role of an optimistic non-commissioner and unhappy MacDawax as a Boyer / Coleman messenger ?? all under the watchful eye of the delightfully hot-tempered Ralph Sanford Torment; the lost MacDoux, led by the equally puzzled Jack Carson; Assistant director Chandler rejoices at the opportunity sent by MacDawkes: “I am going to become a director!” <br /> <br /> Ace comic O'Hanlon plays a dual role: he plays both MacDoix and McDox himself! Oddly enough, Richard L. Barre, who plays himself in one or more of the other recordings in the series, declined this opportunity here. In real life, Naked is a young, six-foot-like Rock Hudson, but here he plays the role of veteran actor (over 500 films!) Jack Mower.
