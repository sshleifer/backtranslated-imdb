Like Ishtar and the King of Comedy, other great, misunderstood comedies, Envi has great performances in which two actors play essentially losers (maybe this is too harsh a word, I will call them suburban dropouts). <br /> <br /> This film was a dark gem of comedy, and I'm not sure what people expect. I enjoy watching the main studio comedy, which is not filled with obvious humor, and I believe that the small moments in this film make it worthwhile. Stiller's facial expression, when he sees the dog disappearing for the first time, captures the moment, the moment that most people need to recognize in themselves. Yes, it was a rather simple story, but she explored the root of envy in a really interesting way. There were a lot of great scenes (decrepit Lake Hut, Corki’s unceremonious burial, the role of Weitz’s wife and Walken’s J-man - all this is great. <br /> <br /> I can ”I don’t tolerate people who go to IMDb and mercilessly making films when they have absolutely no idea what they need to create them. I will take “Envy” for almost any of the ten best comedies of the year (except for “Napoleonic dynamite”) and an unusual, pleasant gem. <br /> <br /> Remember these people; in most cases, popularity is not equal to good.
