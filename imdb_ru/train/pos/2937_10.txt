I know that this is rude, and I know that this is not a PC at all, but it is so funny. If you understand that this is the beginning of the 80s, and all the stereotypes of that time are embodied in it - and the film still makes you almost lose consciousness from laughter - this is really a good comedy. Continuing the tradition of comedies over the millennia, the subject of this film is exaggerated. If you can stop your political correctness for an hour and a half, just to laugh, follow this. <br /> <br /> P.S. Someone, please put it on DVD, it's so hard to find on VHS.
