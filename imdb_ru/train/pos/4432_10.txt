I gladly admit that I am a lover of a beautiful film, and quite inventive movements and camera angles may be enough to interest me in a rather long film. Although not the entire length of Gojo, although it contained the most wonderful cinematography I have seen since the time of the Korean play MUSA. However, Gojoe provides much more than just beautiful images (like MUSA ... not to imply contrast) - its second largest force is an excellent game and an exciting story with a very dark philosophy. I have to admit that I was absolutely not sure what he was trying to prove at the end, but this definitely evokes some thoughts along the way. Uncertain, but unequivocally thoughts: p <br /> <br /> One of the aspects in which the film could be better is action. There is a huge amount of bloodshed in the film, but all of this action is filmed using hyperkinetic close-ups and is often hidden by the foreground objects. It does create very intense and impressive visual effects, but it would be nice to see some more real movements to make it more believable, so that the villains could just walk through entire armies, ruining everyone. <br /> <br /> However, the film is definitely one of the most interesting and beautiful films that I have seen for quite some time.
