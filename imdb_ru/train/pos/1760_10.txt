40-year-old VIRGIN (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romani Malko, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Jerry Bednob, Shelly Malil, Kat Dennings. Hysterically funny comedy with a high concept about titled Andy Stitzer (wonderfully played by Karell’s many years of second banana in a truly extraordinary comic breakthrough performance, confidently leading him to list A), a representative of technical services for an electronics store in Southern California, who learned about his secretive trio well-meaning , but completely ignorant fellow grandmothers-colleagues (Rudd, Malko and Rogen, each degree more ridiculous than the next), who decided to deprive his friend of his strength, regardless of the cost . What follows is an unlikely, but very cordial affair with a cheerful mother (wonderful Keener, who is very funny here), which leads to adding fuel to Andy's fire. Surprisingly cheerful and obscenely romantic comedy; the funniest since “There is something about Mary” with the shrewdly observant script of director Judd Apatov and Carell, in which there are several startlingly intriguing episodes, including David Caruso’s incredibly accurate joke, ribbing revelation, parodies on a “date-and- paloosis "and demystifying the war of the sexes with impudent aplomb. A real winner and instant classic; the funniest movie of the year.
