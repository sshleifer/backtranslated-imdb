for those who play video games here, someone noticed that GTA: Vice City Mansion inside the game and some other things, including weapons from the movie associated with this movie, and this movie inspired some of the gameâ€™s creators (Rockstar Games) stuff from this film, and by the way, this is one of the best films of the 80s, I recommend it to anyone who has not seen it.
