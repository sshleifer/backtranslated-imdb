I really liked this movie. (That's why I was surprised that this site received such a low rating from many users!) I'm not saying that this is a cinematic masterpiece, but it was a great way to spend a cold, snowy Saturday night. These are funny, sharp and excellent stories about the ups and downs of female friendship, which continue in difficult times, and the bad things that friends want to do to each other! (Admit it, ladies, we HAD EVERYTHING THERE!) Bill Paterson shines when Reverand Gerald Marsden and Andy MacDowell argue that she can be a good actress when the role is right and she thinks about it. (Indeed, there is a better “wedding escape” that I have ever seen or dreamed of in this film ... more courage than anyone I have ever known!) You will laugh and cry - ignore any marketing campaigns and how this movie comes on ... it's a hidden gem that should have made tons of box office. (now I have to look around to buy a copy!)
