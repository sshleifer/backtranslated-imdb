I saw it during the flight to the USA and at first I was a bit skeptical, as several people said that there are so many characters in it that you did not recognize any of them. However, I did not find it at all. The film is fast, but it is connected with the character of the director and the star. The scenes of the pursuit are excellent, and yes, it can be predictable, but it is not so for most films. The main villain is a little disappointed, Christopher Excelleston is not as convincing as he could be, but this suggests that it is still a good movie.
