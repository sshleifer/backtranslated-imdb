I found the FBI Story very interesting and suitable for my viewing of the New Year. His drama and action episodes were exciting. The character of Hardesty was well drawn and adorable. Overall, photography, screenplay and direction were completely commendable. Instead of seeing the film as a disgusting piece of propaganda, as some might have, I enjoyed it as a well-shown image of the need for ingenious minds and bold bodies in the fight against crime. Again, the image of a family holding together even under the onslaught of the husbandâ€™s commitment to his (possibly) important work, I did not consider your idea to be ideal and exemplary.
