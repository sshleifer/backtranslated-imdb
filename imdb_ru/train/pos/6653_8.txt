Leaving aside all political views, “Queens Khan” and “Gandhi, my father” by Anil Kapoor is a good film, which cleverly tells about the side of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, embarrassed about his family, and about the struggle of his eldest son Harilal Gandhi with society , his father is more than life, and most importantly - the demons in his head. Someone draws parallels with Gandhi, the father of the nation, and fights for what any son could have with his father. <br /> <br /> The game is good. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zaryvala and Akshay Khanna - strictly in that order - add color and pathos to this heart-rending story of Harilale, who cries to embrace only once, and also runs away with a faint touch of a finger. <br /> <br /> Feroz Khan's direction and canvas of production are generous and attractive, however the scenario could be tougher. I saw the play a few years ago on a DVD with a pirated video (it was called Mahatama vs Gandhi), and it was, of course, more exciting. However, the background score of the film, as well as the father-son and mother-son moments, are just brilliant fun. <br /> <br /> This movie could be awesome. It borders on this. The potential is so great that it was just historical differences between father and son, or just Gandhi, or even both. somewhere the plot is lost, and when you expect an absolute embodiment of emotions, nothing comes to you. <br /> <br /> This is decently compared to other Gandhi. Of course, this is not a review film, such as Gandhi by Kingsley, or the abstract Hey, Ram movie by Haman Haman. The film almost takes root; However, one wonders, "what if ..." Worth seeing. 7.5 / 10
