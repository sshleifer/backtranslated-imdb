First of all, do not think that “Revolver” expects another “jerk” or “capture”, it is a completely different gangster movie. <br /> <br /> One evening I saw a gala concert, and this film definitely divided the audience. This is the film where half of the viewers will leave with the thought, WHAT was it? It was awful, and the other half would leave to think, what was it? It was cool. Personally, I like movies that I don't understand, that is, Mulholland Drive and Ordinary Suspects, so I liked Revolver. <br /> <br /> This was definitely not perfect, though. I saw a big turn, going for a mile, at least a part of it, and although sometimes some loose ends are left unexplained, this is good, the Revolver leaves a LOT of questions, unexplained without a reason, as it seemed. In addition, some scenes, such as animation, and the scene in which Sorter goes to a great fun (in fact, one of my favorites), although, anyway, the scenes looked like it was just because they were cool to watch. and not because they fit in with the film. <br /> <br /> However, there were many good things. I thought the acting was excellent from all the main actors, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore and even Andre Benjamin (which was a pleasant surprise). This film definitely supported my interest, with one wonderful, intense, action-packed scene after another. When Ray Liotta was under the table, wow ... well, you have to see it. The script was very well done, and the soundtrack, as in most Guy Ritchie films, was great. <br /> <br /> Although one step below such films as Fight Club, Mallholland Drive and Ordinary Suspects, he was still a terrific, fast-paced, psychological, action movie, with many turns and lots of scenes which you will remember long after its completion.
