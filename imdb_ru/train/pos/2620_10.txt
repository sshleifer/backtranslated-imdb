What a pleasant surprise: the sequel to Disney DTV (Direct to Video) is really good. “The Lion King 1 1/2” is a comedy film featuring favorite meerkats and warthogs, Timon and Pumba. It all starts with the fact that they watch the original film and make comments until Timon complains that "we are not here yet." After the battle for the console, Timon and Pumba decide to tell the audience "their story." They start a new film, and it starts laughing. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was losing hope at Disney. Most of their fare on the video was aggressively terrible, and the plot lines were desperately trying to make money on the original. “1 1/2” decides to try something else: he tells the original story from a new point of view. Well, that adds something, for example, where Timon came from and how he and Pumba met, but this is an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella beautifully return the bonds and friendships that made us love them in the first movie. There are also some neat parodies of films (including one scene that at the same time forges “Good, bad and ugly” and “Cool cold-blooded Luke”), and the script is filled with funny memorable lines. <br /> <br /> Posted as starring Julie Kavner (The Simpsons) as the restless mother of Timon and Jerry Stiller in the role of the slightly crazy Uncle Max Timon. Matthew Broderick appears as Simba, and his “teenage” scene reminded me of Ferris Bueller. Everything is fine with everyone, especially with Robert Guillaume (how do you write this?) In the role of Rafiki, who radiates more and more jodas in this film (Timon comments on this several times). <br /> <br /> “Lion” King 1 1/2 'is the ideal alternative for those who are tired of Shrekification animation. 10/10
