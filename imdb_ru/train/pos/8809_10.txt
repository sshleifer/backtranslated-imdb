This document really opened my eyes to what people outside the United States thought about the September 11 attacks. This film was skillfully put together and presents this disaster as something more than an attack on the US soil. The consequences of this catastrophe are viewed from different countries and perspectives. I believe that this film should be more widely distributed on this issue. It also helps in the process of recovery, finally, to see something other than news about terrorist attacks. And some of the parts are really funny, but not offensive. This film is highly recommended to me, and I convey the same feeling.
