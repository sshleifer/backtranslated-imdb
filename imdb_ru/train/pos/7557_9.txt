Paul Bender Limerick: <br /> <br /> Male or female? Who knows? <br /> <br /> It turns out that this is both. <br /> <br /> Sleep in clay. <br /> <br /> Then they all left. <br /> In one of their UFOs. <br /> <br /> Gender Bender is another great episode of the first season. I like it, because this is the story in which you never know what will happen next. It is completely original. The teaser is very funny with close-ups of the eyes and the reflection of the disco lights. I really need to learn my thumb trick that the hedge does. I really like the atmosphere in a small village of Kindred, and Mulder and Scully sneak in the middle of the night. This is very exciting. This is actually one of my favorite episodes of the first season. I think I really like the way they turn out to be aliens in the end and leave the crop circles. Many people see it as an alien episode not related to mythology, like “Unnatural” or “Cosmos”, but I think it can easily be considered as mythology. Maybe a sexual husband, just like an alien bounty hunter, can look like anyone. BUT? Anyway, I give episode 9 of 10.
