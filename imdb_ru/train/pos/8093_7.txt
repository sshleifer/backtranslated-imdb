My friend had the idea to watch the animated LOTR after watching Peter the King Returning the King. Therefore, I finally bought it from e-bay, thinking from the very beginning that it would be bad. In fact, everything was not as bad as I thought. The animation was good for its time, they used a unique method of mixing live action with animation to create some interesting effects, and the guy who voiced Frodo sounded a bit like Elijah Wood. <br /> <br /> Not the greatest adaptation of the book, but believe me, I have seen much worse. He misses quite a few things, since the Fellowship and The Two Towers are compressed into one two-hour film. Children need to look, children may like it, but, nevertheless, they can not be compared with the Peter Jackson trilogy.
