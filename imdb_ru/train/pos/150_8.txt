The latest film by Spanish director Agusti Villarong is a study of how children who experience violence and isolation in their remote community are turned into anxious young people who need certain mental tools to cope with their hidden mental weakness. Regardless of whether these tools are religious or fanatical, take care of others or simply depict macho while engaged in prostitution, Villaronga successfully explores the influence of these vices on three teenagers living in Spain under Franco. All three witness an alarming double death or their friends before they become adolescents, and then bury the emotions they experience with their fragile peer bodies until they meet again in the hospital for those suffering from tuberculosis. <br /> <br /> The cinematic style of the text is usually visually rich, as one would expect from a Spanish author, and very much resembles the work of a Spaniard colleague Pedro Almodovar with themes relating to sexual desires, both heterosexual and homosexual. The element that is different between the two directors is that Villaronga prefers a supernatural connotation, combined with claustrophobic, grim realism, in contrast to the use of surrealism by Almodovar, although both styles are similar. <br /> <br /> This article gives an idea of ​​the troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature. I highly recommend watching this film, as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a significant period after viewing.
