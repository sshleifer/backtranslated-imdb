I saw a new abridged and edited version yesterday, and I liked it. Then I went home and watched it with subtitles, and I liked it. I am ready to watch it again. <br /> <br /> I am a lover of a secret person with a gentle upbringing, and what could be softer than a pacifist librarian? The scenes where he reveals his supernormal abilities to his friends or absently forgets to be meek are my favorites. <br /> <br /> Of course, martial arts are awesome. I really can say little about them if you are familiar with the HK style. However, if you didn't ... we briefly suspended the reproduction, and Walker, a Texas Ranger, was turned on. We noticed that after each stroke there was a cut. Not in black mask. <br /> <br />
