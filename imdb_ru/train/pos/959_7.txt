There are a lot of police dramas doing the rounds. I'm not sure why. This is probably due to the old main theme of "good versus evil." <br /> <br /> This film has a documentary style, since we are following the difficult initiation of the recruit sons of Anna into a police unit stationed in the Baltic region. No attempt is made to charm the police. They are truly mundane, harsh at times and inexorable, Anna, on the other hand, has a soft heart, perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. Contrary to all the rules, she sometimes hides the compromising information found during strip searches and other investigations. <br /> <br /> This is not a very nice movie. Not one to relax you. There is no particular sense of optimism. The police seem to be involved in a losing battle. Tomorrow there will be more attacks, murders, break-ups of families and children in great difficulty. Let's face it. This is the world in which we live. <br /> <br /> Over time, Ann becomes more closely connected with the police and with the families they are investigating. The only real warmth in the film is that the character of 12-year-old Benny from a broken family gives. Anna has her own way of correction. She closes her eyes to the theft at Benny's shop and tries to help him as best as possible. I was surprised that she went so far as to seduce Benny's father. It made me wonder if it was related to her father or her own needs. In the end, from the film it becomes clear that she desperately needed a partner and loving children. <br /> <br /> Well played, but not my idea of ​​evening entertainment,
