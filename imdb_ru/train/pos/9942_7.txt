A good Korean film about not only taekwondo, but also about what is needed in order to be good, as a way of dealing with thugs, cannot surpass the taekwondo guy in his sport, because there are rules, as in life and in school, and this film has a subtext of this concept. <br /> <br /> The martial arts in the film are not so good, but they are tolerable and pleasant. Friends who pursue something that they mock at once become stronger through the mind and heart. This film should not be taken too seriously, as there is a slap in it, but it also carries the message. <br /> <br /> Good movie again from Korea.
