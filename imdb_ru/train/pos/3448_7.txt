A lossless documentary in words ... ever ... <br /> <br /> Assuming that a story is more than a hoax, let's assume that this is a commentary to Japanese society. And since this film is as fast as an absurdist documentary, as it appears, a constant play on words, as fast as it goes, and as poorly translated as it is - in its current version of the movie screen, as it was at Copenhagen Cinematheme tonight - still pretty nice. <br /> <br /> But for the patient, and ONLY for the truly patient and open-minded, I speak to you, Jim Jarmusch fans with relapses of ADD, I think this is a movie for you. This is a smart movie if you let it subdue you. <br /> <br /> Quite beautiful, quite kitsch, and quite a Japanese subculture. And pretty experimental. Static 2D in 3D world. In general, a pleasure for those who want to watch a Japanese film that fakes the culture of Japanese cuisine. Not bad if you are tuned to something completely different.
