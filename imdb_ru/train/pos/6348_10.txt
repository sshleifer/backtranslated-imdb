Jim Carrey, as usual, is good, and although there are quite a few “Jim Carrey moments”, this is definitely not a “Jim Carrey movie”. <br /> <br /> It is mainly aimed at children, and I managed to enjoy it as such a movie. In Israel, it was advertised as another Jim Carrey film, so those who expected a strange comedy were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film has pleasant moments and it works well as a children's film. I can not say that I liked this film, but again I am not his target audience!
