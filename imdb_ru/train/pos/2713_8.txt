Wilson (Erica Gavin) is caught by the police and sent to prison on this bright and amusing example of the exploitation of the 70s premiere, which marked the directorial debut of Jonathan Demme. After writing and producing several mentors for Roger Corman's "New World", Demme was first given the opportunity to star in a director, and he makes a film that not only demonstrates the expected and tasty portions of nudity and violence, but also attracts attention. mocking quality to it as well; it's often as fun as catchy. <br /> <br /> Outstanding scenes include obscene and brutal vaudeville style action performed for prisoners, as well as powerful sleep / fantasy for the excited and obviously very depressed Superintendent McQueen (the icon of horror Barbara Steele, making an amazing turn in this antagonistic role ). I also enjoyed the scene of the bank robbery, which had become useless, and the scene of a carjacking that was just noisy. As in other films of this kind, it is also commendable that this is both a portrait of women's empowerment and pure exploitation. These women are tough, they don't take out the garbage from anyone, and they are more than able to handle themselves. <br /> <br /> Our attractive cast plays most of their roles: Juanita Brown as aggressive Maggie, Robert Collins as cheeky Belle, Rainbo Smith as cute and timid Lavel, Gavin as wide-eyed novice and Linda Gold (aka Christine Sinclair) in a bright appearance as an accomplice outside. <br /> <br /> As our climax ends, Demme comes with a tense finish to “beat the time,” as our heroines rush to save Belle from a lobotomy by the rapacious Dr. Randolph (Warren Miller), a man who doesn’t thinking about using women to their advantage. . <br /> <br /> "Caged Heat" is fun entertainment that guarantees a pleasant pastime.
