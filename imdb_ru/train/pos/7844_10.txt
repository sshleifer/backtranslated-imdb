I really love this show, it's like reading a book, and each chapter leaves you wanting more. It makes you think about what will happen in the next episode, and about the struggle for trying to keep friendship for many years. After the end of each episode, you still have a sweet bitter taste, knowing that: One - The show was good, you can't wait for the next episode, and it really makes you think about what's really going on with friends for twenty years. And the second is the fact that the show was put on “a break”, and we will not see its end in full. Fox, obviously, does not know what they have done, they claim that they are losing viewers in the category of 18-49 years old, they clearly do not know what people want to see if they get rid of a good show, such as Reunion. I have one request that I would like to raise. If they returned the show, and it lasted for another season, how would it work, since each episode is done for a year, and the story is based on what happens for twenty years? Your answers are welcome. Bring back the Reunion! Bring back the Reunion!
