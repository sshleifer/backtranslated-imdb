Jane Eyre has always been my favorite romance! When I came across this version of the movie in the late 90s, I was delighted! This is the best and most complete version of the book about the film! This version is a bit long to sit in one sitting, but it's worth it. Timothy Dalton is great as Rochester. I was glad that they played a normal-looking actress (Zelu Clark) in the role of Jane, not a charming man. I love the sets and location. For those who are a real fan of Jane Eyre, this version is worth a look !!! For those of you who are interested, I just found this version on DVD. I watched my VHS copy almost before hacking, so I was glad to find it on DVD.
