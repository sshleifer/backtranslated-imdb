If you are not in the mood for more than one hour of the film, this film may give you some variations. What I love is constant surprises. Not just once, do you want one or more short films "New York, I Love You" to continue. Yes, some of the short films make you curious, some are very short, some are longer, some have certain goals, and some are not. <br /> <br /> Most of the story is the sad side of the capital. It shows many different nationalities. Many of them make me feel the same way I used to be in one of the capitals in other countries during the year, where many people from different countries came. This movie tells you about many things that you may have known, but for all the characters, this is new things. Maybe some of you went abroad alone to stay for a year or two, just to feel something new, to meet new people; I feel dreamy, sad, but the kind of sadness that you are looking for is just boring that you were in your own home. You might want to relive it by watching it.
