It was a modesty that we did not know! Hinted and summarized in a comic book that syndicates were sold to newspapers! Lee and Janet Batchler were real Modesty Blaise fans who were given The Dream Job - they tell the story of Modesty that fans have never seen before. In their audio commentary, they acknowledged that they had made changes to its origins to make the story smoother. The “purists” should also note that we really do not know whether everything she told Miklos was true, because she was “stretching the time”. I did not rent and did not take a DVD, as other "reviewers" did, I bought it! And I do not want a refund! I watched it three times and did not sleep! Excellent dialogue and well traced characters that I cared about (even the bad guy Miklos), like in novels and comics! I also can't wait for the next film about Humility (and Willie), especially if this “prequel” is a sign of what should happen!
