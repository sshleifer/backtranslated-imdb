Well, this is again a movie that plays with your feelings, and you get everything soft, not a rock movie. But I adore them, so I gave a good result ... the game was very good, and I had a lot of feelings. Violence is minimized, which makes changes. I would give him 9 if not for the salute at the end! In general, a good movie with very good actors. <br /> <br />
