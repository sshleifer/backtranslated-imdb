One of the best comedians. I’ve seen this show about 10 times, and I’ll probably watch at least 100 more times. My friends and family quote this dvd so often that you think that we didn’t do anything except watch it. The initial part about Alcatraz is a little slow, but either make your way through it or jump to the part where Eddie is on stage. Follow the “Pie or Death” part (joke about the Anglican Church) and the “Hitler / Pol Pot” part (hard to explain, just look). The best part of the show could be Eddie's facial expression. He really can say a lot with his own eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner and eyeshadow probably help, eh?) Just a warning: Eddie tends to throw a lot of four-letter words.
