Definitely one of the wittiest and perverse people I've ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Michael Kane were great and helped me get through the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Very stylish scenery, and the props really create an atmosphere of atmosphere. Minimalist style works on the whole picture. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is not about the film itself, but about the lack of a decent widescreen edition of the film on DVD. I own a full-screen version (which proves that I love the movie enough to sustain a full-screen presentation), but an amazing Deluxe or “special” edition will surely get my money.
