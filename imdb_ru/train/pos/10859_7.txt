Not to be confused with the Resse Witherspoon high school movie of the same name, this is a stylized look at the triad of Hong Kong gangs. It is called an election, because a new leader or “chairman” is elected according to ancient traditions every two years. Two candidates for this position, and thanks to the ego, bribes and past track records, the race is at least tense. Expertly directed to introduce you to a vast composition, without entangling the twists and turns of history, before revealing itself in all its cruel glory. The Asian godfather is not, but this is a pleasant thriller in the genre of gangsters, which will leave you on the edge of your place and frowns from violence. Subtitle Volume 1 I think that it is safe to say that there will be other parties when we delve into the dark world of the triads and all their warring and backstage business deals. In any case, this is a good start, and if there is no continuation, an excellent film in itself.
