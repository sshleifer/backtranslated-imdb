Lunar Child was one of the most symbolic films I've seen. What I really liked about this is an illustration of immorality / mortality, as well as obstacles and directions in life. The film depicts the many Kay vampires possessing the power of immorality and advantages for it. If it has supernatural powers or eternal life, this is what people usually want. Lunar Child shows the pain and shortcomings of immortality, since the sense of loss affects almost all the characters, especially the main characters Sho and Kay. The meaning of the name "Lunar Child" is revealed as the film comes to an end, where it clearly shows that everyone is the moon, which shines to other people and gives directions. I really like the personality that the moral film is depicted on. The filmâ€™s weaknesses are in some of the details of acting and special effects, as this makes the film less authentic. The scene where Toshi's character dies could be more powerful and realistic if more genuine emotions were added to it. Some scenes with special effects, such as pistol shots, could also be more authentic without making them look too much like action. The sparks emanating from the guns seemed too fake, and I think they could be fixed or corrected. However, I think the "Child of the Moon" should be a film that everyone should consider. Symbolic ideas and images that show the film will be easily accepted by all and may interest many viewers. This is a pretty thoughtful film, as well as interesting to watch.
