The silent movie "Pride of the Clan" with Mary Pickford in the title role was to be shot on a fictional island off the coast of Scotland. In fact, most of the external images were taken in Marblehead, Massachusett, in Marblehead Neck, close to several rocky seaside geographic areas, including Churn and Castle Rock. My initial interest in the film was due to two factors: 1) the location of the Marble Head film in my hometown and 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizette M. Woodfin was hired as a substitute for Mary Pikford during the filming of several scenes, including "Rock scene". Both women were short (5 feet), and my father and grandmother told me that she stood with her back to the camera on the rock scene, as part of the Chiefton set. I just wanted to tell this story to future historians and movie lovers. The film itself (my DVD is a bit bad) is very well made with a lot of action and expressive play, including several scenes where Miss Pickford portrays a strong female character. I enjoyed it and would like to get a better copy, although I am not sure if it exists, as I have seen on various film sites, that the remaining copies are dark due to quality deterioration. Very good movie of the quiet genre with lots of action!
