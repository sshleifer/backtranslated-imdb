I would say to all reviewers on this page that this film is worth seeing. This was done in 1972, but so what. Fashion in the film was exactly the same as in its time. People who have not studied the culture of decades would think that this film is a cheese ball. Compared to the modern series “Behind” (which is made for our time right now), it looks just silly. However, the only unhealthy part of the film is fashion, which was again more than 30 years ago. BUT. The message that is sent in this film is very powerful and carefully preserved. Just so much can be said, but I refuse to say it. (for fear of spoiling it) So go and see this movie! If you do not like the message that it sends, you have problems that require some attention!
