For those of you who are not familiar with Jimmy Stewart, this is one of his “less significant” films from the later period of his career. And although this is not a very good film compared to many of his other films, he is a good and decent passer-by, but not by much. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak is a witch in New York and for some inexplicable reason she decides to spell poor Jimmy to fall in love with her. Over time, the cold and distant Miss Novak also begins to fall in love with Stewart - and, obviously, in the book of witches, it is definitely NO, NO !! <br /> <br /> The film is strange in its feelings about the witches. They donate neither children nor omnipotent diversity. Most of their magic is rather limited and meaningless (for example, Jack Lemmon uses his abilities to turn off street lights). And, oddly enough, all the witches seem to be bohemians who hang out in trendy bars, where you can meet people dressed in berets and listening to crappy jazz. Considering what I think about jazz, it must be smelly to be a witch in the world of this film! <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is quite romantic and slightly comedic, but I would not watch it. The acting is pretty good, but the script doesn't offer enough payoff to make this movie exceptional - in fact, I almost scored movie 6 - it was really close.
