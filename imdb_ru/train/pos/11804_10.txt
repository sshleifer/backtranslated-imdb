He made a movie as a joke. My friends and I had so much fun laughing at it that I went and found a used copy and bought it for myself. Now that all my friends are looking for a funny movie, I give them Sasquatch Hunters. This needs to be said, although there is a rule that made the film much better. The conversation is forbidden until the film is on, unless the words are repeated in squash. I also liked the credit at the end of the film. "Thanks for the Jeep, Tom!" Whoever Tom is, I say thank you, because without your Jeep, the film could not have been made. In short, a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at. If you want a good movie, maybe look for something else, but if you donâ€™t mind laughing at the expense of a man in a monkey costume, get yourself a copy.
