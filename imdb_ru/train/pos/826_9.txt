I'm sick of people who complain about Evoks! True, they are not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they did happen, so deal with it! In addition, they are cute, and I do not care if they are sold. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This film always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end could not be better. I am thrilled by the “Ghostly Danger” because she will suddenly move the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I like the way it unfolds at the end — that would be too intractable in another way. Therefore, those of you who complain that Vader’s helmet has been removed, think about it. It is very effective. Vader, a man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, finally turns out to be a sick person. He is not exactly a car - he is vulnerable. <br /> <br /> I don’t know how the casting director chose such good actors in “New Hope”. They are all so good. They are believable characters. Hamill copes with his dramatic character development. Fisher copes with the role of the female role model (I mean, come on! She killed Jabba, even when many others failed!). Harrison Ford - do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> The music is brilliant again. It is very touching and important when you can choose the themes of the characters in different parts of the film. The best climax is when Luke screams "Nooo!" and jumps out to fight with his father in the final battle. John Williams is nothing but a genius! What an amazing person! <br /> <br /> Thanks to the film “Episode I,” the film has become much more meaningful to me. then look at the original trilogy again. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
