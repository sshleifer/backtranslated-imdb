"Hollywood Hotel" is a fast moving, bright, surprisingly interesting musical comedy from Warners, which, unfortunately, is overlooked. This should be remembered at least to provide the official thematic song Tinseltown - “Hurray Hollywood”. However, Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer’s score has several other gems, including the charming “I Like a Fish Out of Water” and “Silhouette in the Moonlight”. The best musical number - “Let it be a lesson for you,” in which Dick Powell and the company tell in detail about the misadventures of people who find themselves “behind the eighth ball,” is the fate that literally comprehends the slow Edgar Kennedy in the room. end. The picture glorifies Hollywood glamor and pierces it all at once, as she gets a lot of comic run from pompous and ego-manic actors and two-faced studio executives. The cast includes the great characters of comedians - Allyn Joslin as the sly press agent, Ted Healy as the potential manager Dick Powell, Fritz Feld as the excited patron of the restaurant, Glenda Farrell as the sarcastic Gal Friday Mona Marshall, Edgar Kennedy as Change driver, Mabel Todd, like Mona's stupid sister, and Hugh Herbert, like her even dumber dad. The “racist” element mentioned in the other review is a ten-second bit in which Herbert appears with a black face during the pseudo-“Gone With the Wind” sequences. This is a dubious taste, but this should not prevent you from seeing other charms in this film, in particular the quartet of Benny Goodman (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!) In that, I think, is the only footage in this incredible jazz combo. The sequence of “Dark Eyes” goes on too long and comes too late, but otherwise “Hollywood Hotel” is a gem that is worth your time and, of course, a film worth considering for a DVD release.
