This is the first and only full-length article by Paul F. Ryan. Since then, he has not done anything. However, he managed to get an amazing cast to portray the characters of his story. I don’t know when or why the idea came to his mind, but Ryan wrote the script, which later became his own film “Home Room”. <br /> <br /> The busy Phillips carries the film on his shoulders Alicia, a troubled girl; those that we always see in the television series. With dark hair and black clothes; a pack of cigarettes in your pocket, a strange look and anxious eyes (with makeup, of course). An event occurred at her school; shooting Some students died, and she saw everything. Now Detective Martin Van Zandt (Victor Garber) is investigating this case, and, as expected, Alicia is a suspect. But shooting is only an origin; The film is not about shooting. <br /> <br /> Dinna Cartwright (Erica Christensen) is in bed in a hospital ward. She is one of the hospital survivors. The script establishes the relationship between them the school director (James Pickens, Jr.). He helps all students recover from this event, but Alicia doesn't seem to care. It is isolated. Thus, the director punishes her; She needs to visit Dinna every day for up to five hours. Then the movie begins. <br /> <br /> I can't even describe how wonderful the film was written. I can identify with the characters and the situations in which they live; I like the reality. These things can happen to anyone. And what they say is completely understandable. They grow up and try to cope with things they have not experienced; they do their best. Not knowing this, Alicia (when she first visits Dinna) and Diana (when she sees Alicia standing in front of her) begin a journey that will determine their personality and ideas for the next step in life; after school. <br /> <br /> The director manages Christensen and Philip very well. Look at the contrast between them. Dinna seems naive and with simple thoughts; no difficulty in her mind. When Alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers, she asks, "Who brought them?" "Many people," replies Deanna; although in a few days we will find out that they are from her parents who come every week. All parent figures are well represented, but not as important as the characters of their sons. Deanna is lonely. Alicia seems mature and cruel; smoking cigarettes and talking rudely. But after a two-day visit, she returns to the hospital every day; even sleep in Dean's room all night. After they both quarrel, I think that Dinna says, "Why do you keep coming back?" Alicia is also lonely. <br /> <br /> The end of the film, without destroying it, is a little disappointing; This is what I did not expect. This eliminates some of the power that the film has. Revelation is completely unnecessary; wrecking the logical climax that a movie could have. In any case, it was a great script; and great direction. Damn good movie. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Eric Christensen, she needed a role to fly higher. Her role in “Traffic” was impressive, but it was a big step; The main role. Perhaps not many had the chance to see her in this film, and this is a pity. Since then, she has not made a single false move. She even performed well in terrible movies. On the other hand, in the busy Philip, who turned out to be very promising in this film (what a transformation), there are not so many opportunities for other roles. <br /> <br /> The same thing I say about Paul F. Ryan. (director, curse), and I expect him to sit at the computer now and finish his new script; I'm waiting for his next movie. I hope the best for them all.
