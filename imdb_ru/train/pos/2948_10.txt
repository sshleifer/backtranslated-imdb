It must be against the law not to experience this extremely funny show with Eddie Murphy. I have never seen anything like it. <br /> <br /> Murphy almost 70 minutes talks about the members, pussies, tits and insults of so many famous people, including his own "family". Among the people who get it from Murphy: Elvis, Mr. T., Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I seriously never laughed so hard in my whole life. I mean, when a person does not know who Mr. T. is, but he still laughs at Murphy so much as Mr. T., there is something about that. At the time I saw the show, I could not remember who Mr. T. was, but still laughing. Now I know who he is, and that makes him so much funnier. Because this is what Eddie does - he can make these impressions so good that it doesn't matter who the hell he is trying to do, it's still fun. And on top of that, we find out that Murphy is actually a very good singer. Please watch this ..
