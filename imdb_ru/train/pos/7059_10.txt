I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews that I saw on the Internet, I thought Cinderella 2 (and also 3) is a very nice and funny continuation for all - children and adults ... like me, I am 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I also find this and very informative film, which shows lessons on how to be true to yourself and follow your heart. I thought he had great animation, and the sound was very good; the songs performed by brooke allison too. Since this film was divided into three memories / stories, my favorite of the three is the story of how Jack-mouse became a man for one day thanks to the Godfather and her magic.
