How can someone not like this movie ??? This film is so good that in the first week I saw it on a shelf in a video store, when it was stolen .... THE BEST horror movie ever !!! .... I mean, he took Carrots, and he ... well, you know HAHAHA .. How is it NOT funny? The only film that comes close is “The Bride of Chucky,” and it was just great !!
