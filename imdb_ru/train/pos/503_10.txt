After 7 years of watching this terrible nonsense called Star Trek Voyager, I felt pretty numb. Next Gen and DS9 were damn good things, and Voyager destroyed TV Trek. It opened, probably with the best pilot on the track show. The crew was really good, as was the choice of actors for the roles. Scott Bakula played a typical novice captain in deep space, and his impeccable course of action was a refreshing change for familiar captains. The rest of the team was really nice in their roles, and I think they had a good first season. When the show was prematurely canceled, I was very disappointed. In "A Mirror Darkly" they showed us what the actors are capable of. Sorry, the movie or television movie was never considered. It remains to tell so much background and the foundation of the federation, including the beginning of hostilities with the Klingons ..........
