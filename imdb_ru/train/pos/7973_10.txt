Maybe I'm a juice, but these are the sweetest movies ever! I first saw it when I was about 4 or 5 years old, and I was crying my eyes. In the meantime, and now (embarrassed at the age of 15), I have seen it more than 25 times and sobbed each of them. Do not worry, these are tears of happiness! And that is not all! It has a lot of humor and comedy. Usually the whole thing of a talking animal can be a huge burden, but in this film it is not. My only advice: even if you love it - I do not see the consequences ... commonplace! I suggest everyone check it out ... you will not regret it, no matter how old or how old you are!
