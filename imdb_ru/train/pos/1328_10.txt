Without “mental anachronism,” this film, which I would like to find on DVD, offers an extraordinary immersion in the vital and mental context of people's thinking before the “frustration of the world.” For the past thirty years, as a director and screenwriter, one can experience such empathy and such a romantic truth in order to make them a masterpiece, it amazes me. It would be necessary to be able to view and re-examine this film for better capture than the temporal and cultural distance so that we lose the ability to be included / understood, analyze and, finally, accept this or that example of “primitive thought”. ". Since this thought, which persists in a secularized world, is almost impossible to sense, nevertheless, it contains certain keys of our behavior that only their future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance. If someone knows where I am then, to get a digital copy or VHS for me or DVD ?? thank you in advance.
