Take a pinch of GOODFELLAS, mix it with THE GODFATHER, add some Roman mythology and a lot of undersized comedies, and you will get SOPRANOS, about the clan of the mafia, operating from northern New Jersey. It is almost as interesting as professional wrestling. I'm not the biggest fan of this show, but I admire the very complex Tony Soprano of James Gandolfini, a psychopath with a casual glint of conscience. I also admire the contributions of people like Dom Chianese with a gravel voice in the role of bewildered, but murderous Uncle Junior, silver-haired Tony Sirico in the role of everlasting confusion and very beautiful Edie Falco in the role of two faces, tough as nails, Carmela. Soprano. Violence is sudden and visual, the number of bodies is steadily increasing every season, but often small moments are important here. See how nephew Paulie and Tony Christopher (Michael Imperoli, deceased of LAW & ORDER), how they got lost in Pine Barrens and sit in a cold frosty night in an abandoned truck, both are convinced that they have it.
