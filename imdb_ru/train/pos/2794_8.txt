How can a movie be controversial and tender? This one does this with an almost perfect structure. No one wants their daughters to be athletes. Obviously, most cultures do not want their daughters to be small tits too. Here we see a group of superb actors that we have never heard of before, portraying people from different cultures who live pretty boring until their girls want and can become professional footballers. The structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is remarkable. There is no condescension. Both cultures are viewed as modern and valid. (And yes, both are stupid too). One drawback: hundreds of relatives seemed to be participating in the Hindu wedding ceremony, but there was not a single child among them.
