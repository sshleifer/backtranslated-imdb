Riding Giants <br /> <br /> This documentary traces the history of surfing and talks about three other well-made and famous surfing films: “Dana Brown's Endless Summer”, his subsequent “Endless Summer II” by Bruce Brown, son of Dana, and Step into a liquid (IMAX). I saw the first, not others. <br /> <br /> Although the exciting surfing shots are impressive, I value the director’s historical perspective most of all. He brings us back to the origins of the sport almost a hundred years ago and shows how it developed to its present form. This includes extensive interviews with leading personalities and performers, how surfboard designs have changed over time, which beaches in Hawaii and California have been visited by world-class surfers, and what an incredible tide of adrenalin gave them sport. Athletes lived for months on the beaches, surfed from dawn to dusk, camped on rudimentary bunks, fished, and returned to their boards the next day. What a euphoric way to spend your youthful days. <br /> <br /> We see how the media opened and promoted the sport after a slow start. What was the biggest incentive for sports? Believe it or not, it was a Gidget movie, although I suspect that copyright issues may prevent me from attributing surfing songs to Beachboys, such as Surfer Girl and Surfing USA. Surfing magazine and Surfing Encyclopedia (who knew that there was such a volume) are mentioned for their contributions. We also see comments from the pioneers of sport, their families and how the current generation benefited from the creators in the 1960s. One such story is that 40-year-old Laird Hamilton, who was considered the greatest surfer today associated with an earlier lead surfer, introduced him to his single mom whom he married before becoming his stepfather. <br /> <br /> The plot is accompanied by an exciting musical background of contemporary music of all eras. Did I whet your appetite? Wonderful. Have a good ride.
