I think it took her a lot of courage to perform this way. Unfortunately, when a celebrity suffers, this is what helps people the most. But in her case, what she did was wonderful. I have been in the field of mental health for five years, and I think it's great that mental illness is no longer a scary word, and I believe that it helped. I always thought she was great and always will be. I am glad that she wrote this book and that the film was shot. She is a wonderful lady, and I hope that she continues to act. She survived a lot and faced this. I would really like her to work more with children, especially with child actors. Her test should not have happened, and I think that she would be a wonderful teacher for young people. The film was so touching for me that I was very touched. Suffering from TBI, which caused my frustration, and from PTSD, it's nice to know that someone has the courage to show his life like her. I believe that this helped this nation, and people in general understand that there are others like them, and that there is help. Thank you, Madam Herzog or Anna, that you have ever preferred.
