Imagine that the bureaucracy is hindering you so much that one person spends 8 years of his life and he has a mental breakdown when he tries to solve the mass murder case practically by himself! The killing technique is clear, but a government that does not want to admit the truth allows the monster to destroy dozens of lives. When I think I have hard work, I just remember the true story of this amazing film. Devotion to the main character masterfully portrayed Rea. The comic (and sometimes almost tragic) relationship between Rea and the character of Sutherland made this film one of my favorites for the last 5 years. Having caught one of the worst mass murderers in history, I found myself on the edge of my place. Although not as well advertised and talked about The Silence of the Lamb, the plot was just as tense. Rent or buy this movie today!
