The education of Victor Vargas is a film that you definitely need to watch. It was a very emotional feeling, and there was a lot of humor in it that absorbed you. This is so similar to the real life that teens have to face. Victor, a cheeky teenager, but with a kind heart at the end makes love in all the right places, dealing with girls and family. In the end, Victor learns the true meaning of love after talking to an old-fashioned grandmother, and the girl he wants to use actually uses it too. I recommend that people watch this movie, because it will be similar to how you are watching a real family. That's how much feeling this movie is. One of the moments that I had a heart attack was that Grandma Victor throws out a winner because of something simple. Victor was really emotional and could not believe that she would do something like that. I felt very sorry for him, as if it were real. In general, I give this movie B +
