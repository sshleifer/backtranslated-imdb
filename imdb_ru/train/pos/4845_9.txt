Hello, playmates. I recently watched this film for the first time, and this is also my first experience with Arthur Asuka, I have to admit that this film made a big impression on me. As a fan of black and white films in general, passports for Pimlico, Lavender Hill and Tommy Trinder (who, apparently, is a distant relative), this film is attractive because it had good old British humor. I noticed that there are some here who criticized Asukaâ€™s performance, however, in my opinion, this stands the test of time as an excellent example of comic acting skills of the forties and, if it adds something to the picture, creating characters that are more than simple stereotypes That seems to be dominating films now. If you can get this film, I would recommend that you get it, shame that these films are usually not shown anymore on Sundays. I am also pleased to have the opportunity to watch another movie. the work of Arnold Ridley (Private Godfrey in his father's army). Thank you
