When “Paris is burning” came out, I completely rejected it. I was not a whole madonna and fashion phenomenon. I thought it would be stupid and stupid. How wrong I was about this movie. I watched it after the film was shot for ten years, and I ran out and bought it. It brought me back to the times and the place of fun and excitement. I felt as if I knew all the characters personally. The 80s were impressive, and the film captured the essence of gay culture. What an awesome job! I went online and found out that some of the cast members were doing now, but I could not find them all. If someone has any information about caste members, please let me know. <br /> <br /> I hope they make another documentary. I LIKE IT
