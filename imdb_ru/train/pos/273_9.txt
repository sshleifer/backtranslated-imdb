I find it hard to criticize anything that Mitzi Kaptur does. She just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress. Despite this, yes, the plot was predictable. I think maybe if Jill slept with Richard, it would probably make him a little crazy than he already was, which would add more concern. It would also be nice to see how Jill and her husband find out about Richard's little problem with his ex-wife, maybe a little more background. I was a little disappointed with the ending of the film. I would like to see more closure with Zack's death and possibly closure with her husband. However, I must say that I can never look at a flare gun and not imagine how it stands there. It was a very good end for Richard. Of course, Mitzi is swinging! I look forward to her future projects.
