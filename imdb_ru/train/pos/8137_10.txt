If you like CB4, you have no idea what you are missing if you have not seen this movie yet. This movie is insanely funny and includes much more about the hip-hop industry than any other parody movie ... Unfortunately, this movie was not released on DVD, because this is one movie I've ever watched it all loved and wanted a copy. If you really want to laugh, and you like hip-hop, and you are a little familiar with old school performers, definitely rent this movie. There are not many places for renting videos that have copies, but if you come across one of them, you will not be disappointed.
