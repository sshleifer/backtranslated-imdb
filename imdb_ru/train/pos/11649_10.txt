What a great movie, if you need to kill 2.5 hours, watch it, you won't regret it, it's too much fun! Rajnikant carries the film on his shoulders, and although there is nothing besides him, I still liked it. The music of A.R. Rekhman takes time to grow on you, but after you heard it several times, you really liked it.
