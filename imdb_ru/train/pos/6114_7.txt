A really nice movie that has some similarities with the 2001 hit “My cheeky girl”, but in most cases it fascinates. The biggest applause should go to the two leaders. Ha-Noyle Kim is sweet and whimsical, Sang-Wu Kwon is both attractive and rebellious. The chemistry between them is very good. <br /> <br /> Director Kyung Hyun Kim uses several CG inserts to enhance visual effects, and also offers impressive battle scenes in which Sang-Wu Kwon can shine. I liked it here much better than in the highly overvalued “Volcano High”. And this boy has a future - these views, these fighting techniques and romantic leadership. Not bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I can do it shortly: a good movie. My rating: 7/10
