Mirage (1990) - a very rare horror / chiller of 1990, released here in the UK, on ​​the label "New World Video". <br /> <br /> This is a desert horror film about a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend, only to be killed one after another by an unknown force that drives a menacing black truck !!! There are several creepy scenes in this film, and in some places it's bloody, but I must say that the acting was so lame, even by low budgetary standards! But the film was strangely addictive, and I liked it, and I never fell asleep or turned it off, which is always a good sign! I almost gave this film 6/10, but when I saw how it gained momentum along the way, he had good moments of blood and expectations, there was a little nudity, and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was also beautiful! I will give 7/10.
