This film had an interesting cast, it didn’t have a cast list, but the actors who were in the film did a good job. I’m glad that we have class b movies like this, basic story, main actors, and just like they do, you don’t need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mixture of ordinary actors and main story. I like how they had a street and that nobody was around, and I also wonder that they did not close the cafe to install equipment there, and they did everything from the police station. Arnold Voslu and Michael Madsen did a great job on portraying the roles of the hostage situation. It was a great movie, and I hope to see more of them in the near future.
