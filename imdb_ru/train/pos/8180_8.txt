This is an entertaining film. In fact, it can cause you discomfort, because it is not some psychopath or sociopath of the undead, but your ordinary doctor. how scary it is. There are good actors and actresses in this film, although some of them were underestimated, like Virginia Keane, like Sarah. Ken Fori, whom you may recognize from the devil robber zombie, and Halloween (2007) as our detective on the schizoid trail of Dr. Alan Feynston (Corbin Benson). A brief summary is this: Dr. Alan Feystone, a guy who has a sexy wife, a good home, and a wonderful dentist that everyone loves. Until he catches his wife cheating on him with the pool cleaner. Then he begins to hallucinate, that the teeth of his patients have rotted, and the female patients his wife, when he begins to go crazy in this thriller. But before that a good guy.
