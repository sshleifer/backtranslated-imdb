Possible SPOILERS: Not sure <br /> <br /> While watching the movie “The Lion King” 1 1/2, I could not help but have mixed feelings about the entire movie. This is definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. But there is nothing in it that could give you the same feeling as King Lion. A story for those who have not yet read other reviews tells how Timon and Pumba meet and how they affect events in the original Leo King. <br /> <br /> Actually there are some very funny jokes in it. movie. My favorite part is when they show a couple picking up a Simba. However, for me, the worst parts should be when they show Timon and Pumba, directly interfering with the events of the original. I can never look at the “Circle of life” or “Can you feel love tonight” sequence again and again (I'm fine with the sequence “I just can't wait to become king”). <br /> <br /> Voice talents are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are doing a wonderful job, just like Matthew Broderick, the guy who practices Rafiki, and hyenas. Even the actor who starred in a young Simba sounded to me like Jonathon Taylor Thomas. But why do they even include a voice actor for Zazu? He literally had only 2 lines, and none was very necessary. The additions of Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller only add to the talent, although you still cannot hear the voice of Timon's mother and not think about Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that do not seem to fit into the original, the one that comes to mind when they eventually become pride. How did they manage to fit into the first fight with hyenas? <br /> <br /> As for the DVD itself, it’s impossible not to feel that special features are not enough for a set of two discs. They could easily place a comment or other image format on the first disc. I liked the game “Who wants to be the king of the jungle,” even if this is the most shameful example of cross-promotion I've ever seen. Some of the questions are really difficult. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good movie, although not as good as TLK or even TLK2.
