Well, this film is good, as I said, but you definitely need to watch it, as it is worth watching. We are talking about two guys, Mack and Sam, who are good friends and work as fashion photographers, and the laugh time begins when Mack (Akshay Kumar) starts dating 3 flight attendants at the same time, which is suspicious of his wife. Sam reaches a state and almost forgets his friend, but not completely. But Mack thinks so, and so he starts dating flight attendants. At every step of the film there is a garam masala, rock songs, but something is missing. Comedy is not up to par and deserves a reward. This is good, but not so great. Some people laughed to the pain in their stomachs, but this did not deserve so much laughter. But, of course, everyoneâ€™s opinion is different. So, if you want to watch a movie, you can do it.
