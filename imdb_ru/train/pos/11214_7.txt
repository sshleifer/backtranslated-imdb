It was the first film “Walking High,” which I saw, I think, in a $ 2 movie theater on Hollywood Boulevard. So I had no mention of the first release made by Joe Don Baker. I remember being shocked by the corrupt system of McNayri County and the brutality of the “gangs”. I was also struck by the fact that one person decided that he would not allow him to fall, and went to do something about it. Manly? I thought so — to the extent that it made me shiver in my back. <br /> <br /> I think this film is a great story about American courage to get up and do something with a system that only serves its own interests. I was delighted with this, and I think that it is still one of the best films of the hero / anti-hero genre that you can laugh, but includes the latest films, such as The Punisher, but even more so because it’s true story . The recent remake with “Rock” simply does not give due to the real fire in the history of Buford Pusser. <br /> <br /> “Classic”, which I am sure will reappear in the future.
