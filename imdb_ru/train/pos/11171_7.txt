In general, this film was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many future generations. Although the plot is not 100% accurate with respect to the book, in most cases everything is correct. The film skips far ahead and skips some important pieces. I found the book and was ready and immediately wanted them to make a film (because I hadnâ€™t yet learned about the film), but later I found the film in the trash can at Wal-Mart and decided to buy it and see if I expected. In general, I give this film 7 out of 10 for its good parts (relative accuracy and general sense) and its bad parts (big time gaps and small but noticeable inaccuracies).
