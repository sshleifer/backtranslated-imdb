From life in (some) colleges. Of course, artistic licenses were taken, but some of what you saw in this film continues in some colleges. <br /> <br /> I studied at colleges in Southern California, where races mostly hang out with theirs. It's funny because these are schools that want racial unity, equality, etc., and I can honestly say that it is there. But the fact is that when the class lets go or when they just hang out in anticipation of the class, they (the students) seem to just hang out with people of their race or ethnicity. This is bad? Not really. Everyone needs a sense of belonging. But, as in a school newspaper of one of the schools I attended, they once wrote about it: “We all must try to chat with students of other nationalities and try to learn them.” Otherwise, you create your own segregation. <br /> <br /> Racism, of course, existed in one of those schools that I attended. One day, someone laid out leaflets around the campus, talking about the glories of the Aryan race, and had symbols of some of these racist organizations. Fortunately, nothing happened, like the incident in the film, when a young man from the Caucasus left and started shooting at a multiculturalism meeting. <br /> <br /> I can only hope and pray that nothing of the kind will happen. <Br /> <br /> So, “Higher Education” is too dramatic? Exaggerated? May be. Is this the way "out of step"? It depends on where you went or went to school. A race occurs when ethnic groups just hang out with their own. With the exception of Hollywood exaggerations, the race hit me pretty close to home.
