I watched this movie in the preview and found it superb. <br /> <br /> “New York, I love you” is a real novel in the novel, which explores the clever, funny, and sometimes shocking situations around the most powerful emotions of humanity. . <br /> <br /> The cast is huge, real Ocean 11 with Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shea Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. All of them give outstanding performances in one way or another. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the fact that there is someone who directors interweave stories in smart and interesting ways. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapoor, Natalie Portman, I mean - WOW! This film is not just a romance or a romantic comedy, although it is both romantic and fun. It also has serious stories and notes. But this is good, in my opinion. See for yourself and reply to my review, I want to hear what others are saying.
