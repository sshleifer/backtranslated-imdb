The new Pendragon Pictures film “The War of the Worlds by G. G. Wells,” the first true adaptation of the original novel, has been in development for about 5 years. The theater release was scheduled for the beginning of this year (March 2005), but this did not happen. The DVD was released to coincide with the release of Spielberg’s version, which is released in theaters on June 29th. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie with some reservations. <br /> <br /> How true is the adaptation? It is not completely 100% true to the book of Wells, but 90 to 95% true to me is enough. At least a few of the scenes were completely new, for example, the standoff between astronomer Ogilvy and a farmer and an unnamed writer / narrator, awkwardly drank tea with his cousin. But overall, this film follows the book very closely - of course, much more than the classic George Pal version of 1953. <br /> <br /> His biggest mistake was that he was obviously made on a very cheap budget. Most of them seem to have been shot on a blue screen and linked to a digital background. This is especially annoying during most of the internal filming and scenes in crowded city streets. Reviews of London in 1898 are like video games. Numerous scenes in horse-drawn carriages were rigged - I think they could not afford to rent a horse. It seems that the only scenes shot for the "real" are open fields or forests. <br /> <br /> But within these budget constraints, they managed to do quite a lot. Artistically, the film looks right. The Martians and their tripods are pretty well made and very faithful to Wells' descriptions. I was particularly impressed with the heat ray. Although the episode "Thunder of a Child", which was supposed to be one of the highlights of the film, is very disappointing. It is a pity that they could not afford more real sets or better animation. <br /> <br /> The game and the direction will not win a single Oscar. For the most part they are literate, not bad, but not outstanding. The music is also not bad, although not on a par with any of the major Hollywood composers. <br /> <br /> I’m actually glad I didn’t get a theatrical release, because a budget constraint would make it look a lot worse on the big screen. In its current form, I would rate it in the same way as the adaptation of classical literature for BBC-TV. <br /> <br /> A few quibbles: most of the scenes are presented with different color filters (mostly red). Perhaps it was an artistic choice, but it is very inconsistent and more like a sloppy work on the development of DVD. And apparently the fake mustache of the writer / narrator is modified from scene to scene. <br /> <br /> Outcome - Is it worth seeing? If you can forget about the technical and budgetary constraints and delve into the story, I think you will like it, especially if you really read the original novel by G. G. Wells. However, if cheap production figures easily repel you, you better get around this (if you're not a MST3K fan). Keep in mind, however, that the film lasts as much as 3 hours, so I do not recommend watching it all in one go. <br /> <br /> By the way: a completely different version of “War of the Worlds” (“VIEW”)) was released on DVD in the same month when Spielberg went to the cinema: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/. This was also done on a budget, but updated to today, like the Spielberg film - but it is much better! And to top it off, Jeff Wayne shoots an animated film from his bestseller since 1978, but this will not happen until 2007.
