Three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relationship. The base of the triangle is hardly there. At the top is Marie, a serious, short and thin tomboy with a belmondo-like face structure. Her best friend - the physical and psychological opposite: flirty, plump - I dare say, fat, and she wants the first kiss with the boy, but not quite ready for her first sexual encounter. Because of her puffiness, the boys don't seem to be interested, and that hurts her. <br /> <br /> Another top leg is a beautiful blonde vampire "fille fatale". She actively participates in sports competitions in synchronized swimming at a competitive level. Marie sees her during a competition in a local public pool. Marie introduces herself into the life of a vampire, using as an argument the desire to become a synchronized swimmer. The vamp has a reputation for being a sluts, who knows any young man who revolves around her. Marie does not lag behind this reputation. Focus on reputation. <br /> <br /> The first half is set. We will see a lot of synchronized swimming when we meet three girls. In the end, the narrative leaves synchronized swimming behind and concentrates on the inverted relations between the three. That's when unexpected things start happening. <br /> <br /> This is a trademark of French films that throws pieces of wisdom at the viewer. This one is no exception. Here we are talking about ceilings and dying. Watch the movie to find out more. <br /> <br /> The director says that using synchronized swimming is advisable. This women's sport is a metaphor for a girl's life: beautiful and feminine on the surface, hardworking and competitive. This is facilitated by a series of scenes: graceful movements and smiles to the public, clumsily kicking the feet under the water. The French name also suggests: “prieuve,” or octopus, which means that a person has to simultaneously manipulate many pressures.
