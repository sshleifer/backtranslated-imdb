This is a very unusual film in which the star with the best billing does not appear literally to the middle. However, I was involved in the Ghost Lady trap. Curtis, although competent as the falsely accused Scott Henderson, looks a bit tough to be sympathetic (perhaps he should have shaved his mustache), and his behavior when he first comes home should have convinced the police to While another commentator had problems with Franchott Ton as Jack Marlow, I discovered that his character image was impressively complex. He is not a stock villain. The magnificent actor Elisha Cook Jr. is again in great shape, like “a little man with big ambitions”. His drumming in musical numbers added a desirable touch of erotica. This film, however, is filmed by a very capable and pretty Ella Raines, as the devotee will be Henderson's lover, Carol Richmond. She definitely has talent, and her presence on the screen is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. This is the first of her works that I have seen, and I am definitely inclined to see her other roles. The rest of the cast is also more than competent. In general, a very pleasant film noir secret, which, when viewed today, fully conveys the dark and complex urban world for which it is intended. Recommended, 8/10.
