Something in Poli has touched my heart, as few films do. This is a witty, funny, but emotional film. I was late becoming a fan of this movie. I did not see “Poly” until May 2004 and since then I have ordered a widescreen DVD from an eBay seller. <br /> <br /> The conversation effects of Pauli are superb. My son asked me how a bird knows so many phrases. Probably my favorite part of the movie, when Paulie is accompanied by Jena Rowlands (Ivy) and then Cheech Marin (Ignacio) Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays an excellent role as a kindhearted person. You cheer for him throughout the film. <br /> <br /> You can’t go wrong by renting or buying this movie !!
