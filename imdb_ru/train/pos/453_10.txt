I always tell people that “Enchanted April” is a film for adults without curses, sex and violence. Some might think that this is a “perfect chick click”, but I bet that there are one or two enlightened people who also love it. Do not invite children. This film is very discreet. <br /> <br /> Watching Enchanted April is a very rewarding experience. The sound track and magnificent landscapes, as well as gentle feminine manners remind of the silence and beauty of the picture of the Dorafaelites. <br /> <br /> So that no one would think that you really watch only one movie, paraphrase a line that I once heard on “Saturday Night Live” and say that my two favorite films are “The Deer Hunter” and "Enchanted April."
