In the classic sense of four humors (which are not specific to the concept of fun or even entertainment), Altman "H.E.A.L.T.H." applies to all humors, and in fact very funny, entertaining. This sputum is embodied in the slow, cautious and protective nature of Lauren Bacall Esther Brill, whose life mission seems to be in appearance, protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well-being. There is a choleric Paul Dooley, Dr. Gil Ganey, who loves fish out of the water (perhaps more like a seal), staggering frantically, barking and encouraging crowds to join his water insanity. Isabella Garnell's Melancholy Glenda Jackson smacks of the restless and complacent Hamlet of Shakespeare - even offering a monologue or two. And let's not forget about the bilious character of Henry Gibson, Bobby Hammer ("The breast that feeds the child, rules the world"). Then there are the characters Harry Wolf and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett, respectively), relatively sensible characters seeking to find some kind of balance between all the companions and extreme humors that have gathered for X. E.AL.T.H. - a kind of world trade organization specializing in H.E.A.L.T.H., which should say something other than health. This is Altman in their best classic.
