A very good war film showing the impact of the war on a boy from his hometown who loses his sight on Guadalcanal and should return home and restructure with the help of family and friends. An excellent cast helps make this film very interesting. The role of Eleanor Parker as a friend was worthy of an Oscar nomination. She has such innocence in this film. The role of Ann Doran was equally satisfactory, as were all of her small minor roles. I especially like the aura of the hometown of pre-war Philadelphia. The hunting scene is very good. Of course, the scene of the Guadalcanal war really showed the horror that our soldiers encountered during this epic battle. A well-deserved film and one that should not be forgotten.
