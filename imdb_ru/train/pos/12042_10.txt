........... as I was when I saw this movie) I will never watch this movie again, not because this is a bad movie, but because it scared me so much! As I said, I was 14 years old when my English teacher decided to show it to us; The reason for this is that we have read an excerpt from the book. <br /> <br /> All the girls in my class were terrified when the Woman in Black enters the window and swims over Kidd’s bed, although just before there is something that also scared us when Kidd I found a toy soldier under the pillow and heard a child’s voice say: "This is for you." This scene still haunts me to this day, after almost 7 YEARS after I watched the movie. <br /> <br /> If you get scared easily, AVOID THIS FILM !!!!!!!!
