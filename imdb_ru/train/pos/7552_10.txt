CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary manga Nekojiru. He received the Best Short Film Award at the 6th Fantasia Film Festival and also received the Outstanding Achievement Award at the Media Arts Festival in Japan. <br /> <br /> When the death of the little kitten Nyaako stole due to death, she and her brother Nyatta set off on a strange journey to return him. In the surrealistic landscape of dreams, on the other hand, they encounter many fantastic characters and wonderful, often disturbing adventures. <br /> <br /> CAT SOUP is an anime that you have never seen. This is Hello Kitty on acid! It is very original, amazingly beautiful and has a great sense of strangeness and lyrics. CAT SOUP is very surreal (no dialogue), and sometimes cruel. So this is more anime for adults than for children (they may not understand at all!). Great trip for those who get a chance to see this absolute masterpiece. Be sure to take a look!
