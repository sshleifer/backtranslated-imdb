Intriguing. Exciting. Dramatic. Explosive. Complicated. Epic. Words that relate only to the tip of the iceberg from the point of view of the great story, which is told by LOST. <br /> <br /> From acting to rare visual effects, LOST is a must-see television show for science lovers. - Fantasy, fantasy, thriller, adventure, and many, many mysteries. <br /> <br /> Each cast is so well chosen and so good in its roles that you either love them, or hate them, or directly wish them to die. <br /> <br /> Visual effects, when used (which is rare), are actually quite well made, given the usual production of the show. Be it a “smoke monster” for polar bears, LOST is believable from the point of view of eye candies. <br /> <br /> With regard to history, nothing can compare with the enormous complexity that the show showed the audience I endure. Starting from the end, the continuity is almost perfect, the characters evolve, and the constantly evolving story slowly provides answers to their questions that so many crave. <br /> <br /> In general, there are practically no flaws in LOST. It does for drama / sci-fi television what Arrested Development did for the comedy: it set the bar. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend LOST to those who are patient, intelligent, and love every moment of the trip, no matter how long it takes to get to the end. <br /> <br /> Watch this show.
