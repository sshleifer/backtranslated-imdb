One of my favorite shows in the 70s. As I recall, he went on the air on Friday (or, possibly, on Saturday) on the Nine Network (?) On the network here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great together. <br /> <br /> Each episode usually culminated when Kolchak had to engage in hand-to-hand combat with some supernatural opponent. To their credit, the authors made concerted efforts to get as far away from the usual circle of vampires and ghosts as possible. <br /> <br /> I remember one episode in which the enemy was the spirit of an ancient Indian leader who / who "returned" in the form of a powerful electric current, which began to kill people in the city hospital. At the last autopsy, Kolchak tried to close the "powerful beast" amid an explosion of sparks and a flaming flame. Oh well ... you should have been there at the time, but it was an interesting idea. <br /> <br /> McGavin always put a lot of effort and enthusiasm into his roles, and this was one of his best. <br /> Definitely deserves a place in the "Hall of Fame" television. According to Tony Vincenzo ... "Kolchak, YOU ARE ON THIS" ... Or, in the case of the Hall of Fame, "In it"!
