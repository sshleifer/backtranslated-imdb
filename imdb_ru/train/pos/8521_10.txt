I really enjoyed this show. I watched it from the time it aired in the late 90s until the very last episode. In my honest opinion, it was a great family drama that is so rare these days. Definitely a show that you could watch with a friend or your children. Yes, with Joe, things have changed a little since the last time we saw her in books, but she is still irresistible with good stories and good lessons. The actress who portrays Joe Baer (Michelle Burke) does an excellent job as an actor who plays Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort). Throughout the series, we see the developing novel by Joe and Nick, as well as daily stories and lessons, children and students learn. I recommend this show to everyone.
