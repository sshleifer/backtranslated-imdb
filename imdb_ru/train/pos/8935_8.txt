“The Offender (L'Intrus)” is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life. <br /> <br /> White-haired Michel Suborus plays "Louis Trebora", like Jason Bourne, as an old man with a hidden past, living just in an isolated hut in the forest for legitimate paranoid reasons (but attracting pretty young women who might be helpful for him). We learn more about him through dreams, memories and travels that can unfold in chronological order or not, as well as through his rude relationship with his family, lovers, business partners and a startling enemy. Like The Limey, the film resonates with the regrets of parents and children and a suspicious past revealed in clips from an old film with the same actor as the young man (here, Paul Gegouf’s adventure film 1965, Le Reflux). <br /> <br /> In complete contrast of sentiment we meet his son Sidney (Gregoire Colin), who should be the sexiest domestic husband in the world, as he sweetly and seductively takes care of home repairs and cares for the child, baby and all the rest . need his working wife. Of course, Claire Denis, the director / co-author of the film, must have created it as a feminine fantasy, if there ever was one lesson for other directors about the filming of a prelude. There is another extended scene where he is looking for his father in the forest, carefully carrying his angel child in his bag. He is all that his father is not, and he has every relationship that his father is not capable of supporting; no wonder he thinks his father is "crazy." I spent the rest of the film in fear that something bad would happen to him, since the true nature of the heart of his estranged father is very gradually playing out before our eyes. <br /> <br /> The film is a puzzle, but the Subor mercilessly fascinates when we watch him cross the country and negotiate vile deals, and Denis’s “Beau Travail” voice-over irritated anyway. We have to figure out the horizon lines and random designations that it travels to Geneva, Korea and the South Pacific. The passage of time is indicated by the change of seasons, the creation of scars and healing. There are many images of water for purification and removal. <br /> <br /> Continuing her fascination with the transformation of colonialism into globalization, as well as playing a little on the stereotypes of the mysterious East and Russian criminals, Denis included elements from Tahiti Robert Louis Stevenson, Paul Gauguin and Marlon Brando. idylls and the 40-page memoirs of the French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, the last for the title and plot of a heart transplant used for the ironic theme of limited immortality, which has consequences. <br /> <br /> Although “Louis” thinks that he managed to transcend the boundaries, rules and morals, there is some entertainment in the last act, as the locals do not quite know what to do with it and try to help him decide his odd odyssey, even if he lies in isolation again. <br /> <br /> Several people in the audience became disillusioned with the elliptical but strikingly beautiful story-telling method. An unconventional story raises many plot questions on the details.
