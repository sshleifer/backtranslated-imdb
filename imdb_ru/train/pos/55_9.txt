At first, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to see this film when it appeared in my guidebook, so I looked at IMDb and thought that the cover looked pretty cool, so I decided to try to watch a movie like Elephant. <br /> <br /> As soon as I realized the fact that I didn’t like the character of Alicia, who was well-played by Busy Phillips, I realized what a good job this film did to establish the relationship between Alicia and Dinnoy. Alicia is so cruel to Deanne that Erica Christensen plays almost throughout the entire film, but we end up finding that, despite the polar opposite, they have one thing in common, besides being on the set. They share the loneliness and the extent to which this is revealed during the film. <br /> <br /> I just said how much I liked this film, and I was glad to see all the positive reviews about it. I could not even get through the Elephant, because he seemed to be using the tragedy of Columbine. This film, on the other hand, was convincing and realistic. Actor Busy Phillips is offline! This is good, and I would like to see her progress in more mature roles.
