I am afraid that it was a film that you MUST WATCH to extract something from it. This is not a meaningless film, such as ..... "LEATHAL WEAPON PART 58", do you know where Riggs is really crazy? This is not a film that at the end is almost the same as the beginning. You can run around, talk on the phone, do what ever, and enjoy it in any way. In the past, I have noticed that for most people who do not like this type of film, this is the type that will do most, except to watch a movie, and then clap it because ..... yes, they do not understand it or not understand or what happened. <br /> <br /> DO NOT ALLOW YOUR DOG TO ACCEPT SOUL !!!
