If you saw this movie, you were in Puerto Rico. I lived in Puerto Rico all my life, and I must shamefully admit that we (PR people) are now living in real chaos, and drugs are the main cause of the shootings and murders that we commit almost every day. These people will shoot at anyone, anytime, anywhere, and because of this, many innocent people have died. We no longer feel safe, and in addition to this, our so-called “justice” no longer moves truth and truth, but money, influence and power. Ladrons and Mentirosos are based on real, regrettable facts and truly depict the three main problems of Puerto Rico: drug-related killings, money and power manipulation in our courtrooms, as well as innocent people and children are corrupted because of this and even die. Ricardo and his wife, Pauly, with their realistic storyline and their awards (**), were brave enough to present it as bad as it is: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country living in a nightmare that doesn't seem to ends !!! ** They recently received the Brass Wing award for Best Director in the 2006 World Cinema Competition at the Phoenix Film Festival.
