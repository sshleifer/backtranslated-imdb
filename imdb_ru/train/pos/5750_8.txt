But the rest of us who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a castle for you to cry ... enjoy! <br /> <br /> Tom Hulse is great in the role of Dominic, a mentally retarded scavenger who loves professional wrestling, and his brother Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and works very long hours. <br /> <br /> Due to the work schedule of Eugene Dominic, most of the time is left alone and inclined to make dubious judgments. He really just wants to be a good boy, do the right thing and make his brother proud. He stops at church to pray at some point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the hero makes you cry even before this damned movie really begins. <br /> <br /> I am not going to give anything here, but the film is extremely exciting, sad and heartbreaking. Those who are not afraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story, its loving characters and a wonderful song that I cannot quote here, which has nothing to do with the film at all, but is strangely relevant ... but you hear it in the bar . <br /> <br /> I thought that Tom Hulse would be nominated for this film, since it was for Amadeus, I thought that this would give him the opportunity to win. There is no such luck. Liotta is just as good, but has less emotional impact, but then does it later. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she does not play a special role here, but it was very nice that she gave her name to a small dramatic production in Pittsburgh about two brothers whom you will never forget.
