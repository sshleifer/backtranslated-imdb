I really like this film, but itâ€™s a fact that you cannot understand it if you are not from the former Yugoslavia. Most of the actors are now dead, and these were the best actors in the former Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this film is now on Divx, and I can have it in my collection. Macedonia Serbia Montenegro Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia. Slovenia. <br /> <br /> All this was the former Yugoslavia, the melting pot of the Balkan peoples. It can be a country of dreams, if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists do not poison the mind of the nation with their sick ideas.
