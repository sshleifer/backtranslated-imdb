First of all, I was never afraid of this undervalued pearl in childhood (“The Little Mermaid” on the other hand ...). As my name implies, it was one of my favorite children's films that I still love as a teenager. This is a beautiful, bitter-sweet film about an unhappy German shepherd named Charlie (fantastically voiced by Bert Reynolds) who was killed by his boss / crime partner (name is ha, ha - this is Carfeis). Charlie goes straight to heaven by default, because "all dogs go to heaven, because unlike people, dogs are naturally good, loyal and kind." Chali was sent back to Earth because he spent his life hours where he receives even more damage with his best friend, Itch and the little orphan girl, Anne-Marie. I watched it all the time as a child, and sometimes I still watch it. In any case, as I said, this is a beautiful, bitter-sweet film that can just leave tears in your eyes ...
