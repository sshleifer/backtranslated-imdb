This is one of those films that feel good on a Saturday afternoon. It's right there with other retro movies like Flight of the Navigator. Just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to light things up. And it's interesting to see how such stars as Kelly Preston and Leah Thompson have changed in 20 years. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix. <br /> <br /> I personally like these films from time to time. Nothing too deep or too scary. Just a good storyline. And I would never know Mr. Phoenix, if I had not recently read the captions. In fact, he was still a kid when he starred in this movie. <br /> <br /> Kelly Preston was also a rather young aspiring actress. She and Leia did a wonderful job in this film. I agree that this is not an Oscar film. But it is very worth seeing. Especially if you have children, say, between the ages of 8 and 11 years. Or those who are interested in the space program.
