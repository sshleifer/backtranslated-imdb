It's not always easy to explain what a movie looks like, but this time I think I found it. It reminded me of two films: Trainspotting (petty criminals making drugs and doing stupid things in Scotland) and The Blair Witch Project (because of the style of filming). <br /> <br /> It is about loyalty between two friends, one of them is released from prison, the other has not yet been caught. In a stolen car, they drive through the Scottish countryside, but gasoline is enough. When they try to find fuel, they find a farm off the beaten path. The farmer thinks they want to rob him and points the gun at one of them. Than everything goes wrong. One of the friends accidentally shoots a farmerâ€™s daughter, and they have to flee. This is followed by the hunt for humans through the fields and forests of Scotland. Two friends literally have to run for their lives. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this film was shot in just 12 days. Well, this is not entirely unbelievable, because most of it is always in the same place: in the Scottish countryside, but I still find it quite amazing. Especially since this is actually not a bad movie. Perhaps this is not the best movie ever, but they can still be proud of what they have achieved. I had a good time watching it, and in general I liked the movie. I give it 7/10.
