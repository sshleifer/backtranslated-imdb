This film has become better than the usual fighter, and in this respect they have succeeded. In this film, there was impressive cinematography with breathtaking mountain snow and heights, a very good role for Stallone, a fascinating plot and a magnificent plot. the performance of his main villain, because he really shocks you with his evil ways. The film is not rated all the time as great because of the weak game on the screen. The plot and the story cry for this film to make Stallone a special person, very similar to the heroes of the movie "Rambo", "Rocky" or "Bond." They decided to humanize Stallone’s character in this film, which is normal, but, given the plot style, weakens the excitement factor. Also the dialogue was vicious and carelessly condescending. realistic and less "talkative". Another weak point was unrealistic shooting scenes. The filmmakers had to be more careful how they dealt with film hits and misses. They had to continue the quality of the scenes of the shooting scenes during the hijacking of the aircraft at the beginning of the film. Instead, they decided to flood many shooting episodes (the “A-Team” series) as soon as the villains set foot on Mountain Peaks. This film had a lot of potential all the time. Clearer sequences of action, better dialogue, and more emotion / determination in the Rambo / Rocky style from Stallone would take this film to a higher level. I know it is not Stallone’s fault. I feel that the director of the film wanted to soften the character of Stallone and try to steal the film, taking into account his leadership, which was not so great, if not for his cinematographer. Although, a good movie ........
