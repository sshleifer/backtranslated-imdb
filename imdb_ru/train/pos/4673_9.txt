In this film, I was most interested in how characters and related stories evolve on the fly. I guess the authors wanted us to become interested in the characters, not forcibly feeding their characters. The premise of using art and craft in the design and manufacture of furniture was a unique theme and / or analogy of what family / siblings go through in life. The difficulty of the twin serving as a surrogate father and even a husband added a great deal of stress to making this film emotionally interesting. In addition, although the story was not one to which the masses could have a direct relationship (i.e. Jewish / twin / family business), the themes are fairly universal, as there is a black sheep in every family. It made him very attractive.
