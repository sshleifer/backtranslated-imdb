Who doesn't know Largo Vinca in the France-Belgium-Luxembourg trio (three countries where French "BD" or "Bandes Dessin√©es" are widely published)? 18 years after the publication of the first comic, which itself is an adaptation of a series of novels, it MUST be adapted on screens. After the first and unsuccessful attempt with the TV show begins the present. <br /> <br /> First of all, most of the fans did not achieve this, the goal of this film is not to adapt the comic strip series entirely. Some important parts, characters and actions of the original are missing. The film itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a fan of the 1st grade comic, I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised. The actors are as good as the script, although it may seem too fast. Therefore, I recommend this film to anyone interested in financial / political thrillers, but it is clearly not an alternative to the James Bond series or Jason Bourne because I could read on the Internet.
