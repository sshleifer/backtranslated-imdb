The murder diagnosis was shown on most days of the week on BBC1 since I watched it 10 years ago when I was sick at school — I know that I don’t really like it, just as I shouldn’t enjoy the “Murder Wrote. "But I am completely addicted to both and even have DVD sets ... Well, I know it's sad!" <br /> <br /> Dick Van Dyke leads the show, acting as Dr. Mark Sloan Physician in the Public Los Angeles General Hospital, which is also a Los Angeles Police Police Consultant - his son Steve (Barry van Dyke - Dick's real son) is a police officer who needs his father's help in so many suspicious deaths. <br /> <br /> Dr. Amanda Bentley, a General Community pathologist, is involved in the trip and during the first few seasons you had Scott Baio, who played Dr. Jaak Stewart, who rose and left the series in 1995, hoping to do something big and better ... he had to stay where he was from he did not do anything remarkable ... and his only theatrical appearance for many their age was in the "Baby Geniuses 2: Superbabies" .... Oh dear !!! <br /> <br /> In any case, Dr. Jack Stewart was replaced by the younger Dr. Jesse Travis, who was played by Charlie Schlatter, who stepped quite comfortably on Bayo's shoes. <br /> <br /> The series is incredibly implausible, but why not the show Whodunit? (The murder she wrote is wherever Jessica walks, someone ends in death, or the Undervalued Mr. Dowling Dowling about the murder revealing the Priest with a nun girlfriend) <br /> <br /> Until 1997, the series was much brighter than the actor The lineup that included the awkward hospital manager Norman Briggs, played by Michael Tucci along with Nurse & Mark’s secretary Dolores, played by Delores Hall. After 1997, both of these characters were no longer included, and the series became tougher, with a larger budget. The episodes included much more action, one episode in which the entire hospital exploded. <br /> <br /> This was a family show for Van Dyke, because, like Dick’s son Barry, you also had Dick’s Daughter and all his grandchildren who made appearances in various episodes. <br /> <br /> As the series went on, it became a bit silly, one episode that I remember, Dick van Dyk plays his whole family, which was a bit unusual, but overall “Diagnostic Murder” was a really good TV show, which had a lot of good guest stars. <br /> <br /> After this show ended in 2001, Dick and Barry reappeared together on the TV series 'MURDER 101', filmed on the Hallmark Channel. many follow the same path, and yet enjoyable. Dick, who is now over 80, does not seem to have changed much and looks as if he will work to the bitter end. <br /> <br /> TV SHOW **** OUT OF *** **
