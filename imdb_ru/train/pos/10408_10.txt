I first saw this film when I was a small child and immediately fell in love with it. The shooting is breathtaking, and some of the scenarios are damn funny: "You, sons of a thousand fleas." <br /> <br /> He is always shown on TV late at night or really early in the morning when I wake up at about 3 am once and it just started. TV companies need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time on Sunday, so that everyone has a chance to see this wonderful work. <br /> <br /> 10/10
