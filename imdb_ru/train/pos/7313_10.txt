Some spoilers If you are a big fan of horror films, then you will know that Halloween has paved the way for many slasher films. This film, which is often imitated, never dubbed, is a true classic of horrors and, of course, one of the worst films ever made, if not the worst. <br /> <br /> I really saw this movie after watching the rest of the series (don't ask me why). I honestly saw the remaining 7 films before I saw this one, that's just how it turned out. But I would have to say that this one takes all the rest away. It's really scary, and the sight of Michael jumping out from behind a bush or walking in the dark causes a cold down your spine. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael hits the guy and tilts his head to the side. This is one of the most terrible pictures in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Later slashers, such as Friday 13, were more fun and less intense than this movie. I like the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this one movie is better than all the F13 movies. Michael Myers is such a terrible villain, because he is a realist, you can imagine such a crazy guy like him who kills people. I admit that this film gave me nightmares after watching a few nights. <br /> <br /> What's good about this film is that it does not rely on blood or humor to entertain the audience. This is just pure horror. It is a pity that the later films of the series have been shaken by this, because itâ€™s just as good an example of an impressive slasher film as they are.
