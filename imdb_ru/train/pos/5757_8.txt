This film could only appear in the 1970s !! This is a strange action movie in a small California town of workers. Some mill or factory is shutting down, so suddenly unrestrained bad behavior occurs on the streets! Citizens are fed up! So, Ben Arnold (Ian Michael Vincent) goes to another city to recruit his brother Aaron, played by Chris Christopherson. Aaron is a Vietnamese Veterinarian who looks and acts a little unbalanced. He hangs out with a bunch of other dismal Vietnamese vets. They come to the city to clean it (they become deputies), but thanks to their good deeds, they actually manage the gambling houses, ask for money for protection, etc. !!! People need time to gain popularity, and in the biblical confrontation of Cain and Abel, Vincent must take his elder brother. In this film there is an interesting atmosphere of the evil eye, which makes it interesting (pay attention to the scene of cockfighting!). Vincent is almost too angelic in this role ?? he values ​​his brother so highly that he cannot imagine that he is doing the evil things that he is accused of. Does he finally come to his senses ?? his girlfriend, Victoria Principal, was severely wounded in the back, and he was beaten in his house. Chris Christofferson, like Aaron, is very effective. He calmly denies any wrongdoing and even cooing gently and talking to Vincent's young daughter (she calls him "Uncle Aaron"), even when he threatens his father's life, smiling all the time! Vincent and Christofferson have good contrast chemistry with each other. Bernadette Peters looks like an interesting saloon girl who attracts the attention of Aaron. This is a good 70s action movie, if you can find it! Is it not available on DVD yet ??
