This film is fascinating for its beauty and creativity. The artist's deep vision, his art, which intuitively flows from his natural source, brings us inspirational Hosanna, mixing his creations with trees, white water spurting over stones, fields and rain ... Andy Goldsworthy makes the viewer feel the joy of life, realizing that we are all made of clay from this glorious land. He does not spare us his random disappointment, but in general we see a miracle in the combination of art and nature. Of course, this is the merit and director Thomas Riedelsheimer, who with incredible sensuality and perfect time shot, photographed and edited the film. <br /> <br /> If you have a sense of beauty, nature and art ... do not miss this fantastic movie!
