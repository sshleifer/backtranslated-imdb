Cypher is a movie that is worth seeing because it is not an ordinary science fiction film. The artistic approach is colored by dark scenes and a kind of macro-look at what is happening. The close-up view is how the director makes the plot ghostly. The sci-fi aspect of the film is secondary to the plot of the film. The technology used in the film is not very impressive, but the director makes good use of props. <br /> <br /> Character development is intentionally superficial. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to plunge into the world of espionage. The audience must find out its mysterious nature, and it is this riddle that interests the audience to the very end.
