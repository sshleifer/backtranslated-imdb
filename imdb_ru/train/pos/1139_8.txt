There are few similar comedies, where almost every line and every character is close to perfect. This is soooo funny !! And there is a bit of satire. Sally Field leads the field of truly outstanding actors and does a good, if not perfect, job with her daytime television diva. Sometimes her acting is too wide and excessive, but in 90% of cases she rebels! In the same league, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr. and Whoopi Goldberg (unfortunately, there is little that can be done). Downey Jr. may not be entirely convincing as a comedian and does not always have the right time, but he struggles with his part, which, frankly, is the most ungrateful. But the shining star here is Katie Moriarty in the role of Celeste, a real bitch if ever having existed with more than one nasty secret (you will see in a completely stunning finale!) parties. I usually like Ms. Shu, but here she acts like a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be shot in another movie. But this is not something destructive and for the most part it is, at least, adequate. Otherwise, this comedy can be seen, filling in with memorable lines and situations, wherever you are on TV or wherever.
