Shamefully, before I saw this film, I was unfamiliar with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> I had to do some research to make sure she didnâ€™t really suffer, like her character, with (well?) that she was amazed. I was delighted with this beautiful lady. She did it perfectly. <br /> <br /> Who would have thought that the sexually explicit circumstances associated with the ultimate desires and needs of a unique young lady can be interpreted as tender and romantic? Well, they can be when the right performers present them properly, as they did in this great movie. I forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful Miss Carter looked in this film. I often said that she was the most beautiful creature that ever graced the face of our land, but she seems to have succeeded in this particular film. <br /> <br /> I hope that any of you who watch this movie enjoy the same way as I do. Thank you for letting me express your opinion.
