This is one of those little Christmas movies for everyone. Our Scrooge is Ben Affleck, who decides that there is not enough money, so he rents a family that lives where, he thought, his family. OK? This is a great little school soap, PG-13, but small sexual references are comedy, so if your child can't handle them, he can't live in the real world either. <br /> <br /> Now, Affleck is a piece, and, as usual, goes through this fun, OMG, remember when we did it ... the ensemble play, as if it were in the final stages of some neuroinfectious disease . But this is normal, because even this old Oracle continues to hope that if Ben is so well proportioned, well, we, ladies, still have hope. Fortunately, the rest of the ensemble - Katharina O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman - fill and save this Christmas shadow Ozzy-Harriet alternately fun, comfortable and warm. br /> <br /> This film is that you can jump and get popcorn, and when you return, everyone will want to support him to show you that you missed. <br /> <br /> This is, after all, a happy movie, and it leaves you enjoying the life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. There really is something for everyone.
