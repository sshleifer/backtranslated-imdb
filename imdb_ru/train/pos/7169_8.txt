As a rule, "children's" films have some annoying quality, which makes it too full and unbearable for a person over 13 years old. But, again, this is before the Hole appears on the scene. Of course, there are the same moments in it that often give the above-mentioned quality to a children's film, but this film does a good job avoiding such agreements. The game was decent, and the uneasy dynamics that Stanley had with some other tourists was more realistic than what most films are trying to portray. What I particularly liked about this film is that this film did not try to break your heart or make you cry. Emotional power was a bit more natural than many could imagine, much like the "Atonement of the Shoushenk" (Holes also have a similar, redemptive end). The only drawback? Hockey lizards. Overall, however, 8/10.
