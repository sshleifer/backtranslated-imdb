New York, 2022: greenhouse effect, disappeared oceans, increasing unemployment and a shortage of water, electricity and food ... and the population of New York exceeded 40 million. This is a small gem of a painting, not least because the depleted future is a reality for us, citizens of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> Low-budget opening credits of this film are great: a set of music, a low-tech “tape-slide” consisting entirely of archival footage from the beginning of photography until 1973, depicts an untouched American pastoral transformed into a polluted and populous hell in less than 2 minutes. Compressed and unambiguous, it is truly unforgettable. Budget constraints are also behind the rather unimaginable cinematography and other constraints, which is at odds with the brilliant premise of the plot. The sequence of the police station looks like an episode of a television detective show of the 70s, and the rest of the interior sets look simple at best. Probably the entire budget continued to try to “futures” the Chelsea West apartment of Soylent's executive director with modern delicacies, which means that other costumes are casual, some of the pictures are of extraordinary density, and daytime exteriors are apparently all shot . smoke filter. <br /> <br /> A memorable scene in which Saul and Thorn (Charlton Heston) share a meal of expensive and rare foods, neatly summarizes their society: they enjoy real bourbon, salad, celery, tomatoes, apples and beef, and we really We feel how amazingly someone’s rich privileges value them. <br /> <br /> The main scene of Robinson's death, in which his hero willingly dies in a place called “The House”, depicts him as immersed in images of the once beautiful flora and fauna in the world, as he remembered them, contrasts well with the conscious dawn Thorn's saying that the future went bankrupt, among other horrors. <br /> <br /> This is one smart movie and its main idea is as relevant today as it was in the early 1970s. Yes, I know that we are not eating the dead, but with our unrealized longevity, the growing gap in poverty, corporate global capitalism and uncontrolled habitat destruction leading to climate change, the steady forecast of “Soylent Green” can occur.
