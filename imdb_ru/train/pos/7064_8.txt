Dina Durbin really saved Universal from bankruptcy and allowed her to remain a big studio. By the mid-1930s, most of the major directors who worked for Universal, such as Milestone, Browning, and Wyler, were gone. Only James Weil is left, but his prestigious horror films are left behind. Dina and Judy Garland appeared in the short "Every Sunday", and initially Garland was offered the role of Penny in "Three Smart Girls". When Garland was unavailable, the Wagon switched to Durbin. Initially, she was definitely a supporting player, but her potential was so vivid that the script was rewritten to make her a star. Directed by Henry Koster filmed a film in European style. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a beautiful panorama of the lake "Switzerland". "Three smart girls" in the title - three sisters, Joan (Nan Gray), Kay (Barbara Reed) and Penny (Dina Durbin) swim with Penny, giving their glorious voice "My heart sings." Everything is not so good in the rear - their father plans to marry a younger woman (Binnie Barnes), so the three girls, with the help of their faithful nurse (Lucille Watson), decided to go to New York and reunite him with their mother. Lucille Watson is best remembered for her role as the harsh mother of Robert Taylor in Waterloo Bridge (1941). <br /> <br /> Donna is a gold digger who, along with her poor mother (Alice Brady), is full of determination. marry Judson Craig (Charles Winninger). For those who have no experience in cinema, Deanna is as lovely as Penny, a typical annoying, overly enthusiastic younger sister, and she is as beautiful as a painting. When she sings "Someone Who Cares for Me" to her father, you just melt away - what a glorious voice she had. She also has one of the funniest lines in the movie. When her father comforts her with the words "I will take you to the zoo tomorrow," she replies: "Oh, I see enough monkeys here" !!! <br /> <br /> With the help of Bill Evans (John King, they decided to hire a “count” (Misha Auer) for Donna's romance. They agree to meet at a nightclub, but because of the confusion, Lord Michael Stewart (Ray Milland) is mistaken at the expense, and Donna falls in love with him (she thinks he owns half of Australia !!!). Kay and Donna want to speed up their marriage with Judson. <br /> <br /> Penny decides to take matters into his own hands and runs away. She is taken to the local police station, where she charms the cops with her performance of Il Bacio (she tries to convince them that she is a young operatic I am a singer.) Everything ends well with the fact that their mother (Nella Walker) sailed on the patch of affairs with their father, and in the meantime Donna meets a fake count (Misha Auer) and goes with him to Australia. <br /> <br / > Highly recommended.
