Girlfight is like your grandmother's cooking: the same old recipe you've tried a million times before, but somehow turned into something fresh and new. Try to explain the story to people who have not seen it before: young women on the wrong side of the tracks are trying to improve their situation by doing boxing, dealing with a bitter, obstructive father and her growing attractiveness to a male opponent, See how they roll their eyes on a string of cliches , and they are right: this is * clich√© *. However, I was hypnotized by how well this film works, because of the often excellent action and dialogue, and the sensitive direction that makes it "new." I avoided it in the movie because it looked like complete nonsense, but I did not make the same mistake as me. Definitely worth a look.
