I saw this movie in childhood. And 10 years later, I did not remember anything about this film, but I found out about it, I also do not know how I managed to recognize this film. This is my life. My favorite movie of all time. My words do not correspond to the true meaning of what I have for this film. I am watching this movie. This is a brilliant mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror, erotica, scary and martial arts. The story of the power of love is quite touching and warm. This is a masterpiece of Hong Kong cinema. <br /> <br /> Sinna Yauman is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made in the film. Written by Sunling Pu and directed by Siu-Tung Ching, there is everything in The History of Chinese Ghosts. Lin Choi Sin, played by Leslie Cheung, is a young man who was unlucky and who goes in search of a monastery for an overnight stay in the depths of the forest, where residents seem to be very afraid of approaching. One trip is dangerous for wolves, and a crazy Taoist monk lives in the temple. <br /> <br /> Lin Choi Sin meets Qing, a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in an abandoned temple. She is forced to seduce men for her evil lover, but when she meets innocent Lin Choi Xing, they fall in love. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Xing is a clumsy fool, but his heart is in the right place, while Qing is trying to protect him from other spirits in the forest, he is trying to protect her from a monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the forest . There are great martial arts, even a monk, who starts a drunken song when performing ritual forms of Taoist swords. The film has a lot of traditional martial arts films on acrobatics, with magic and flying through the air, from tree to tree jumping, with elegant long dresses and scarves, but the film is genuinely flowing, and everything is effective. <br /> Qing should be married to an evil monster on a tree, which cannot be good, and we feel her plight in her house, where we meet her sisters and stepmother, who is not really cute. <br /> <br /> In the end, they have to fight the tree witch in a deadly language and go with Yin deep in the heart of hell to fight the evil a thousand years ago to save their souls and bring Ling's ashes back to her home for proper burial so that she can chance reincarnation. <br /> <br /> A wonderful story that really pays attention to the details. This film has touched you in many ways, you will laugh, cry and just enjoy the great martial arts and cinematography. And although at the end of Yin and Lin Choi Xing leave for the morning sun under a charming rainbow, we will never know if Qing was reincarnated, but we know it.
