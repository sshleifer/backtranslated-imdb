I am not a big fan of martial arts films, but the video store was almost empty, and Jet Li was in Deadly Weapon 4, and I got it for free when I made other films that I made, in any case, I rented them. I really liked it, my roommate and I (22-year-old students studying biochemistry and accounting) spent half an hour after the film made strange sounds of kung-fu and threw beer shurikens at each other. I can't explain it (well, maybe a little tequila). I never liked Bruce Lee, the skinny guy kicked a big guy, beat him, kicked a big guy, etc. The film ends. Think Jackie Chan, with less comedy and more action.
