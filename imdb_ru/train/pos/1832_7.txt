Over the weekend I watched two films, one of which was “kaal” and the other one was “Waqt”. Both films were made in Bollywood, but these are different worlds. The principal difference is the story and the director. Vipul Shaw left an indelible mark in the movie “Ankhen”, one of the best comedy Hindi films. His casting from Charecteres is perfect. The story, apparently taken from Gujerati Play, is amazing, with some exceptions, the treatment is excellent. In Bollywood, when the film is made, the first thing that a Bollywood director is inclined to do is register a music director, and this guy (in this case mediocre Malik) is required to release six songs in order to fulfill his contract. Therefore, even such good directors as Vipul Shah must use them to appease Finasier and grandmother, who simply cannot get enough of these numbers. No music director can continuously produce good songs, which is clearly seen in this film. None of the songs have a melody, and they are clearly intrusive for the narration, except for background music and the pro-Western version of Bharat-Natyam. The duel and role-playing game of the Father and the Son is a good game of Bachchan and Akshay Kumar. His stunt scenes are clearly outstanding. A good director surrounds himself with good actors, and he is ready to wait until a good story appears, as in this super movie. Then we have a cheap classless tasteless producer, such as Sharuh Khan, who will go down low to shamelessly plug and advertise garbage, such as Kaal, to enrich themselves by improving Art, and they will surround themselves with borderline talent, and they will pay off the investment before the word bypasses. This is the Bollywood Locust, which preys on an unexpected audience in order to receive the “Film Farce” awards received by the Bollywood fans, and most of them in the media.
