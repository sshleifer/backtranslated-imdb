I love this film very much, I never get tired of watching it. The only line in which I really can't get it, is when Riff calls himself a teenage lobotomy, but other than that, everything else is perfect. I have never been a PJ Soles fan, and it didn’t help to hear that she didn’t even know who the Ramones were before she made this film, but I can ignore her confused little face for the most part. Most people who watch it again and again are Ramones fans and really ... this is the only reason I love it so much. I never get tired of seeing DeDi spoiling her Pizza lines, or Joey again and again spoiling the teacher's name, ha ha. One of the best parts of the film is to see them sing. Do you want to dance through the high school halls ... I like it. The special edition DVD has a good retrospective, surprisingly, PJ Soles is not on it. Maybe she was working on another project * laughs * Anyway, a great movie, even better if you're a Ramones fan.
