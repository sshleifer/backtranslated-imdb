The last (I suppose) of the Boys movies shot with Hal Roach is also the last really funny movie they shot before going to the fox of the 20th century, which so coolly deceived their talents. Although there are some weak points - for example, dealing with a “lung tester” is a little bit, oh ... exaggerated (but worth having, just to see Jimmy Finlayson's “doctor”), but in general this film is a good summary of what the boys brought screen. Richard Kramer (uncredited) has appeared in other L & H films, and he is delightfully threatened here as convicted Nick Granger. The scene where the Boys should eat their synthetic food ("Looks good, smells good and probably tastes good. Eat") is one of my favorite moments in art. Stan & Ollie will always be pleasant companions in the lives of their millions of loyal fans.
