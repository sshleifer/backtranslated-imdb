The essence of this film is simple, as is the scenario: an elderly Muslim forces his teenage son to take him in his equally old wagon from France to Haj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia so that he can fulfill his sacred Muslim commitment before he dies. The father is clearly religious, but the son is not impressed; he assumes obligations to his father, rather than to religion, he would prefer to be with his (non-Muslim) girlfriend. The father is stubborn in many things that the son does not understand, and the irritability between them is a device that supports drama, although this is often quite tiring. However, as in any good road film, there are strange characters; for example, a woman in the backyard in Croatia, who, when asked how to get to Belgrade, simply sits in the backseat and points by hand, uttering one word that they consider to be a place, but cannot find it on the map. In Bulgaria, another person asks how to get confirmation that he can speak French, but then gives an extensive commentary in Bulgarian. There is also occasional humor - in one country the son gets tired to eat egg sandwiches and wants meat - they are given a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps fortunately for the viewer), he runs away before his father can perform the ritual of a Muslim fighter. In the end, they get to Mecca, the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but on a much larger scale. For the inhabitants of the West, this is all strange, but fascinating. The film is not complicated, but in its own way charming, a kind of National Geographic with a soul.
