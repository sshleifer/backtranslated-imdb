In addition to the magnificent film METROPOLIS, this is the oldest pure science fiction film. While sometimes the film is preached a little and the action may be a bit wide, this is a great movie for two reasons. Firstly, it is extremely original in both style and content. Even in the 21st century there are no films about which I can think of anything like that. Secondly, for its time, the special effects were absolutely incredible - using matte paintings, models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both the post-apocalyptic world and the great city of tomorrow. Of course, you can sit back and knock on the film, because, by today's standards, the effects are the only way. But you must understand that this was a state of the art when the film was released in 1936, and it must have really hit the audience. In many respects, the scenery looks very reminiscent of the “modern cities” shown at the 1939 WORLD FAIR. <br /> <br /> I think the film is also interesting because it seems that it is torn by the question “are people really so stupid or are we destined for greatness? The end result seems to be a bit of both! How true! <br /> <br /> Last note: I saw it twice on TV and most recently on video. All three times the quality of sound and print stinks - especially the sound. If it is available on DVD, I hope it will be much cleaner and provide optional subtitles. Since the sound on the video continued to be clipped, I would really appreciate it!
