I saw this film last night in a special cinema in Nuremberg, and it was great. I have to admit that the original musical composition of the cellist and percussionist / xylophone player influenced the mood of the film, but the film itself also had power in depicting the tragic saga about Nibelungen. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in silent films or in Nibelungenlied, I highly recommend this film. The costumes were fantastic and creative, the scenery was gorgeous and exotic, and the action was dramatic and exciting (as is typical of a silent film “tragedy”). Unfortunately, I did not see the first part of this duet concerning Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after the death of Siegfried, when Cremhild (Gudrun in the Scandinavian versions of this story) begins planning his revenge on his brothers. <br /> <br /> In addition, I watched this film in German; I am a native English speaker and have a basic knowledge of German. At first it was difficult to read “subtitles” (what do you call it in silent films?) Because of the old-style German alphabet, so I advise you, if you watch it in German, make sure you can distinguish your “k” “ F and S in the old script. :)
