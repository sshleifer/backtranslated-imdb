It was one of those wonderful rare moments in T.V. that I would like to capture on VHS forever. Will it ever be again? <br /> <br /> It was so creative, and I remember that it was shown once a week, and the waiting for the next episode was painful. I want to see it all again. I want to buy this. I want something I can not have. Even on EBAY. <br /> <br /> So, after I was pretty tricky, it was one of the best series of the 80s. This should be considered a classic, but lost in space. At least this site and Wikipedia mention this. Sob. <br /> <br /> It was very attractive, funny, flirty and original. Maybe not like the original Sherlock Holmes, I actually think Quintin is much more attractive and has more chances with his lead lady than the mighty and chalky Holmes.
