Philo Vance (William Powell) helps uncover the numerous killings among the wealthy after the dog show. <br /> <br /> I usually hate overly intricate secrets (like this one), but I LOVE this movie. He moves very fast (only 72 minutes), perfectly directed by Michael Curtis (he uses tons of camera tricks that just speed up the narration), has a very ingenious storyline (including the decision to kill in a locked room, which was just incredible) composition. <br /> <br /> Powell is very courteous and great, like Vance - he doesnâ€™t seem to work - he IS Vance! Mary Astor gives little, but she adds class and beauty to the production. All the others are also very good, but Eugene Pallett is best in the role of Detective Heath. He is a very good actor with a VERY distinctive voice, and some of his lines were hilarious. <br /> <br /> In general, the great mystery of the Hollywood murder of the 1930s. Worth seeing. <br /> <br />
