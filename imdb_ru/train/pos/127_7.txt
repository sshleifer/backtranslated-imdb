Zentropa has a lot in common with the Third Man, another film like noir that has collapsed in the ruins of post-war Europe. As in the case of TTM, there is a lot of inventive work. There is an innocent American who emotionally associates with a woman whom he does not really understand, and whose naivety is all the more striking compared to the natives. <br /> <br /> But I must say that the Third Man has a more well thought out storyline. In this regard, Zentropa is a bit fragmented. Perhaps this is intentional: it seems like a dream / nightmare, and if you make it too connected, it will spoil the effect. <br /> <br /> This film is relentlessly gloomy - “noir” in several ways; no one ever sees the sun shine. Gloomy, but intriguing and frightening.
