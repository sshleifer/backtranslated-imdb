That's how I feel about the show. <br /> <br /> I started watching the show again in 2001. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the show, but there are too many mistakes in it. <br /> <br /> I hate the characters MICHELLE & JOEY! <br /> <br /> Steal storylines from old TV shows. They even stole from the "Party Family". Then in episode 1 the “Partridge Family” was mentioned. <br /> <br /> Actors played different roles in different episodes. Martha Quinn's MTV is most noticeable in this, especially when she played herself in episode 1. <br /> <br /> Michelle's character CAN'T JOKE, but then they forced this young child to “revenge” their sisters for making fun of her. <br /> <br /> Story lines that appeared and disappeared in episode 1. Joey gets a television show with Frankie and Annette, after which she never heard of it. Danny suddenly plays the guitar. 1 episode, he coaches football, 1 episode, he trains softball / baseball. 1 game, aren't you, Danny? <br /> <br /> Jesse and Joey continue to get jobs very quickly, with no experience. Only in the TV show. <br /> <br /> I really liked DJ & Stephanie characters. It is a pity that Jody Sweetin could not learn from Candace Cameron Bure and have a clean life without drugs.
