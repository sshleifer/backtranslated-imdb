Since I'm so interested in lake monsters, I really dug up this film. This movie worth watching. If you like such horrible movies, try this. The effects are really good, just think "The Land of the Lost." I originally watched this movie in the early 90s, perhaps more like the 89/90 on a local channel monster show called Morgus Presents. I didnâ€™t scare me, but I was 8 years old, and everything that B felt was more like A. Years later I saw it on DVD in the local Circuit City and immediately bought it so that I could give him 9 because he has a personal place in my heart right there with a squad of monsters and gremlins. Good movie B is fun for all ages.
