Ruby in Paradise is a beautiful, adult story about a young woman, Ruby Lee Gissing, who avoids her sultry roots to become herself. Although the main character is skillfully played by the magnificent Ashley Judd - probably in her first film role, although she should be proud - the emphasis is not on becoming “someone”, in the role of the next Madonna (be it the mother of Jesus) or angry, eager singer). <br /> <br /> Instead, he emphasizes following the instincts and some introspection in them in order to grow into his ideal adult self. NOTE: this is not an action movie !!! During the recording in her diary, an occasional voice-over narrative (Miss Judd) is used, and, oh, I see that I have just lost the male half of the readers. But be patient with this beautiful film, where we learn that bliss can be found in - oh, I don't know, I carry water with me and chop wood. <br /> <br /> Actor / director / screenwriter Todd Field, who played Nick Solovey in the film “Eyes Wide Shut”, is cast as Ruby Lee's noble love interest, helping her to heal her view of the relationship implanted from her youth. <br /> <br /> But even Ruby Lee is not responsible for his character: There is no external hero imposed on her. The final message is that we are responsible for ourselves. The writer / director Victor Núñez, who also wrote / shot "Gold Uli", did an amazing job showing the young woman who grew up in herself - faced with age-old problems of good against evil on her way. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is also stellar, and the music used, especially excerpts from singer Sam Phillips' song (which I heard is the wife of T. Bon Burnett), right now - especially “Trying to Stay on Earth” . "Now, when I hear the first few chords of this song, tears appear in my eyes, Pavlovian and uninvited - not sure if this is music or an indelible connection with a quiet, charming message about the empowerment of a film. <br /> <This film is strongly It is recommended for any young person trying to find their own way. For any woman of any age, this is a must-see! Disadvantage: it is NOT on DVD except Spanish. (However, we learned that it is legal to make one copy of the VHS version that can be easily found on the Internet My My beloved husband found someone with a copy of VHS and got me a copy on DVD.) Although this movie’s treasure sometimes appears on the air on an indie channel, usually ?? you can’t count on it when you may need it most as a tonic to calm the pressure of the world. So buy a copy for yourself. <br /> <br /> This film should be reprinted, and that would be if I were the queen of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> - Figs Jones
