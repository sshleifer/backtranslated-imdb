The independent function can now be viewed as a work of art film and video resume. Enter “Broken” and aggressively advanced, twenty minutes, with style and enthusiasm. But is it good as a movie, or does it only work as a demo? Ah, therein lies the snag. <br /> <br /> The broken story of Bonnie Clayton, kidnapped one night after waking up from a recurring nightmare "by a sadistic stranger and his bright surroundings" (quote from the video box)). Since she is in captivity, it becomes obvious that her captors know about her that even she did not know about herself. While they question her, a soldier in black clothes shoots at their shelter, trying to save her. Lawlessness appears. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for us, director Alex Ferrari seems to know what he is doing, or at least he pretends very well. Broken does not suffer from a lack of visual flair, which is especially commendable, given its budget and the inexperience of all participants. What he suffers from is a weak and partly derivative letter. Think long, goodnight's kiss meets the Matrix, written ten minutes after reading Fight Club. The good news for Ferrari and producer / writer Jorge Rodriguez is that the elements of the story are easily ignored due to the huge amount of eye candy. Is the story really so important that in a twenty-minute short presentation he demonstrated the technical skills of its creators? No, not at all. <br /> <br /> Although it would be unfair of me to ignore any negative aspects in the light of the budget and the duration of the films. Broken is not a classic genre. The biggest problem was that it would actually work better as a full-format function. The final "turn" does not allow enough assembly time to be shocking. If Ferrari were given time to slow down the recording of an object as needed, the plot elements would seem less random, and the film more complete. Knowing he gets a chance. <br /> <br /> The audio broken presentation in Dolby Digital 5.1 is unparalleled in the indie world. I have never heard such an aggressive environment from such a small feature. Inspired by the Matrix soundtrack is very rich and deep, the shots have a beat, and even the dialogue gets the effect of surround sound. Of all presented on this disc, this audio speaks of the praise of the modern independent DVD production. Also included is an equally impressive Dolby 2.0 surround sound track, which is used by default in the menu. <br /> <br /> Additional Information Literally hours of work on features can be found on this disc. In fact, there are so many additions that I find it unrealistic to list and describe each of them here, still expecting my readers to continue reading. Whatever the flaws that the actual flaws may have, the DVD is unprecedented in its informational resources. People who like the film can learn everything they need to know about its production, including everything from conceptual art to an advertising campaign. Those who plan to make their own indie film can learn about everything they need to know from these features. <br /> <br /> Additional features are divided into categorical menus. These include: preliminary preparation, production, post-production, short film, biography of actors and crew. From a critical point of view, I found that some sections were rather short. If they were edited in one functional panel for each menu item, they would be less frustrating to navigate, as the cursor by default selects the top selection each time you return to the main menu of the section. This, of course, is just picky, but maybe in future DVD releases the creators will take my advice to heart. <br /> <br /> There are six audio commentaries and several hours of interviews and talented people, and, despite the sales consonant skill, their true colors really shine through. <br /> <br /> Willingness to share your secrets of filmmaking with everyone who takes this DVD is very generous. From the add-ons, I learned which editing and effecting software is the most reliable and efficient, which camera brand creates the most professional look at the lowest price, even where you can buy cheap air soft weapons. In addition, I was given several alternatives in case I could not find any products used in this particular production. The creators of the film "Mimic", not wanting to read a book on this topic, would have succeeded in watching this DVD. <br /> <br /> Overall, I scored an actual score of 6 out of 10, but I would like it to be an option for film length potential and effort, because I would score 8 or 9 in these areas. I recommend the DVD for its features and as an excellent example of what can be done for as little as eight thousand American dollars. Those who buy DVDs may think of themselves as ghost producers for a larger project, because the more attention these guys pay, the more money the full-length version gets.
