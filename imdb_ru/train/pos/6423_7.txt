This film is a stunning continuous riot of laughter, which includes all the usual ingredients of David Dhavan's comedy - clumsy heroes, heroine characters, silly dolls for heroines, disgusting villains, wise men, a stunning soundtrack + choreography and a small dose of action, <br /> < br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda play a dual role: police and fraudsters. The heroine of policeman Amitabha is Ramya Krishnan, and Ravina is opposite Govinda, the policeman. The heroine, as usual, is just a strangled props. There are no heroines. Paresh Rawal continues his villainous act at DAUD (he also played a similar Don in KHOOBSURAT). Asrani shines in a short role. He repeats his famous act “Angreson ke enchantment ke Jayler” in SHOLAY. <br /> <br /> Govinda, as usual, flawless - as a wise, good-natured policeman Pyaare Mohan and as a crook Chhote Miyan. He imitates the Bihari Hindi style, speaking with hilarious results. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, pales in comparison with him. But still AB is in order. Madhuri Dixit in the role of Mahna plays one of the roles. She dances like the wind. <br /> <br /> Viju Shah's music is awesome. See "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" and the title track. <br /> <br /> Do not look for LOGIC, because it is a comedy and the script is completely convenient. Just enjoy yourself.
