The second part (actually 4-8 episode) of the popular Danish series is a little inferior to the first, but there is also a lot of laughter and fear in it. This time, Udo Cyrus plays two roles, like a monster child and his demon-like father. This time, other prominent roles are Dr. Krogsha Soren Pilmarck, who has to face Dr. Helmer's terrible revenge, and again Mrs Dress, trying to solve the riddles in Miss Marple's style. Finishing rock climbing, and after the death of leading actors Ernst Hugo Yaregard (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolfs (Mrs. Dress), you wonder how they can ever do Part III, but I hope Von Trier gives it a shot. Unfortunately, shortly thereafter, Morten Rotne Leffers, dishwasher No. 2 with Down syndrome, also died. Look for Stellan Skarsgard at the cameo. ***
