What has always been lacking in the history of the Matrix is ​​how it all happened in the real world. Don't say more, because this part of the story covered most of the basics. What was really interesting was how politically it was, perhaps even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration. Fascism and violence were the only things that a person could think of in relation to the fight against the robotic horde, which were supposed to be just servants of humanity. What I also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of ​​the unknown. We humans often fall into this trap, allowing the lack of logic and thinking to overtake us, because people cannot believe the opposite. Well presented and composed, this is a true testimony to how illogical people can be.
