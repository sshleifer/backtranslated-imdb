If you are a purist, do not waste your time - otherwise, hold on to your hat and enjoy the adventure. I liked the version of Stuart Granger / Deborah Kerr - I have seen it dozens of times, but this film is just as good, just another. I will not describe in detail the differences, because it will spoil the film. Besides, itâ€™s nice to see Alison Dudi again (I'm a big Indiana Jones fan), Patrick Swayze is good at Quatermaine, and the supporting cast is great. I consider the quality of the cast of one of the Hallmark Production trademarks, and this film was no exception. The cinematography is great and the score is beautiful. If you are looking for entertainment, you will not be disappointed.
