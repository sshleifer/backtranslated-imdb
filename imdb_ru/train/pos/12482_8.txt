I read only good things about this film and finally got the opportunity to watch it late at night, and that was all I expected and more. This is how a real horror movie should be. I think the reason is that it was so scary because it was so realistic. The sound with the creepy sound was perfect for creating a gloomy mood. I liked the dramatic opening scene, and I liked the way the rest of the film was played. It was very easy to understand and understand, unlike some films that are too complex. very good. I would like to see more horror films like this one. This is easily one of my favorites. Realistic thunder and thunderstorm would create a good atmosphere for this film. Otherwise, all the elements were terrible. The film is needed. I highly recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate a good scary film that does not pull itself. I will add it to my collection. There are some interesting special features on the DVD.
