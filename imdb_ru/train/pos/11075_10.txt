After reading the reviews of this film, for obvious reasons, I began to watch it with great doubt in my mind that this would really be good. However, this is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Most of the reviews I read said that because of the complex plot it was too difficult to follow. And while some parts really confuse you, the finale binds so many loose ends that you want to kick yourself because you missed so much. It's not like Lock, Stock ... or Snatch, in the sense that it's not so funny (it's actually quite dark), and it's much smarter in the sense in which you see parts . scenes from different angles (and in one of the best scenes of the film, Jason Statham spends five minutes in the elevator, arguing with himself). The way he resembles the two films I just mentioned is that he is full of unforgettable characters, in particular Statham, who plays a fantastic role in the lead role, and Ray Liotta, who spends most of the film in Speedos but gives excellent performance nonetheless. If you have time, and then you have time to think about the film and even watch it again, you will really begin to see all the symbols and hints that are set out in the film. I think this is fantastic, and that Guy Richie is the director in his game.
