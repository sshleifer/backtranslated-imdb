The problem with depicting a person from real life is that the performance may be good, but it still does not work if the audience does not believe that the actor depicts a person. This is the main problem of the “young Mr. Lincoln”: “Henry Fonda plays amazingly, but it was hard for me to believe that Abraham Lincoln spoke as quietly as Fonda depicts. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a drama in the courtroom with young Abraham Likolny in the foreground. Was this a true story, I don’t know, but if it’sn’t, then why talk about it, using Lincoln as the main character? Never mind, though. In the film, Lincoln defends two young people accused of murder. <br /> <br /> There’s nothing special about the movie, and as a result it looks pretty empty. I wanted more story and character development. The film lasts 100 minutes, but it is not. There are a few small scenes involving Lincoln and a blooming relationship with Mary Todd, but they seem superficial. <br /> <br /> The game is good in all respects, but, as I said, the Foundation’s performance works as a character, not Abraham Lincoln. I just do not believe that the real Lincoln was so quiet. True, he has a loud voice when he needs it, for example, when he persuades a drunken mob of lynchmen to allow the defendant to stand trial, but the Foundation portrays Lincoln too meekly. However, other performances are impeccable, especially Alice Brady in the role of Abigail Clay, the mother of the accused. She is a sweet lady to whom we can really relate. Simple and uneducated, but very cute; we can understand why Lincoln wanted to help her. <br /> <br /> John Ford seems to think of this film as epic, and at the time of its release, it probably was. But even then there simply is not enough material to present it as such. <br /> <br /> This is a good watch, but not a classic one.
