What a real pleasure and completely unexpected. That's what the real thriller is about. I rushed to the video store, took the film without reading all the ads on my back, and hoped for the best. I was completely surprised and delighted. I really liked the actors and their characters. I thought they all gave a great idea and made their characters realistic. The plot was well thought out, well written and directed. He interested you from beginning to end and never got bored for a minute. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to those who love thrillers, especially thrillers with a good tempo and those that hold your attention. Definitely 10 out of 10 from me.
