You play as B.J. Blazkovich, a tough guy from an American secret agent who is sent to reveal the Nazi secret and turn the tide of the Second World War. This means everything from the exit from the Nazi prison and ending with the undermining of Hitler's military machine and even the Fuhrer himself. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most influential game of its time. This is because it literally inspired obsession. Many games existed at the time and even more do today, but from time to time you get a real grabber. This is one of them. Just like Tetris before it and most recently GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is better in almost all respects, but shots are heard all over the world that led to one of the biggest tidal waves in games that were made by B.J. Space Marine, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman and the legions of others owe their existence to the ID guys. Whether directly or, in most cases, indirectly, but they are still there. <br /> <br /> Even with its old look, very outdated graphics, very simple gameplay (this is really a game, the games now border on “experience” level) and very rectangular levels, covering all six episodes provides a lot of fun. Especially reveal these secrets with treasures and chaingun in them. <br /> <br /> Also: “Stop!” * Bach! Bang! Explosion! * “AARRRGH !!!” never gets old --- 8/10 <br /> <br /> Voluntary appreciated by PC-13 for the “deep slaughter.” However, this is extremely tame compared to what games have today.
