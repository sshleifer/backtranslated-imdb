The visual mastery of Tsui Hark in this film. Unfortunately, the terrible game of Ekina Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the desire to strangle her while watching, it’s so bad :) sometimes it was difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> This film is a real breakthrough in the visual department. When I first saw this, my jaw dropped several times, and I thought to myself that I had never seen anything remotely like this, but this is how it should be done to fully pay tribute to the mythical world of Chinese historical novels about kung fu! Without a doubt, this is one of the most beautiful Chinese historical epic epic of Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> But alas, Cui Hark didn’t improve much in writing, and the story and the dialogue are quite minor (his obvious obsession with the stupid and excessively long depiction of evil guys didn’t help either). Worse, this film is very poorly filmed. They decided to use the “hot” popular Hong Kong idols as the main characters, but unfortunately both Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung are completely unsuitable for historical kung fu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystics who must embody such characters Adam Cheng Siu-Chou and Bridget Lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better. <br /> <br /> I would like Zhang Yi-Mou and Cui Hark to unite their efforts one day and create a film in which there is Cui’s visual mastery, but with maturity and Zhang’s poetry telling the story ...
