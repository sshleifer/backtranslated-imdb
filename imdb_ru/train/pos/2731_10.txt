Sorry, I do not have time to write. I am not a psychologist, but I know one for 25 years. She said that Scott Wilson portrayed the sociopath (without conscience) unusually well. I agree! She also said that Robert Blake portrayed a man with anger and impulsive control, who had a conscience, but he could not control himself perfectly. I agree! What a scary and awesome movie. I watched over 2,000 films and rated them in the top 100. My old friend regularly communicates with such clients. My only criticism was the preaching story at the end of the film. Many people do not grow in ideal conditions, but only one out of a million will behave like these 2 losers.
