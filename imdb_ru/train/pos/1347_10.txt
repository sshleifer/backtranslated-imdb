A huge, comprehensive and passionate summary of American cinema, seen through the eyes of Martin Scorsese. Needless to say, for all 4-hour work time is never boring. Many genres, periods and directors are studied, discussed more from the point of view of a movie lover than a modern director. For those who are even remotely interested in American films or cinema in general. A masterpiece and the best of the BFI Century of Cinema series. <br /> <br />
