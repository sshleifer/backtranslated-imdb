CREEP is a real serious horror film, shot in real time, that wants nothing more than just to show how mutants attack people on an empty subway platform for 85 minutes. And it does exactly that. No more, no less. Directed by Christopher Smith draws drama as far as he can be, introducing a series of characters who would actually have a reason to be on the subway after it is blocked. It also leaves the origin of the title Krip intentionally vague (they hint at the illegal experiments taking place in the underground of the 60s), and this small part of the mysterious works for the most part. Unfortunately, it undermines itself by the end, actually holding back the end of the twist, where more genetic defects will develop (they are also hinted at). Yes, you understood me correctly - I wanted the ending of the cliche! Franca (RUN LOLA RUN) Potent is good in the role of female terror, and the rest of the actors are fine.
