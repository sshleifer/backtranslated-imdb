Since I remember myself, I am only 18 years old, my mother and I have been and continue to watch old films, because in the long run I find them much more useful (but, hey, don't get me wrong, I really love movies, which we don’t have today as much as I like movies from the 40s and 50s) Anyway, now I have to say that at that moment when I started watching the film, my eyes were fixed on the TV. Of course, my favorite character was a grandmother performed by Lucille Watson. But I liked the way Betty Davis and her family were portrayed. Children ... do not behave like children in the least. But there is a good reason for this: you have to hide and control most of your life, to see how the terrible things that children saw in those days destroyed their innocence. Therefore, people who say “ooooh, I hated the way the children acted ... blah blah blah,” read between the lines and knew that they had seen things that children should not see. <br /> <br /> Paul Lucas ... dear Paul did a terrific job !!! Now I know that many people are angry that he is gone, and Oscar and Gods are not, but hey, they both did an amazing job, so I think that everything could go in any direction. But the performance of Lukas was so amazing that by the end of the film I was satisfied to tears. I really liked this movie and I recommend it to everyone! :-D
