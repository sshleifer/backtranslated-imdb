This film is a beautiful image of the Nutcracker; the dances are beautiful, the landscape in the background was superb, and I really liked this floating bed. <br /> <br /> Yes, and the costumes ... I especially liked the marzipan ones, the pack was amazing. The special effects were very well done (for example, wood, bed, etc.), and I really liked the rats. I like that they do not make them scary, but sweet and embracing. Suppose, with the exception of the king. <br /> <br /> If you are a completely courageous person, you will not like it, but this is a very good film that is suitable for all ages, but not for all levels. testosterone. <br /> <br /> But I have a few complaints. <br /> <br /> First, why did they have to put partner Sugar Plum Fairies into these terrible tights? There will hardly be any difference if he is naked! And secondly ... why did they have to make Kalkin's costume PINK on EARTH?
