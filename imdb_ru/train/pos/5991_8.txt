The continuation of "Angels with dirty faces" only in name, "Angels wash their faces" to some extent suffer from the usual machinations of Children in a dead end. In fact, in the presence of Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan, this should have been seen as a continuation of “Angels with dirty faces”, at least for the sake of continuity. <br /> <br /> By the way, about Ann Sheridan. She is the only true shining light of this film. To paraphrase a cliché, Ann Sheridan could read for two hours from the phone book, and I bought a DVD! <br /> <br /> Another advantage of this film is the chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film is too far in the background. For a better example of the Sheridan-Reagan duet, I would recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row.
