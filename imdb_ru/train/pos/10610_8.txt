A good-natured young mountain man with a sad past (Henry Thomas) comes across an abandoned girl in the forest and immediately falls in love with her. City elders usually support him in raising a child, although the local temptress (Kara Seymour) thinks little about a new family. A resolute little girl on a long walk and an ominous traveling salesman (David Strathairn at his most creepy) has parallel stories that converge in a fateful way. This is a charming piece of Ozark life in the same spirit as “Where the lilies bloom” and “The Puppeteer”. All three were shot on these beautiful hills and encompass the lives of ordinary people, but not ordinary people. A minimum of strong vocabulary and brief but abrupt violence make this family viewing quite safe.
