I was a production accountant in this film, and I also had to work a little on it, so Iâ€™m not completely impartial, but if it were terrible, I would say that. I thought it was a funny movie, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, anyway, but there was a lot of laughter along the way. The Bible claims that laughter is beneficial, as a medicine, so watching this movie can be good for your health. <br /> <br /> Many of the actors in this film have not yet reached their peak at the time when we were filming this film. Susan Sarandon, of course, has since gained much greater fame. Melanie Myron weekly starred in television as a photographer in the TV series Thirty Something. Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, still pursuing people's dreams. One of my favorite actors in this series was Oak Taylor, who played the sheriff. He was a great comedian and a truly sweet, sincere man. We all had fun working on this show, and I think the fun is coming.
