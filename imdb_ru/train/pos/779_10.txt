In the northeast of Brazil, the father of twelve-year-old illiterate Maria (Fernanda Carvalho) sells his daughter to a middle-class prostitution man, Tadeu (Chico Diaz), to work as a housekeeper and live better. However, the girl is resold to farmer Lawrence (Otavio Augusto), who besieges her, and he gives the offended girl to his teenage son to get his first sexual experience. Then she is sent to a brothel on a gold field in Amazonas and investigate its owner, the meanest sarayva (Antonio Kalloni). When Maria flees to Rio de Janeiro in anticipation of a better life, she is explored by Captain Vera (Darlene Gloria). <br /> <br /> Anjos do Sol reveals the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in Brazil through the fate of the girl Mary. Last year, I saw the Lily of the Fourth Century, which tells an identical story in the former Soviet Union; therefore, this problem exists in third world countries. Director and screenwriter Rudi Lagemann presents an excellent film, revealing reality, but never showing nudity or explicit sex scenes. This is the debut of the promising Fernanda Carvalho, who perfectly played the role of a frightened child fighting for survival. Most prostitutes are lovers, and it is impossible to distinguish the famous Darlene Gloria from such plastic surgery. The bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("Angels of the Sun").
