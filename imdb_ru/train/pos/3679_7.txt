I just watched a movie two days ago, and I was full of expectations that Paris is my second favorite city in Europe, and I spent there very romantic 18 months in the 80s. I was somewhat disappointed that the majority of this group of vignettes, although originally and artistically executed, did not very well capture the “light” and beauty of the city. Enough romance! We did not see any of the tree-lined boulevards ... There was too much darkness, not only literally, but also figuratively. Some of the plots manipulated the viewer, who seemed to them, and let him down until she fell (Marais sequence, hairstyle sequence, to give two examples). Uplifting, good: the Mime sequence, the cemetery, Montmartre (although the viewer had too much to understand), the Cowboy vignette and Sacre Coeur seemed few and I would like to see such a wonderful actor like Orlando Bloom in that could demonstrate its originality.
