The Journey of Hope (1990) is the path that many nomadic and poor Turks make so they can live a good life in Switzerland. These people so desperately need to live like Westerners, that they give up their lives and lives trying to reach the promised land. A great many of them are deceived by greedy scammers who make a living by charging huge fees for desperate people who are in a hopeless situation. One family endures cold, treacherous mountain range and predatory criminals, and discovers that there is not always a shining white light at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists all over the world, not just in America. Some people tend to forget this. A heartbreaking film that makes you wonder why at the end. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
