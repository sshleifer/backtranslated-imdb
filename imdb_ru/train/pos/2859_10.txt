I know it sounds strange if someone was born almost 15 years after the show stopped, but I love this show. I don't know why, but I like to watch it. I love Adam the most. The only disappointment is that the only place I found to buy seasons on DVD was in Germany, and these were only the first two seasons. It is disappointing, but it is normal. I will continue to watch online. If anyone has any advice on where to buy the second to the fourteenth seasons, please email me at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already have one. The only drawback is that DVDs from Germany are played only on my portable DVD player and on my computer. Well. I still have it!
