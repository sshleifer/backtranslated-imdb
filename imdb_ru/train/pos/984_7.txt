One night I stumbled on the "Bait" on the cable as soon as it started, and thought: "Why not?" I am glad I gave him a chance. <br /> <br /> “Bait” ​​is not perfect. He suffers from overly bright indications and sometimes dullness. But in general, this film worked. All the elements are aligned exactly right, and they removed what might otherwise be a rather ugly film. <br /> <br /> Much of this, I think, is related to Jamie Foxx. I don't know who marked Fox for the lead, but whoever it is, this film has done a great service. Incredibly and surprisingly, Foxx slides through the film, smooth as butter, and funnier than hell. You can say that he is working on instinct, and instinct will not let him down. <br /> <br /> The plot, albeit unimportant, actually binds together quite well, and even there is a characteristic arc, thanks to which Fox’s character grows as a person. makes things so much better. <br /> <br /> I am surprised at the low rating for this. Maybe I caught this move that night or vice versa, but I would give 7/10. Bravo, Mssr. Foxx.
