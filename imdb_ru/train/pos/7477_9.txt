This film consists of such strong emotions, especially with its outstanding soundtrack, which coincides with the film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm for making films and having fun. This film was not the best the first time I watched it, but after about 3 times I decided that it was one of the best films I have ever seen. It occurs in New York, and progresses through its lifestyle. He discovers in his life a divisibility with his girlfriend (Diaz). He goes through a state of depression and then an outgoing mixture of imagination. This film exceeded all my expectations and is one of the best Cruise films!
