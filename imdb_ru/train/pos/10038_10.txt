Titanic has to be one of my all time favorite movies. He has his own problems (and there are no films), but, nevertheless, it is pleasant. <br /> <br /> When I stumble upon someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I think my first reaction is “wait a minute, are you not?” I know so many people who don’t like this film, and I do not say that I do not understand why. “A love story is too stupid,” yes, but isn't it pleasant and touching? Well, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unreal, everyone knows that such love doesn't really exist. But this is a film. Doesn't everybody like to watch a beautiful story that allows us to plunge into a little fantasy? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well, well, in this film, I agree that they do not work in full force. However, I consider it unfair to say that they are terrible actors. I personally think that they are both very talented actors who, unfortunately, are very famous for the film in which they are not surprising. But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can take care of them a little, but I agree with many people that they did not do what was expected. <br /> <br /> And finally, if someone complains that they don’t like this film because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic films, then sorry, but why did they go and watched a movie in which all these things are so clear. It's like people who complain that the Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action films. Just to be a movie, not because you don’t like this genre, it’s a good movie. <br /> <br /> He deserves his Oscar, in particular, the best cinema that I think is the best I've ever seen. in the film, the Lord of the Rings trilogy could be saved. <br /> <br /> I know that some recordings fail, for example, the constant shouts of each other’s names throughout the film. The remembered part of the story can be quite weak, but overall this is an amazing achievement, thanks to which the Titanic looks so real, and the sinking - so epic. <br /> <br /> I understand why many people don’t like this film, but for the most part it comes down to the fact that they don’t like the basic idea, such as a love story, and not what they think the film itself is poorly built. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that I have read more than five books about Titanic, including memoirs from the day it happened, and this film is extremely historically accurate, with the exception of a few mistakes. The only major ones that I can find are that the pipeline should be made of copper rather than steel, and the iceberg looks quite unreal, as the scene in which they hit. <br /> <br /> I give this film 10/10, not because I like romantic films, but simply because it is an outstanding cinematic achievement that leaves a sense of horror from the realistic adaptation of events.
