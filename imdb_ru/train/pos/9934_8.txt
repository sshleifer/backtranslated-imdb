Domino was widely condemned on this site for its frantic editing style and "ugly" photo. This ill-wishers refer to its superficiality and criticize its use of “style over substance”, I could not but agree more. I believe that Domino represents the absolute height of Tony Scott’s cinematic career. <br /> <br /> After creating the dominant Hollywood-style action movie in the late eighties and early nineties, Tony Scott gradually approached a more subjective style of cinema. Back in The Crimson Stream, Scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters - the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict aboard a nuclear submarine were embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with framing at an angle. Then it was transferred to the "Enemy of the State" and "Spy Game", which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage, respectively. <br /> <br /> “The Man on Fire” was an extreme departure, a transition to an expressionist, more aesthetically beautiful. Here, Scott used an outdated handheld camera and flash to express his character's explosive rage. Although he was not completely successful, he presented methods that were to find their full expression in Domino. <br /> <br /> In the frame of the FBI interrogation device, Domino tells about the life of the infamous bounty hunter through her story. incoherent fragments of memory. She clings to the memories as we all make fragments, flashes and short tricks. When Domino narrates her story, Scott transmits it visually, illustrating not only the events she describes, but also the point of view that directs them. She does have “traces of mescaline” in her body, but her individual vision is unusual in any case - this is a woman who abandoned the luxurious life for head hunting. <br /> <br /> Scott really lets you break the events that led to her captivity. Together with cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott organizes the post-modern canvas of modern America. Gradually, we begin to understand that, although it may be Domino, it is no more divided than the culture "90210", which it rejected. When she sneaks through this cultural melange, Scott makes her viewer more aware of the innocence that he destroys through the disadvantaged children whom the narrative represents. Ultimately, Scott portrays their salvation as the only way out of this surrealistic journey. <br /> <br /> Criticizing this film for over-styling is the same as criticizing Picasso or Pollock for not representing what is a recognizable person. Like any big picture, the value in Domino is on the surface, and the surface is all. <br /> <br /> I am in no way affiliated with Scott Free, but I have always been and will be a big fan of Tony Scott.
