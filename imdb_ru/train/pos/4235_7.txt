.... after 16 years, Tim Burton finally disappoints me !!!! What happened to old Burton who read Frank Miller's The Dark Knight's Return as a study to prepare him to send Batman in 1988â€“89? Apparently, Burton did not investigate either the book or the film, because he got everything WRONG! This movie sucks! It is not as good as the original, and it does not deal with the same subject as the original. If you want a good movie about a monkey, look at the original. <br /> <br /> ** of **** stars
