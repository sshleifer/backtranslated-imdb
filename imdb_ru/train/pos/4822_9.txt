Need someone to hold your hand when you go up or down the stairs? Ask others to try your food before you eat it? Faced with domineering mother? These are just some of the obstacles that young Victoria faces in this film (various power struggles also occur, as well as attempts on her life). Needless to say, this makes for a very exciting and informative viewing. <br /> <br /> I only saw Emily Blunt earlier in The Devil Wears Prada (and a little more). As she was in this film, she is again outstanding here. I was very impressed with her portrayal of young Victoria, and thought that she coped with the role very well. She makes the transition from the young Victoria, which we meet at the beginning of the film, to Queen Victoria, who later becomes quite believable. Dumb played well in the role, showing all the different sides (from vulnerable to strong to young Victoria, who makes mistakes to the queen who takes control). It is not enough to say about Emily Blunt in this role. She is - very simply - elegant, commanding your attention every second while she is on the screen. She keeps you in suspense right up to the final snapshot of the film. <br /> <br /> Rupert Friend also established himself as the love interest of Victoria (and a possible husband), Prince Albert. Actors have good chemistry, and you are absolutely confident in their developing relationship. They have their differences, but you can say that they are in love. Blunt and Friend are excellent in every scene in which they are divided, and you are interested in what happens between Victoria and Albert. Other actors in the film are also very good. Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne, Miranda Richardson as Duchess of Kent, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy and Jim Broadbent as King William. There are no bad performances in this movie. Less focused on people are also well portrayed, considering how little screen time they have. Even the dog of Victoria (Cavalier-King-Charles-Spaniel named Dash) is remembered and influences the film. <br /> <br /> Although the film usually misses more than a few aspects of Victoriaâ€™s life - especially at the end - and instead * tells * what happened (with her and Albert) on the screen, the main thing we actually * see *. After all, this is a film about Young Victoria (not Middle-aged Victoria and Old Victoria). Despite the fact that in this film some embellishments of the story are made, he is still focused on what he intends to do - that is, tells the story of how the young princess came to power. <br /> <br /> The film looks amazing The costumes Emily Blunt wears look amazing, and the music only adds to the movie, but never detracts from it. This is an exceptionally filmed film, and, unlike many films in our day, this film is actually very long, as it does not last so long that you lose interest or feel that it is useless to draw. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that what makes this film so great is Emily Blunt. Here she is in great shape, starring in another great performance and raising this film above what it could be if another actress played in this rather important / historical role. This is one carefully created film with excellent features that are definitely worth seeing. If you value a fascinating look at a woman who was extremely significant in history, you definitely need to see it.
