Although I loved this film, the trailers that distributed the Internet a year before it appeared in cinemas put my expectations a bit higher. <br /> <br /> I have a DVD, so don’t get me wrong, I don’t say, don’t watch or even buy! I just still think the first scene was the best, and nothing in the whole movie ever surpassed it.
