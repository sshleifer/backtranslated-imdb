Breaking Glass is a film that anyone who wants to be in the music industry should see more than once. This is a very dark story about how a record company manipulates a singer to do things her own way and earn as much money as possible. Looking at some of today's “star-seeking” TV shows, both in the UK and abroad, I always recall this film. Although they are not experts in this matter, the winners of these shows, as a rule, receive one very large initial kick, and then his descent. This film precedes this show, although the effect seems the same. After she got rid of her manager, who was brilliantly played by Phil Daniels, the record company slowly but surely changed the lyrics, forcing her to stimulate, and in the end she burned down completely. You are the potential stars of tomorrow .... SEE AND CAUTION !!!
