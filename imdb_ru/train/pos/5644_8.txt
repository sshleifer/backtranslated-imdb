When the US entered World War I, the government forced Hollywood to release propaganda films. LITTLE American is probably the best of all because Mary Pickford plays the main role in it. <br /> <br /> Pickford plays a young woman torn between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hutton (French), but her decision is delayed by the war, both men recruited. <br /> <br /> When the ship on which Pickford sails is sunk by the Germans (remember Lusitania) due to the fact that he is transporting ammunition, Pickford has a beautiful scene when she stands on the Lifeboat and shouts at the German commander. Later, of course, she runs into both Holt and Hatton when she is held as a prisoner of war in a castle. <br /> <br /> Directed by Cecil B. DeMille offers one truly wonderful scene in this film, as Pickford and Holt wander through a bombed-out village. They pass a ruined church, of which only one wall remains. The wall is very big crucifix. As they stand and stare, the wall collapses, but the figure of Jesus remains in the air. This is a very surreal moment in the film, which is otherwise very simple and inept. <br /> <br /> Pikford, as always, is a pleasure to watch. She was always a very natural actress who avoided the historical prowess that many other actors of the time used. She is also very, very beautiful. Holt is very good here in the title role. Hatton is fine. Among the nominal actors in the "extra" parts - Wallace Beerie, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neil and Edith Chapman. <br /> <br /> Not a great movie, but itâ€™s interesting to see US propaganda at work.
