I didn’t explore the film before my first viewing, because it was part of the Wells box set I recently bought. I received the box set mainly because I wanted to get a “Man for all times” and also to revise Waterloo. Therefore, I stick Orson and Rita into the player, and I am equally considered class and confusion. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the story seemed simple: a man meets a gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple. from the thugs, they click right away, and the man gets a job offer on a cruise with a woman and her famous husband lawyer, and then ............. <br /> <br /> ... well it becomes the mystery of the murder of conspiracy and many frauds. Michael O'Hara himself (Orson Welles) doesn’t really know what's going on, he’s just as confused as the viewer, and it’s great to watch as he is pulled almost everywhere in the film. Obviously, the fateful woman of such beauty as Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) has her own moments leading to the heart strings, but you just know that everything will become pear-shaped. <br /> <br /> With so many wonderful things in the film, he has Wells’s visual style everywhere, we see an amazing scene in an aquarium, and the final episodes in a fun house are majestic for the eyes. O'Hara's narrative happily mocks himself, and we get good relief from the legal case with Everett Sloan, which greatly illuminates the proceedings. <br /> <br /> However, the film is an oddity, and in fact it is a random viewing, because {as I should have found out after} The studio bosses cut the film by almost an hour, and this not only upsets us , the audience, but also unfair on the vision of Wells. I am sure that the full original of this film would be praised and honored in bulk, because we have a very good and intriguing film, which, unfortunately, only hints at greatness, but it remains a damn exciting movie that I am glad that I can return to him further. 8.5 / 10
