This is a kind of film that will stay with you for a long time. Soha Ali and Abhay Deol both look very beautiful. Soha reminds you very much of her mother Sharmila Tagore. Abhay is a born actor, and in the near future he will rise greatly. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is very different from most movies. In a sense, you were left unsatisfied, but if you really think about it in real terms, you realize that the only sensible ending was the ending shown in the film. Otherwise it would be a gross injustice to everyone. <br /> <br /> The film tells about a professional witness who meets a girl who is waiting for marriage in court. Her boyfriend does not appear, and ultimately helps her witness. Slowly, slowly, over time, he falls in love with her. It is not clear whether she has such feelings for him or not. Watch the movie for full details. <br /> <br /> The film really belongs to Abhay. I look forward to see more movies from him. Soha pretty, but in the film says little. Her eyes, her innocence made the most of the conversation.
