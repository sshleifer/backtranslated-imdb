I saw Brother's Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival, and I really enjoyed it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are gorgeous as father and son. The film tells Scott Cohen about parole in Alaska and his family in Brooklyn. He appears there because his brother is dead, and he sets off on a journey to gradually restore his alienated relationship with his brotherâ€™s wife and child and his father, who never forgave him for being a black sheep of the family. This story deeply immerses us in the hearts and minds of this family and allows us to better understand the complexity of their lives. In addition, the images of the woodworking business and the Brooklyn background set the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.
