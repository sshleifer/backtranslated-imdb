Eytan Fox did it again: moved the viewer's heart to a modest story, taking place in an overwhelming mess. The film also describes the atmosphere of the incredible city of Tel Aviv so beautifully and subtly. <br /> <br /> I was there a month ago and everything is there: lifestyle, relationships, heart. beating the city, a mess, a sketch of utopian thinking in the most carefree, frivolous and forgetful megalopolis. <br /> <br /> We strongly recommend: this is a journey for the heart and mind with an interesting perspective to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Note of Bene: There is a central gay story in the film. If you do not think that you are too friendly to gays, be prepared for the fact that you will be challenged, and finally, take it as "just love." (and don't worry: the chicken is hot too!)
