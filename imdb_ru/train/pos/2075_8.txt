To say that the film is depressing is not necessarily bad. I really want to see a depressing film, if there is a sense to be made, and this one is definitely there. This is often a heartbreaking story about a Chinese man and his family, as they have lived through many years of hardship and abundance. BUT, I have to warn you that this may just be the most depressing film that will come out of Hollywood in the 1930s - because peasant life in China was quite enough, to say the least. Be prepared to watch episodes about hunger, death, and disease. <br /> <br /> The only minus, apart from the incessant tone of suffering, is that the main role is played by Paul Mooney. While he was an exceptionally talented man, it's just a shame that Hollywood always threw people of European descent to play Asian leaders in this era. If you pay attention at all, then it is quite obvious that Mooney is not suitable for this role.
