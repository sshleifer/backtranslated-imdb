I think I read it somewhere: Joe Johnston (director of the film, as well as one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic to work on the first Star Wars movie) and one of his producers or something else puzzled over getting the title for the movie “Rocket Boys” (I guess) something was missing. <br /> <br /> Once they played a computer program that forms words from other words (for example, you type a word or a series of words and it mixes letters and forms other words) I think the technical term is “anagram” <br /> <br /> In any case, they scored “Rocket Boys” and, of course, return to the “October Sky”. They were shocked, to say the least. The title summed up the entire film, as the film revolves around the satellite. At first, Homer Junior didn’t like the idea, but he warmed up after he came out and shot a paperback novel.
