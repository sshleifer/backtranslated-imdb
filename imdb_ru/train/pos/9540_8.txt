Most of the reviews about the Meatball Machine that I heard were pretty mixed. The couple even say that they think that "it sucks." Well, for the people Iâ€™m talking about, get the fucking imagination and go to hell yourself. It was a very interesting movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins with this mechanical bug, which attacks and somehow turns its owners into these deadly bots, similar to Guar's costumes, called nekroborgami. Eventually, you will learn that these mechanical bugs also attach a small parasite to you, which can then control your actions thanks to the hot connection of your nervous system. Unfortunately, for two lonely young people looking for love, they encounter a mechanical mistake, and before you know about it, transformations and a splash of blood take place. Is there a way to stop the transformation? Perhaps a way to stop this mechanical threat of error? Why nekroborgi fight with each other? Do two desperate singles get to express their feelings for each other and make them nasty? There is only one way to find out. <br /> <br /> When I entered the Meatball Machine, I was somewhat cautious due to mixed reactions, but it turned out to be a big surprise. The only weak points I can think of are a few unanswered questions, occasional average behavior and a slightly confusing ending. From the feeling of anime to the parasites who themselves become small characters, and even because of the feeling of a limited budget, this film gets to the right point more often than it misses. With a constantly evolving story that is interesting enough to keep up to date with questions mixed with cool makeup effects and blood spatter, this fan of bizarro / horror / Tetsuo / splatter fans is worth checking out. 8 out of 10
