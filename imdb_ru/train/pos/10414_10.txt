I first discovered in the early 1950s the fantasy by Alexander Korda (1940) “The Thief of Baghdad” in a reissue called “A Wonderful Show of the Century!” Both films Korda Technicolor, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown in one program that should not be forgotten . The music of Miklos Ross strengthened both films. Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! The thief of Baghdad remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. Years passed, it became increasingly difficult to enjoy the color of the film as it was originally presented. True Technicolor was replaced by the Eastman Color process in the mid-1950s. Both Cinema and Samuel Goldwyn republished the film in both theater and video. But Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and dimmed the brightness of the original Technicolor. The release of the Laser Disc of this title also looks pastel - beautiful, but not the way it should be. NOW the release of the M-G-M DVD (December 3, 2002). Thief Baghdad again has a wonderful Technicolor DVD view that is simply awesome !!! It was so great to see it again, that after watching the DVD, I watched it a second time. The only “Additions” are the Spanish dubbed version, subtitles in English and Spanish, and a beautifully made original theater trailer. Thanks to M-G-M for this EXCLUSIVE DVD release. Now you can only hope that KORDa FOUR FOXES and a restored version of JUNGLE BOOK from Korda will appear on the DVD soon (instead of bad prints of public domain).
