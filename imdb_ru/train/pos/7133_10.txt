Absolute film masterpiece! Good night, Mr. Tom quickly became one of my favorite films of all time. No one should miss this movie, it's too good! Mr. Tom is perfectly portrayed by John Tow as a stern old man who becomes a soft father figure when William Buck (Nick Robinson) goes to his evacuation, almost like the "City mouse and the village mouse." A truly heartbreaking movie. The director knew exactly how to turn a book into a movie, and he did it very well. The film was shot so well that the emotions of the characters and what was happening made the audience experience a variety of emotions, from love to fear, and these emotions could turn into six pence. Filmed during the riots during World War II, this film also shows the difference between cities and villages, they are almost like different countries. Absolutely must see those who do not miss a truly amazing and brilliant film.
