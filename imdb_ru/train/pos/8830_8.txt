This is a masterpiece in b / w 35mm film. The film makes you see a strange way to start the day at 7:35 am at the bar and find out how much can happen there in 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> In short, you find yourself in a complex history using very few elements, and step by step makes you understand that something is not quite right. It expresses a lot, makes your adrenaline rise in subtle details and is incredibly understandable to anyone, not just film critics. <br /> <br /> But I know how it sounds: European short, black and white and with a low budget. Do not let this scare you. In fact, it is worth looking at everyone, not just the experts in the genre. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more to tell, since the film lasts only 8 minutes (exactly), and I do not want to spoil it. But I just watched it on the Internet and could not understand why no one had spent a few minutes to leave a comment about it. <br /> <br /> Really worth seeing. 10/10
