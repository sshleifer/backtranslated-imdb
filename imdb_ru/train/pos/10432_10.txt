I must admit that at first I was a little restrained in watching this movie. I thought it was a stupid little romantic film about a Frenchwoman who meets an American in a train and decides to go with him to Vienna. I really wasn't fascinated by this script, as he continued to make me believe that it was just a movie. However, I watched it! And I was amazed ... "Before Dawn" is one of the few films that dare to speak quite philosophically, marveling at the fact that at the time of our birth we are sentenced to death or that it is the average thought that a couple should rest together forever or that we humans can sometimes live in fairy tales. <br /> <br /> The end was wonderfully chosen (we donâ€™t know if they will meet again in six months, at six o'clock, at the train station in Vienna) - we sincerely hope so. The actors acted very well, so I began to believe that I myself could live a love story, just like this one.
