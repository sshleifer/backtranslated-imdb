Lillian Hellman, one of America’s most famous female playwrights, was a woman with a mission. Her left views were not well appreciated at the time in the country. In her memoirs, she talks about her trip to the then Soviet Union, since she was intrigued by the so-called successes achieved by this system. The “clock on the Rhine” must have been the result of those years. The left wing in America, as well as throughout the world, had a problem with the growth of fascism, not only in Europe, but also in Japan. <br /> <br /> The Patrol on the Rhine was put on Broadway eight months before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. In this, Miss Hellman proclaimed the entry of America into World War II. The adaptation is attributed to Ms. Hellman and Dashila Hammett, her longtime companion. At the direction of the director Herman Shumlin, the film was well received when its premiere took place in 1943. <br /> <br /> We get to know the Müller family when the film opens. They cross the border with the United States from Mexico. They must continue their journey to the home of Mrs. Muller in Washington, DC, where her mother, Fanny Farrelli, is a little celebrity mistress. We understand that Mullers are fleeing Europe due to the persecution of opponents of the upcoming totalitarian regime in Germany. In fact, we thought that in a sense, Mullers could have been better justified if they were Jews, fleeing from certain extermination. <br /> <br /> We learn that Mr. Muller has experienced terrible times of the Motherland, as well as in other places, because of his frankness in condemning the Fashims. Little does he know that he comes to his mother-in-law’s house, where one of the worst representatives of this philosophy lives. <br /> <br /> The movie offers a great game around. This is a curious thing because of the supporting role of Bette Davis. Paul Lucas, repeating his role on Broadway, is very convincing in the role of Kurt Muller, an honest man who wants to make the world a better place for himself and his family. Mr. Lucas works great by portraying Kurt Muller, repeating the role that made him a stage enlightener on Broadway. <br /> <br /> Another best performance is Lucille Watson, who plays Fanny Farrelli, the matriarch of this family. Geraldine Fitzgerald - Martha de Brancovis, guest of Farrellis, is married to the despicable Tekk de Brancovis, the Nazi sympathizer, played by George Coulyouris. Beula Bondi, Donald Woods and the rest of the actors play good performances under the direction of Mr. Shumlin. <br /> <br /> The film should serve as a reminder of the evils of totalitarian rule, wherever.
