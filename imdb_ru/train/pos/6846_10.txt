The film receives my seal of approval. The scene at the museum requires action without dialogue. This is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of cinema. Character Dickinson Kate is very well developed, and her performance is felt throughout the film. The best work Angie Dickinson has done since Point Blank!
