I just read the TomReynolds2004 comments and I feel that I have to jump here. I understand that he does not like the film, but its reasons are not obvious. My feeling about this film is that he is not afraid to travel the dark roads of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sadness. Each of these two people, as depicted, has many reasons to be bitter and evil, but to find tenderness and comfort in each other. Only a great acting game could do this work without becoming an emotional quagmire, sentimental and juicy. I really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity, which they gave such strong performances. I have every reason to dislike Jane Fonda for her actions during the Vietnamese era, but besides her personal feelings, she is magnificent in this role. Robert De Niro is great as a man whose intelligence and kindness begin to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities. This is the first time that DeNiro uses tenderness, not harshness, to sell a character, and I like it a lot. This film was a big surprise when I first watched it, and I look forward to it again.
