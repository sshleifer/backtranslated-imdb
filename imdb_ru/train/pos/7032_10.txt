My school's theater club will be showing this show in spring 2002, and I can only hope that we are so good! I recently watched this film as a kind of “study” of my role (Rosie Alvarez), and I just wanted to say that Vanessa Williams is the coolest! <br /> <br /> Wow! The casting for this film was correct (with one exception). Jason Alexander, oh my goodness, what can he not do? He was the most wonderful Albert Peterson in the entire history - I especially liked all his funny facial expressions and dances during “Put on your happy face!” He is so cool! Vanessa Williams, as I said, is the coolest. She was beautiful Rosie, and her transition from secretary to temptress was absolutely plausible. Tyne Daly was gay, like Albert's disgusting mother, and George Wendt was excellent, like Mr. McAfee annoyed (however, I LOVED Paul Lind's performance in the 1963 version!). Brigitte Dow pissed me off like Ursula Merkle; she really messed up everything! And Mark Kudish was a terrific Konrad Birdi ... "Be patient!" <br /> <br /> There was only one casting that I did not understand, and as you will see from the previous comments, many other people did not do it. 'T understand. Chinna Phillips as Kim McAfee - what was it? I mean, she is really beautiful and very talented, but ... she looks too mature for this role. Maybe I delirious. <br /> <br /> Well, anyway, I highly recommend this movie. It will make you smile! <br /> <br />
