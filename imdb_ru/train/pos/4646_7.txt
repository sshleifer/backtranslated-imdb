I did not know what to do with this film. I guess it was really all. I have never seen such a film, and I doubt that I will really ever do it again. Glover collects something unique for him. I think to appreciate this, you should read some of his poems, perhaps watch one of his slideshows. I really like this guy, he's so weird that I can't help it. Note. I saw this movie before it was final edited, so maybe what I saw and what others saw is different. I will know, I think, if I decide to watch the movie again. I think I should be properly influenced by drugs ...
