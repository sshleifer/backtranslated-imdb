I really enjoyed the details that went into the script. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Rhys Meyers (misspelled) and Jewel were outstanding in their support roles. Like Jeffrey Wright. Toby McGwire did an excellent job with acting, as he had ever portrayed when he had to amputate his best friend's hand, knowing that he would die without a procedure. <br /> <br /> Attention to detail, a good dialectical training, to grasp the southern accent incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Why this movie was captured by Hollywood promoters, I can only imagine. I have strong suspicions. Which makes it even more attractive to me. I gave a dozen DVD copies for gifts. <br /> <br /> Fully missed movie. Rent or buy it and give it all your attention for a couple of hours, and then judge.
