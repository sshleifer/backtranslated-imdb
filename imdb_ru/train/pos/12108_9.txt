Yakitate! Ja-pan (translated as “Fresh Baked! Japanese Bread”) is the story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his journey of making the perfect Japanese bread or Ja-pan for Japan and for the Japanese, who will be recognized by the whole world. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is just outside. Actually Yakite! Ja-pan is not really about bread, but about the reaction that comes after eating bread, and the pun that accompanies the reaction. The series is attractive because of these puns. From popular anime titles such as Naruto, Detective Conan and Dragon Ball, to blockbusters like The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings. Everything is there. <br /> <br /> So what makes this title different from other titles of the same genre as Cooking Master Boy or Mr. Ajikko? Well, unlike others who use cooking for world domination, Yakitate! Ja-pan is pure comedy. Of course, there are times when the story turns into drama or even murder, but the comedic atmosphere makes them laugh at them. You will laugh at your view of paradise. Just take a look. <br /> <br /> Just remember that this is also an invention, although some of the bread cooked here is based on real bread, by eating homemade Japan No. 2, you will not turn into Super Sayan or turn your body into rubber.
