He could not understand why Jeremy Irons found it necessary to show the most embarrassing accent, uttered through clenched teeth and behind the throat. In fact, it rather spoiled the film for me, and distracted from what was probably his excellent presentation (very annoying). No other actor or actress seemed to have such a pronounced accent, and although I always rated Jeremy Irons as a great actor, I would not call this film one of his best. The film, however, gave me an appetite, like some other comments made on this film, which I found very interesting, and I intend to read the book now.
