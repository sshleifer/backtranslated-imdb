First, I liked this movie. It was good for everyone. <br /> <br /> However, I do not understand the comments that I hear from people about the unexpected ending. I did not know anything about this film, except for a few “must-see” recommendations, but I knew where the plot was going in less than ten minutes. (I will not mention what prompted me not to spoil a good movie for others.) Nevertheless, despite the fact that it seemed obvious, I continued to watch. It was nice to see how everything is played out, filling in the details and motives of the characters in the later scenes. <br /> <br /> I don’t hate it when I anticipate the ending at the beginning of the movie. I hate it only when the path to the resolution is dotted with boring landscapes. <br /> <br /> The persona on the screen of Will Smith is simply cute, even when he plays such a vague character. He is energetic and believable in everything I have seen from him. "Seven Pounds" is another great performance. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson is a solid performer, depicting a strange, rather elevated character, despite the incurable heart condition. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with Rosario, if you do not find it magnificent, you should think about replacing the eyes. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Woody Harrelson on the screen. I have not seen him much lately, but it could only be me. Woody did not have a huge amount of screen time, but he sold his cheerful, piano-playing, blind character for all it cost. Fine. <br /> <br /> A quick study of the boxed jellyfish tells me that its poison is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I think this makes it a dubious choice for both the pet and the plot. <br /> <br /> In general, I should recommend this film not for the plot, but for some very good performances, and for the fact that it tends to evoke some tragic emotions that we usually try to avoid.
