The film was very touching. It was tender and funny at the same time. The scenery was absolutely beautiful! Peter Folk and Paul Reiser gave award-winning performances. Olympia Dukakis was great. I understand that because of the storyline, her role should have been brief, but I would like it if I could see more of her — she’s a real pro. seeing this movie. We were lucky to see Paul Reiser in Q and A after watching. He is a wonderful person, intelligent, eloquent and "real person." It was a really nice night! This movie is a must see. You will be so grateful that you went.
