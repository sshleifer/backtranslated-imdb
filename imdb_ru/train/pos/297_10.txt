I am glad that other people enjoyed this film, because I know that he doesn’t have the best reputation, and he didn’t make money at the box office. I thought it was amazing, and there are several reasons why Bogdanovich is directing with a light touch, the cast (especially Colin Camp) is perfect, and Big Bad Apple has never looked better on film. You have seen the worst movies!
