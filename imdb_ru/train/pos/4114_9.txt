The name of this film does not make much sense until you see it in action, because it is the sound that a backward young man makes while he drives his imaginary cart, which he does all day. And he is just one of many strange characters in this surrealistic and sometimes tragic story about a group of slum dwellers in Japan. <br /> <br /> There are two drunks who sell wives, there is a man seeking to be an architect and his little son, whom he sends to ask for food. There is a wise old man who seems to be the pillar of sanity in everything that happens around him, and there is a businessman with serious nervous breakdowns who has a wife who treats him (and everyone else) as dirt. <br /> This is not a special plot, in fact, it is a bunch of stories that drift back and forth among themselves, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. In general, I thought it worked quite well, and I really wanted to see it for a long time, based only on its description. I was not at all disappointed and would definitely recommend it. 9 out of 10
