I used to watch this show when I was a little girl. When I think about it, I remember only vaguely. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things that I vaguely remember are the initial sequence and theme of the song. In addition to this, everyone was ideally. In addition, the letter was very strong. The performances were also top notch. I hope that some network will return it so that I can see every episode. Before I finish, I would like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, although I do not think I have seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, if some network ever returns it, I hope you catch it the day before it goes on the air for good.
