The film "Titanic" makes it much more than just a "memorable night". He writes a tragic historical event, which is always talked about and which will never be forgotten. Why so criticized? I have no idea. Could / would they ever make a film like Titanic that is so touching and touching every time you watch it? Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece? It will be almost impossible. <br /> <br /> The director undoubtedly had a great influence on the film. A simple film about disasters (boring to watch) turns into an incredible novel. Yes, I am also not from romances, but this should not bother you, because you will never see such a novel. Guaranteed! All for amazing effects, for music, for the sublime action. <br /> <br /> The film creates an amazing visual effect and a wonderful feeling. Everything looks very real and alive. The very legend "TITANIC" brilliantly shown in all classes, also looks, too decent. Acting was a real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best in their roles. No one could do better. In part, they are the reason why the film is so good. <br /> <br /> I think this is not so much. The plot is simple, the acting is brilliant, based on a true story. Probably more than half of consumers who watch a movie will cry, thanks to an unimaginable ending that can never be forgotten. Well, if you have not seen this film, you are missing something pestering, and a film that worships Hollywood. Could it get better? No, absolutely not. The most touching film of all time, do not listen to people, see for yourself, then you will understand. Landmark (don't be surprised if you cry too)
