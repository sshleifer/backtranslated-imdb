You are using IMDb. <br /> <br /> You gave some hefty voices to some of your favorite movies. <br /> <br /> This is what you like to do. <br /> <br /> And this is all because of this. Fifty seconds. One world ends, another begins. <br /> <br /> How can he not be given ten? I wonder who gives it seven or eight ... how exactly is the FIRST MOVIE EVER MADE? For your information, the long, still-opening shot is a great showman, a great innovation, perfect for the situation. And a dog on a bicycle is a wonderful touch. All this for fifty seconds. <br /> <br /> The word "genius" is often abused. <br /> <br /> THIS IS A GENIUS.
