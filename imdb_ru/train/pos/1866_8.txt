Excellent story based on a real story about a young black man and all the difficulties on the road. As this is the first Denzel Washington film that he was going to shoot himself, I have to admit that I was a little skeptical, but who would not ...? But again, he is a great actor with many years of experience, and the end result was great. The story is told in a magnificent way, forcing you to experience difficulties in childhood and youth, to see yourself in such situations. So he hits you hard, letting you know that you are not the only one going through hell. In general, a touching story about a young man trying to do it in this awesome world. (The story is based on the life of Antwone Fisher, born August 3., 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who was also the author of this film) Highly recommended. 8/10
