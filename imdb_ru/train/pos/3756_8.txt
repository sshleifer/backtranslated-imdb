Made just ten years after the real events and set in the Bunker under the Reichstag, the Pabst film is completely engaging. It smells of sulfurous death awaiting the perpetrators of a world war. I have not seen this for more than three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. The characters seem to be waiting to be walled up in their cave. Sparking a dialogue between two generals: "Does God exist?" "If He did, we would not." It is a pity that it is not so easily available for the exhibition or purchase, because it would be interesting to see and compare this film with the documentary film about Traudl Jung, “Im Toten Winkel” (“Blind Spot: Hitler’s Secretary”) and “The Ruin” with Bruno . Ganz.
