Three scary stories based on members of a transgressive Hindu cult who return home but have somehow changed. In the first story, our former member of the cult is now in a mad asylum, and a person who comes to visit him who wants to know what happened in the cult. Somewhat sluggish, as recounted in the memoirs, when they sit on chairs and look at each other. The reporter is particularly interested in what leads to the death of the participants. What seemed rather boring suddenly becomes very exciting with an unexpected turn of history. Everything gets pretty bloody. <br /> <br /> In the second story, a young criminal abuses a psychiatrist to undergo compulsory therapy. The patient seems to have some type of program, but the psychiatrist is doing the job. Again, everything slows down a bit and becomes weird. In addition, there is a very strange turn in history, which is very well written and amazing. <br /> <br /> The final story tells about a spiritual healer who claims that he can remove the sickness of people with his own hands. One of the patients is a former member of the cult, so successful treatment becomes more difficult. Again, we are surprised by the turn. There is a rather bloody scene. <br /> <br /> For some reason there is some kind of pretty full nudity of the female sex, as well as complete nudity of the male sex. I found that the stories were written very well, and the director completely manages to customize each story with its amazing twist and terrible consequences. <br /> <br /> Note: review of the German DVD.
