Very strong movie. Bruce is good, and Brad too. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that two cities from the list that Bruce remembered are missing from the list of administrators. <br /> <br /> This means that the woman was real insurance and she did her job. <br /> <br /> Well, Novikov property seems to me to work in this film. However, I believe in "Back to the future theory of the multiplicity of worlds." <br /> <br /> So Bruce could save the world, but not his world. <br /> <br /> In the theory of parallel worlds, a person can meet himself. <br /> <br /> And I believe that this is no problem. Here I disagree with Dr. Brown from the back ... <br /> <br /> But the story of 12 Monkeys has its own beauty. Despite all these theories about one world, a multitude or a continuum, one can believe that he is really crazy, and the doctor - his girlfriend was just lost. <br /> <br /> A sequence of events that may lead her to think that this is from the future. The bullet - well, it could be some kind of mistake, some kind of falsification. <br /> <br /> Well, I like this movie - I need to buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> Best of all.
