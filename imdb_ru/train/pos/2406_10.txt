this is the best example of what, in my opinion, Jesus was like. most films show that Jesus was effeminate, lobotic, or tortured. this Jesus laughed, played, and was serious when it was necessary. This is the type of people who are attracted to people, not the Hollywood version. <br /> <br /> the film took on some of its freedoms, trying to â€œfill in the blanks. but the fillers did not seem impossible or even incredible. I could argue that he never explained what the Romans had against Jesus (the film showed that the Romans were the main driving force behind the death of Jesus, and not that the Jewish authorities were against this idea). <br /> <br /> The film seemed to be well researched. One example was an occasional commentary on a teenager, who was called a "sign." It is believed that this sign (or the sign of John) was a boy who was called in the Garden of Gethsemane, whose cloak was torn off and ran away naked (Mark 14:51). I have a feeling that they tried to make the film as accurate as possible (even in spirit) as possible.
