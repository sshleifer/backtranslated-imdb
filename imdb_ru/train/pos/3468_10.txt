I really liked this movie! At first I did not dare to watch it, because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, watching “The Two of Us” brought me back to a happier time, when he was still alive and there was hope and opportunity. I think the writer did an amazing job portraying what "could be." Aidan Quinn was adorable as Paul and met a challenge head on. I was impressed with his accent and manners. Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite believable as John. My favorite parts were the scene in the park and the scene on the roof that was so sharp. The film left me with both sadness and satisfaction, both of which I consider appropriate, given the circumstances.
