You do not need to read this review. <br /> <br /> An earlier review from pninson of Seattle has already revealed all the major shortcomings of this production. I can only strengthen his main arguments. <br /> <br /> “Cold House” was a relatively late novel by Dickens and much darker than his early works. This is too literally perceived by director Ross Devenish, who accumulates darkness and too much fog. When Ada, Rick, and Esther appear half an hour after the opening episode, it is a relief when I first get to daylight. In some dark scenes it was difficult to see what was really on my TV screen. I watched it all in one day, starting at noon. Since daylight has disappeared, it has become less of a problem, but I have a pretty good TV, and I have never encountered this problem before at any time of the day. <br /> <br /> The pacing rate is very deliberate (i.e. slow). I'm sure it was intentional, but it overdid it. There are numerous shots of people wandering through the mud and darkness of Victorian London, which take longer than necessary to create a mood and atmosphere. A good editor could probably take a few minutes from every fifty-minute episode without losing the line of dialogue, just slightly cutting each of these scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not want to exaggerate these two problems, you will soon adapt to the appearance and pace of this production. A more important problem is that it does not always tell the story very effectively. Dickens's earlier novels are as long as Cold House, but they are not so intricate. For example, I recently re-read Nicholas Nickleby because I was intrigued to see Douglas McGrath squeeze an 800-page book into his two-hour film. The answer is simple: the book is full of indents. McGrath cut out magnificent fragments of the novel, while retaining all the main elements of the story. This would not be possible with the Cold House. <br /> <br /> This performance needs seven hours. This probably needs even longer, because many of the elements of his convoluted plot are not clear enough or are as well handled as they should be. A few random examples illustrate the problem. <br /> <br /> A maid, Rosa, appears out of nowhere with no background, so Lady Dedlock's affection for her is largely unmotivated. <br /> <br /> Sergeant George’s humility Tulkinhorn’s claim on Horton’s handwriting sample is somewhat deceptive. <br /> <br /> It is not clear enough that Esther is really in love with Woodcourt when she agrees to marry John Jarndyce. It is also not clear whether they agreed not to announce their engagement or why. <br /> <br /> Ada and Rick's secret marriage is omitted. In one episode, they are simply lovers; in the next, people suddenly call them husband and wife. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Roundswell only meets at a late stage in the story and the dismissal of Sergeant George from her family. remains unexplained, as is the way it is discovered. <br /> <br /> Tulkinhorn’s commitment to maintaining the honor and respectability of the Dedlock family is understated, so his motive for the pursuit of Lady Dedlock is more obscure than it needs to be. <br /> <br /> The involvement of brick makers in a relationship with Tom and (later) Lady Dedlock is somewhat opaque. <br /> <br /> It is not obvious that Guppy renews her offer to Esther because she’s smallpox scars have almost disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is only a choice: there are others. They are not serious problems, and the main point of the story is clear enough. However, they are minor irritants that diminish his strength: you do not have to wrestle with small plot points. However, there are more important structural problems that weaken the story at a later stage. <br /> <br /> The whole process of the murder of Tulkinhorn is somewhat discarded. The bucket immediately identifies Hortensia as a suspect, which undermines the uncertainty of Sergeant George’s predicament and the importance of finding Mrs. Roundswell. It also reduces the influence of the subplot, in which suspicion is raised on Lady Dedlock, and weakens the scene in which Hortense is exposed to Sir Lester. <br /> <br /> A more serious problem is that the murder, its investigation and the subsequent search for Lady Dedlock dominate this story for more than an hour, during which we completely lose sight of another main storyline: the court case and its influence on Rick. His unsatisfactory finances, his frustration with Foules and Skimpole, Ada’s despair, his deteriorating health, and so on — all suspended for a whole episode. This may be how Dickens wrote the book (I have not read it for many years), but a good script should make different storylines move forward together. <br /> <br /> Finally, the role of Smallweed in history is so diminished that it is almost superfluous. His discovery of the new will, which launches the final phase of the story, is also discarded. It happens behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, it is still a very good production. Many of the speeches are outstanding. Individual scenes are beautifully implemented. His accumulating sense of tragedy is very strong. I would still recommend this as an excellent adaptation of a great book if it were not for 2005 production. In fact, I probably would not have known about his shortcomings if I had not seen how Andrew Davis did it better. I have criticized Jane Austen’s adaptation from Davis, but I have to admit that he really knows how to tame Dickens' sprawling books. <br /> <br /> This is an impressive and addictive drama that costs 7 hours of any time. However, his probable fate should be viewed primarily as a cross reference to the almost final version of 2005.
