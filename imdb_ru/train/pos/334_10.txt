It is very easy to define this film: “PURE NOISE”. This opinion was formulated for the following reasons: the performance of actors that seem to be citizens of that era, 1100 BC. They perfectly personalize the characters. The second reason is that the poetry expressed by Homer in his poem is well given in production. Among other things, the stories made by the choir create a special atmosphere that makes us a participant in artistic performance. The third reason: the reconstruction of the decor is absolutely perfect, in the Mediterranean regions where the poem took place. And most of all emotions on dates. I repeat my gratitude: "PURE SHEDER".
