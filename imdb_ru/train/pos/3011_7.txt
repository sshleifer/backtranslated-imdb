One of the best films of Vance achieves greater success in an interesting plot and sly directing by none other than Michael Curtis. This time, in his locked and locked upstairs bedroom, he was found dead — a shot in the head a financier who is usually hated. Philo Vance, hearing about the situation when he is going to go to Italy, decides to end his vacation and try to decide what he considers to be murder and what everyone else considers to be suicide. William Powell is as friendly Philo Vance as you will find. It seems he never presses and is always very calm about what he says and does. Powell is helped by many very talented actors - some first-class actors and actresses, such as Mary Astor as a niece who hated her uncle, Ralph Morgan as a dead man’s secretary, Paul Cavanaugh as a lover of competing dogs, Arthur Hol, as a mysterious butler, Helen Vinson as a neighbor, she was holding a blonde, and two really good speeches by James Lee, like a Chinese cook, and an impressive Eugene Palitra as a smart police detective. Add the wonderful comedy episode of Etienne Girardot to the mix, when the public investigator always misses his meal. It is this depth of the suspects and the story, in which there are a lot of turns and turns, that make the “Case of killing a nursery” a fast-paced, funny puzzle.
