It was the first televised episode of the Colombo series (although it was filmed after Death Gives A Hand) and marked one of the most successful television series in history. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy (who played the killer on the series three times) equally admires complacency, arrogance and self-confidence, like Ken Franklin, one of the half of the mystery writing team, who bears a carefully thought-out plot to kill his partner Jim Ferris (who is played by Martin Milner) who decides to end their professional relationship, with the result that Franklin is exposed only as a good publicist, not a prolific writer. <br /> <br /> The initial kill setting is fantastic and Cassidy's performance makes it easier to justify the honor that he was the best Colombo Killer on the show. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is remarkably understated in his role as Colombo and his inborn character traits and oddities, which are emphasized by seeming slowness and absent-mindedness, especially character’s extreme complacency with Cassidy: one of their early scenes together, where Ken Franklin comes up with The motive for murder through the non-existent Jim Ferris exposition to identify assassins operating in the underworld illustrates this very well. Franklin hints at Colombo for this potential motive, and Colombo is not (deliberately or unconsciously) unable to grab hold of him, forcing Franklin to express his disappointment in a clearly patronizing manner and compare him with the detective in the books, Mrs Melville. <br /> <The early director's contribution of 24-year-old Steven Spielberg also deserves attention. Despite some elementary inclusions of cameras hiding actors and actresses, he adds some stylish and sophisticated touches to support the overall professionalism of the episode. One particularly sharp picture is Jim Feriss’s dead body lying on the sofa, almost dark in the foreground, when Ken Franklin raises his glass in the background after he finishes answering the phone call to Ferris’s distraught wife. I have no doubt that, working on a restrictive 10-14 day schedule, Spieberg’s efforts should not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the event of a second murder caused by blackmail according to a woman’s plan. Franklin's friend (and ironically called Colombo "sloppy" in his climatic generalization) comes out of it all. The front edge of the story is compromised, and the time on the screen between Falk and Cassidy is inexcusably reduced at this point, perhaps to help the screenwriter (Steven Bocho) to get out of a difficult angle, since he cannot single-handedly develop the story without another murder. <br /> <br /> The climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode. The initial banter and word exchange between Falk and Cassidy is resolutely and effectively performed, but he simply advertises the fact that it should have happened more in the episode. The main deterioration lies in the key to sealing (if it can be called a key): the thorough complacency and arrogance of Cassidy’s character are marvelously expelled by a key that really says little about his fault; and as soon as it is mentioned, it capitulates in a rather uncharacteristic and uncharacteristic manner. <br /> <br /> In general, the bold discovery of the series, which inevitably advertises and predicts everything that is good in Colombo, and, conversely, the problems associated with such ingenuity, that is, maintaining high standards and, in particular, creating reliable and quite a reasonable ending.
