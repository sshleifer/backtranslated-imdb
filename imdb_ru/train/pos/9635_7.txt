The romance of the film, which is also its main theme, is nice and beautifully presented. However, the environment of a love story is too lyrical, graphic and unreal. Worse, the psychology of the protagonist is strange and incomprehensible, like the end of a film. Feel free to watch this movie if it interests you, but also donâ€™t expect too much from it.
