I was looking through old VHS tapes that I had, and came across the TV show “John Denver and Christmas Dolls Together”. It made me go to the computer and see if I could find the DVD version of this show to buy. I was disappointed that I could not find it on DVD. The show was broadcast in 1979 and was amazing. I have a recording and a CD, but I would like to buy a DVD version of this show. The tape is old and the image quality is pretty good, but fades, the sound is not as good as that of a CD. There are also several other songs not recorded on a CD. As a fan of John Denver and dolls, a DVD with this show would really be a good seller. If you don't have a CD, this is a wonderful collection of Chritmas songs taken from this show. The album is also good if you can find it and still have a player to play it.
