Vanilla Sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 film Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And in my opinion, a much more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Ames, a selfish egoist who takes the emotions of others for granted and thinks only of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best and in many ways the only friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sophia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend who accompanies him on David's birthday. Cameron Diaz is played by Julie Gianni, David's random buddy. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist talking to David. All of their interactions and their consequences make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional and complex thrillers. I will no longer explain the plot, because it is much more convincing, the less you know. Ignore all the people who call this film too confusing to follow. If you pay attention, you will not be confused. The film is very complex, but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best films ever made.
