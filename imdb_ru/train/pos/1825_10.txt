I saw this film when I was young, and remembered it as one of the first films I really liked; it was not an action movie or a comedy. So in the following years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or something in this movie. To my surprise, the film met all my expectations. This is a great movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes, good songs (although not very good, and this actually explains why I don't remember that it was a musical), and all this is very useful for my time. I was surprised because the last films of my childhood that I visited did not even meet my minimum requirements for a decent movie, and yet this film, which I first saw in second grade, made me cry today just as it made me cry then Maybe it's because my dog ​​recently died, or maybe not, but what matters is that it made me feel, and that's why the directors make films (this is money, of course). Yes, there is a continuity of glitches. Yes, there are holes in the script, but this is not important. The film itself is fun and intelligent. So do not be fooled by cynical people who are always looking for bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this film gets 10 not because it's perfect. He gets 10 simply because it made me feel.
