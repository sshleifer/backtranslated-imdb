This movie is just so good! Despite Carmen Electra, this should be one of the best films I've seen lately. Jamie Kennedy is just awesome, and Loren Dean plays a crazy spoiled movie star very well. The plot is also great. This is all very real, which is scary. It says here that it’s a drama, but it’s one of the most damn funniest dramas I’ve ever seen. Go check it out.
