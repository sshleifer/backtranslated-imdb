*** SPOILERS *** About the first World War II films coming out of Hollywood, which show how the war affected those soldiers or, in this case, the US marines who fought in it. <br /> <br /> 21-year-old Al Schmid, John Garfield, was just starting to live with a well-paid job — earning about $ 40 a week — at the local steel mill and Ruth Hartley’s girlfriend, Elenore Parker, whom he was going to marry when the Japanese spoiled everything for him, and millions of young Americans attacked the US Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor. Fulfilling his duty as an American citizen, Al immediately joined the United States Marine Corps in the hope of avenging the Japanese, knowing how it turned out that the marines would be the first American combat units to be hit. /> <br /> Al finally got his chance when his unit, the 1st Marine Division, landed on August 7, 1942 on Guadalcanal on the vast Solomon Islands to attract the Japanese, who controlled it. It was during the battle near the Ilu Ala river that almost with one hand stopped the massive attack of the Japanese Banzai, restraining wave after wave of suicide attacks with resolute Japanese with their machine gun until help or reinforcements finally arrived. It was during the bloody battles that Al collided with a Japanese grenade that blinded him. <br /> <br /> Now in the states that are recovering in a naval hospital, Al has come across something much more difficult to overcome. then fighting the battalion size attack of Japanese or German soldiers. He faces a future in which he will never see again, and he will have to depend on others who will look after him or him! <br /> <br /> We will see a battle in the film “Pride of the Marines”. He himself is much harder than ever, he made the Japanese troops on Guadalcanal, just to come to terms with his disability. Not wanting anyone, especially his girlfriend Ruth, to feel sorry for him, in fact, Al is the one who felt sorry for himself more than anyone else in the film. It was with the help of the Navy Nurse Virginia Pfeiffer, Rosemary DeCamp and Ruth, along with her friend in the US Marine Corps, Lee Diamond Dean Clarke, finally gives Al the courage to confront his blindness with the same force that he encountered wave after wave. Goodalkanale. Al courage thought he had lost back in this god-forgotten hell island in the South Pacific. <br /> <br /> Based on the true story of US Marine Sergeant Albert Schmid, the Pride of the Marine Corps showed what we expected from tens of thousands of wounded US soldiers returning from the war. We will see how in many ways it was much more difficult for those who fought the war to adapt to America’s peacetime when they left something, as in the case of Al-Shmid, on the battlefield. The battle of Al with his personal demons was much more difficult than with the Japanese, whom he fought, because they were part of him and therefore had to fight with themselves in order to defeat and eventually defeat them. Despite the help he received from nurse Virginia and his girlfriend Ruth, as well as from the doctor of the Navy, who is strikingly similar to the actor Gregory Peck, he still had to overcome the fears that he faced. The fears with which he and only he had to fight and overcome, as he was told everything in the film, all by himself.
