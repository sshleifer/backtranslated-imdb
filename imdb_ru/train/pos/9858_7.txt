I would not go so far as not to recommend this film, since the only problems that I have with him are related to the overexposure of the plot devices used in the film — these kinds of things characteristic of any children's film have ever made him seem . It does nothing wrong, I just would not go far. <br /> <br /> This is a bit of saccharin, so I can say that for the most part, anyone who is looking for something with a little more intelligence may be disappointed in a film meant for children, like this. <br /> <br /> However, all this flies out the window when this squirrel appears on the screen (the one in all trailers). His time is limited, but it seems obvious that decision makers had the wisdom to say to these guys: “Hey, could you add a little more protein?” Each time it becomes unbearably boring. It does not save the film, but you can leave the statement "at least there was one aspect in which I could not stop laughing." <br /> <br /> And, of course, visually it will not disappoint, but it is almost given with Pixar clicks. Out of all their stuff, I would put it downstairs ... but that in itself is not bad.
