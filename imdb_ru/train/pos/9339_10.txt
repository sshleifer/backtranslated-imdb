For those of you who do not have this mention, clubberin is 4 fists hitting one body ... <br /> <br /> In any case, for review. <br /> <br /> I miss WCW Saturday Night. Some of my favorite moments of struggle occurred on this scene. I remember watching Stunning Austin, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Cactus Jack, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP on his work days, Lord Stephen Regal, Harlem Heath, Ricky Steamboat, STING ... I would be here while listing all. The fact is that WCW had a wonderful line-up on the pre-Googan days, and they created entertainment television. Dusty Rhodes, in comments over the past years, gave me a completely new reason to watch when I started smoking marijuana as a teenager ... I really would like Vince to put him on a microphone for a show or two, perhaps at the next Great American Concert ? They are CLUBBERIN! And here is DA PLUNDA! He was great. <br /> <br /> -DirrTy
