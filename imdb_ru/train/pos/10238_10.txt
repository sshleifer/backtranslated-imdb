People expect no less brilliant when Steven Spielberg makes a film, and this film is no exception. Some of the films I love were poorly filmed at the box office, but I’m glad to say that this film is not one of them (more than nine million dollars, which I don’t think was bad for that time). The characters were funny, the animation was clear and not blurred, and the music was modern, which is unusual for an animated film. I did not think that Professor Screw Eyes or his Scary Virus was too scary for young children (the target audience of this film), but I thought that what happened to the creepy professor at the end was too dark for the children. movie. In general, this film is a funny and charming classic that I have loved for many years.
