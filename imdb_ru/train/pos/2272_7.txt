Nick Nolte plays well in the grim tale of Kurt Vonnegut. Notl plays Howard W. Campbell, who was a double agent who worked in propaganda during World War II. After the war, he lives anonymously until rival factions want to dig out his past. As in many of the works of Vonnegut, this is a reflection on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own purposes. Nolte is fantastic - sure of himself and sure as a younger Campbell, and then broken and persecuted as an elderly person who is forced to atone for the sins of his past. (7 out of 10)
