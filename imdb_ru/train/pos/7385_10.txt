For everyone who thinks: 1. It was a boring TV show. 2. Halle Berry and Denzel Washington do not deserve their Oscars. <br /> <br /> CLOSE F ** k UP !! It was one of the best Academy Awards shows, because 1. It was a moment in history when black yes “Black Actress” won the Academy Award for Best Actress, so many of our black sisters were ignored by the Academy for many years. To be honest, I stopped watching Academy Awards because of the lack of diversity, neither winners nor nominees. For me, it was nothing more than a group of white people patting each other on the back. The academy had many chances to vote for black actresses. which were brilliant in films, for example, Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary Jean Babtis, but this did not happen. 2. Halle Berry deserved that there was no competition at the Oscar, the academy was forced to vote for it, while worthy actresses were ignored by the Academy, most of which are white voters, yes, yes, Nicole Kidman sang very cute in Muling Rouge! But it was a time when black people took part in these awards. As for Mr. Washington, the academy was indebted to him after this unjust loss for MalcomX. For all of you who think that the race is not a problem, “probably white people” in the film industry, it’s good that many of the most talented black actresses around were either turned into stereos, typical of white people’s roles that they think these are black women or not the existence of "Angela Basset". I do not expect many white people to understand any of this, because they have never had to deal with any of this. Think about it, they put it.
