In the Suburbs, everything is idyllic when a small family enters, as my father got there a new job in a computer company. But no heaven would be complete without a snake. Strange things happen when a family enters a local country club without a husband, since she certainly keeps secrets. The father is not a carpenter, but pressure is put on him, since everyone who is near and at work are his members. Robert Urich's good guys are a little cool, but Joanna Cassidy, like a good-natured housewife, turns unpleasant thorns. Suspended and well-made chiller with a bitch Susan Lucci as club chairman. Look for cult favorite Michael Berryman in the role of servants. The film reflects the feeling of paranoia, and the final special effects worth the wait. I have seen this movie quite a few times.
