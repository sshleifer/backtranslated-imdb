Pressburger and Powell's greatest film. David Niven plays the RAF bomber pilot, who misses his own death, but gets a second chance in life when the skies notice that he is proud, and sends an angel to investigate. The scene where young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all killed in battle, go to heaven to gain eternal life, is unbearably painful. Beware also of Roger Livesey, the highly underrated actor, and Kim Hunter as a love interest (later, of course, Zira in Planet of the Apes). By the way, Steven Spielberg played the actress who played the main angel (Kathleen Byron), in the role of the elderly wife of the same name soldier in Rescue of Private Ryan half a century later, which speaks of his cinematic literacy.
