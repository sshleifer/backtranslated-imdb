A young woman (Gene Simmons) is convinced by her intriguing and dangerous aunt (Sonya Dresdell) and uncle (Barry Jones) that she is going crazy and in a very delicate state that requires their control, which turns out to be more like manipulation, as they try keep her as far away from human contact as possible. The only other person she sees is the manor of the manor, the lustful character played by Maxwell Reed, who has been deceived by a middle-aged aunt. All this, an aunt and caretaker, an uncle expert on butterflies with a serious reverse side and an imposing niece in the middle, would have made the film more dark and ominous. In fact, the murder frauds send Trevor Howard (a dismissed state secret service agent who took a job of cataloging butterflies) and Simmons across the countryside, avoiding the police, catching the headlines "The police is closing" above her photo on the front page, jumping into buses, and enters Liverpool, where they meet some wonderful characters and finally face greedy and murderous aunt and uncle
