This film does not cease to attract attention and move, even in 2008, an audience familiar only with modern overproduced sounds and computer technologies. <br /> <br /> The experience of the 1922 movie goer who could only see this in a movie with other people on their big screen must have been a really deep and completely satisfying experience. <br /> <br /> You can ask if the filmmaker today can make a two-hour silent film, make it interesting and achieve the same pace of structure and balance as this movie. Creating a quiet film was pure art, it had to keep attention through its structure, direction and action — there was no addition with more words or computer distractions. A poorly filmed or uninteresting silent film cannot be traced. <br /> <br /> This film should be used in context for those who may be confused by the mention of Christian themes. This is not a film about Christiane, he does not sell anything. These topics, along with references to current moral standards, often appear in this era — also visiting the church on Sundays was a national past, Christianity was given in most households, so the film shows only normal life as it was then. Themes would ring true and deep at the time. <br /> <br /> This is very strange, given the strong support of good Christian thinking about this particular film (and it does not preach religion to anyone, only emphasizing the difference between hypocrites and honest ones) that in 1922 the pastor was in open discussion with a film industry representative. with a large crowd condemned Pickford as an example of immorality along with some other persons whom he called. NY Times 1922. <br /> <br /> Perhaps they should have watched this film, which also came out in 1922, and learned some lessons. <br /> <br /> The pastor complained that since church began in the film industry, attendance has fallen by 500,000 people. The representative of the film in the debate, however, made the following observations; the attendance of salons also declined, that there were far more pastors in the prison than actors (fact), and that the choice of several examples from among the multitude was not representative. <br /> <br /> In this way, the battle between the church and the film industry continued in the first days of the cinema. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful film about how to be honest and loyal to family friends and be ready to make sacrifices. Mary Pickford, naive, honest, furious, full of happiness and joy, loyal, humorous and silent victim - although poor and uneducated, she represented the ideal character. This, however, does not put pressure on our throats, but unfolds gradually in the film. <br /> <br /> This is reminiscent of some modern Chinese films where the characters slowly, sluggishly unfold during the film, and this is the pace that creates a stronger connection with the character. <br /> <br /> It has an even tempo for the first half, which contains all the elements for the last section. The last 30 minutes is a great film making, and you need to understand that this was achieved without the use of sound, dynamic dialogue - this was achieved thanks to a clever game and great direction. It is sometimes surprising to realize that at the end of the film you have not heard a single spoken word, but it seems that you have all heard. <br /> <br /> The cast played a great role, especially Gloria Hope, Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes of Pickford’s typical understated humor when she goes out on the pretext of sweeping snow, almost perfect balance and finish. This is a special type of touching humor that should not be underestimated. Chaplin often used this device and copied some of them from Pickford. <br /> <br /> Another special note that should be made about silent films, and especially about Pickford’s films, is that the star often has to keep the camera for most of the movie without the audience becoming exhausted or bored, with over-exposure of the actors. The fact that Pickford is usually the focus of most of her films, but people still can't get enough of her, is testimony to her excellent acting ability.
