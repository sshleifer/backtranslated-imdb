I was surprised at how a film can be both gentle and excellent. Frisbee's flying saucer was incomprehensible, especially when landing, but the special effects when Krell attacked were amazing for a film that was made over half a century ago! Living in the Middle East, I saw how the shades of Islam crept in when JJ Adams offered Alta to dress more modestly, and as an engineer was amazed by the imagination used for “futuristic” gadgets and the things created by the props department. In general, an interesting hour and a half, when I first saw Walter Pijon and the chance to see Leslie Nielsen as a young man
