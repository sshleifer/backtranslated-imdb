Season by season, the players or characters in this series seem like people you would really like to hate. Was this show falsified, or were they chosen for the same? Each episode offends only one person, and as a result he is killed. You like to see how they screwed up, although this is completely wrong and bad. You like to see them fooling others, fooling themselves, playing in the mud, bringing him back, running away, and finally driving Trump away. The number of tears also increases with the season. <br /> <br /> Awards that try to compensate for past humiliation and suffering are also greatly reduced. In newer seasons, it's like "You will meet xyx, who will give you lectures on uvw" .. as who worries? The characters are so hateful, collectively and individually, that you wonder if they are paid actors? The only sensible person can win. <br /> <br /> Watch with caution and keep your conscience. These are your brethren in the firing line.
