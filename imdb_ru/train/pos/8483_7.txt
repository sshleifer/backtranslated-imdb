It is difficult to appreciate this or any other comparable film of an era of early sound in terms that could be used for ordinary film commentaries. At times there is almost despair, as many filmmakers of the era of silence try their wings in sound, probably fearing that they will be left on the sidelines (as it happened with some), Rin-Tin-Tin. however, it was completely natural. In such a vaudeville, unrelated sequences, some will surely single out John Barrymore's monologue from Richard II, which is certainly worth keeping. By and large, only those who were trained at an earlier stage inspired confidence. Nevertheless, it is generally quite interesting, and necessary for "movie lovers", especially those interested in the transition from sound to sound.
