The part where Meg visits the mechanic and says: “Does the piston shoot short?” (Implying bad sexual energy from her bride) was fun. I love Meg Ryan, and she is beautiful in this wonderful film. Very cute and very smart too. Her innocent expressions of indignation make you want her to be yours. The hero copes well with the transformation of a garage mechanic into a physicist. Did Einstein have a romantic side to his mind? The puzzle around the press and the audience was well done. This is terribly underestimated and deserves the praise and attempts of rebirth. He loses one vote for including the extremely incredible contrived theory that the US government is buying. I do not understand why he is not in the top twenty of the best romantic comedies of the century. Great movie with a presidential seal of approval!
