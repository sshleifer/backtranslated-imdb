I'm curious about what kind of rifle Beckett used in the film, as well as the caliber of the bullet he was supposed to shoot. If it is loosely based on the sniper shooting of Carlos Hetcock, I guess it is 7 mm. round. I am also curious about the rifle itself. He also made a comment in Sniper's final film about a rifle, which a Vietnamese man allowed him to use, which belonged to his father. Beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. I would like to know which rifle it is too. I know that this particular rifle was made during World War II or in advance. I just could not look close enough at him while watching the film to identify him. <br /> <br /> Regarding Mr. Hatcoxâ€™s murders, his longest shot was 1.47 miles, and he had 93 confirmed murders and 14 unconfirmed kills. After his wounds had somewhat healed from burning in Vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching the USMC snipers the skills they would need in the field. His sniper career is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters who train at the USMC. I learned his name from my friend, a former marine. Any information would be great.
