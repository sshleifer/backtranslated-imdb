George and Kim ride with their little son Miles to a remote cabin in upstate New York when their car crashes into a deer and crashes into a ditch. But what seems like a simple misfortune marks the beginning of a terrible journey, where myth becomes reality, and the spirit that eats the flesh, half the animal and half the man of Wendigo, pursues a small town ... "Wendigo" Larry Fessenden is a suggestive horror film which often turns into a grim family drama. characters are well developed and there are some amazing moments. Wendigo's subtle glimpses are handled efficiently, and it is never clear what is real and what is imagined, or even if the story takes place completely in Miles's head. “Wendigo” is my first contact with the work of Larry Fessenden, and, of course, he will not be the last. Give this film a chance, if you don't mind watching something unusual. 8 out of 10.
