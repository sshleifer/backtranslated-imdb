If an Australian post office ever needed a promotional film for a set, then this is it. This is one of those films whose heart is in the right place, and you can watch it again and again. Mirandaâ€™s address is touching, as it shows the aspect of Australia, unimaginable by many Europeans, that it can be cold, wet and dull, like everywhere else, and the same as everywhere else, and what's important is the people around you. The characters in the film are warm and hospitable and make you think about a career move to the "office of letters." Miranda continued to make great films, but I hope she always thinks about it?
