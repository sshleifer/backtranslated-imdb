I am Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the American TV shows were shown here (the original language with subtitles), and Batman was one of the first people I got interested in. Unfortunately, here it caused a "panic hysteria" among mothers, because Batman was considered too cruel. God, compare the innocence of this series with the shit the kids see today. So because of my overprotective moms from the 60s, I had a chance to see maybe two or three episodes! I was so upset that I started collecting comics and chewing gum cards (still got them!) To compensate for this. I even got the View Master slides ... I had a desire to see the Crusader in the hood. All children need some kind of hero. <br /> <br /> After years, I finally had the opportunity to see replays as a teenager, and I really enjoyed it. Obscene acting would have slipped away from me when I would have seen it in childhood, but I understood it at the age of 17. Yes, I watched them all now and a random good soul in the Internet posts episodes, because they did not release the series on DVD (as far as I know) <br /> <br /> I enjoyed "Return to the cave of bats" that evening. .. it was amazing to watch because it was full of trifles and internal jokes. Seeing Adam and Bert was amazing, and this TV film is fantastic in all aspects. They play the same way they played their roles in the series. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the people who gave this great nostalgic feast ... I will watch it again. My advice to all Batman fans: SEE IT !!! Rent it !!! Lend to a friend !!! Buy it !!! I would never have expected that I would rate it as 9/10 ... Very well done!
