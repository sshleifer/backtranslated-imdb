I was hoping that it would be good for James Bond fan Timothy Dalton, and although it was not his well-deserved “third exit,” it was a laugh. Belushi brought a bit of good humor to his role, and Dalton coped well with it, but was probably underestimated. his role was similar to the frozen version of Jack Nicholson in a few good people. the other Brit was a bit shocking, but overall it was a laugh.
