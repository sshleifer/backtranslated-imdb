Saw it at the Hawaii Film Festival, where the director and his wife (who produced him) subsequently took questions and answers. <br /> <br /> It was hard for me to believe that this was the first time the director and all thanks were given to Harvey Keitel for again risking and going to the end point for the sake of the script that he liked. <br /> <br /> Of course, reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso, he tells the story of a young director about the turn of the revolution in Cuba. However, do not expect it to be a film about the revolution, its political position is surprisingly ambiguous. Many directors mention the obvious love of cinema history (great respect for "Bicycle Thief") and some fancy scenes that work without pretentiousness. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
