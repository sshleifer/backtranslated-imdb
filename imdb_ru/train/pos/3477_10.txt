Some people think that Scooby was destroyed in the second series .. I totally disagree. The quality of the show did not rise and did not fall and broke, win my opinion, as a very good player. I looked at the survey on jumpedtheshark.com and 72% of people said that the second series of Scrappys is a Scoobys crash. Good, but many said yes, but 28% still cannot be wrong. I like the way most episodes focus on comedy. I believe that if it were the same 5 people / dog, solving the mystery in the same formula. Skrappi was a breath of fresh air for the show. Of course, some people turned off, but when they presented Scrapi, they looked at the DOUBLED figures. Back to the show. All episodes and segments were very funny. .i was intrigued by the yabba and shorts. But at the end of the day it’s a matter of opinion, if you like a quilt or not, it’s a matter of opinion, of course, not a fact. But in my opinion, it was an excellent series. This gave the tire service a new formula and a lifelong life.
