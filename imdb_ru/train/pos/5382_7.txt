After watching the Next Action Star reality show, I was pleased to see the film winners right away. I was wary of such a showcase of new talent, but I was pleasantly surprised and excited. Billy Zane, of course, was an ordinary man, but Corin and Sean stayed close to him. It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne (also from the competition) in their cameos. Hero Sean, not Billy, is hunted, and his frustration at the discovery of new rules in the game is well played. Corinne is good at running a tightrope between her character, who loves Sean, and stays there just for the money. I liked how the game was played until the last second. And then on! Not a very good movie, but interesting, and a great showcase for two who first come out of the gate.
