Full House is a great show. I'm still growing up on this today. I started watching it when I was 8 years old, and now I'm 12 and still watching it. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. she is my favorite she had such a sense of humor. if there are people on this show who hardly watch the show, you should do it because it will hook you. I got into it after the first show I saw, and it was the first episode in 2002. This is a really good show. I really think that this show should go through many generations in families. and this is also great because it is a suitable show for all ages. and for all parents, it teaches children lessons on how to continue their lives. nothing terrible happens like violence or swearing. it's just a great sitcom. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. what do you think? OH, and the best time to watch it is when you get sick at home from school or even the old office. It makes you feel so much better. Believe me, I barely get sick at home, but I still know that it will make you feel better. and to everyone who thinks the show is stupid, well, this is too bad for you, because you will not reach such a high level in life, even if you are happy with your life. You really have to watch this, and you hook it. I'm just telling you what happened to me and to everyone who started watching this amazing show. Well, I need to go have lunch. Remember that you should start watching a full house and soon!
