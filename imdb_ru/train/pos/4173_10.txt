A kind of road film in old-fashioned trains at the end of summer in the Slovenians. At the beginning you see someone in underwear sewing black fabric pants, and when the same young man in black pants leaves the house with two suitcases, you see that some of his pants are missing from the mourning flag (apparently his father died) . In the train, he meets a young lady, and almost without words, but with many small gestures begins a wonderful love story. This is somehow surreal, very poetic and a bit strange film, with many strange characters and strange incidents. Beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details.
