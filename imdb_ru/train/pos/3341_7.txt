I saw this movie on Thursdays after a very boring day. I had no expectations, the ones I had were rather negative. The only film I've ever watched Jimmy is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifa (?) ... don't ask why! But seriously ... this movie is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always nice, but I almost fell in love with Fallon's character. Why can't I meet such a cute nerd? :) Movies like this are great. Simple, sweet and necessary. Sunday on Thursdays. I'm not even a fan of sports, but something about American baseball films fascinates me. Perhaps the fact that we do not have this sport here in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first comment). Haha
