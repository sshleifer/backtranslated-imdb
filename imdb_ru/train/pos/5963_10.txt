This film is terrible, but you have to see it because of it. I'm not here to discuss the whole movie, just the best chase scene. When Eddie drinks milk from Tim, he is chased down the corridor. Eddie puts obstacles in the way of jokers with happy consequences (for example, a plate with nails on a trumpet; buy a DVD and watch slowly). The best obstacle is a tipped mop bucket over which one athlete jumps but continues to slide on the ground through the door. But when he slips, he picks up speed, ignoring physics (mainly friction); but what lies behind the door is supreme. The coolest staircase in any school in the entire history that this jockey clears up in the air. In fact, he is likely to die from a broken neck. Not only does he challenge all perceptions of reality, he makes the most ridiculous noise ever created in this situation. Go and buy it. Believe me, this scene is worth your 6 bucks.
