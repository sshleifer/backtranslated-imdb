I saw it many years after the television series, and initially I didn’t care. Then, when my memories of the show receded over time, I looked again and found it to be absolutely fun. Judging by the play of Neil Simon, she was not “open” to the big screen, and this is one of her strengths. Walter Mattau and Jack Lemmon are great in the role of Oscar and Felix, and the cast is great, especially John Fielder in the role of Winnie. Even now, some moments can turn me into tears of laughter - Felix interrupts Oscar during a ball game asking for dinner, Oscar smashes and chases Felix all over the apartment, giggling "Dove Sisters" are discouraged by Felix's sobbing stories and, of course, the legendary the scene in the cafeteria (later ripped off by Nora Efron "When Harry Met Sally"). The dialogue is razor sharp. When the boys think that Felix has taken an overdose, Oscar says: “It could be vitamins! He may be the healthiest in the room! " Fantasy!
