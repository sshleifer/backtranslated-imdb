This film is an exact copy of the television series on the Indian TV channel Doordarshan, which was shown at least 15 years ago. The series was known as "gubbarre", which means balloons. Each episode was a new story. The story is gorgeous, and the original is much sweeter and more convincing. Abhay Doel does an excellent job, but he is not suitable for the role of "normal" and "third class" (as he calls himself in the film). In fact, Shayan Munshi with a short haircut and without designer clothes would be in line with the role of Abhays, but Shayan simply lacks the talent to cope with this. <br /> <br /> I would advise to watch the show if it is available. This is the same story, except for running with the mother of friends and the initial acquaintance. The acting of the television actors was much better than those of these “stars”. <br /> <br /> The only reason this film is a failure is because the director tried to stretch half an hour (or 45 minutes) of the plot to 2+. h. So this must become gritty. Even songs with a sense of nasal singing could not make up. <br /> <br /> These films are good for a lazy Sunday and really refresh if you haven't watched the original series. The script and the end of the series were much better <br /> <br /> ##### Spoilers ahead ## SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ############ Spoilers Ahead ########## The ending of the original series was much stronger, since the hero himself throws the girl, even thinking that she is ready to marry him. He knows and tells her that he does not want to be repaid, and he never helped with this intention. The director or script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film. The initial final would cause tears in the eyes of the girls and make the guys nod in agreement. Delivery was not correct. <br /> <br /> But personally, I feel that this is a pathetic copy. We should not pay tribute to the director / screenwriter. This story is amazing and was written by one of the famous novel authors in the PRemchand munshi class. I'm not sure that this is the story of Premchand Munshi, but in many other short stories in this series there are several stories by Premchand Munshi and other great Hindi writers.
