In April 1965, CBS broadcast the first monumental television events of Barbra Streisand. The show was not only rampant, but also received 5 Emmy awards. This is one of the most memorable moments of 1960s television and (unfortunately) such a special television they no longer produce. Filled with beautiful songs and an impressive performance by Barbra, this special offer is a must-see for any Streisand fan or anyone interested in early television.
