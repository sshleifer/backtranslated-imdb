Maybe Presque Rien is not the best movie ever made ... But it's better than many of you have said. I still have not seen a homo movie better than this one. <br /> <br /> You Americans are used to watching very narrative films with a clear start, development and results. But European films are less narrative, but they make you think and feel a lot. <br /> <br /> Many of you did not understand the meaning of the film. The goal of this film is not to show us a simple “summer” Loving film, with commercial characters who “fall in love and live happy forever.” Summer holidays and the beach are just the background, and this film is addressed to every young boy who can feel identified with these boys. <br /> <br /> Some of you may have misunderstood this film because of its 3 parts, shown as memories. These 3 points are: - Summer in Pornichet, when they meet and love. - After one and a half years of living together in Nantes Mathieu does not attend psi hiatry. He tries to commit suicide by taking something, and Cedric takes him to the hospital. Later, he seems to be talking to a psychiatrist to find out the reason he did it. - The last part, when Mathieu returns to Pornish in the winter, one ... to think about how his life changed, how his life became, and try to find himself. It is possible that some people could not understand all this well, because all the scenes are mixed between them. But in any case, as I said ... this is not a funny movie. If what someone wants to see is meat, for this we have films with whites. <br /> <br /> Presque Rien, who wants to show us - how cruel a life can be for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure what to do in life. Mathieu only wants to leave home and try to live such a life that he thought could bring him happiness ... But what seemed perfect in the beginning ... later was not as good as he thought, and he became anxious and I feel that he is lost. He is lost and does not know what he really wants to do or what makes him happy. He finally gets depressed and tries to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So what's funny? This is not a funny movie. Very hot scenes? only a few .. but this is not a movie for fun. It's all about feelings ... friendship, love, happiness, unhappiness, pain, depression, loneliness ... I, like many others, feel identified with Mathieu’s life and problems, and this is what the director wanted to do ... the film that shows us the cruel reality of the boy's life. <br /> <br /> For me, this is the best homo movie.
