Samuel Fuller brings his familiar playful and stylish direction to this squalid, puffy story and managed to create one of the undiscovered cinema gems of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark plays a tough guy from the petty thief (the role over which he has improved the course of many films), who snatches the purse of a young lady (Gene Peters) in the New York subway and with him a piece of so desired microfilm . This is 1953, therefore, of course, the microfilm is the property of Commi spies, who will stop at nothing to return it. When a girl appears in the Widmark shack on the quay, sent by an offensive guy to return the film, Widmark feels able to shake her and her "comrades" for a lot of money. The plot thickens, people begin to die, and Widmark and Peters fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Fuller clumsily draws on a love story, but more out of a feeling of indifference than because of bad writing or directing. As if he included a love story under duress, and therefore made it intentionally unbelievable, like the love stories that so often were and remain in Hollywood films. Peters demonstrates remarkable performance as a hard New Yawk cookie, partly gangster mall and partly maid in distress. When violence occurs against her, we sincerely care about her well-being, and this is typical of the traitor Fuller, who is ahead of his style, that a happy ending is not necessarily predetermined. <br /> <br /> But the ultimate success of Pickup on South Street depends entirely on the weary shoulders of Thelma Ritter, who plays Moe, a furious lady who makes money as much as she can, whether selling ties or working as police informer. Ritter gives an idea of ​​his career; in a breathtaking monologue, she conveys, even without addressing directly to him, the entire sad trajectory of her character’s life and the hopelessness that she feels waking up every morning in the world of struggle, crime and hardship. It’s as if every character Ritter ever played converges for one short moment to unleash all the emotions that they haven’t been given in other films. The scene is the highlight of the Fuller movie and the highlight of the 50s cinema, period. <br /> <br /> Rating: A +
