After reading a few very negative views on this film, I was not sure whether I should fork out for its rent. However, it was a pleasant surprise. I have not seen the original film, but if it were better than this, I would be in heaven. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise demonstrates the strong role of the seemingly unstable David, convincing me that he has more smile on his feet (only the third time in his career; other examples were Magnolia and Born Fourth of July). Penelope Cruz is a bit lightweight, but meets the requirements of her role, as does Diaz. The only disappointment is the slightly limp Kurt Russell. In the film, however, not acting is really impressive - this is filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Cameron Crowe succeeds as a director, giving himself the long-awaited change of pace from his usual eccentric. The growing madness of the film is beautifully performed by Crow (the short sequence in which Cruise passes through the empty Square of Time is incredibly effective) The soundtrack (a distinctive feature of the Crow movie) is also sublime. <br /> <br /> You will be shocked and experienced as a spectator. The plot seems a bit contrived, but the problems behind it are endlessly discussed. The film is not perfect, but its long-awaited change of pace for Cruise and Crowe and for those raised on the Hollywood diet should be a revelation.
