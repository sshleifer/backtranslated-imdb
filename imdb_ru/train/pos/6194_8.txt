Henry the Fool surprised me. I did not expect it to entertain and entertain as much as it did. Fay Grim continues to be surprised by the fact that he gives a firm continuation of the story, which does not seem to be needed. However, as soon as the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the film, he is dazzlingly aware that this is one of the BEST sequels of the brilliant indie film. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not better. <br /> <br /> I’m a little disappointed that Jeff Goldblum’s role is so small, but I’m glad that he’s part of this short journey. He is persuasive and adorable as agent Fulbright. Also admire Liam Aiken, who very well portrays Ned Grim, son of Fay and Henry. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun for many reasons. I am pleased, for example, to find out that Henry is not really a loser, whom he seems to be (towards the end of the Fool), and even more to find out that he is, in fact, a genius ... well, this is really a fine stroke of the pen. <br /> <br /> I hope they do the third ... as the end of the trilogy. It seems absent. They should give him the right to Ned Full Grim, and this should be Liam, looking for his father to confirm the amazing changes in his mother and the feeling of almost genius that he feels in himself. Assuming, of course, that Fay continues to hide many of the most important facts from her son concerning his father. It feels like it needs to be done. I would buy it. <br /> <br /> Even with a lot of action, it is still not an action. This is more drama and intrigue ... a mystery of a kind. I will watch it often. <br /> <br /> He estimates 8.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
