The fall of the nuclear power plant causes most people to turn into deadly, rotting, sinister zombies, who naturally fall into a terrible frenzy. A handful of disparate uninfected people are doing everything possible to survive this grueling test. Director / co-author / producer Todd Sheets demonstrates amazingly sincere love and passion for a lively and disgusting horror game: he maintains a steady, fast paced pace everywhere, fills the screen with a crazy wall of action, and, fortunately, keeps a terrible dialogue at a pleasant minimum. Moreover, Sheets, of course, does not stint on the magnificent graphics and excessive unnecessary splashes: this picture delivers a delicious truck with melting flesh, gutting, lots of sips in the intestines, one guy broke his heart, and even a good piercing on a tree branch. Sheets earn bonus points for keeping a dark and nasty tone to their literal bitter end (for example, almost all the main characters end up becoming a zombie chow-chow). Of course, this film has its drawbacks: sloppy editing, several unsuccessful attempts at pathos, and a largely terrible play of actors with a nameless cast leave much to be desired. The highest awards go to the cute and funny Casey Rausch for her triumphantly bulging image of the resourceful Daria Trumillio. Frank Danlay also does a good job as a veteran of the army, Ralph Walsh. Best of all, Sheets confidently understands the contagiously senseless feeling of an implacable rushing impulse and an obvious proximity to the horror genre, which ensures that from beginning to end this will be a complete blast.
