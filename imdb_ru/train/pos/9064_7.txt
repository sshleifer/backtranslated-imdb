I sat with my children when we watched this movie. It seemed to all of us that this is a very interesting film. <br /> <br /> When Billy goes to a new school, a bully in the fifth grade starts doing something with him, and this is what leads to eating worms. <br /> <br /> The bet is made, and Billy has so much time to eat 10 worms or something else. Since then, the bully and his friends are trying to come up with nasty ways to cook, roast or bake worms, trying to infect Billy to lose the bet. <br /> <br /> Billy remains strong and eats his way became more and more beloved by all, even his hooligan friends. <br /> <br /> I won’t tell you whether he wins at the rate or not ... you just need to look to find out, but I’ll think that if you like good family movies, you will like this one. <br /> <br /> PS Let me add that this film is not only for boys, I have all my daughters, and they really liked it.
