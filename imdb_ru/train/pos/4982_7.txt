I love these films Baby Diapers! You could not make such a film today, and it is rich in cinematic history. This is stupid, and the film was made to make you laugh, which is what it does. How they forced these children to "act", I will never know. I think they are precious, and the children make me laugh, as well as the others who made this film, because it shows the naivety that existed in the early 30s. You have to remember that this was when the film industry was very young, the stock market collapsed, the global depression began, and these films were created to give a person a break from the real world. The fact that you could watch movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but also dinner for 25 cents too. It was a different time with a completely different mindset.
