This adaptation of the story MR. James "A View from the Hill" was first shown on British television in 2005 on a small BBC 4 digital channel that I watched. I saw it being repeated on BBC 4 again, and decided to give it a go, recalling the successful adaptation of BBC B 1970 s to other stories mr. James, including "Whistle and I will come to you, my boyfriend" and "Signalman." “The view from the hill,” although it does not belong to the same class as these masterpieces, is nevertheless a pleasant and sometimes tense drama. <br /> <br /> A historian comes to a small rural village to see a collection of a recently deceased collector of ancient artifacts. While in the countryside, he sees the abbey, which has been in ruins for hundreds of years. But what does this have to do with an old pair of binoculars and the terrible legend of the ominously named Hangman? And what do the brave village squire and his servant know about the situation? Although it was not scary, I enjoyed this small performance, and if the duration was more than 40 minutes, it could be a really great adaptation. Anyway, it all looks a bit hasty, and it would be advisable to set the mood a little more to create a mood. <br /> <br /> I give it 7 out of 10.
