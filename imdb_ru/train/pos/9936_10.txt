It was one of my favorite TV shows when I was a kid. The Swedish TV and Radio Company decided to broadcast it again a couple of years ago, when I had just finished my first semester of medical school. I was surprised to see the depth in which the organs were explained. Of course, some things are simplified, but most of them were correct (although it was made 22 years ago!) And quite understandable. I would advise all future medical students to watch it. This is a very good way to learn some basic medical words, for example. Now I have the seventh semester, and I think I'll watch the series again, as soon as I buy the DVD box :-)
