The film, which I am going to review, is a small television film, filmed in 1996, in which Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin were filmed. <br /> <br /> The protagonist / antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical all-American teenager who is under pressure from having such a controlling father (Baldwin). However, when she meets a former con artist named Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan “Never Kissed”), they instantly “fall in love” with each other, but Jennifer has a different idea of ​​where to take her relationship. she manipulated them to kill her parents in order to protect their “love”, but she just used it to get rid of her parents so that she could be with Brad (Sabrina's future assistant in David Lasher’s film for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator, and she does an excellent job with the film, using her friends and Nick, so that she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the auxiliary actors work well, and each of them holds his own when they have screen time. I also found it interesting that this film was shot and released the same year, Hart began to portray Sabrina, "Teenage Witch", and this is a show that she can play in my film and television genres. <br /> <br /> Although the film is somewhat dated, it still stands out as one of her best works, which includes drama or thriller, and I look forward to the release of Nine Dead, which will be released in November, because that it shows that it can be seen as other people who are not called "Clarissa Darling" or Sabrina Spellman "<br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina. You can watch it online, so I suggest checking it out.
