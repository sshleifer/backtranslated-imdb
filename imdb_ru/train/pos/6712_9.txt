I love Sabrina! This is one of my favorite shows !! My favorite episodes; the one where she turns Libby into a geek, the first episode, the episode of true love and most of the rest of the first series. I really think college episodes were not as good as in high school, but they were better than in the last episode, which was terrible. Valerie was a good character, as she was more rounded than Jenny, but Jenny was in some brilliant episodes. Hilda and Zelda were adorable, and there seemed to be no explanation for where they went! Libby was also a good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, they were not as good as her other friends.
