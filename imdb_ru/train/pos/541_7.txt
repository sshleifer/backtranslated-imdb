As a sequel, this is a good movie. I liked it more than the first. It seemed to me that it is more interesting. It seemed to me that he was filmed in a documentary style. At first, it bothered me, because I thought it looked too low budget. but it grew on me, and it made the film seem more authentic. this film has a drier one liner than the original, which is a good thing, in my opinion. I really think that from time to time they came out unnecessarily with some scenes and characters. he almost becomes a parody in itself, which may be the main thing. this film has at least some expectation, which the 1st did not have, in my opinion. he has some of the same great music from the original, and that's great. again the game was pretty decent, although, as I said, some of them seemed excessive. I also felt that the film was losing a lot of momentum towards the end, and there are a few minutes that seem very slow and just don’t flow like in the rest of the film. Although, in general, I thought it was a rather lengthy scenario. the rating “Return to the Lake House” is 7/10 *
