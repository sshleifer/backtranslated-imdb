As far as I know, the real guy, in which the main actor plays, saw his performance and said that this is an outstanding image, I would agree with him. This is a fantastic film about a fairly gifted boy and a man who is assisted by a special part of the body. Oscar and BAFTA win, and the Golden Globe-nominated Daniel Day-Lewis plays Christie Brown, crippled by a man, with cerebral palsy, who spends most of his life on the floor, in a wheelchair and carries his family. Although he has a special left foot, he can write with it, draw with it and keep things with her. He learns to speak later in the film, which is very good for a guy like him. Also in the lead role, “Home Alone 2” won an Oscar, and Golden Globe nominated Brenda Fricker for the role of Mrs. Brown, and BAFTA nominated Ray MacAnally for the role of Mr. Brown. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Director for Jim Sheridan, Best Writing, Scenario Based on Material from a Different Medium, and Best Picture, was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Film, Best Makeup Artist and The best adapted script. Daniel Day-Lewis was 85th in "100 Greatest Movie Stars," he was 20th in "50 Greatest British Actors," he was 9th in "Best British Actors," and he was 15th in "Greatest Actor of the world, ”and the film was No. 28 for 50 of the greatest British films. Fine!
