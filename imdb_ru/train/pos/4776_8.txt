I watched this movie at my usual time, which is very late at night. Usually, if the film does not interest me, I begin to fall asleep and have to raid the fridge in order to stay awake. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that this was what I had to do, since the pace of this film began slowly, along with the fact that its frames were usually delayed for a long time on the character. But after a while I begin to immerse myself in the film more, as it tells more about the main character through his story. In the end, you feel you have known him all your life. The film interested me so much that I didnâ€™t even know that the sun was about to rise. <br /> <br /> There are not so many strange Lynch styles, but there are enough freakish characters in it to make the movie fun.
