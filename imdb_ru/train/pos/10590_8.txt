This series was a cut above the rest of the detective television series of the time, but somehow it did not find an audience. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a blind detective may not be completely new, but she added so much to the story. And who could forget Paks, the beautiful guide dog on the show! <br /> <br /> Although the stories themselves could be no better than the average series, the settings in New Orleans, acting and music (I pay attention to the comment on the musical score in other comments ... I remember that clearly) working to make a good TV series even better! <br /> <br /> Well, you never know ... once Paramount can just dig into its archives and release it on DVD!
