The short film that starts this film is a real footage of a guy named Gary, apparently, he was shot randomly in the parking lot of a television station where Gary works in the city of Beaver. Gary is a bit "different"; he is an imitator and drives an old Chevrolet named Farrah (named Fawcett). And now, after some time, the director receives a letter from Gary, in which he is invited to return to Beaver to get footage of the local talent contest that he has collected, including Gary’s stunning performance as Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh my. The next two shorts are the story of Gary, the one you just saw, only the first is depicted by Sean Penn, and the second by Crispin Glover called "Orkley Baby." If you're in the mood for a laugh at someone, this movie is definitely worth watching. Most of this I doubled with laughter, especially with Crispins' performance, which could definitely stand on its own. When it was over, I had to rewind the film to look again at the present Gary and all his radiant idiocy. Although Olivia was the center of attention, I would like one of the “fictional” shorts to hit Gary in imitation of Barry Manilow, which was just as ridiculous.
