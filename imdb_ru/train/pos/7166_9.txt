Holes, romance, were imposed on me in an educational course. I did not think I would like a children's romance; In addition, the two other books I was forced to read for the class were really bad. But, to my surprise, I really loved Holes. This is truly one of the most beautifully written novels I have ever read. I think this is a rare quality that makes it attractive to teens, teens and adults. I think that everyone who reads it will leave it better. Although I cannot say that for the film, I am happy to say that they understood it basically correctly. I do not think that the film’s audience will leave as enriched, but they will certainly be entertained, without the side effect of stupidity when they sit down. This is a smart story, and it is very well told. I think he moves too fast. The novel takes more time to develop characters. And the memories come and go so quickly that they don't have much time to register. The interracial romance in the past feels more cliché and banal than in the romance. And the ending that binds all the loose threads seems very funny. In the novel, everything is exactly the same, but in the film there is a sense of absurdity, which does not exist. It works much better. I also don't like a lot of pop songs. I wish Disney didn't feel the need to sell soundtracks. The cast is great, from the little guys to the old professionals. John Voight is especially good. Although I'm not quite sure why we need Catwoman and Fonza. 9/10.
