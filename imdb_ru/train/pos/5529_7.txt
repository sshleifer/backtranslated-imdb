I first saw this film in a theater in France a year ago. It came and went with a little pomp, but I enjoyed it for the beauty of landscape photography and breathtaking wildlife photography. (Despite the fact that this story is good, it is really random. If you really thought about it, what happens will not happen in real life.) I just saw it tonight here in the States on DVD. Again, I understand that this has a very limited distribution. The blockbusters had only one copy of it, and I donâ€™t remember her ever playing at art houses in Cleveland. <br /> <br /> On my TV, the picture is not as exciting, though very beautiful, the wildlife video still mesmerizing. The story of the relationship between a 10-year-old child and a fox is even less convincing the second time when you know where it is going. <br /> <br /> However, as I have already said, the story is random. This is a beautiful movie to watch, and if you like shooting from the wild, you should find it exciting.
