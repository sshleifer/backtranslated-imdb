This is one of the few Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian cartoons - and a space dog named K-9 is also included. This episode of "Looney Tunes" is very funny, with a pretty good animation of the cartoon (Marvin's animation is very well done), and the plot is well done. The end is pretty weird, so be prepared for this, it's a bit boring. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Marvin the Martian was sent to Earth to capture an earthly being and return it to Mars. With his faithful dog K-9, Marvin sets off and soon finds traces of a rabbit other than Bugs Bunny! He meets them with treats, thinking that they are in tricks or treats in their costumes. Little does he understand that they are preparing to take this bunny to Mars ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this episode to anyone who likes Bugs Bunny, Marvin the Martian and Looney Tunes in general. As for the beginning and the middle of the episode, you will probably like it. Enjoy "Hasty Hare"! :-)
