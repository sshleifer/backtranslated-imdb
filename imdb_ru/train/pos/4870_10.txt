The film celebrates life. <br /> <br /> The world is preparing for innocent and pure souls, and everything has a “happy ending”, as in the final scene of the film. <br /> <br /> The film has a wonderful soundtrack, a mix of Serbian neo-folk, gypsy music and jazz. <br /> <br /> This film is very refreshing visual poetics. <br /> <br /> Watching you is like you. ” We were drawn into another colorful, romantic, and sometimes rough world. <br /> <br /> As it should be in Mr. Kusturica’s movie.
