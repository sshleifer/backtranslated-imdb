I was not at all a fan of watching this film, but when my friend called me and said that she had a free advanced pass, I went with you just to see eva longoria and laugh at the antics of Jason Biggs. <br /> Overall, it was actually better than I expected, but not by much. it was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days, and how to go to heaven. I think a typical romantic comedy with its moments. The film was rather short (about 85 minutes), but it was enough to tell the whole story, build character development and have a decent happy ending. The whole idea of ​​a ghost stalking her ex-husband was an interesting plot. Eva did a good job of maintaining sarcasm and Paul Redd, and the rest of the auxiliary staff (especially Jason Biggs) kept the laughter at a smooth pace. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked the film only because I had a lot of laughter to support me, otherwise I would give this film a lower rating. hey, it's a flick of a tiptoe, and i'm viewing this movie from a guy’s point of view, it would be more honest if women watched this movie and shared their thoughts with it.
