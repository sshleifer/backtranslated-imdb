There are 21 comments, as I add my own to this list, and there is only criticism. This is because this film is amazing entertainment in which there is a bit of everything. <br /> <br /> It may be a little scary for little children, but my 15-year-old son thought it was fantastic in all respects from action, to humor, and even to beautiful music. <br /> <br /> I buy DVDs only when I know that they will be watched regularly, and now, when they finally appear in the UK, I will certainly add it to my collection.
