A rather memorable film about the diversity of animals that kill people, especially similar to Willard, is that he is acting as an aging character (in this case, he drops a little to the level of Les Tremayne, which puts the only outstanding performance I saw, gave) in the role of a man whose life is not balanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to take revenge on those who have offended him. Yes, this is one of those films where almost everyone is despicable, so you will be sick when they die, and indeed there is a choice of actors, locations, etc. There can be no better way to create a shabby atmosphere in the film. <br /> <br /> Tremaine's character is “Snake Bender,” and he is definitely the most interesting thing in the film: an elderly snake collector obsessed with John Philip Souza's music. When a local preacher suppresses his practice of collecting small animals from local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes, and his friend marries a stripper (thus disrupting his ritual concert on Wednesday evening, the group), he goes into a rage, creating an unforgettable pile in the process clunkers under the cliff, where he dumps debris after disposing of their unfortunate owners. One fun game that you can play while watching Snakes is to bet on which cars will land farthest on the cliff. <br /> <br /> In general, it is very cheap and exploitative, but in fact there will be a lot of fun for fans of such films.
