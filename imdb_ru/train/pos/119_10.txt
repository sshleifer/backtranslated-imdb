The best way to describe Europe, which comes first on my list of favorite films, is the exclamation that came from the other person after the end of the movie: “I didn’t know that films could be made this way.” Completely original in its visual style, this is one of the best examples of what could be a movie. This is as far from master and lighting as possible; perfectly integrates multiple layers of image, sound, effects, props, dialogue, voice, performance, editing, lighting, etc. - they are all equal but not dominant. Despite the short-sighted Hollywood dialogue, cinema is not a dialogue and not beautiful lighting, action or music. This works best when all elements are in the same position where ONLY the MIXING of these elements in the order or combination in which they are presented will convey the idea. Reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element, and the film does not make sense. “Europe” is what cinema should strive for.
