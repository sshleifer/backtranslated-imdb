I was completely involved in this and could not wait for each episode. The game brought to life how emotional the missing person in a family should be, along with the effect it will have on those closest to them. The only problem that we, as a family, had to face was how quickly it was “explained” at the end. We could not clearly hear what was said, and had no idea what was the role of Gary in all this? Why did Kyle call him and why did he agree? Having invested in the series for five hours, we felt deceived, because only five minutes were left for the conclusion. I asked around, and none of my friends who watched it were wiser. Very strange, but maybe we missed something important?
