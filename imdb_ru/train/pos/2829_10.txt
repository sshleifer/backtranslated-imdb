Without a doubt, Private Lessons II is the greatest film I've ever seen. Japanese imports (poorly) translated into English, its a joy to watch. Not much of this makes sense, but it doesn't matter. This is the best comedy without intentional funny. <br /> <br /> The film is rare and unavailable on video, but I caught it a couple of times late, late in the evening on a paid cable. My copy was watched dozens and dozens of times, while I slowly, one by one, presented this gem to the world. <br /> <br /> Joanna Pakula plays Ken’s mentor / lover, our hero. (Obviously, she just worked for the check.) Kena is played by Goro Inagaki, the Japanese pop group SMAP, which is laid out a hundred and has great hair throughout the film. Stacy Edwards, known in the film “In the Company of Men”, also appears in the film and is probably happy that she later found other works in the cinema. <br /> <br /> To understand what you need, you need at least three views. The plot is there. When re-viewing you can enjoy elements such as the unusual number of vases that Ken has in his house (at least 50), or the fact that Ken wears a shirt with embroidered corn husks in the final film. <br /> <br /> The film is predictable, but highly quoted. My friends and I play the whole scene. Yes, it sounds like we are losers and losers ... but we are losers who have seen Private Lessons II. Become one of the ten people in the world who have seen this movie. You thank me for it.
