In 1943, a group of RAF officers, including Eric Williams, decided to flee the POW camp using the Gymnastic Horse to jump in the yard. In 1950, it was decided to shoot his film, and he laid the foundation for a kind of British film genre - the story of a military prison camp, which reached its apogee in Danger Inside (1959). <br /> <br /> “Wooden horse” is one of the quietest films I've ever watched. There are no great dramatic moments, but a stable storyline ultimately leads to a climax that causes more tension, because the story is not inferior to unlikely dramatic scenes, parachute jumps or perverted (something must happen!) Music. This is his time, and it works great. <br /> <br /> Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead an unusually modest selection of actors and (I suspect) non-actors. Without exception, everything is constantly monotonous and quiet. They keep emotions out of their roles. Since until recently many of them were former military personnel, I suspect that they have recreated their wartime roles as “officers and gentlemen.” <br /> <br /> This unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most wartime shoots, the story does not end on barbed wire: this fact alone keeps me glued to the end.
