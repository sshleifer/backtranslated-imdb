I had some problems with this film, and I heard a lot of criticism that it is too long and overvalued. True, it lasts more than three hours, but I was amazed that it passes so quickly. I do not think that it is overvalued at all, I think the IMDb rating is quite decent. The film looks gorgeous, with great costumes and great effects, and director James Cameron rarely comes out of focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances in the role of Jack, and Kate Winslet is as beautiful as Rose. David Warner, the great actor, steals every scene he is in. This story is very rich in details, and it pays a lot of attention to character development, which is evident from a love story, which is very touching when necessary, although in the first episode the film is a bit slow. The last hour is extremely exciting, and I confess that I was on the edge of my seat when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very touching. The musical accompaniment of James Horner was wonderful, although I was never a big fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries were good, but they suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic 8.5 / 10. Bethany Cox
