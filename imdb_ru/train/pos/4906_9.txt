I do not believe that it was an acting challenge for Richard Harris. It was a simple plot, but interesting. This is a good movie to watch when you donâ€™t want to think a lot, just want to be told a simple story. Canadian landscapes were breathtaking. Only beautiful autumn photos made a picture worthy of attention.
