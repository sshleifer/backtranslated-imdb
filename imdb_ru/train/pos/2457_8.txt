If you have a dark or depressed mood, watch this movie. It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting, and it is very encouraging, especially from the point of view of feminists and humanism. <br /> <br /> When you know both Turkish and Danish or German, go watch the movie anyway. Half of the dialog is Danish in original, synchronized with German in the translated version, the other half with subtitles in Danish or German, respectively. When I watched it in Mannheim, Germany, the reaction of the Turkish-speaking audience proved that there should be a lot of humor in the Turkish dialogue, which, unfortunately, mostly eluded me, being only imperfectly reproduced in the subtitles. Nevertheless, the film is interesting, even if you do not have enough knowledge of the Turkish language. <br /> <br /> Aesthetically, the film plays a lot on the topic of speed and slowness. At first glance, there are many bodily movements, fast as lightning, which makes the film fast, agitated. In particular, despite the fact that this is a film about Kung Fu, beware of running scenes that perfectly express a multitude of emotions. But there are quite a few very slow, emotionally intense scenes. And, above all, the characters develop much more slowly than one would expect in the drama of reaching adulthood; However, there are some movements in the characters: carefully observe the villain Omar, whose role and role I really liked. <br /> <br /> Contrast of speed and immobility perfectly contributes to the manifestation of the rage and dignity of a person. - shown at the same time, the same characters at the same time.
