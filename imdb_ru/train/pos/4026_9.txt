Pinjar is truly a masterpiece ... This is a film that makes you think and makes you think about our culture. This is without a doubt the best Hindi film I have ever seen. This film was supposed to be shown at film festivals around the world, and I believe that it would be a serious rival in Cannes. All the characters were perfectly matched, and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai pursued their roles. <br /> <br /> The story told in the film about the section is very important and should never be forgotten. > <br /> It has no preconceptions or prejudices and has given the section a human story. Here, no country is depicted as good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the music is melodic, meaningful and intrusive. Everything in the film was awesome ... and the game just grabbed me. All were well cast.
