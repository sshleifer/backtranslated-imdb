In one of her first films, Romy Schneider plays the role of the young Queen Victoria of Britain, as she suddenly comes to the throne at the age of 18, learns to control, despite the machinations of politicians, and eventually marries and marries Prince of Saxony Albert, Citchy and Campie (albeit surprisingly faithful to real events), this romantic piece is irresistible. Watching this movie about the British-speaking royal families adds a strange charm to it. On this front, the question arises why the Austrian film about the Queen of England was made; but then I recall that in 1954, Austria was still occupied by the Allied forces, including the British. Perhaps this was one of the reasons for the existence of this film.
