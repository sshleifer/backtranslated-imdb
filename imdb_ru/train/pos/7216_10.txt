No one better spoil this piece of work! Awesome movie! Written skillfully by Ira Levin and depicted with the best career performance of Christopher Reeve and one of the very best Kane, this is simply superb. I would like to catch a drama version somewhere ... maybe someday I will do it. I hope that this extremely undervalued, missed film did not become too difficult to find, because it is a “must” for any hitchhiker, Agatha Phil or a lover of a big film. One of the very few films that I could not instantly decide or predict, and it is worth a second or even a third viewing. The Death Trap earns 9/10 and earns its every iota. We need and deserve more films like this!
