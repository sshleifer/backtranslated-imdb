The emotional powers and characters of Dominic and Eugene are things that Hollywood no longer produces. This is one of the most emotional, sensitive and soulful films I've ever seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulse and fellow actress Jamie Lee Curtis perform with Oscar's outstanding achievements! There are not enough words to express how good this film is. Of course, people who do not participate in sentimental films may not care so much about Dominic and Eugene as the rest of us, but for the rest of us this film goes straight to the heart and unity of compassion and humanity. You will never forget this movie, NEVER! <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS BELOW ***** <br /> <br /> A simple but eloquent story is masterfully told. Eugene is a medical nursing home trainee who faces many hours and hard work in the hospital. His brotherly twin brother, Dominic (born 12 minutes earlier) is a bit slow and clumsy because of brain damage due to the victim of abuse by their father. (The heartbreaking moment when it shows up in a film that will leave you in tears!) Eugene (a.k.a "Geno") faces a painful dilemma. He must decide whether to finish medical school, which would mean taking his residence permit in another city and leaving Dominic (a.k.a “Nicky”) behind, or losing the rest of his education to take care of him. Niki helps pay for his brother's medical training while working as a scavenger. <br /> <br /> Questions of ethics, morals and duties are masterfully combined in this remarkable film. Just at that moment, when Gino thinks that Nicky may be moving towards independence, Dominic turns around and starts doing things like helping a drug dealer or tying to a defective cord he finds in an electric device in a landfill. <br /> <Larry, “The Character” and Nikki’s partner in his trash route, which fills the head of the gullible Dominic with all sorts of stories, such as Jenno and Jennifer (his girlfriend, who he teaches in clinical pharmacology), going to Atlantic City and playing gambling all your money. But deep down you can see that Larry is taking care of him. In their rounds, Niki is also friends with a little boy, whom we learn that he was also beaten by his father. The end result is also tragic, and the pain you see on Nicky’s face when it happens speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> The sensitivity that both brothers share with each other cannot be overestimated. All Niki wants to do is to be loved and, in any case, to seek acceptance. (i.e., he goes to church, loves Hulk Hogan) Geno loves Niki more than anything else. But can his brother become independent enough for Geno to fulfill his dream of becoming a doctor? A brilliant film that was supposed to get more recognition than it deserved, but, unfortunately, came out around the same time as Rain Man, who was working on a similar problem. However, I prefer Dominic and Eugene more because they have a much stronger emotional component. Be warned that this film is aimed directly at the tear ducts, so have Kleenex on hand! What movie !!!!
