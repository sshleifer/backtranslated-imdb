Anyone who is interested in pop music and is not familiar with the British musical tendencies of the late seventies should definitely watch Breaking Glass at least once. The film, which tells about the young womanâ€™s aspiration to leave her mark in the musical world, perfectly reflects times, starting with obvious sexism, economic hardship, social upheaval, and ending with the transition of popular culture from crude punk to terribly feigned and pretentious futurism / new romanticism. The styles of music and fashion that were created daily in Britain at the end of the seventies are still rediscovered and processed (since 1980 there has really been nothing new). It was a dazzling time, and Breaking Glass tells a very personal story and explores the cultural landscape, and does it very well.
