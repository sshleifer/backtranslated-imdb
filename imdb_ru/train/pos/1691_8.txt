This movie is funny and suitable for any age. This is definitely family fun. The cast is great when playing in people in the western city of Big Bean, Illinois. Where we must assume that nothing is happening, since the excitement (pre-invasion) of the decade is a new (and only) exit ladder from the Interstate. The location looks quite dull and quite unlikely to invade the Martians on the ground. But these Martians are completely irrelevant, despite the fact that they are well equipped with an arsenal of respectively terrible and deadly weapons ... including a set to destroy the Martians! Martians idle their lines and add just the right accents to make us, the spectators and local residents, help them ... leave the earth. JJ Anderson, who plays the very young predatory halloween duck, has only wonderful lines. Watch this movie for fun and entertainment; make you think it is not. But subtle and pleasant is it.
