This is a trio of fairy tales "Shakti", "Devi" and "Kali" about an experimental commune (or something similar), called the Taylor-Eriksson group, which sent people on trips inside themselves and to the kingdom unknown, and left some damage here and there, i would say. Many years later, some of this damage is still hidden and is waiting for the right moment to show itself. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband had mysteriously died, in fact, he was torn apart, and the suspect was a man who may not have existed. It seems that this woman is capable of projecting some kind of internal demon, or so the sister of a man who was killed when she tries to talk to this woman, posing as a reporter, finds out. Devi tells the story of a young man who wants to "jump out of his skin." He is a skinhead, obsessed with speed, and he is sent to a psychiatrist, who, as it turned out, was a member of this commune in the past, with the result that a good doctor helps a young man realize his desire. This is probably the best of the three segments. Kali tells the story of a healer who is trying to "heal" this woman, who was part of this commune, and releases some kind of demon who lived in this woman, but wondered if he did it, or SHE lost it, because it is not could survive in her more. All these three stories are pretty creepy and disturbing, because you never know what to expect, and the package and the setting are not so similar to ordinary horror movies that it adds to strangeness. It has a sort of low-budget look, but it is also capable of creating a rather creepy atmosphere everywhere, to its credit. I watched it with my mouth open most of the time, and when real panic (and blood) came, it hit pretty hard. I found this film very interesting and exciting, and I really liked it. A good little find, I would give 8 out of 10.
