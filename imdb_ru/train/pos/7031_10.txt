This is a great movie, I did a play a while ago. This had an extra zing-- to this. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosie, and also Jason Alexander has a good voice. That was great. The decor was also very good. Except for the fact that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes, it does this for quite some time. Overall, I give him 8.5 stars. They also added a few pieces, but it was still cool.
