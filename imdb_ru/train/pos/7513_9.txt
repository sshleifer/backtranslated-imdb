"The Infamous Betty Page" (2005) <br /> <br /> Director: Mary Harron <br /> <br /> Starring: Gretchen Mole, Chris Bower, Lily Taylor, Sarah Paulson and David Strathairn <br / > <br /> MPAA rating: “R” (for nudes, sexual content and some language) <br /> <br /> It seems that now every celebrity receives a biopic about his life. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, biopic films are very smart now. “The Notorious Bettie Page” is the latest one released on DVD. It depicts Gretchen Mole as the best-known pin-up model in the world, Betty Page, and she was shot mostly in black and white with some excerpts in color. However, unlike Ray, Go Down The Line and Finding Neverland, this film will not be the one worth seeing at the Oscars this year. In this film, there is no emotional resonance displayed in other biographical films, and most of the most dramatic moments in the life of Betty Page are either completely ignored or simply offered. This does not mean, however, that this is a bad film. In fact, The Infamous Betty Page is a very exciting and intense film - a solid film work. This film focuses more on Page's exciting careers and the fine lines between sexuality and pornography. This is filmed with fervor and caution, and directing Mary Harron captures the look of a period of time that most filmmakers only dream about. <br /> <br /> Everybody knows Betty Page (she’s played by Mol). If you know her as an icon ?? or just a porn star ?? you know her. She is a woman who had a very deep impact on American culture, only by finding more skin than is considered relevant at the time. Now most people know her as one of America's first sex symbols - a legend for many models, especially for Playboy and other adult-oriented magazines. She lived at a time when a read only an inch of flesh under the waste could have resulted in someone being arrested, and Paige's bondage photos simply pushed the American public to noise. In fact, the photos launched a full-fledged Senate investigation of decency, and the difference between harmless movies and porn. <br /> <br /> The performances in “The Notorious Betty Page” are absolutely wonderful with the Gretchen Mol standing out. Her performance in the role of Betty Page is just great. I understand that when she was announced for this role, many were skeptical of her. Her name is not something that immediately comes to my mind when I think about good performances. Now it will be so. She completely mastered the role and attracted me with her vulnerable and at the same time very attractive performance. David Strathairn recently came out of last year's Good Night and Good Luck, in which he gave one of the best performances of 2005. Here he gives another great idea, although he is a bit undervalued. I was shocked at how limited his on-screen time was, but quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie. The only talk I saw with Lily Taylor was in Phantom (1999). While most people ignored the film, I found it enjoyable, if not completely superficial, a horror film, and I also always thought that Taylor was absolutely believable as emotionally distraught Nell. Here Taylor gives another credible insight. She demonstrates a very subdued performance and superb performance to compliment Gretchen Mol. <br /> <br /> After everything was said and done, I realized that “The Notorious Betty Page” cannot be compared with other biographical films, such as “In Search of the Neverland” and “Follow the Line.” This is incomparable with them, because it tells the story of a woman and her career from beginning to end. Briefly implied her personal life, but in fact her influence on the world becomes the highest point. We watch the film, knowing that Paige will eventually expose everything, and we know what impact its decisions will have — but we are rarely shown what impact they will have on her personal life. She is a woman who never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself. After all, she was an adult model who became a Christian missionary. This film does not dramatize anything. This could include Page’s fictitious moments of hysterical sobbing and God's pleading forgiveness. This might show that Paige is running and screaming through the rain, trying to run away from the ghosts of her past - and yet this is not the case. "The Infamous Betty Page" tells a simple story, and it is rare by today's standards. Fortunately, it is quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Final thought: “The infamous Betty Page” is a relaxing film with absolutely amazing cinematography. <br /> <br /> Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)
