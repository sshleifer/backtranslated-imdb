This delightfully pleasant and kindhearted sequel of the extremely successful "Legends of Bogey Creek" is a sequel only in name. Stories abound in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious bigfoot called Great Bay of Tai, which dwells deep in the unattractive swamps of Boggi Creek. Two brother brothers and their older, more intelligent tomboy (sweetly angry presentation, pretty, with pigtails of the future star of the comedy series “Different Strokes” Dana Plato) are sent to the insidious quagmire to see if the creature of the local legend can actually be real being. The trio is hopelessly lost in a violent storm, and a furry, bear-like, huge but very gentle and benevolent Sasquatch comes to the aid of the children. <br /> <br /> Casual, no-nonsense, Tom Moore’s leadership connects this simple story at a leisurely pace, astutely capturing the details of the daily life of a rural city in incredibly precise details, attracting characters from different countries with great warmth and love, and fortunately , developing a mood organically, with restraint, without coercion, which never develops into a sticky - calm mess. Delightful Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on “Gilligan's Island”) gives a breathtakingly daring image of a loving single working-class mother children, while Jim Wilson and John Hofey offer pleasant hot-tempered support in the form of a pair of quarreling old men with hay. Robert Betard’s capable, sunny cinematography displays woody scenery in all its superbly calm, painfully clean and fragile, untouched by the magnificence of civilization. The Darrell Deca score successfully combines the trembling creeping synthesizer and the jubilant banjo-ripped country bluegrass into a melodic sound beer. In addition, this picture deserves special praise for the fact that it strangely predicts the children's peculiarity of the 90s in the fashion of a snowman for a good 15+ years from now.
