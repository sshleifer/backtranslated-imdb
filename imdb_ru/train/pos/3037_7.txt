The film "MacArthur" begins and ends with General Douglas MacArthur, Gregory Peck, Alma Mata at the US Military Academy at West Point on Hudson. We see a weak 82-year-old General MacArthur deliver an opening speech in the 1962 graduation class about the honor to serve his country. The film then tells of the nearly two-hour memory of General MacArthur’s brilliant and ambiguous career, which begins in the darkest hours of World War II on the besieged Corregidor Island in the Philippines in the early spring of 1942. <br /> <He said to leave the island and go to Australia before the Japanese military invaded it. General MacArthur, for the first time in his military career, almost does not obey the direct order of his senior US President Franklin D. Roosevelt Dan O'Herlih. Feeling that he would leave his people at the most difficult time, MacArthur, reluctantly, together with his wife and young son, did what he was told, only so that he would persecute him for reminding him of the war. It is for this reason that his escape due to death or captivity by the Japanese forced General MacArthur to use all his influence to force the Federal Republic of Germany two years later to launch a major invasion of the Philippians, and not on the Formosa Island. support his promise to both the Filipino people and the thousands of remaining US prisoners of war. That he will return and return with the strength of the army and navy of the United States to maintain his promise! <br /> <br /> Two years before the invasion of the Philippine Islands, General MacArth defeated the Japanese forces in the Southern Pafiqiu in a series of brilliantly conceived island vault battles, which isolated and forced hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops to surrender. The general did it, having suffered much less US military losses than any other allied commander in the war in the Pacific! <br /> <br /> It was in 1950/51 that during the Korean War, General MacArthur achieved his most brilliant victory, as well as the worst military defeat. Bypassing the superior and excellently executed North Korean army, with the invasion of American marines who lost less than 100 men, the invasion of the back door or the left hook of General Inchon. MacArthur, feeling invincible, sent US / UN troops under his command the frontier, along the Yalu River, of communist Red China. Speaking to his subordinates that he faced the threat of a massive ground attack from the communist Chinese forces, General MacArthur still continued to insist until this attack materialized, cutting the forces of the United States and the United Nations into ribbons. The unstoppable wave after wave of the attacking red Chinese forces forced the US / UN forces to retreat during the "Big Mistake" of 1950, leaving all their equipment behind, across the North Korean border, even leaving the capital of South Korea. Seoul! This turned out to be one of the biggest military catastrophes in US history, when American troops lost a record, in the Korean War, 1000 lives on the first day of November. 29/30 1950 - about the invasion of the communist Chinese! <br /> <br /> Shocked and humiliated by what he allowed, mainly because of his own arrogance, MacArthur went on the offensive not against the advancing communist Chinese and North Koreans, but his own commander and chief president. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, has no argument or courage to do what needs to be done: start a full-scale invasion of communist China with nuclear weapons, if necessary, so that his troops do not seize the Korean Peninsula! For Pres. Truman, who collected almost as much garbage from General MacArthur as he, publicly running away from his mouth, tells how he mistreated the war, not with all his strength, as MacArthur wanted, against the Red Chinese - this was the last straw! April 11, 1951 Truman unceremoniously freed General MacArthur from his command as Supreme Commander of the US / UN forces in Korea! President Truman’s bold, but very unpopular decision also, not complying with MacArthur’s overall military strategy, prevented the outbreak of World War III with an ally of the Soviet Union — Communist China, which, while the United States, had an atomic bomb! President Truman’s controversial decision to dump the very popular General MacArthur also cost him re-election in 1952 from his polls of numbers so low in the mid-20's that he left in March of this year from the campaign of the President of the USA! <br /> <br br > The trouble of General MacArthur was in trouble when the political and military climate in the world changed in how to wage future wars. With the horrors of nuclear war now, in 1950/51, the suicide of the nation would be a reality in order to General MacArthur, against the Red Chinese, who might well reflect There is a nuclear holocaust that will swallow not only the ussr and the red china, but the whole world! This was the important reality of the future war that General MacArthur never learned, since the A and H bomb was not yet invented at West Point. <br > <br /> Back to 1962, we can now see this general. MacArthur, having completed his opening speech at West Point, became a senior and wise soldier, and also after leaving the US Army the oldest statesman in his feelings for the war and her worthlessness. One thing that General MacArthur taught at an early age from his civil war general, Father Douglas MacArthur Sr., who had been sticking to him all his life, was that for a soldier like him, war must be the last, not the first, means resolving the problem between nations. In this, the soldiers must fight and die in it. It took General MacArthur a lifetime, with the advent of the nuclear age, to finally understand how truthful and wise his father, the winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor, was, like himself!
