After watching the movie "Break the Leg" in Vancouver at the graduation party, I thought it was a very nice movie. <br /> <br /> I had a few frank giggles of the abdomen, and some of the cameos (in particular, Eric Roberts) scream. I have not heard a word about the actual release date, although I heard that it is close. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but basically it is a tool for characters and situations. The script is smooth and solid, the plot develops without effort, and the action is comfortable, but fresh. This film received at least one award from EVERY film festival in which he participated, about 10â€“15 or so. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Breaking the Leg.
