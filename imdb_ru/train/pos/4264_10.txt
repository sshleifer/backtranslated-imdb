I happened to see this film twice or more, and I found it well done! The Second World War had just ended, and the so-called Cold War began. Thus, this film can be defined as one of the best “propaganda”, patriotic films that prepare the Americans and, secondly, people from the not yet formed “Western NATO bloc” of countries that face a new threat. The film glorifies the power of the United States for centuries, while projecting itself into the current war, which has just ended. A good and fun way to describe the discovery of the Americas by Columbus and the cute "episode" in New Amsterdam and the purchase of Manhattan from a drunken local Indian. propaganda through time)! :)
