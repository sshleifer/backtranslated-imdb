Atlantis: Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought this movie would lead to my expectations. True, this film began slowly, but as the film was worn on it, I liked it more. The story takes place in 1914 and tells about a guy named Milo. Milo believes in legendary Atlantis. Together with his grandfather's friends, he embarks on an amazing adventure of his own. Along the way, he should evoke love, betrayal, trust, and more. The voice composition is great. They certainly know how to wear movies only with their voice talent. There is nothing special in music, but in any case it is pleasant. Animation is not the best, but still good enough. Overall, this is a good family movie for all ages. I rate this movie 9/10.
