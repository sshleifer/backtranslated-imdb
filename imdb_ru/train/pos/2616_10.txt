The Lion King 1 1/2 is a very cute story that accompanies the Lion King. It basically follows the original story of the Lion King, but with a pair of twists. In the film, the events are explained from a different point of view of the characters. This story is still an original plot. <br /> <br /> With regard to sequels, Disney is not so good at creating decent ones. This, being the third part of “The Lion King” (“Simba's Pride - the second”), actually has an original idea, but still includes the fun of the first. Timon and Pumba travel in search of the perfect place to live. After searching around, they find the location of the Hakuna Matat. Then they meet a little lion named Simba and pass through many things that parents go through today. <br /> <br /> I think this is a very good movie and I am happy to add it to my collection.
