Hello from the dark again. The highly anticipated, distorted comedy from writer / director Richard Shepard is a party for the actor Pierce Brosnan. This Bond guy is gone. This new guy is a completely different thing !! He read that Shepard thought Brosnan was too good for this role, but Brosnan turned out to be the perfect Julian Noble, the “facilitator” ... and not at all beautiful! Do not underestimate how perverted the humor is in this. If you go, expect raisins and spectacles for all kinds of sex, murder, religion, sports, business, and anything else that you may consider politically incorrect. Brosnan takes the superb script to another level thanks to his amazing facial gestures and physical movements. Even sitting on a bed in a hotel (with or without a sombrero) is a joy. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinnear is the direct guy of the Brosnan comic, and he has enough depth and comics to make this partnership interesting. I hope that Davis plays a small but subtly effective supporting role as Kinnear’s wife (what's with her name Bean?), Which is a little worried when she has an assistant in the living room. <br /> <br /> Visual effects and settings are perfect - including bullfighting, the hippodrome and the Denver suburb. And how often do we release The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? This is definitely not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you like a perilous movie, this may be for you.
