OK, let's see. I'm really not fond of science fiction, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neill leads his SG-1 team through the Stargate. A round device that creates a wormhole. It gives you the opportunity to travel to distant worlds. This may sound like your regular science fiction series, but itâ€™s not! The plot unfolds today not in some distant millennium, as in many other science fiction TV shows. I find it great. He gives you things, events and the like to which you can relate, and you can go into the series at any time without learning a lot of new terms and names of all gadgets. Of course, they have some, but thanks to O'Neill, who likes to stick to simple terminology, there are not so many of them. <br /> <br /> The series combines action, humor and drama. If you like a lot of special effects, you will not find it here. They do not use a lot of bad, but a limited number of well-done special effects.
