Carlos Mencia was excellent, this is a special hour. He worked hard to show everyone that he was real. I know that people said that he stole the material in this special issue, but it is not. Carlos makes comedy the way he wants it, not the way someone else wants it, so he is so good. People say that he is not funny, because he says Di Dee too much, and they still have not realized that this is part of his action, and they donâ€™t want it that way, but he still brings it in and he manages to do people laugh. For all the haters, here's the message, Carlos is here to stay, you have no point trying to knock him down.
