This is really an old-fashioned charming film. The places are great and the situation is one of those old Preston films. If you want to watch a movie that doesn't require much more than sitting back and relaxing, that's all. The acting is good and I really liked Michael Rispoli. He was in Shulers too. And while you were sleeping. The rest of the cast is fun. This is exactly what happens when two people who are about to get married meet someone they really love on weekends when they plan their own weddings. I know ... it sounds weird ... but it is. And that's what fun to watch. This will force your girlfriend to either hug you or leave you, but at least you will know.
