This is the great opus of Swedish king shit Mats-Helge Olsson. Rarely a film of this magnitude was shot in Sweden, and it really stands out as one of the most amazing achievements in a Swedish film to date. Who pays for these things? <br /> <br /> Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to move to Sweden. But his plans are ruined by the Russian military, who kidnap him and say that he arrived in Sweden. This trick is their way of ensuring that Markov continues his work in nuclear physics, which will revolutionize the supply of the entire planet. However, the CIA seeks to deliver Markov to the west and send his ninja to release him. <br /> <br /> Swedish actors speak English - this is what Mats-Helge has perfected in his later works. This cheap feeling of the b-film that it creates probably has no equal in performance. But besides that? Well, action is the standard style of live video. Machine guns shoot huge clouds of smoke. Thousands of Russians are dying. People run around in black ninja suits, trying to hide under the snow. <br /> <br /> What really stands out is the insanely bad way of staging battle scenes. When they say "ninja" in the title, I expect martial arts, I expect hand-to-hand combat. But in this film there are maybe two or three scenes of real martial arts. And they are funny. It is so bad that I donâ€™t have enough words to describe it. If the ninjas move slower, their hearts will stop. And, of course, the entire film ends with an explosion that points to a special effects budget consisting of four food stamps and a McDonald's voucher. <br /> <br /> So what's the verdict? Instant classic of course. A movie that was so obviously intended to be consumed along with a huge amount of alcohol has never been shot. This is the perfect party movie. Insert in the video and laugh. You just need to understand that these films are no longer created. This is the story of the movie. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the rating is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.
