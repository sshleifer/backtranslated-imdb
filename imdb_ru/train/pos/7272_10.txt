Before I begin, let me tell you how great it sounds when you play Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut at the same time (especially at the Red Mountain level). Therefore, watching this special performance, I suggest ... no, WANT YOU to do it. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia brings his fight to the extreme in San Francisco, California. There he scoffs at all without any apology. <br /> <br /> I greatly thank God that Carlos didn’t do his job, in which he uses the same joke over and over, over and over, and over and over and over. He does a great job, making fun of everyone and at the same time honestly speaking about it; I know a couple of times when I said, after Carlos said a joke: “Damn, this guy makes a good thought!” And then the Game Over screen appeared on my TV, because I forgot that I play Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut. My bad :) So, yes, there is nothing to complain about this special buffet. If you have a TiVo or something like that, do yourself a favor and record this historic hour.
