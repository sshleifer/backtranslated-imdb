If you like romantic comedies, then the story of two 30-year-old singles who fall in love during the American League pennants race is satisfactory. On the other hand, if you hang up waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, then you should probably stay away. The plot contains a mandatory guy meets friends of the girl, the girl meets friends of the guy, and the guy meets the scenes with the girl's parents. There's even a guy meets a girl on a dog scene. This is all for the course in such a film. However, what I liked about this is that the plot has gone deep into the decision-making process that people accept when they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and in fact is a bit strange. The plot is centered around answering questions; how many quirks are too many and how much love does it take to beat these quirks Interestingly, the characters cope with this, because deep down (if we admit it), we all have oddities. Barrymore does an excellent job with his role, and Fallon seems to surprise me â€” he's good too. I rate him as 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add one point if you are a baseball fan or are romantically associated with it. Add another point if you're a Red Sox fan, and subtract two points if you're a Yankee fan.
