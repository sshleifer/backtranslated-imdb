A delightful piece of cinematic narrative in a simple but effective way. Cinema, after all, is a visual media, and Igor used his full potential. A young restless man gets on the train, not thinking about the goal. In one of the compartments, he meets a girl. Words don't exchange, but their washing is erased, and from there we go on a journey with other specific characters and situations. Two leads are well played, as their unique features tell a story that does not require words.
