I have no idea why this movie gets such a bad rap with many IMDb users (some say it's his “worst movie ever.” What? Have any of you seen Cradle 2 The Grave?) My favorite critic is that the plot completely stupid, and this is just a reason to hang all the sequences of actions. Duh! What shit did you expect from the movie Jet Li? Did you sincerely believe that someone invented a story and then just put it into action? Of course not! The black mask is an amazing wall-to-wall action for almost the entire time. This is also terribly disgusting, and we get a lot of severed limbs, beheading and creative ways of observing how the bad guys (and quite a lot of innocent people too!) Are killed. Most of the other Lee martial arts films are children's school compared to Black Mask; There is no deterrence from unwarranted violence, bloodshed or a sequence of actions at all! And that made me a happy tourist. Again: if you go to the movie Jet Li, waiting for a great dialogue and an intriguing plot, you go for the wrong reasons. “Black Mask” is probably my favorite movie (beware of terrible duplication).
