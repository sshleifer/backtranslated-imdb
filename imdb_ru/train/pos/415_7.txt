Master of the play Cecil B. De Mille goes west. Using the three legends of the old west as his main characters (they probably never met), Gary Cooper portrays Wild Bill Hikak, James Ellison as Buffalo Bill and Jean Arthur, who make an excellent Disaster Jane. This story serves only to de Mille hang some amazing action films, such as a major Indian attack. Such scenes are very well made. If you do not mind some of the redundant performances of the actors, it is very entertaining western. Look at the very young Anthony Quinn, who talks about the role of a brave Indian who participated in the Battle of Little Big Horn. This piece, at least, was seen in Hollywood.
