Hi: <br /> <br /> I heard about the lost from a colleague who had obvious differences in views on entertainment, he liked it. Well, I watched episode or 2 at the beginning of the season, and I was bored, so I turned it off. After a few years, I stumbled upon the lost; bored with the current sci-fi fare. Wow, I was surprised. Can you say gravity is good, damn it, I soaked up. The tempos and scenarios are very good, some of the flash forward / back are the same as for the lamer characters, but on the whole itâ€™s good. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Said Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jean and Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Papa Jack. Jack and Michael are definitely immature, very spoiled and immature. Kate is 1 step taller than them; Juliet was much cooler than Kate. Mr. Eco is underestimated and at the level of Charlie, if not more, it is a pity that they both died. A guy dressed in black is talking to Jacob (way back) - this is real curiosity. In general, a wonderful, very multi-layered series: looking for more. <br /> <br /> Regards
