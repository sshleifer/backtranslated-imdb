Talk about filming a dream - only the two most wonderful actors that have ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in “Hot Millions”, a funny, bizarre comedy that also starred Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is a former scammer who gets a resume of a talented programmer (Morley) and holds a position in a Malden-run company for the purpose of embezzlement. This is not a smooth sailing; he drew the attention of his rival in the company that Newhart plays, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him by place of residence under a different name), briefly becomes his secretary. She can not stay at work, and throughout the film they see her at different jobs - everything ends with her dismissal. When Newhart moves in with her, she invites Ustinova to her curry apartment as a cover, but they soon decide that they are made for each other. Of course, she does not know that Ustinov is a fraud. <br /> <br /> This is such a good film - you can't dislike Ustinov and Smith and be enchanted by the machinations of Ustinov, his genius and how he escapes trouble. But there is an end that will show you who really has brains. Do not miss this film, filmed in the 60s in London. One has only to hear Maggie Smith whimpering: "I was fired."
