Fans of Giallo, look for this rare film. It is well written, and full of all sorts of ordinary low lives that inhabit these films. I don't want to give anything, so I won't even say anything about the plot. The whole film creates a very strange atmosphere, and you do not know what to expect or suspect. Featured! The only place where I saw this movie in English is European Trash Cinema for $ 15.
