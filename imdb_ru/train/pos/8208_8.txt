I liked almost all the films in the “Dirty Harry” series, with the exception of one, which I think is called “Enforcer”. “Deadpool” was also a bit weak in the areas, but I still liked it. This is one of my favorite episodes, to say the least about the great “Come on, make my day” line. This one also shows an interesting, though familiar, story that someone killed those who did it wrong. Just think “Magnum Force” with fewer mysteries about who is behind the murders, and you have your own conspiracy. Of course, there is something more here, since this show has a very good final battle in an amusement park. It also shows that Dirty Harry got a bulldog as a gift, and it tripped Sandra Locke in a rather funny scene. The only question that remains is why Clint Eastwood had to have a rather mediocre actress Sandra Locke in many of his films. She lowers her points every time, even when I like the film in general. Of course, she is not so bad here, but her character could have been much better by someone else. Another problem with this film and other films is “Dirty Harry”, sometimes they seem to be advertising weapons. I love weapons just like the next person, but we really need scenes in which he explains all the strengths of his newest weapon and how many bullets are in it? However, a very pleasant recording in the series “Dirty Harry”.
