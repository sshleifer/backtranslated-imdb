Zabriskie Point is often misunderstood as the political film of Antonioni, the American film of Antonioni. Stylistically, he follows the example of “Blow-Up,” which means that the tempo is faster than in previous epics, although, of course, no less distinctive. <br /> <br /> Basically, a common mistake is that the film glorifies the hippie generation. Not this way. <br /> <br /> The two main characters come from completely different environments. Mark from "rebellious" young men, Daria from real estate agency corporation. But truly Antonioni, they are both alienated, both are trying to escape from their surroundings. Mark leaves the meeting of student rebels, and the Black Panthers are disappointed with the verbosity of empty rhetoric, while Daria continues to be anxious to be in motion with her car. <br /> <br /> Chief director Antionioni portrayed rebellious youth as confused and shallow, then moved to the city. An environment saturated with corporatism, billboards, meaninglessness must expand to adapt to a similar expansion of the population, bringing profit. It is from this environment that two main characters escape, although it seems, for the most part, a coincidence. <br /> <br /> Indeed, when Daria enters a small village on the outskirts of the desert, the situation becomes as suffocating, and people, like the losers, best illustrated by the old boxing champion, have now turned into a shadow of themselves, Drink, smoke and say stupid things. A stunning melancholic sequence, made even more powerful, thanks to the inclusion of several half-wild children living around, introduced by some kind of "benefactor", but "destroying the true part of American history." In the not so obscure symbolism there is Antonioni's opinion about hippies. Just a semi-positive glimpse into the canvas of human alienation. <br /> <br /> And then the desert, a landscape that is strikingly destructive, turns into a clean and terrifying, pristine, wild and dead. The sequence in which the two main characters make love, “connected” in fantasy by the generation of “flowers”, reflects a similar sequence in “Red Desert”, where Juliana tells her son a story. This is a colorful intermission in a colorless landscape. Bright semi-fantasy in suffocating reality. <br /> <br /> The ending probably belongs to the pantheon of great movie endings torn apart by Western civilization. Catharsis, exorcism. <br /> <br /> Two “international” films “Antioni” (British “Blow-Up” and American “Zabriskie Point”) are less efforts than previous masterpieces, but this is mainly due to a faster pace and inevitable invented conditions (London reeling, flower America). But when it comes to this, it becomes clear that he has not lost the advantage.
