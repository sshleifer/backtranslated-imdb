it's not Bonnie and Clyde or Thelma and Louise, but it's a good road movie. he sets up his two main characters softly and easily. Viewers will quickly recognize the underlying tension, which is a tribute to the director. There is a young French-speaking (and English-speaking) son who wants to succeed in France, has a French girlfriend and drinks alcohol, throwing parties like young people. And there is his Moroccan Arabic (and French) speaking father, who faithfully follows his Muslim faith, with the generosity and wisdom of his elders, and who rejects the new culture around him (like mobile phones). the film can explore a very strong policy - a strange couple drives through the former Yugoslavia, Turkey, and then through the Middle East to get to Mecca. these are areas where the Muslim population is involved in wars, repression, ethnic cleansing; where dictators pursue torture and summary executions to retain power, and where religious communities are in a constant deadly battle with each other. yet the film moves through those places and possibilities only with hints of such agendas. The relationship between them is key to this film, and faith, politics - the background. It seems to be saying that we are all human, and we need to understand and care for each other in order to manage this world well. This, of course, is not "Natural Born Killers", and so much the better.
