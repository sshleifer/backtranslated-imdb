This movie scares me from the first day I saw it. <br /> <br /> My mother watched him when he was on television in '92. I remember waking up in the middle of the night with her tearful delirium, when my dad helped her up the stairs. <br /> <br /> She said something like “Don't let her catch me” or something like that. I asked what made her so upset, and she told me that she was watching Woman in Black. <br /> <br /> Obviously, I had to watch this, and although I was only eleven, she allowed me. It scared the hell out of me. Since I watched this movie, I have been immune to horror movies!
