Of course, this film is not historically accurate, but it is a great entertainment. Most of DeMille's paintings, especially the later epics, are slow and painful, but the action here moves in the video. The story basically consists of a series of peaks with very small quiet moments. The action takes us from the Indian raid on the cabin; one of the best parts of the film with Gene Arthur, superb, trying to soothe the war-drawn natives. She and Cooper are then sent to a military camp and tortured. Later comes a protracted battle with the Cheyenne. All this is funny, but very fun and interesting from beginning to end. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this era, and she shines here.
