I heard people who say that this film is boring boring boring. I don't think they watched the right movie. Thank God, this is not a prototype action movie. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama about a recruit and his mentor, which, as it turned out, is about killing people. So it works very well, with the amazing performances of Berenger and Zayn (who doesn’t follow the film, as he plays in other roles - he really looks like he plays). <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with the action by the end - a lot of it didn't make much sense and was unsatisfactory, given the build-up from the rest of the film. But look at Zayn’s face when he panics alone while Berenguer does the dirty work.
