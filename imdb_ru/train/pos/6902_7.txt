This is a modest, character-driven comedy shot in Brazil with a small budget. The premise is familiar, as in the 1950s Danny Kaye movie ** “About the Double” **: someone who jokingly gives the impression of a famous person is then dragged to impersonate him as a person. <br /> <br /> The contrast between the two leads is very effective. Raul Julia, as a German-Paradorian secret policeman, tall, cold-blooded, menacing and Latin. He is engaged in obviously obvious work of the blonde. Richard Dreyfus, a lively, short, New York Jew who is cheerful and responsive. In show business there are a lot of references and anecdotes inside. <br /> <br /> Parameter is clearly modeled in Paraguay. Paraguay did rule from the early fifties to the end of the eighties by General Alfredo Stroessner, an unelected military dictator, whose father emigrated from Germany. But the writer / director Mazursky shows his ignorance in the local context when he portrays Parador / Paraguay as a typical Latin American tyranny with huge wealth inequality and active partisan insurgency. Further in this spirit, Mazursky calls the comic Jonathan Winters an American pensioner who is in fact C.I.A. the head of the station in Parador and such a powerful figure that he can give the president of the country foul language. <br /> <br /> In fact, the US has little influence in Paraguay, which is largely unrelated to the social and racial tensions observed in other parts of the region. This is due to the fact that the country waged long and costly wars against its larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries. The male population was almost destroyed both times, but the emerging society was patriotic, racially homogeneous, and strongly cohesive. <br /> <br /> At another level - feminism in the image of the character of Madonna. Brazilian actress Sonny Braga performed by Madonna - a former nightclub dancer who was a presidential girl in full costume, but on television she is considered the president at the very end - now she is politically and cosmetically correct, without makeup, with hair modestly dismissed, swept away office velvet revolution. <br /> <br /> Once, when such an event really happened in Latin America, the Argentine administration Isabel Peron (and not beloved Evita, who never held a position) lasted two years after the death of her husband, the legendary ** supremo Juana Perona.
