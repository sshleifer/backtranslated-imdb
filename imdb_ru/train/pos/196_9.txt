This for me was a great introduction to the talents and beauty of Marion Davis. She is not only gorgeous, but also cheerful in this film. (I believe that Lucille Ball modeled his later Davis-style career, which could be called “crazy beauty.”) Widor’s direction is light, but true, the story is, of course, a chestnut, but acting piece surprisingly modern. stars for fans of the era of silence, with many cameos, adds to the general fun. He pretty well combines the elements of farce with adult drama and the good old timeless novel. For all movie fans who have a knee reaction to watching silent movies, sit through it and it can change your attitude. <br /> <br />
