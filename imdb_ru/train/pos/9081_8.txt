If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters and Ancient Legends, then you will love this movie !! <br /> <br /> Special effects - the best I've seen since Park Huaraschi got on the big screen many years ago. While the action may have been a little less than desirable, the storyline and effects adequately compensated for this. <br /> <br /> I wish I could see this in a movie on the theater screen instead of our 42-inch large-screen TV. <br /> <br /> If you like non-stop action, stunning visual effects and a taste for myths and knowledge ... you should watch this movie !!
