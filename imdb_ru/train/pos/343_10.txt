Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, David Boreanaz. Even before I learned what the film was about, these names were enough to attract me. Gorgeous, talented and popular, these artists should pay attention. <br /> <br /> Okay, where do I start. We already know what the film is about. Five beautiful girls fall victim to the "romantic" serial slasher, a guy who was all denied school dancing 13 years ago. Its trademarks include subtle death threats disguised as valentines, larva-infested sweets and bleeding nose. His weapon of choice is: well, take a pickaxe, a knife, an electric drive, a bow and arrows, red-hot iron, etc. Good, so basically it's a horror movie with a good perverted sense of sexuality. <br /> <br /> Horror films should not be Shakespeare, but I will not go there. I love horror movies, but not all of them. This one, I adore. It is there with some of my favorites. It's funny, sexy and scary. The killer’s mask is childishly creepy, and it’s really strange to see Cupid firing from a bow and arrow at a victim. Acting at the highest level: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are very funny. I really wanted to see a lot more Katherine Heigl. I am one of her biggest fans, and I would very much like her to become the lead soon. Jessica Capshaw is a very capable actress, and Jessica Kaufjell plays the dim blonde as she refined in Urban Legend 2. Smaller pieces were also good; Hedy Bresse was a scream (“bleedmedry.com”), and this younger version of Denise Richards looked terrible like her. <br /> <br /> Highlights: There was a distinct difference in each death scene. The most terrible scene was the opening in the morgue. The jacuzzi scene, though ridiculous, was well done. And the audiovisual labyrinth was sinister. The soundtrack is gorgeous, with spooky music and a few wonderful alternative melodies. <br /> <br /> Lowpoint: it seemed to me that the killer was not good enough, we barely saw the mask, and it was not presented at all during the climax. I also thought that the climax was really not focused, but nonetheless amusing. <br /> <br /> The turn in the end was not such a big surprise, but I’m really glad that the filmmakers decided to rid us of all this “killer explanations” routine. <br /> <br /> I don’t like telling people what movies they should watch, but if someone asks me to choose a horror movie that I thought was really worth watching, then Valentine would be that. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10 (bull's eye!)
