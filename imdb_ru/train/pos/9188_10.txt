It is a pity that many did not understand this and the next episode. <br /> <br /> But don't worry! I'll explain it too. <br /> <br /> This episode is divided into two parts. <br /> <br /> The first part is Tony's “Dream” in his coma. The second part is what happens in real life. <br /> <br /> Now people don’t understand that Tony’s dream is more than just a dream. This episode deals with his preparation for his death. He loses his individuality and, in the end, even forgets himself, so he turns off all his connections with this world. You will notice that I speak on the stage of the doctor, where Tony says that he has lost his briefcase, which contains "his life." They really did an excellent job of interpreting their own thoughts about what happens when you die. <br /> <br /> If you understand the whole plot, you will find that this and the next episode are unique and have great spiritual significance. <br /> <br /> As with every episode with a soprano, acting and shooting are excellent. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not understand was the role of the monks. I will watch it until I get it. <br /> <br /> In any case, this episode really touched me, and I don’t think that someone else can better understand what is happening in the near-death experience. <br /> <br /> 10/10 no doubt.
