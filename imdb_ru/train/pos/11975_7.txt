Full House is a great family show. However, after reviewing several episodes over and over, I realized that they are incredibly boring and it seems that they strongly protect themselves from the outside world. Yes, there are many comedies, but there are moments when she is incredibly tender. Not that I hate it, but just donâ€™t watch them again and again, because they are aging quickly. Probably the best season is first. <br /> <br /> Full House talks about widower Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and his three daughters, DD. (Candice Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweeten) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny's wife dies, he needs help. So, his best friend Joe (Dave Kulier) and uncle Jesse (John Stamos) get out of the girls with them. Once they live there together, they discover that they cannot live without each other. <br /> <br /> Full House reminds you how important a family is and that you can always go home again.
