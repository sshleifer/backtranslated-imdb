I must admit, I was one of the skeptics who judged this show prematurely before any information about it was spread. I decided that it would be a cheap way out, led by Ronald D. Moore, who owned the retcon wand. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The pilot leaves a great impression on the audience. Availability is amazing! Of course, experienced BSG veterans will be immersed in the plot, which focuses on developing Cylons before the first war. (58 years before the events of the BSG pilot). The pilot also considers newcomers, clearly presenting his story and ideas in the first part of the episode. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake: “Caprica” is not BSG. We are presented with exciting, cerebral drama, dotted with provocative, bold and controversial ideas. <br /> <br /> Casting conforms to BSG standards; Stolz and Morales are simply amazing. Morales' image of Joseph Adam, inspired by the image of Olmos William, gives a wonderful look at the heroic father of William. Stolz's image of Dr. Graystone raises many thoughts and questions. <br /> <br /> If the quality of the pilot is an indication of what's ahead, RDM and the creative team intend to continue the BSG legacy of the first television programs with another masterfully created television masterpiece.
