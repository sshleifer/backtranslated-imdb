The second great installment, which is as good as the first. <br /> <br /> Once again, the casting is just wonderful. I like the fact that the first and second episodes have nothing in common except wit and ingenuity. <br /> <br /> The second episode is just very funny, very stupid and very pleasant. This is the very first Christmas episode about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer, dressed like Santa, after he killed her husband. As in the first episode; Karma. <br /> <br /> The most humorous scene is the connection between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first pretending that she is afraid until she becomes real.
