I just wondered why the hell FOX canceled season 3, although season 2 wasn't as good as season 1, which is really great !!! I love it so much that I even think about buying a DVD on Amazon. student, and I feel uncomfortable getting an international credit card and $). I just hope that FOX can ever return a DA!
