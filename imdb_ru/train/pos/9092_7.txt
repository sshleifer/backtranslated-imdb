I think this film adds diversity and is very accurate in terms of historical reconstruction. The way this shows the different communities leaving together in Thailand is very interesting ... The Portuguese, the Japanese and the various communities ruled by the king. The plots around the courtyard are, as usual, the struggle for power with great betrayal. The wardrobe is fine. The film is also made locally in Thailand in reasonable production. The scene with Elephant as performers is very interesting. It's funny, and I think it can also be used in schools because of its historical accuracy, because it shows that Europeans in Asia were subjects of local kings, which is very different from the traditional Hollywood perspective.
