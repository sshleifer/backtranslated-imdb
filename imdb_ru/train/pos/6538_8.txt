I really liked this movie. He managed to do what several films are doing now; it provided family values ​​by entertaining me. Nancy Drew - a heroine for all generations and an example to follow for young girls. The little girls I was with were enjoying the film and kept talking about Nancy when we left the theater. The film has relatively few problems for families, and I don’t think it will be boring for parents to sit in the theater. No, he won’t win an Oscar and didn’t demonstrate great special effects and didn’t even provide a terribly creepy mystery, but he entertained me and remained true to the spirit of the books. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has a young girl (she will like it!) Or any book fan. You will not be disappointed.
