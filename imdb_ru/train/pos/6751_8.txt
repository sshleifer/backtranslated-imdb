Pretty good movie from Preminger; sometimes a maze, as it explores sets and locales from different perspectives and perspectives, as if it were a natural film about the inhabitants of the modern city and how they live. In this sense, it is visually and spatially pleasing, because his hero, a good cop with a bad temper, gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews plays a leading role, as if it were Hamlet, and was never better. The story may be pure melodrama, but Andrews gives it weight and almost raises it to the level of tragedy. Like his girlfriend, Gene Tierney is attractive, but unremarkable. Gary Merrill makes a very interesting villain with his natural warmth, providing a good contrast with Andrews coldness; it seems that his smiling, friendly-looking bad guy is constantly challenging his sworn enemy with the mere fact of his emotional openness, in contrast to the severely wounded and moralistic policeman stalking him. <br /> <br /> There are no serious surprises in this film, which seems to be transitional for all interested parties. For director Preminger, this is a kind of reunion with his stars Laura, Andrews and Tierney, who were at the height of their career around the time of the film. The supporting cast - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - is understandably more optimistic, since they were all on the road to growth. Preminger, as serene as an observer, as before, allows events to unfold without expressing a strong point of view, because the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing, because the cat-and-mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any simple movie to contain, far less determination. <br /> <br />
