This is a romantic comedy with an emphasis on comedy for a change. As usual, the lovers - Sally Field as the queen of soap operas almost over the hill, Celeste Talbert; and Kevin Klein as a slightly hired and slightly talented actor, Jeffrey Anderson - work for different purposes, apparently unaware that they are madly in love, etc. Thanks to a little Bette Davis, Margo Channing in All About Eve (1950) and on the whole Judging by many theatrical traditions, Sally Field is going to meet the fun, when she is wrongly moving towards love and happiness. Kevin Kline, one of the most underrated leading people of recent years, is also very good and very winning because he manages to be beautiful, vulnerable, selfish and attractive at the same time. <br /> <br /> The center of misadventures around Celeste’s fear of losing her audience when she entered her forties was to reach a critical point with the arrival of her niece, beginning actress Corey Craven (ELIZABETH SHU), who is NOT her niece, the ensuing difficulties. Corey manages to play a small role in the soap opera as the homeless deaf-mute, before discovering her true relationship with Celeste (as well as Jeffrey Anderson) —but never mind. <br /> <br /> As a romantic counterpoint or as a presenter, Robert Downey Jr. (director of the show David Barnes) and Cathy Moriarty (Montana and nurse Nan). David Barnes is very hot for her, but she only cares about one thing: get rid of Celeste so she can shine brighter on the set. To this end, she forces Barnes to do anything to ruin Celeste’s career, but thanks to chance and / or perverted logic, all his attempts fail, to the delight of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Wails Goldberg plays Rose Schwartz, lead screenwriter and alter ego Celeste and confidant, while Carrie Fisher plays a modest role as a producer on the show. <br /> <br /> I thought it was funnier than the only other deception in the world of the soap opera that I saw (Young Doctors in Love 1982, which broke out of a general-purpose television hospital and was pretty good). Soapdish is funnier with Duffy and a lot of ridiculous one-on-line and stunning performances by Field, Klein and Downey Jr. But look at this for Sally Field, which is outstanding.
