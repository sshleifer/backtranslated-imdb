In “Come Back to Me,” Vern and Teddy discuss who was tougher, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often discuss who will win the battle too. Sometimes we become absurd and compare guys like MacGyver and Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now it seems that we are discussing guys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. This is a meaningless comparison when I see that Lee is dead, but it is fun. And if you follow what we have seen from Jet Li in "Deadly 4" and "Black Mask", you should at least say that he will be well combined with Chan. In this film, he meets as a martial arts god. <br /> <br /> A black mask tells about a person who was created along with many other people to be the highest combat vehicles. Their only goal is to win the wars that other people lose. They are invincible in some ways. Now this is a prerequisite for the film, but what it does is that it creates all the amazingly staged battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a miracle. He can do things with his body that no one person should do. And this is what makes his observation so fun. <br /> <br /> In addition to the martial arts in the film, Black Mask is strong in humor, and this is due to the chemistry that Jet has with his partner, the police officer. They are great together. But honestly. if someone reads this review, he wants to know if the film is a blow to the ass in the action section. And the answer to this is a resounding YES !!! Many, many bloody meaningless actions. You will love this movie.
