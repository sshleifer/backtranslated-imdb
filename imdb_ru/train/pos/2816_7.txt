This is Jackie Chan's fantastic film, because of the fantastic finale and great humor, although there is nothing special about this. All the characters are pretty cool, and the movie is interesting, plus Jackie Chan is amazing in that! Jackie and Wai-Mana Chan had fantastic chemistry together, and they were both very funny! And I thought that the main opponent looked really threatening! But the duplication was just awful! Character development is above average for this kind of thing, and the main battle is fantastic, plus some of the blows that Jackie gets in this are cruel! There is a lot of stupid and stupid humor in it, but it amused me, and the ending is hilarious!, Plus all the characters are pretty nice. It looks pretty cheap, but overall it’s very well done, and although it’s not the number of battles you expect from the Jackie Chan movie, it’s enough to keep you watching, plus one of my favorite moments in this movie is when Jackie (Dragon) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger), play with a rifle, and she leaves! This is a fantastic Jackie Chan film, because of the fantastic finale and great humor, although this is nothing special, but still worth seeing! Direction is good. Jackie Chan copes with his work, works great with the camera, shoots fantastic angles and for the most part keeps the film at a fast pace. Acting very well! Jackie Chan, as always, is amazing and amazing, he is incredibly cute, funny, as usual, does some crazy tricks, had fantastic chemistry with Wai-Man Chan, kicked his ass and played this wonderful cheeky character, he was awesome! I just wanted them to stop duplicating it! (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Wai-Man Chan is funny as Jackie's best friend, I really liked him, he is also a very good martial arts master. The rest of the cast does well, I guess. Overall worth a look! *** out of 5
