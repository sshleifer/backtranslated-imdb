First of all, I have to say that I made a mistake by watching the “Elections” films out of order. I say, unfortunately, because after seeing election 2 first, the election seems a bit disappointing. Both films are gang epics similar in form. And although “Elections” is a nice movie ... it’s not as good as a sequel. <br /> <br /> In the first edition of “Elections” we are shown two competitors for the post of Chairman; Big D and Lok. After several scenes of discussion by the “uncle” of the one who should have the title of Chairman, they (almost unanimously) decide that Lok (Simon Yam) will lead the Triads. Suffice it to say that this does not fit well with rival Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) and in an attempt to influence takeover, Big D kidnaps two uncles to incline the election commission to his side. This has disastrous results and triads lead to full-scale war. Lok is determined to become the chairman, but he will not become official until he receives the "Baton with the head of a dragon", a material idea of ​​the powers of the chairman. The current chairman, Whistle (Chung Wan) hid the baton somewhere in mainland China, and the race is on to find out who will be able to return it first. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is dedicated to the restoration of the Loaf. Since both aspiring leaders are looking for him, they must evade the police and opposing sides, which leads to one of the outstanding election scenes, which includes a subordinate named Jet (Nick Chung), a machete and a lot of bad guys. The presence of Nick Chung attracts attention, if not more ... Interestingly, this somehow influenced the director Johnny That when he held the second election, as he later demonstrates more of the character Jet. <br /> <br /> While Nick Chung gives an idea of ​​the theft of the scene, I can't help but pay tribute to the rest of the film. Elections have a great ensemble with well thought-out performances that are both subtle and spectacular. Simon Yam is his usually magnificent personality, and the film also wins against such heavy actors like Louis Koo, Tony Leung Ka Fai and the underrated Suit Lama. In the acting game there are really no weak links, and one can easily believe that they are watching real gangsters. <br /> <br /> Although the performances are great, one of the most impressive things in “Choices” is the look of Johnny To for the camera. The film has truly amazing shots, and it goes without saying that Tho definitely knows how to frame his shots, as the viewer views a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera positions and angles. All this makes “Elections”, first of all, a great looking film. <br /> <br /> My problems with the film arise mainly because of the huge number of characters participating in the elections. Watching him becomes difficult, because the film is full of characters who are not an integral part of the plot. While the sequel prefers to focus more on two candidates, the first election proposes the election process as a whole, with tons of uncles, subordinates and policemen filling the storyline. Perhaps the film would work better if it were a little longer, if more time was devoted to the internal actions of the Triad, or if director Johnny Th would direct the necessary elements and explain them more. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - In general, this is an amazingly brutal film with a great cast, a great direction and a leisurely rhythm that gives a striking beat. This is a little harder than necessary.
