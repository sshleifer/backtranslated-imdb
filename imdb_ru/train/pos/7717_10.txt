I have loved this movie all my life. This is such a clever story, with many classic allusions. eg. The ship missing missing decades earlier was called Bellerophon. Well, in classical mythology, it was the man who killed Chimera, a legendary beast consisting of two or more other creatures. In the FP, Walter Pijon is clearly a chimera of himself and his Id monster. <br /> <br /> I like movies in which the writers clearly attribute a little intelligence to their audience, unlike most modern blockbusters, who spend $ 150 million on special effects, but about $ 1.5 per script. /> Greetings
