A recent viewing of THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT made me want to watch many of the classic MGM musicals of the forties and fifties. ANCHOR AWEIGH is, of course, a smaller film than ON THE CITY. The songs are not as good as the chemistry between the characters. But the film perfectly combines classic favorites such as Tchaikovsky. And the scene in the Hollywood Ball, where Sinatra and Kelly appear from the forest above him and then run up the stairs, while dozens of pianists play the piano, is the best scene in the film, although the scene in which Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse , better known. Fans of classical music will surely recognize the music that pianists play. Then Sinatra sings, “I fall in love too easily,” before I get an insight into who he loves. The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks beautiful with its mountains and clear air (Can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties, not to mention the mid-1940s?!), And piano music is absolutely gorgeous. MGM definitely had a talent for creating such lyrical moments.
