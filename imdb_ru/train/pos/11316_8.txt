(Some spoilers) I did not read the novel by James M. Cain ("The Postman Always Rings Twice") on which this film was based, so I cannot compare this version of the film with him, but I saw and love the American version of 1946. (also called "Postman"). <br /> <br /> Even better is this gem from Italy, which, as I read, was “mutilated” during the editing process due to too many explicit references to the fascist regime. Nevermind ?? what remains is a wonderful piece of cinema, obviously the forerunner of the neorealist movement in filmmaking. You can certainly see why ?? in spite of the fact that rough editing continued, there is still a pervasive sense of social and cultural, as well as personal oppression, over the protagonists, who therefore face many limitations in life. <br /> <br /> Look at Gino, a young man. a vagabond, poorly educated, unemployed and resorting to tidying up, stealing and deceiving people to get along, his pair of shoes are so worn out that it becomes almost useless. <br /> <br /> In Giovanna he sees a way out, but he had to keep going since Giovanna was depressed by her love marriage with an elderly man with some money, her work (working in the trattoria for her husband, slavery behind the bar and kitchen), and her sex. She had limited opportunities in the past, and she still decided to marry a restaurant / gas station owner (Giuseppe Bregant, played by Juan de Landa), knowing that he would not make her happy. She tells Gino that she feels sick every time Bregana touches her. <br /> <br /> Under the pretext of helping Bregany to repair his car and send him to the village to buy the necessary part (which he actually put in his pocket), Gino wins the service of Bregany (promising to also repair the broken water pump - water symbolizing or lack thereof) and remains alone with Giovanna. They immediately begin a hot, passionate, but unstable love affair. <br /> <br /> Gino soon feels strangled by the relationship and feels the need to move on again when Giovanna offers to dispose of her husband. Not wanting to participate in this, Gino leaves the city by train ride, which he cannot afford, kindly paying for it with another gypsy man named Spagnolo, a fellow traveler of the passenger train. For Gino, Spagnolo represents a kind of freedom, and they become friends (Spagnolo also symbolizes Gino's morality and conscience), traveling and finding work at the carnival together. Finally, Gino has a permanent job. To his horror (he has not finished his love for Giovanna), a month passed when Bregana and his wife go to the carnival, and Bregana persuades Gino to return “home” to live and work with them again, as he is at hand. to have around. <br /> <br /> Too weak to resist, knowing that it will unite him and Giovanna, Gino agrees and returns to stay with the couple. After a while, he gives in to Gina’s demands to get rid of her husband. As soon as the atrocity is committed, Giovanna becomes more cold-blooded than ever, it seems that she has very little conscience, while the guilt and shame eats away at Gino because he wounded a man who had never done him any harm. As much as he wants to leave her ?? he briefly again, they are now inextricably linked and must face the consequences. <br /> <br /> I liked the way Spagnolo's character returned to Gino's life to judge his wrongdoing ?? It was very good and interesting, adding another dimension to the story. <br /> <br /> While the American version of the year 46 with Lana Turner and John Garfield is a little lost in the swamp of peripheral characters, especially police officers and lawyers, Ossessione succeeds in focusing on the psychological consequences of the crime only for lovers. This gives the end result even greater potency and makes a powerful statement that reinforces the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live. <br /> <br /> Small dispute: the amount of time (unlikely) that passes before the lovers declare undying love, how quickly they kill the husband (there is no unsuccessful first attempt, as in the US version); Gino's very fast relationship with a dancer / prostitute ?? they also quickly confess their love, and she is ready to take a lot of risk for the man she just met! ?? it's pretty unrealistic, isn't it? I found this time interval problem to be quite distracting ?? it made me think that I missed something somewhere. Otherwise, well worth the time of the viewer. The game and the manual were equally good everywhere. Featured.
