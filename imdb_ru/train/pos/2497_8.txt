In fact: drug use, scandals, “dodging a bullet,” a futuristic city with a mixture of Asian races and a lonely vampire - all in the same film - seems like a story that can only be seen by a Japanese pop / rock star. And this is exactly what the "Lunar Child" and much more. While all of these elements together may sound like the perfect plot for the bi-movie's weekly march, Lunar Child does it, but only a few unexpected problems are expected along the way. <br /> <br /> He has an unnatural, definitely independent feeling, jumping from one scene to another, not in a smooth transition, but rather in sporadic jumps and boundaries, giving an idea of ​​the life of the characters and barely scratching the true plot. But the film makes no excuses, instead turning the story into a story of friendship, love, trust and betrayal, covered in sugar in the above-mentioned elements of a futuristic society, warring gangsters and vampires. <br /> <br /> HYDE as the grim vampire "Kay" is excellent, he gives depth to the character and balances Gackt's overly zealous behavior like "Sho", orphans who support Kay. Lee-Hom Wang also shines like a vengeful "Son" who made friends with an adult Shaw. The story revolves around these characters, their friends and family in different periods of their lives, and how simple friendship can easily turn into grief and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Although the action is too great from time to time. Unrealistic and special effects just seem like pontovy things, a film that never does suggests that it talks about the extremely popular Asian singers that it shows. Superstars as actors have their flaws, as well as their characters. The film rarely becomes boring, and ends where it should, after jumping quite a bit. “Lunar child” is quite pleasant, sometimes humorous and even very touching: it is definitely worth your time!
