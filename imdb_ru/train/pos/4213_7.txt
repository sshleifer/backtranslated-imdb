Directed by Samuel Fuller comes up with a brilliant visual scheme: a cheeky pickpocket unwittingly removes the microfilm from a woman's handbag; It turns out that she is a courier for the Communists, and now she and the fraudster are under police surveillance. The Film Noir formula is all its fame - before its ingredients became clich√©s, including waterfront locations, floods, saxophones on the soundtrack and one hellish climate battle. The performances of Richard Widmark and Gene Peters are right on target, and the smart, sharp script is rather colorful. Fairy Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for the role of a knockout in the role of "professional chair." Exciting, atmospheric, tough, like nails. *** from ****
