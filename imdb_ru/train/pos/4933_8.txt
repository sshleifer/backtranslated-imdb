Refreshing "lost" gem! Effective dialogue in combination with excellent acting game allows you to set the characters and involve you enough to take care of what happens to them. The characters Douglas and Widmark are realistic heroes. Palance is his usual evil presence. Widmark wins the fight with the fist fight, a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a “logical” end and a long foot chase that shames the exaggerated chase sequences in modern Hollywood. You know how this may end, but tensions and interest persist everywhere. The end of the chase is one of the most realistic you have ever seen. The film seems to be slowing a little further than the middle, but stay with it for a useful conclusion.
