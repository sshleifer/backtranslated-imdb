Well, this is probably one of the best films I've seen, and I like it so much that I remember most of the script (especially the scene in the memory unit when Jerry Lee breaks the wind) and even the script in my head. I still like to watch for Jerry Lee, that the German Shepherd is hysterical and is really being tested to find out who is smarter. The tag is also correct. Not to mention that acting is great, although Christina Tucci sounds different in a whisper (check out the movie for CSI if you donâ€™t understand what I mean). It is a pity that in this film there was only one problem that Dooley and Jerry Lee had to work with, it would be pretty cool to see the tricks of Zeus and Wells.
