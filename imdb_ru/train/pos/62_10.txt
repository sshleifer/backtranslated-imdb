I really liked this movie. I bought it as soon as I could find a copy of it. There were so many emotions in this film, and I felt so real that I really could sympathize with the characters. Every time I watch it, the ending makes me cry. I really can identify with the character Busy Philippe and with what I would feel if the same thing happened to me. <br /> <br /> I think that all high schools should show this film, perhaps it will keep people from wanting to do the same. I recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. Especially those who suffered from any school shooting. <br /> <br /> This is truly one of the greatest films of all time.
