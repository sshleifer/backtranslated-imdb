The second official episode of the series "Colombo" ("Murder on the book", filmed later, first hit the air). Robert Culp, who in several future releases coincided with detective Peter Falk, is terrific as the hot-tempered head of a sophisticated private detective agency who kills the clientâ€™s wife when she refuses to interfere with his blackmail. Two smart stars go together perfectly in this clever exercise for cats and mice, which is one of the best in the series.
