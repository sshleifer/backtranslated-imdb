Lisa is a hotel manager or owner, and she flies to Miami. In the end, she sits next to a killer named Jackson, who tells her that she should change her family room or her father will die. The reason she has to change the room is because Jackson wants to blow it up. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie with an unknown, because Lisa is trying in several ways to avoid this trick that Jackson has created. The whole storyline is gorgeous, and I thought that they could spend more time on the plane. On the plane there could be something more, but other than that, the whole movie was pretty good. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the final, because it was heartbreaking. I did not know what was going to happen, and I was surprised by this. For me, this film just made.
