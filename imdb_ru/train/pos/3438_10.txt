The film was very outstanding, despite the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes. In fact, such things happen, and that is why this film shows a lot of this. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in superb performance), whose recently started college, she is doing well. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in a stunning presentation) at a fraternal party that turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet. He invites her to dinner. They look at the stars from the bridge and end up going to his apartment. They talk and lead her to the basement, where they flirt with each other. She tries to put an end to this, but he rapes her. This incident scares her. She goes to the club, meets the bartender / DJ Adrian (superbly played by Marcus Patrick), who sees that she is drunk and helps him to go far. They make friendship. He also takes drugs, and Maya also begins to use. In other words, introduces her to another world. She begins to return to school and works as a TA (assistant) and sees Jared as one of the students. While the students take Midterm, she catches Jared's deception. Jared tries to smooth out Maya's conversations, but she still wins and decides to invite him over. Will the story repeat? Or will Maya have a surprise for Jared? You are watching a movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson portrays the role with attention and endurance. Chad Faust does not like that he can be a rapist, but he copes well with the role of Jared. Marcus Patrick is a brilliant man who saves Maya and trains her in a new world. This film deserves an award.
