This is one of the best comedies that have ever been on television. The first season was fun, like most of the following seasons. The only reason I give this 9/10 show is the bad final season. The only good part of the final season was the final. My favorite part of this show was the scenes that amazed people, often depicting characters in famous TV shows or movies of the 70s. This is a rare show in which I liked every character (with the exception of the final season ... too late to try to develop a new character, and the fez was not so funny). Red's leg in your comments on the ass never gets old, nor does Kelso's stupidity. Bravo fox for having kept such a good show for so long, even long.
