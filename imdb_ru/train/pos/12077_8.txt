I really liked this mysterious 1945 film about the young woman Nina Foch (Julia Ross), who is out of work and lagged behind her rent and is desperately looking for work. Julia reads an ad in a local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes to try to get this post. Julia gets a position and is hired by Mrs. Hughes (Dame Mae Whitty), who demands that she live with her employer in her home, and wants her not to have relationships with male friends, and Julia tells them that she has no family she is free. devote all your time to this work. George Makreedi (Ralph Hughes) - the son of Mrs. Hughes, and he has a very strange desire to play with knives. It was a low-budget film, and most of the scenes were close-ups to avoid background costs and decoration costs. This strange family lives in a huge mansion off the coast of Cornwall in England, and there are secret doors and a lot of suspense.
