This film is very interesting, and any criticism is based on personal preferences, and not on the quality of films. In addition to the usual excessive profanity in some scenes of Murphy, the film is an excellent tool for its type of humor. He has pretty good special effects and exciting action films. <br /> <br /> Murphy's character begins to search for the missing girl, which leads him to the path that others believe that he was “chosen” - - to protect the Golden Child. The boy was born as an enlightened, designed to save the world from evil forces, but whose very life is in danger if it were not for the help of Murphy and his beautiful, mysterious and mystical assistant / guide / protector. <Br /> <br /> There are also moments of philosophical lessons to challenge members of the audience who are interested in thinking about deep thoughts. One of these scenes is where the Golden Child, whom the Murphy character is supposed to protect, is being monitored by the monks of the mountain temple. An elderly monk presents a tray with decorative necklaces for a child, and the child is checked for his choice. <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy / comedy based on the idea that there are both good and evil forces in our world that most people are completely unaware of. By accepting this premise of conspiracy, we must let go of our touch on perceived everyday reality and prepare for the destruction of the earth and the walls and the revelation of the kingdom of evil, which is waiting to be destroyed. <br /> <This is a great movie, with a good storyline, a great game and, for the most part, a fairly decent dialogue, combining a serious theme with a healthy balance of martial arts and Eddie Murphy's humor.
