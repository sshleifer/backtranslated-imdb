I can not accept the negative comments of other reviewers. They are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past. I would like to see a comment from someone who has never seen Basic Instinct 1, maybe someone very young? I left the cinema feeling happy that I was not conquered by the reviewers of IMDb. 14 hours later, I'm still trying to find flaws in the conspiracy, but I can't think about anything serious. My advice to all - see for yourself and make a decision. <br /> <br /> This is similar to Basic Instinct 1, but the plot is less confusing. It still left me surprised at the end, but in a more satisfactory way. Sheron Stone is as sexy and wicked as before, and wears her very well for 48 years; it remains its defining role. David Morrisi was satisfactory, although he is not Michael Douglas. Of the cast, I especially liked David Thewlis as a police detective.
