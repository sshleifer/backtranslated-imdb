This is a good movie at 99% duration. I feel that the final has closed this film from high praise. <br /> <br /> He shot quite naive. This is clearly done in order to create a more intimidating sensation in the film - very soon the feeling of isolation becomes apparent through this shooting technique. <br /> <br /> Horrible characters are very well disassembled and are presented especially in the “crazy body”. called joe. Nevertheless, the useful (normal) characters are too pathetic for my taste - it goes without saying that they should seem pathetic, but this is done a bit OTT. <br /> <br /> The film begins slowly (and the naive work with the camera looks like a film “B”, and this is quite normal, but soon you will feel the impending cruelty that is about to happen. This is one of the most perverted against cold-blooded violence. <br /> <br /> After the sudden and incredibly lazy finale, I was left disappointed. an account of “creepy” and nail-biting scenes shot earlier in the film. <br /> Give him a watch and sorry the end!
