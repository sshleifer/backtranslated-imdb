There is no director that I like more than Mamoru Hosea. But, unfortunately, despite the fact that he shot a lot of films that have attracted a lot of attention from the international community, there are still a lot of his films that have slipped through the cracks. Tachiguishi is one of them, and although I loved him to smithereens, it is not difficult to understand why distributors in the West are reluctant to release it. <br /> <br /> Between his big and serious Oshia films. It is well known that there are several small and whimsical projects. While Tachiguishi definitely falls into this category, Oshi really surpassed himself with this one, creating something that is very difficult to classify, even as a quirky Japanese film. Go figure it out. <br /> <br /> It is based on a documentary, not quite similar to Otaku no Video. But instead of fooling the existing subculture, Oshiy invents his own and delves into the life of culinary heroes, looking for food for free and maintaining a Japanese culinary level. Hosea’s approach to this issue has close ties with Dai-Nippongjin, as there is a deadly sense of seriousness with this subject, while the images on the screen look as ridiculous as possible. Deadly humor brought to the extreme. <br /> <br /> But this is not all, instead of just shooting at his fragmentation target, Oshii decided to do this using a new visual technique of baptized super-life. A strange mix of live action, photography, digital animation and puppet sticks. It is executed and played (or put, if you will) by the great figures of the Japanese animation industry, no less, since the project was supposed to be as low as possible. <br /> <br /> And if you think that almost everything is about him, know that the film is extremely rich in dialogue, which makes it a good companion for Innocence. Influencing influences are analyzed from all kinds of cultural, political, and even philosophical points of view, shelling the audience with a continuous stream of monologues and dialogues. And even worse, the whole movie is completely based on real Japanese history and customs, which makes it even harder for a foreigner to get good control over the material. Needless to say, multiple views are recommended to get the most out of all the details hidden in the film. <br /> <br /> However, at the conceptual level, the film is easy to understand and is already quite funny. Various rafters are presented, as they are the most influential historical figures of post-war Japan. The film plays as if you expect a serious documentary about any other important figure to unfold, but for some reason, large and roughly animated limbs with photographs from which figures are assembled do not make it so serious. Embedded character set - Shinji Higuchi, who took the cake for a cow, wearing a nose ring, and a chain of fast food with his gang of bulls / people. <br /> <br /> Regular Oshi Kenji Kawai provides, besides a rather comical presentation, the score varies from atmospheric and dark to silly, weird and comical. A lot of fun can be expected from exaggerated noises and effects that complement the animation and completely contradict the key of the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is very atmospheric, although I must say that the animation is rather scarce and effective, it remains relaxed, only to occasionally flare up with hyperactive oddities. Which is not so bad, seeing how Tachiguishi is so tense for dialogue. Despite this, the film is still a visual masterpiece, as each frame looks absolutely lush and adapted to fit and improve the overall atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> But be careful, because Tachiguishi really demands a lot from the viewer. If you do not speak Japanese, you will have to read a lot, and there are many cultural references that require some attention. On top of that, the monologues in the field of cinema are quite extensive and difficult to follow. The film still lacks English subtitles, and although my French was basically enough to understand what was going on, I am sure I missed many of the film’s nuances. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is not an easy task. a film to enter, but about halfway through it reaches a full pair, and it does not release further from there. I still hope to see it again with English or Dutch submarines. The dub is actually best suited for such a movie (as “The Container”), although I think that high-quality anime dub is too much to ask for. <br /> <br /> With all this in mind, I can only congratulate Hosea on another wonderful film. It is rare to find a film that mixes and blends so many styles and influences to create something so unique and still working. The film is smart, looks and sounds great and full of creativity. It is very funny, even if you can’t catch all the details when you first view it. But be sure to at least get it with decent subtitles, since automatic translation into English is completely useless and does not justify the film at all. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi serves a very specific audience and I am not surprised that the French got their release, while the rest of Europe (and the rest of the western world) are still waiting for the mark of this film. But for those who love Oshii, he appreciates dry and ruthless humor and thirsts for creative spirit, this film should not be missed, although it may also be defiled. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
