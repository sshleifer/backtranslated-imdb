This is a great movie. I like it when Ning comes down to get ink, and the skeletons pursue him, but, fortunately, he dodged them, opened the window and didn't even notice them. Xiao Qian is also very beautiful. And when he put the needle in Ma Wu's ass, it's hysterical. and when he says that love is the greatest thing on earth, standing between two swords is great too. then also the part where he eats his buns, watching the guy killing a lot of people. then you see him sing poetry when he runs to get away from the wolves. romantic love scenes, Xiao Qian and Ning look cute together. add comic time, giant tongue, and you have horror, romance, comedy, all at once. not to mention the excellent special effects for the 90s.
