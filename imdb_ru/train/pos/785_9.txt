I come from Ireland, I really liked this film. The guy was not only hot and funny, but also sincere and honest. I loved the girl he fell in love with, she was beautiful. They were such a nice couple. The ending was so sad. I like this film! Although it is a little dirty, it resembles the British or Irish version of Prime. If you liked this movie, you should watch the premiere. The same storyline a young guy falls in love with older women, older women fall in love with young guys. Many paths intersect, in the end, the best decision is made or the task is completed. There is nothing more to say without spoiling the entire film, although I thought that the French guy was an ugly, less attractive to me. Hmm ... if you like Irish films, I would recommend Circle of Friends, this film is so good. A quick quote, you can’t get it if you don’t look at "well, this is my lunch ruined." lol
