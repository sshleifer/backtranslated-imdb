I recently watched a 54-year-old version of this film with Judy, and although I appreciated the story and the music, I found that the film could not hold my attention. I expected the remake of '76 to be the same story, except for the turn of Barbra. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern view of fame, money, love and the price of all this. This version is much more real than the 54-year version, with perhaps better music, better acting, more exciting storyline and, of course, deeper love. I do not understand why the previous film is in the top 100 of the American Film Institute, while this exciting remake cannot leave a mark on the list of critics.
