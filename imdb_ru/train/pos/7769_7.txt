Lauren Bacall survived the illness and death of Humphrey Bogart’s husband when she starred in this film. Rock Hudson was at the height of his 1950s glory. Dorothy Malone is in great shape and gets an Oscar for his support. Robert Stack is nominated and cannot cope with his role. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit intrusive from another time, but just as useful as most of the dramas. It's amazing how well drunk people can drive in this movie, as well as how quickly Stack sober up in several early episodes of the movie. <br /> <br /> You can understand why the actors are so good, and in fact this film is very good. You can say that Bacall is distracted during this film, because while her acting is good, she looks emotionally drained in some episodes. <br /> <br /> Sexual links in this film are so soft that many of today's young viewers will not realize that they are. The film does a good job telling the story, and in fact leaves a sequel that must be done at the end, although nothing has been done, although “Recorded after the wind” will be a good title.
