TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) <br /> <br /> Blake French: <br /> <br /> Over the years, viewers have seen and understood war movies from every point of view. Viewing is possible, and for some reason, producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods of depicting various soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher (“8MM”, “Time to Kill”), easily one of the most perilous directors currently working, found a resemblance to “Thin Red Line” in the way his new drama “Tiger Lands” steps on the feet of an individual soldier. This film, written by Ross Clavan and Michael McGuter, has more courage and irony than Thin Red Line or even Saving Private Ryan. Although the dramatic influence of the film has somewhat diminished due to the perversion of the material presented in this material, it undoubtedly gives us a new perspective of preparing young people for war. <br /> <br /> I would like to know the experience of Joel Schumacher in the army. Are men really so deadpan and cruel? I’m sure there are some of them, but the film looks at its uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell) who rebel against the ideas of war. His personality instantly counteracts several other characters, one of whom becomes his best friend Paxton (Matthew Davis) and the other Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose quick-tempered character often annoys Bozz’s tension with the idea of ​​going to war. The war depicted in this performance does not occur on the battlefield, but at the training ground in Louisiana between the concepts and fears of soldiers in training. This film is specifically about preparing for war, no more and no less. This ends when the soldiers finally go to war, which is disappointing, since observing the characters in action could be a benefit for the superbousers. <br /> <br /> Shot in place in about 28 days using 16mm stock and a small budget, Joel Schumacher accurately displays a dark, perverse, brutal and merciless atmosphere, using hand cinematography, unique lighting techniques and direct sound. Schumacher's grainy and blown images make the film feel like a documentary feature. This unusual style of filmmaking only contributes to the hard realism of the film, rather graphic in the use of coarse language, perhaps a little too disturbing. Waves of words of four letters are pushing the audience, some shocked by what they hear. Even the extreme degree of vulgarity does not prevent dialogue to prevail as heartbreaking, truthful and emotional. <br /> <br /> In any case, “Tigrland” gives us a small estimate of how much our soldiers are experiencing for our country in the initial stages of hostilities. Such bravery must be accepted in order to join the army during a war, knowing the difficulties and risks that they take. Such thought-provoking ideas were made possible by the heartbreaking ideas of young novice actors who depict various trainees. This film is not intended for all viewers, but one that young people should take a look at before enrolling in the army ... and adult viewers should take a look in order to appreciate the courage needed for this. <br /> <br />
