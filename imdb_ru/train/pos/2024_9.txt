I liked this mini-series. Tara Fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman hiding with her young son in a mysterious past. Like an Anglophile who loves romances ... this film was just my cup of tea, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to escape to England in the 1800s for a few hours. I should also mention that Toby Stevens, who portrays the very magnetic Gilbert Markham, is reason enough to watch this wonderful performance.
