I'm not a big fan of most anime, but Gundam Wing is really something different. Gundam Wing lacks all this stereotypical melodrama, which you can think of when you think about anime, since the number of jokes made in 17 hours will be only two-digit, Gundam Wing immediately takes over. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is a political thriller just like an action movie. Most are devoted to the diplomatic actions of the war, not just battles. Although the animation of the battle lacks extreme detail in cases where the animation would be painful, the separate fights between the gundams are almost a work of art, given the brisk use of complex mechanics and fast movements. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, this 49 episode plus one series of films was filmed by the cartoon network in 2000, and then professionally named by them. dubbing is just flawless. Not only does every spoken word match, but the use of voices really makes the characters much more believable. Many people think that it is best to watch anime with subtitles in English, but I just do not have the determination to do so. <br /> <br /> Not only are voices good, but the score for the series is impressive. I will simply say that it searches the net in vain to find the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The plot of this series is what will really catch on the audience, and no, it won't hook you like a prime time drama, such as Lost, which was created only to hook you . a deep explanation of the plot would have led to many spoilers, since many of the characters do not even have names, until a series of episodes appear in the series. The crude idea of ​​the series is that the earth and its now independent space colonies are having difficulty maintaining peace. Thus, a war begins, leading to military coups and difficult diplomatic situations. I feel that any additional detail will begin to produce information that is crucial to the plot. <br /> <br /> At the end I’ll say that this series is great for everyone who loves anime, everyone who thinks that ALL anime is stupid (they have good reasons to think so), and everyone who wants to get into anime with a serious tone to this.
