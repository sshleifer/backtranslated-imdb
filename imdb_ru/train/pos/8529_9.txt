I ran into this movie on TV and could not turn it off. Peter Sellers plays an unsightly guy who falls in love with extremely warm and sweet Goldie Hawn (who would not be?). The way Goldieâ€™s character behaves from the beginning of the film to the end is unconventional even today. This film gave me a different perspective on human relations, and it seemed to me very funny. The role of Peter Sellers was hard to sell, but I think he does it well.
