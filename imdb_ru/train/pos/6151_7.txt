I will always have a weakness for this Disney film, another of his live action / animation animations that sought to recreate the success of Mary Poppins and never achieved it. When I was in elementary school, from time to time we had a movie day, where the whole school gathered in the canteen, and the film was shown in the old manner, with a few videos and all the rest. At the time when this day came, it seemed to be a significant event, and “Poor pens and brooms” is one of the films that I remember seeing this way. <br /> <br /> And as far as I remember, this is pretty cute, Angela Lansbury never called her name with something that, at least, was not competent, and she wins here like a witch with a magic bed (boy, this can be misinterpreted, isn’t it?), who can take her and a couple of young children in magical adventures in faraway places. Come on, what child would not want such a bed? <br /> <br /> Rating: A
