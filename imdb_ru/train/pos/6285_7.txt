What is in the name? If his name is Jerry Bruckheimer, expect him to be filled with action. <br /> <br /> The latest film by producer Bruckheimer "Gone in 60 Seconds" tells about the nomenclature. With character names such as Kip, Sway and The Sphinx, as well as cars idealized under names like Diane, Sue and the elusive Eleanor, this is just a non-stop action that keeps you from wanting to just play the game with a name. <br /> <br /> The script is not too deep, but it is a great way to act, since Nicholas Cage as Memphis Rains along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Dyvall comes out of the car retirement to save his brotherâ€™s life by kidnapping a list of 50 people. exotic cars in one night. This film, a remake of the cult hit of 1974, may not have the same cult status, but it is interesting. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it is the action that makes you look, not play. Despite being busy with the stars, none of them has any outstanding performances, including the very weak performance of one of my favorite musicians, Giovanni Ribisi. Even Jolie, filming her recent victory at the Oscars, is simply a symbol of love interest with little or no screen time. <br /> <br /> Can a series of beautiful cars and racing for cars in which they participate make a great movie? I think so. It is pleasant to watch a movie, and although one particular scene takes you into the realm of improbability, the action is non-stop and the wait is irresistible. Just be careful with other drivers fighting for the pole when you leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 of 5
