This film takes place in the 1950s. Accordingly, the dead (called zombies) have arisen to eat alive. However, the company has developed a collar, which, when put on the neck of a zombie, makes them obedient and perfect servants. Robinsonâ€™s mother, Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), Papa Bill (Dylan Baker) and son Timmy (C'San Ray) hire zombies because everyone already has one in their block. Tim calls the zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and becomes friends with him. But his father hates him, and Timmy loses control of Fido, and everything goes wrong. <br /> <br /> As you can see, it is - among many other things - the take-off of the Lessi series when Fido stood up for Lessi. Timmy was named so for a reason! Each of the famous episodes of Lassie revolves here. My favorite moment is when Timmy sends Fido for help before the zombies eat him! It is also a satire from those 1950s Douglas Cirque films, where everything is bright and colorful, but dark secrets tear people apart. The characters wear VERY bright clothes of the 1950s (Moss is always in a dress) - the decor, the decor and the cars, especially the 1950s, are made in super-bright colors. Even when the script repeats, there is always something to look at. The script is good - but there are only so many Lassie jokes you can do. The melodrama is a bit silly, but the cast does. Everything here is excellent and right on target. Even Connolly as an unfeeling zombie does a good job. Moss is the best - to play every single line at any cost - but never to overdo it. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone (of course). Satire can be lost to most people, and the blood is pretty tame. The blood is made so carelessly, and when cheerful music sounds, it is difficult to take it seriously. So for some people this will really work. I give it 8.
