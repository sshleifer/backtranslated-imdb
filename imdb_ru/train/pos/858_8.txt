This film has a rotting core of flexible morality, and yet a strange sense of justice. A lot of ordinary Joe among us would like to "stick this to a MAN." "MAN" in this case is represented by several different characters. Mr. Keller, whom Carla reports in his office. Later, Paul owes 70 big to Mr. Marchand and the club owner. And there is also an officer for parole Paul. There seem to be so many questions about this last character's side story. Reviewers point to this as a weakness in a well-designed underground ping-pong game between our two protagonists, reinforcing the relationship “tit to teeth” until their lives undergo significant changes. They are indebted to every HUMAN agent. One or both can be fired, killed or imprisoned if they do not do as they are told. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film there is a sense of relief. Carla is finally laid. Her boss has to be a jerk. Mr Club owner in his bathroom. They get $ money $. And ... they don't have to worry about telling the parole officer about it, because his moral weakness leads him to hiding his wandering wife in the basement (or something else found by the police, to arrest him). This is a critical subconscious trigger to the castle that hurts us so much. Never mind that someone else can get Paul's file later to control its release; at the moment they are free! They can even get away with it! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> They are driving it to a person!
