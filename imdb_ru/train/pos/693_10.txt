This is almost an inactive film in which Jack, insomnia, passes hallucinations, visits dead friends, rushes from the building and for a long time can not distinguish reality from hallucinations. br /> <br /> Dominic Monaghan, like Jack, is really believable. Puzzled and frightened, but sluggish and sometimes indifferent to what he sees, we follow him, trying to figure out what he sees and find a way to sleep. <br /> <br /> Imagine a talking dog (another hallucination) and children who suddenly appear in Jack's bathroom and bedroom without any explanation of how they got there (more hallucinations), and you have an interesting one, stunning, 43 minutes. And the scenes in the shower are enough to make any Dom fan come back again and again.
