I have been a fan of Jodie Foster since we were both children from her age of Disney. I liked her tricks in films like Candleshoe. <br /> <br /> Foxes were such a huge departure from all this. <br /> <br /> Where other young actresses of that era turned to sex, masculinity, disguised as a comedy (“Little Favorite”, anyone?), Jody went on a depressive and tragic story about teenagers who were drawn to their deaths from - for strong charm of temptation and dependence. <br /> <br /> It was not Disney. It was not Porky. It was not "Halloweed". It was a dark and powerful story of the destruction of young lives. Unfortunately, this is a story that is still played out daily throughout the country, this film can be played (with the current soundtrack) and is still relevant. <br /> <br /> This is not the best film ever made, it is tired in some places, not all performances are especially outstanding. But Jodie Foster continued to show her charms like a real adult actor (the trend began when she was very young in Taxi Driver). <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 Barki
