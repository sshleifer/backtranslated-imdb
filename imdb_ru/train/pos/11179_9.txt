Pet Sematary successfully handles two major situations. First, it's a scary horror movie. Those that just aren't made these days. Secondly, it is an emotional, intelligent film in general. So, if you are looking for chills, fears, eeriness and visually stunning settings, great game, dialing and terrible effects; this is the movie you are looking for. Classic now and really should see any horror fan. <br /> <br /> Probably the best adaptation to any of King’s novels. The events seem a bit hasty compared to the novel, but this does not mean that this underestimated film is not a complete Horror / Drama achievement. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's novel is widely known as very emotional and terrible at the same time. The film reflects the same feeling, mainly because it has good character development, and you can feel the love relationship between its participants. Then, when everything seems to be happy (technically happy, because the name “Sematary of Pets” brings no benefit!), The tragic event changes the atmosphere of the film, now it becomes very gloomy. The film has an ominous feeling from the moment of opening credits, but after Gage is killed, the film becomes sad, gray, creepy. The fight against the loss of a little son is something that can destroy the whole life of the family, and the “Pet Graveyard” proves this convincingly. <br /> <br /> The legend of the nursery seminary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience, but sadness and despair make an emotionally destroyed father give him a chance. Unfortunately, the legend comes true, and baby Gage returns from the dead. The previous encounter with the pet legend turned out to be a tragedy, but this time it is much, much worse. What will happen to the life of our All-American family? Could Pascow prevent this tragedy? What is it with surreal nightmares? <br /> <br /> Watch the Pet Graveyard to see one of the most touching and emotional horror films of late. You will not regret. The game is very good, although I did not dig the actor who portrayed his father. He did not seem concerned enough when situations caused his despair. But this is just my opinion. Denise Crosby really performed great and worked perfectly as a noble, gentle mother. Baby Gage was awesome even on his creepy parts. * Shiver *. In general, this is a great classic of all time and an alarming film that touches the deepest fears of people ... the loss of a loved one, the return of the dead to life and a sense of despair. <br /> <br /> Something for sure ... I do not want to be buried in the nursery graveyard !!
