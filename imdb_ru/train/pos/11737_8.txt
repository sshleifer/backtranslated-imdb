OK, this movie is stupid. I mean it is a good way though. It was stupid on purpose, and was one of the best "stupid" films I've seen. The jokes and jokes are deliberately bad, but delivered in such a way that he hit me on all the right notes. Auxiliary characters were rather superficial and mediocre. There is a rather weak plot, but it works just fine. <br /> <br /> Elviraâ€™s character is in the center of attention. She is attractive and charming. Cassandra Petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this film. The top of this acting talent, she had physical qualities that were frankly amazing. Few can disagree. The pieces that demonstrate her figure were also some of the funniest scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> I had a smile from ear to ear from the first scene to the last. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for comedy lovers as well as lovers of beautiful women. I wish they had shot a dozen more films about Elvius.
