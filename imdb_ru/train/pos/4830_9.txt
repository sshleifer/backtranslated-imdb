Despite the fact that some of the reviews were obviously warm for Luke, I found the story completely exciting, and even if some critics called the love story "Mills and Boone", so what? It's nice to see a warm, touching story of true love in these cynical times. Many in the audience sniffed and secretly blurred their eyes. Do you really believe that young Victoria and Albert passionately love each other, although for political reasons it was a contractual marriage. I really felt that Sir John Conroy, who was desperately trying to control the young Queen, might be too played up like a pantomime fiend. Since it is rumored that he really was the real father of Victoria (as a result of the affair with her mother, the Duchess of Kent), it would be interesting to study this theory. Emily Blunt is perfectly convincing, like a young princess, locked in a stuffy palace with courtiers and politicians to manipulate her. She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination, which ultimately made Victoria the great Queen of England, which flourished more than ever under her long reign. I believe that word of mouth advice will provide great success for this most enjoyable and beautiful film.
