In addition to the usual stereotypes of the thirties, Eugene Pallett as a rude police detective, Jack La Rue as a "dark-skinned" Italian and, of course, James Lee as a "Chinese chef", this film is a great mystery of murder in a locked room. For the film of the beginning of the 1930s, this phased “separation of plywood secrets” is similar to the COLUMBO series, except that in this film you cannot find out in advance who the killer was.
