I had fun watching Red Eye. This is not a masterpiece, but it is well directed and structured. Killian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in this role. Yes, it's the same old story with a different setting, but Wes Craven gave her a good pace. At least one more shout with a regular college killer. It's nice when you can see a clean, consistent thriller, even if originality doesn't stand out as the main character. In particular, from such a director as Craven, who in the past brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genres, and which now simply allows you to return home what could have been a good television film if it had not been released theatrically. Good job!
