Please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie! <br /> <br /> Never before have I seen such a bold and original tale created for the screen of a large film. bold, because the script constantly made a step that many fantasy films safely avoided - a step towards something new, creative and bold. just when you think “oh, I've seen it before” or “I'm sure that this is what will happen now” - StarDust will take an unexpected turn and will involve you more and more into the story. <br /> <br /> The actors are great - even the smallest role is played with such talent that it fills me with reverence for the creators of this film. Robert De Niro is great and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in every scene he is in. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch, and Claire Danes is the perfect choice for an innocent and loving "star", Ivine. Other big names play prominent roles. I had so many beginnings that everyone is trying their best for this film. But once again, the story of Neil Guyman, all the little things that he "invented" for this universe - just outstanding. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie today in preview, the day before the official release. and hope it will be a huge success. There is so much humor, but also tense moments, as well as lovely tender scenes. A look into Yvaine's eyes, Captain Shakespeare's "frivolity", the passion of the witch Lamia is an impressive, unforgettable <br /> <br /> For me, this is the number one entertainment film of 2007, watch it and enjoy it <br /> <br /> 11 / 10 - outstanding peace and love <br /> <br />
