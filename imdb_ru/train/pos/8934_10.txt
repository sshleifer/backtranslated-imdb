In L'intrus (the Intruder) you are pursued by two things: who is the attacker, and is this a film or a dream that you are watching? The ending is so shocking that for a while you cannot find the answer to any of these questions. The offender appears as different characters, different people in different circumstances that do not belong to the scene, therefore they are excluded from it, benevolently or cruelly, but often without emotional involvement. The protagonist Louis is a despicable man. He has hard ways, some mean work and no heart. He needs one and goes after him. His heart was transplanted, and he decides to start a new life. Can this person succeed in his quest for redemption? Such a guy can cut your throat when you hit a hat. You know this, but Claire Denis does not call you to judge him. Sometimes there is a young Russian woman - a beautiful girl who seems to be living somewhere between heaven and earth - who judges him. She may even punish him. But not Denis. There is a character played by Beatrice Dalle who doesn't want to have anything to do with him: don't touch me, she says. But Denis allows this person to be himself, removes him in his passion for search. I do not know whether what she is shooting is heart or mind, but this is not the traditional basis of the plot. Whatever she takes, you get it at the end. You know who the “intruder” is, you know why, more or less, and some scenes come back to your head with their full meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
