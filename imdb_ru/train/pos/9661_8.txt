After losing an Emmy for her role as Mama Rose in the television version of GYPSY, Betty won the Emmy the following year for BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a live concert specially filmed for HBO from Las Vegas. Middler, who has been performing live on stage since the 1970s, proves that she still remains one of the brightest live performers in the business. From her introductory number, her classic “Friends”, where she comes down from the wings on top of a beautiful cloud of props, Bette runs a scene with style and charisma from a rap-style number called “I look good” and then proves that she has As a joke, like a few other performers in this business, she goes through many musical compositions. The part of the show where she greets the burlesque goes on too long, but she manages to turn on her old jokes Sophie Tucker here with a big advantage (although she actually forgets one joke in the middle of the story about it, but her commercial doesn’t remember that hysteria ). Bette also treats us to “The Twist of the Rose” from GYPSY and the title melody from her amazing movie THE ROSE, as well as a shameless stub for her popular movie “FIRST WIVES CLUB”. She brings the house closer to the end with "Stay with Me, Baby" from THE ROSE and her only No. 1 hit "Wind Under My Wings" from BEACHES. This is a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment, and for the fans of Midler it is just necessary.
