There’s really nothing to say about this movie ... it is rude but cheerful. <br /> <br /> The plot of the plot (from IMDB) <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br /> Two losers from Milwaukee Coop and Roemer (Parker & Stone) invent a new game by in basketball, using the rules of baseball. When a game becomes a huge success, they together with the help of a billionaire form the Professional Baseball League, where everyone gets the same pay, and no team can change the city. The Coop & Remer team, Milwaukee Beers, is the only team that stands in the way of major rule changes that the owner of Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to introduce. <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br />> The acting is pretty good because there are not many big stars in this film. Although I'm not a big fan of Southpark, Parker and Stone are doing a good job with their first real film. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny moments in this film that I cannot even name them all at all. He never gives up, and they don’t try to come up with some coarse drama to make it more serious. <br /> <br /> And my favorite aspect of this film is the soundtrack. It's great. I especially like "Take Me" and "Beer" from Reel Big Fish. Very underrated. <br /> <br /> In general, a rude, but very funny movie. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "The Black Wolf" Johnston
