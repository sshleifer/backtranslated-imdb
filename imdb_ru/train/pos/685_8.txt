Ghost Story (New House) - a horrible horror story. This is from the “Circle of Fear” and “Ghost Story” series of the early seventies. The beginning and end of each story is told by Sebastian Cabot. Remember him from the early family series The Family Affair of the 1960s? In this particular story, Barbara Parkins and David Byrney act as the main actors and protagonists of the story. I saw it recently, and I was so scared! Terrific, without bloody or abusive words, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played the young bride. David Byrney played her husband. Both actors were very good in their roles. If you like scary, funny, scary ghost stories, then you will love this little gem. I gave it a high mark. I highly recommend this story.
