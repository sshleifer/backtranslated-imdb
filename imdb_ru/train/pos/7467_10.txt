David Ames is a rich handsome guy who lives in New York. When his “sleeping partner” Julie Gianni is very jealous after David falls in love with Spanish beauty Sophia, she puts David in her car and tells him that he is the only guy she loves and wants to be with him, but seeing how he in love with Sophia, she decides to commit suicide with David in the car with her, leaving the bridge. David is going through a wreck, but he remains with a disfigured face. He is then charged with the murder of Julia. The fact is that David does not know what is real and what is not, because he constantly has these strange dreams (most of which are actually nightmares) and memories, some of which simply do not make sense to him. Everything will return to him soon when he begins to learn the truth. <br /> <br /> Well, there are all the stars here, including Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor, who all give good performances in the film. In the film, they all lay off different things about the characters, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. Very good. There is also a cameo from brilliant Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a well-made, excellent, interesting and original film that will make you talk a lot about it after its completion. This is not just a thriller, it is a real psychological thriller. The trailer for the film is really good, but the film is so different from how it can be decorated. It was very well directed, and there were a couple of really wonderful scenes here. In general, a nice movie, which is also worth paying attention to. Recently, they probably are shot in many films "They are dead, if not the one who is dead."
