I came across this film when I was 8-10 years old on a cold, dark November day. I played outside all day, froze, and when I arrived around 4 in the afternoon, I drank a cup of hot cocoa and sat in front of the TV with a blanket. I was surprised to see a cartoon that was not entirely happy and stupid, but dark and moral. It captured my imagination. I am sure that he skips the text and is abbreviated in all inappropriate places for a Tolkien purist. But it still reflects the spirit of the story, the choice to bear the burden for the good of others, the consequences of selfish, ill-considered decisions, etc. The quality of the animation leaves room for complaints. But the only place where this film clearly rises above new films is voice characteristics. John Hurt is great at this. If you don't like the way the character is drawn, look away and just listen to it. His voice is extraordinary. I saw it again many, many times, and it always brings me back to the time when I was a child, hungry for some kind of magical adventure. For this reason I say “lucky”, the film is nostalgic for me, so I lose sight of its shortcomings. But between John Hurt and Tolkien's fantasy, he still reached me to this day.
