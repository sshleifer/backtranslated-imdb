A magnificent production by Techicolor telling an unusual story about a romance between a woman with a strong religious faith and a Trappist monk who left his monastery, violating his vows. The film opens in a European nunnery, where a former student prays - a lonely beauty in black named Domini (Marlene Dietrich). The Insistent Mother advises her to go into the wilderness and “find herself”, and to lose her grief over her father, who recently died. In the carriage on the way to the Sahara, she sits opposite a very, very worried person (Charles Boyer) - our former monk. Soon she finds herself in a hotel near an oasis with palm trees, where she again sees our mysterious concerned man when he is confused about what to do when faced with a very seductive dancing girl. Domini made friends with him, although he knows nothing about his past - the romance will soon begin. <br /> <br /> This film is sentimental, melodramatic and different (in a sense, almost surreal and even a little picky) - I was pretty fun and interesting. The photo in this is really interesting - it is full of extreme close-ups of the face and beautiful color shots of horse caravans crossing the desert, silhouettes against the sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich gives a well-made, albeit restrained, performance and looks great. Charles Boyer - usually not one of my favorites - is actually very good at it, I think that this role suits him, and he looks quite young and beautiful. Vasily Rathbone is all right, except that he has little to do. Another great orchestral score of Max Steiner helps to support the drama - in general, a very pleasant film.
