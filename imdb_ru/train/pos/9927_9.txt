Domino is a great movie. This is a young woman named Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) who becomes a bounty hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle. She joins two fellow hunters (Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez), and the adventure begins. The script is good. Very practical and realistic with the tone of the film. The only problem I encountered in this film is that it concentrates on the different things they do, and not on the Domino character. <br /> <br /> Despite this, Keira Knightley plays very tough. She shows the right amount of anger and devotion in this performance. Mickey Rourke continues his Oscar-Worthy play in the "City of Sins" with another tough guy performance. Edgar Ramirez really does nothing, except as he speaks Spanish from time to time and looks at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi provides good support. Mo'Nick was herself, although she surprised me in one particular scene. Lucy Liu has wonderful chemistry with Kira Knightley in her scenes with her. <br /> <br /> But the best thing about the film is the direction. Tony Scott's fast-paced style really animates the film. Cinematography is one of the best I've ever seen. He takes an ordinary film and puts acid. All blacks are blacker, whites are brighter, and it has a kind of green tint. The scenes in action are exciting. <br /> <br /> GENERAL INFORMATION: If you like Sin City & Man on Fire, you will love Domino.
