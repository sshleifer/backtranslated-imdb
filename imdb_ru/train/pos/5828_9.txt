Micro telephony is a classic short stack. The guys are inept repairmen working at the radio station, and during some kind of fooling around in the radio broadcasting center, the ideal Curley imitation of “Voice of Spring” is mistaken for the real thing, which leads to a radio contract and a loud musical party. The fake performance of the quintet trio from "Lucia de L'Amamore" is particularly interesting. No doubt this is very important for fans of Stoge. <br /> <br /> Although there are signs of Curly’s poor health on his face and voice, his performance is amazing, and this is probably the last glimpse of old Curly. Some fans believe that “Bird in hand” is the last great short man Curley, but his rough voice and slow movement are too difficult to watch.
