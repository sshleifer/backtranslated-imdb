Zabriskie Point (1970): Was it particularly interesting for me on a personal level, as it happens under the same circumstances, with identical peers, in my own life ?? the countercultural movement of the late 60s - early 70s on campus and beyond. We follow two unrelated young people in separate stories that slowly weave together. One of them is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of the endless pseudo-revolutionary chatter in the classrooms and canteens of his campus, and the other is a young woman traveling to Phoenix to see her father and employer and take over institution "work. The film is FULL from the visual notations of our Italian director (Michelangelo Antonioni) about America, and, entangled, psychodelicacy of self-satisfied era, “we all know, we will change everything for the better”, the youth. What is a "revolutionary"? What does this REALLY mean? Do you dress like one and go around singing? Do you "fly under the radar", but notify you in advance of your arrival? Do you keep your plans and do you make changes without requiring the approval of the group? “Zabriskie Point” is definitely a “historical play” - full of slang, uniforms, a few surrealistic moments of the film (after all, this is the film of a man who gave us a terrific “Blow Up” of 1966) and artifacts of the era, but this is more. It presents options for a cultural revolution, and thanks to Antonioni (who seems to support her), young people are too passionate about themselves to understand what is needed for radical success. Because of this, it becomes a powerful, frightening film that applies to everyone, anytime, anywhere.
