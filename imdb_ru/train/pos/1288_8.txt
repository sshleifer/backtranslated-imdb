Preston Waters has a bad summer. Besides his birthday, nothing else looks promising. <br /> <br /> First he must share his room with his brothers, who are going to do business. They cannot do this in their rooms because they do not have enough space. He only gets $ 6 tokens for a birthday party, while others get $ 32, $ 35 or even $ 50. When one of his greeting cards arrives early, he only receives a check for 11 dollars. <br /> <br /> Going to the bank, he learns that he needs at least $ 200 to open an account. Leaving the bank, the bully steals the check. Harassment after the child nearly knocked him down (definitely his bicycle was destroyed) by a criminal named Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer). Quigley just came from a bank to give the owner $ 1,000,000 to give this guy tomorrow. Quigley begins writing a check for damages, but he manages to write his name only before the police car drives around the area. Fearing, he gives Preston a check, tells him to give it to his father to finish. <br /> <br /> That same evening, Preston tells his father that he does not want a new bike, he wants his own Room back, his home is even better. His father confines him in his room until the end of the evening. Shopping in his room Preston believes that things cannot be worse, he realizes that he forgot about the check, as he is still in the pocket of his shirt. This is empty. <br /> <br /> Using a computer, he carefully thinks about it for 1,000,000 dollars. The next day, trying to cash it in the bank, he took it to the owner, who believes that he is the person to whom he must give 1,000,000 dollars, and does so. However, he is not the same as a real man named Juice. He appears after a moment. <br /> <br /> Now three have to track down Preston. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Preston has fun buying all sorts of things. including his own house and even dating a disguised banking lady who is really an FBI agent (who is trying to track down the 3 bad guys). He invents this man by the name of Mr. McIntosh, for whom he works, and even plans to have a party for him on his birthday. <br /> <br /> But in the end, everything makes up for lost time (money runs out, bad guys get it). <br /> <br /> All in all, quite a funny movie. Miguel Ferrer plays his role very well. If you enjoyed it in another steak out, you'll love it here. He performs all sorts of evil crazy things. <br /> <br /> Rick Dyukomun (the boss of "Ghost in the car") plays a great friendly chauffeur in this film.
