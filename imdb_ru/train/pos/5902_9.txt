As a Westerner following the gaze of a different culture and tradition of marriage, I found Just Married fascinating and delightful. The idea of ​​marrying a stranger by mutual consent of parents is difficult, especially in our modern time. However, this is the case in this Hindi film. Told with humor and a fresh look, we learn about Abhay and Hrithik, who met only once and are now on the traditional five-day honeymoon. As already mentioned, in this rich age of a cell phone it is hard to believe that such an archaic custom, like an arranged marriage, still takes place. We see the embarrassment that this young couple is experiencing when they get together on their first night, and how they are trying to create a connection, even if they do not know each other. We see different views on marriage and obligations presented by other couples also on vacation: from a couple of forty years of marriage with others who are still not sure to make commitments. There is a song, witty dialogue, poignant moments, mixing and comparing new ways and traditions. Watching a movie with subtitles, of course, loses some truthfulness of the story, but it's still nice to watch it. Of course, part of the plot is a bit trivial, and the incident with the bus is a bit delayed and invented; However, in general, the film was worth watching.
