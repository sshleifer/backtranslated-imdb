Simon's carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by Mattau and Burns. You can literally hear the crack of the script. There are several films that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script. For example, the famous reunion scene could have been much duller with less quality actors. It seems that Mattau was born to play Willy Clark (of course, Oscar More in Odd Couple) and with all the little features and manners that Mattau weaves into the character (the line in which he claims that he lives with him in the city, while Lewis lives in a country that Lewis doesnâ€™t touch, is the clearest example of this) making it one of the best performances I've ever seen among actors in any role, be it comedy or drama or what something else. Period. Mattau and Burns work great together; The contrast that they portray emphasizes Simon's excellent dexterity in creating comedic conflict. This film is simply one of the must-see and requires a decent prestigious place in the pages of cinema history.
