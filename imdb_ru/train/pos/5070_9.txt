I recently searched for the recently released FLY AWAY HOME widescreen DVD and came across an interesting title I had never heard of: GRAY OWL. The fact that it was a Richard Attenborough film caught my attention (he is responsible for such beautiful films as GANDI, CHAPLIN and SHADOW). I noticed that the script was William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This “Special Edition” was full of interesting sounding material, and the price was a little less than 10 dollars - so I accidentally bought it and bought it. BLIMEY! What a beautiful movie. The stars of Pierce Brosnan in the role of Archie Gray Owl, a real life hunter in the 1930s, who loved and respected the wild lands of Canada and tried to protect them. Brosnan (who played the lead role in the James Bond film) gives a shadowed, warm and powerful presentation, as does Annie Galipo as a young woman who loves and influences his feelings towards the creatures of the earth - especially the beaver. George Fenton's excellent score (THE CRUCIBLE) and Roger Pratt's beautiful photograph greatly increase the effectiveness of the film. And the extras on this DVD are something else! Includes two shorts made in the 1930s with a real Gray Owl, as well as audio commentary on Attenborough tracks and producer Jake Eberts; 2 functions; and many other great PLUS add-ons for those who have access to a PC with DVD-ROM functions. GRAY OWL was released directly on DVD in the United States - a fact that Richard Attenborough attributes to the lack of Hollywood interest in spreading something that is not loaded with more violence and sex. This is a film that not only informs and entertains, but also makes you wonder. I had a very warm feeling at the end of the film - and a completely new love and understanding for beavers! GRAY OWL is a very good movie worth seeing! I look forward to the opportunity to share with others.
