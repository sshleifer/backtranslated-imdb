This could be one of the funniest television sitcoms that appeared in the States after the breakup of "Everybody Loves Raymond". Warburton is always cheerful, and in this complements the rest of the ensemble, brought to perfection. David Spade continues to tickle my funny bone in an incredibly unique way to deliver my lines. After the enthusiastic British series “Coupling”, I see where the creators of the Engagement Rules got their original idea, but it wasn’t intended as a “brick battle” - an absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way that is transmitted, put this particular series completely separate. But to achieve success in the new series requires not only a competent cast, especially in the very complex field of comedy. Being part of a professional comedy writing team for television for most of 7 years in Australia, I especially appreciate the role of the director and the receptive and creative talent of the film crew. One of the few complaints I have about this series is obviously "canned" laughter. Of course, the live audience could be used in the filming of the series.
