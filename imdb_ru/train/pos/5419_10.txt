This is an old fashioned adventure yarn. I understand that by today's political standards, the treatment of Indians was inadmissible. But this movement is not about politics. It is about action, dialogue, partnership, action, direction, music and photography, and this is amazing for all these factors. Grant, Fairbanks and McLaglen work together on electricity, and Jaffe is great. This is the best film about friends.
