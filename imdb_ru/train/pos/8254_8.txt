Located in a middle-class neighborhood in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with a light touch plays with such obsessive American ideas as gun mania and violence, materialism and keeping up with the johns, fear of others, slavery, golf, and deliverance from the dead. Yes, it all sounds a little hard, but believe me, it is almost as easy as a feather. <br /> <br /> Zombies are prominent among the characters. Important questions arise, such as: who will become zombies (90% of Willard's people choose this last path, while only 10% prefer traditional funerals)? Who owns how many zombies to make their bets like robots (they became a sign of social status)? And what is the range of possible relationships between the living and the reincarnated dead? <br /> <br /> Somehow director Andrew Kerry, who also co-wrote the live script (along with Robert Chomyak and Dennis Heaton), keeps this incredible material leaking for one and a half hours without a single hesitation due to the lack of good laughter . Super actors help: Carrie-Ann Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonya Bennett are the main characters who are helped by young C'San Ray in the role of Timmy, an innocent child with a kind heart, who acts as a fair witness of all the madness of adults. (Seeing her only in “Memento” and “The Matrix”, I didn’t suspect that Miss Moss had such great comedic chops.) <br /> <br /> Stage design and music are from the refined 50s. Maybe this is not for everyone. It will certainly be a tough film for my annual Bizarro award. But clever comedies, which remain ridiculous from start to finish, are among the most conquered achievements in filmmaking. In any case, for me, “Fido” is a scream! My ratings: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (When viewed Jan. 30, 2007)
