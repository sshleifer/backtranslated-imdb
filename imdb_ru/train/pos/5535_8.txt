The very first image of the film shows a mountain range in the early morning autumn fog, and I thought: “It's almost too beautiful.” And it goes like this: images of landscapes and animals that look like a series of romantic paintings, each of which is perfect in every detail. Even the girl's room, her father's car is all nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. It may seem outdated and escapist, but it corresponds to the story of the silent beauty that occurs on the border between life and fairy tale, between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince. I enjoyed every minute of it. The extreme stinginess of the film, with a simple, slow story, one actor and almost no special effects, had a strong magic effect. Therefore, I regret that this stinginess stopped at the last moments, when two additional actors suddenly appeared (a girl as an adult woman and her son). Another disadvantage is the music, which is often intrusive, like Hollywood, and sometimes inappropriate: I could not connect an English pop song with French mountain glory. I went to the movies with my two young daughters, but I recommend it to adults as well, considering that they appreciate this kind of film. Obviously, not everyone does it.
