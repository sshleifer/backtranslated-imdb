This is a great "little" movie. I say “small,” because there is no shooting in it from a hundred guns or a dozen explosions, like in the movie John Woo. Great performances by Roy Shader and the three "bad guys." John Frankenheimer seems to have been more fortunate with small productions these days. The film is very easy to watch, the story is rather a yarn than a washing machine - instead of everything around and around, it seems that with the deterioration of the plot, everything only gets worse. A wonderful ending, very positive. I have never read the book of Elmore Leonard, but it can not be very different from the film, because it seems to me that I am watching the film Elmore Leonard.
