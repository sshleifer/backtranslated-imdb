My favorite movie is "Imperialism" and one of the best action films of all time. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dominate the screen with bold and wise cracks to please everyone except the very PC from moviegoers. Memorable scenes abound - 3 sergeants and their 20 guards fighting hundreds of thugs; McChesney and Cutter give Bobby Kuta a pointy blow ("save a little for the elephant"); McChesney cutter - “I am an expedition”; Dean knocked Cutter out of prison with a fork ("What do you think I'm trying to break out of? Prison pudding?!) And an incredible scene in the temple where Cutter sings and then sounds bravely like copper." All right, you're all arrested! "<br /> <br /> I could go on, but suffice it to say that I try to catch this film when it is. It’s hard to imagine what adventurers and generals are. better than 2 hours.
