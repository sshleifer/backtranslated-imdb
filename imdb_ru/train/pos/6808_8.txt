The “cold blood” of 1967 was perhaps more like a “real thing” (think about it: would we really like to see a real thing?), But it was black and white in the world of colors, and many people didn’t even I know what it was and had the opportunity to remake it for television. Plus, if you redo it, you can show some things not shown in the original. Truman Capote's book "In Cold Blood" was the first "scientific novel." Truman's book was not really 100% true to the real story. I thought that the Canadian location was enough for Kansas in large part for a television movie. Look for elements of sex, drugs and rock and roll: Dick's grandmother, Perry is an aspirin addict, Perry plays the blues guitar.
