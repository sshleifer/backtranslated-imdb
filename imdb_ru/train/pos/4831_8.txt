I entered into this expectation of not loving it; I thought it would be terribly worthy and serious, and rather tedious and boring. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is much better, and I realized that I really enjoyed it. I don't know too much about Queen Victoria beyond what most know â€” married Albert, who died young, and she always mourned for him. Seeing the circumstances in which she grew up was amazing; in fact, I found that I wanted to see more of the story, and I think that at some point we will see a sequel. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is awesome. The sets and costumes are incredibly generous, not too tasteless and excessive. The game is top notch from all participants. In a word, it was great!
