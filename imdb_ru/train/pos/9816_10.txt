Outrage is a pretty good movie! Robert Culp was very good at the movie and was perfect for the role! It's hard to believe that this is a true story, but what can you do? When I watched it, I thought why they should do all these things. This is wrong, but they learned the lesson when they chose the wrong person! In any case, if you ever see this movie on TV, watch it, because it is good!
