... I saw it on cable in the late 1980s, since I have been a big fan of wrestling since 1986. I saw it on a VHS in a "for sale" garbage can and bought it. <br /> <br /> In 1998, I started training as a fighter after the air force and always returned to watch it, to see how it was a very accurate depiction of people involved in the fight (families and friends who were understand us, travel, broken heart), so on. ). Henry Winkler is funny and sometimes sad to watch, because no one else can understand what a brilliant creative person he is. A great way to separate himself from the character Fonz, whom he played in “Happy Days” at that time. Also, look at the cast ... William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holiday (Alice) and wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you have a chance, take a look.
