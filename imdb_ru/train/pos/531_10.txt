This film has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. I saw this film for the first time a week ago, since then I see a discovery every day, and every time I feel as excited as the first time I heard David Niven say immortal words from Sir Walter Raleigh “Pilgrimage”: < br /> <br /> Give me my clam-shell of silence, My staff of faith to walk on it, My scenario of joy, the immortal diet, My bottle of salvation, My dress of glory, the true caliber of hope; And so I will go on my pilgrimage (??) <br /> <br /> Do you know why it would be a truism to say that the lives of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressuburger are fully justified for creating such a wonderful discovery? Because they were already taken to the poets' paradise long before they made this film. <br /> <br /> I imagine that they both appeared before the court on the Day of Judgment and casually said to the angry God: I beg your pardon, sir. So you want to know what we did during our life? Well, well, you will see: we wrote directors and producers: I know where I'm going, Colonel Blimp, Red Shoes ?? Do you think this is enough, sir? It is clear that these two great artists have already fulfilled their duty to God, Nature, Muse, or whatever you call it, when they were filming "The Essence of Life and Death." The fact that other people's lives will be justified for their actions may not be obvious to everyone, despite the fact that I feel that my life would make sense if I had never done anything else to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, old-timers will be tempted to say: they no longer make films like this. They will be partly mistaken; they have not done such films in past times. <br /> <br /> I have already quoted Keats, but I will repeat his words: beauty is joy forever.
