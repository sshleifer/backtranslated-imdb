In the film Lizzy Borden's “Love crimes” (1992), Sean Young plays sandy D.A. in Atlanta. She is a loner who is too deeply involved in the case of a man (Patrick Bergin), who pretends to be a famous fashion photographer and seduces women, makes them compromising photos, and then leaves them. <br /> <br /> Naturally, this hard loner decides to enter the life of a deceiver, posing as his victim, intending to bring him to justice. They meet, they make love, and then she finds out the following: she lies on his lap, slaps her. (Note. There is a whipping scene only in the “un-rated” version of this film. In the version with an “R” rating, it is omitted, as well as in some other scenes that would make the plot clearer.) This psychological thriller includes several scenes from the female nude nature and disturbing images For example, Bergin chases one of his victims around the room, throwing fire at him for riding. <br /> <br /> As a thriller “Love Crimes” at its best, when Sean Young plays his cat and Mice play with Bergin, trying to catch him in an incriminating act. Unfortunately, the film does not end, it just stops. It's true. Director Lizzy Borden may have just exhausted the story to tell, but after 92 minutes the credits are rolling, and we are left with the mysterious “what just happened?” Perplexity. <br /> <br /> Yang's plan is played in an exciting style, but the lack of a consistent ending will be a disabling for some viewers. <br /> <br /> Dan (daneldorado) @ yahoo.com)
