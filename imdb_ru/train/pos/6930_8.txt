This is a rather unusual and unique little western made mostly original due to its history, which revolves around the unique and excellent Winchester rifle of 1873 and all those who put it at one time or another in the film. <Br /> <br /> This is basically a very interesting film that can be watched, but at the same time it is not a real western one. The film was shot in a typical 40s / 50s film for Western genres, therefore, fans of the genre should not be distracted from its unusual main premise. <br /> <br /> Because the rifle is actually the main plot feature of the film, it allows the story to follow several characters throughout the film, which, of course, are related to each other, and at the end the story makes a full circle. Without this, watching this film would be rather dirty, as the story often jumps from one dangerous incident to another, in which different characters constantly participate. It's amazing how they even managed to put Wyatt Earp in all of this. But in reality this is not a criticism. I liked that the film and its story were original and how the film seemed to move from one event to another. It gave the film a sense of adventure and fun. <br /> <br /> This is also a very beautiful film. I liked the settings used in the film, and it seems surprising that in fact it was the first western director Anthony Mann. Fortunately, he later became the director of the new westerns, which would also often play the main role in the lead role of James Stewart. <br /> <br /> It was a rather brave choice of actors - choose James Stewart as the main one. He is one of the most gentle and polite and acting actors, so the actors who play him like a cool shooter look a bit strange. But Stewart is amazingly convincing as a tough guy, and it shows how versatile and truly capable as an actor he really was. <br /> <br /> In the film there are other amazing actors who are not often associated with this genre. Shelly Winters plays the main role, and later in some small roles also famous actors Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis appear. <br /> <br /> A real western with lots of entertainment and entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
