I believe that many people rated the film not because of a lack of quality. But it did not follow the standard Hollywood formula. Some of the conflicts are not resolved. The ending is just too real for others, but the journey that rich characters and a long list of supporters offer makes you wonder and very interesting. Even the cinematography is excellent, given the urban conditions, the direction is also excellent and innovative. <br /> <br /> This is 10 in my book, this film will lead you to the normal and expected Hollywood meaning. They took a chance and did several different things. I think it worked, I deliberately try to avoid any direct references to the film, because seeing it for myself is the best answer, and not accepting someone elseâ€™s interpretation.
