Well, at the beginning it looked like “Shrek” - a loner who was constantly followed by comic relief. Then it turns into something really convincing, since the gauntlet is set. And the result is a pleasant movie in which there are moments that, I agree, are too dramatic for children (for example, Manny’s past). The assumption has obviously been developed over time, so that they can succeed in making a film with virtually no different sets (only ice caps and stones) and three characters. It is good to know that they manage to make something emotional of it. As I said, it can sometimes cause tears, so children, be careful. The real disappointment is the animation. It was not so bad as in the movies, plots or shrekah, and it shows. People are unrealistic, and we have seen the best examples of CGI before. But do not let this blur the record: as a solo album, Ice Age deserves praise. And it will bring a lot of fans, I have no doubt. Oh, yes, moments with this little mouse are priceless and stolen.
