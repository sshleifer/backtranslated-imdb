I just watched the movie and itâ€™s scary that people talking during the movie sounded just like the actors. The film had its moments, but they also fell behind and were quite sick. All this was supposed to be a farce, but as soon as you see the miserable life of people in the film, you think to yourself: "People like this are around us." All attempts to win the sympathy of the audience are broken, as the actors do one nonsense after another. On the other hand, there are excellent (and funny) insults. I think I'll wait for the video, but it was a good laugh. ATTENTION - Jerry takes off his shirt during the movie !! (not a pretty sight!)
