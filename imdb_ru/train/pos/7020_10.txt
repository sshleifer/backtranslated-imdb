* I note where there are spoilers! General Comments: If you can take a serious film, watch this. Have an open mind and you will enjoy it. Do not leave the theater, because you do not understand what is happening! The film is perfectly combined in the second half. I'll take mom to see it again when the film officially opens. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see it on the show a couple of weeks ago, when Will was going to promote the film. He was great - he spent a lot of time with the fans. Thanks for the picture, Will! About Will's performance: in many cases, when you see a film with an actor who is truly known as some other film / show, you always think of them in their current performance just as you think of them in the past. This is not the case with Will Smith in this film. I didn’t imagine Fresh Prince (laughs) when I watched this movie. He was perfectly and completely convincing in this very, very serious role. He grew very much as an actor. I think he will at least get an Oscar nod for this performance. <br /> <br /> About your character: Ben is very controversial and tormented. He is sad ... overwhelmed with guilt ... very determined, but very frightened. Very true to myself. There is a lot of depth in his character ... and somehow, Will managed to bring it to life. <br /> <br /> About Emily (Rosario): Rosario did a great job of portraying Emily, a woman lagging far behind her. taxes. She may not be the shining star Will in this film, but she was very convincing. I think that with her character there was not much work with Will. <br /> <br /> About the plot (without spoilers): I confess, I didn’t like the movie until the second half of it. I knew absolutely nothing about the film, and nothing made sense until the second part or so. But when everything coincides with time, wow. Amazingly well written and well thought out. This is a very intense film that really stays with you. <br /> <br /> You really need to watch a lot. In the theater I was in, most people cried to the end — even adult men. When you understand what Ben is doing and why, this is a very strong moment ... <br /> <br /> ******* Minor SPOILERS ***** That's why it's very difficult to talk about the plot without giving the main things. I feel that knowing too much about this film, it really destroys it. Although the film had a lot of symbolism, which I really liked. I will mention some of this here (without trying to give a lot away). <br /> <br /> - The fish that Ben kept in his hotel room. At first it makes no sense. The cinema had a lot of chatter when people realized the reality of the fish. <br /> <br /> - I hated Ben at the beginning of the movie. By the end of it, I loved him and hated him. That's how convincing Will was. I thought Ben was a huge jerk for Ezra, a blind man just trying to get into the world. Why he was so close to Ezra, it became quite clear later in the film. Wait though. Everything in this movie: wait. <br /> <br /> Ben is a fundamentally good person who has made a big mistake for which he will not forgive himself. It is still unclear to me whether he did what he did because he was trying to get rid of his own guilt, or he genuinely wanted to help people. I think this is a little of both ... I think he wanted to help people, but also get rid of his past. I love his character. You love him and hate him, because you understand that what he does is simply amazing. You hate him because of what he does with himself (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. Good job, Will.
