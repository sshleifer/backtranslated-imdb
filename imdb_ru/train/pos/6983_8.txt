I loved it, being a fan of the original series, I always wondered what the backstory would be - it could not fail to please me. I also like the fact that I didn’t recognize a single person other than Eric Stolz - it is refreshing, very similar to BSG. This introduced me to a whole host of new talents — I can't wait to start the series. Well done to Ronald D. Moore and the team - great job. Special effects, dialogue and acting were in place, and I felt emotionally connected in the storyline. I know that there are purists who are likely to disagree with my assessment, but I felt that Caprica far surpasses most of the science fiction materials created in the last decade.
