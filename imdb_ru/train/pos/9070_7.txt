It began slowly after a great animated introduction, as the director had a bunch of characters and a school setting for development. However, as soon as the bet is made, the film is gaining momentum, because it’s a race against time to see if you can eat a certain number of worms by 7 pm. On the way home we had a good opportunity to discuss some things with our son: hooligans, to help others, to think about matter when you do not want to do something. <br /> <br /> Especially it should be noted the girl who played Eric (Erk): Holly Kate Eisenberg. The director seems to sneak up on her unexpectedly, and when she is on the screen, she fascinates. She is one of those “Hey, she looks familiar,” and then I remembered that she was a little girl that Pepsi showed about 8 years ago. She was also in the film “Pauli” about a parrot that is trying to find a way home. <br /> <br /> Ms. Eisenberg appeared many times on television and in movies in 99–00, but wasn’t seen in the next few years. Now she is 14 years old and she becomes a beautiful woman. Her smile really heats up the screen. If she manages to get better roles, she can have the same good career (or better?) Than Haley Joel Osment, another three-tier child actor, but hopefully without any problems that Osment encountered in the last time. <br /> Anywhozitz, in accordance with my 8 years old Son, who had just finished reading the story, the film did not seem to follow the book very well, but was nevertheless interesting. The ending of the film looked like a big production for some sequels (“How do you eat boiled slugs? Escargot child style?”), Which might not be so bad. It was nice to take the family to the movies and not worry about language, violence or sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of the film was the respect / fear caused by the chief Mr. Berdok. (Template). Currently in films, adult authority figures are usually portrayed as jesters. While he has one particular stupid scene, he ruled the school with a steady hand. It was also nice to see how Andrea Martin gets the job.
