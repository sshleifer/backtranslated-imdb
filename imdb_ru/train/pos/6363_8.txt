I was a big fan of the show as a child, and after that it always remained in my memory as one of those memorable cartoons that mattered in the early 80s compared to previous cartoons (Heidi, Barbapapa, Il Etait and Fois l â€œHomme. .., most of which I love). I believe that other similar Japanese cartoons, released later, can not be compared with Mazinger Z, because they began to repeat the same model boringly. <br /> <br /> This novelty is perhaps one of the best features of the Mazinger Z. Another good point is its ingenuity, with so many extravagant monsters, strange devices and strange characters; in fact, we were looking forward to each new release, to find out what kind of villain or evil machine is waiting for us!
