I have to admit that this film touched me to the point where I wept. Nevertheless, I always think about things twice, and instead of writing words that would define a film as flawless and flawless, I prefer to take a closer look. <br /> <br /> First, that the first: the film has an undeniable effect on the viewer simply because it begins and continues at the slow pace of the film, which does not attempt to capture you with real scenes from 9/11. Thank you for this brilliant blow, because, unlike the Stone World Trade Center, this film, fortunately, does not focus on the attack itself, but on consequences that, like the effects of a nuclear explosion, are barely noticeable, but are nevertheless dangerous and destructive. . The psychological impact, the apparent havoc that caused Sept. 11, and the chaos that he inflicted on the American people are almost palpable in this film. I think that Binder controlled astute observation of American society after 9/11, and Sandler, in my opinion, took off from a regular comedian to a real talent who staged an Oscar-worthy performance. <br /> <br /> However: In the film “Blood Diamond”, the character Di Caprio says, and I quote: “Oh, those Americans. Always want to take care of their feelings. ” I do not want to diminish their suffering, but I would like to compare them. Since September 11, the whole world is faced with memorable monuments, memorable dates and memorable dates of September 11. Hollywood industry and writers like Safran Foer are more than allude to September 11th in their writings. Now this huge number of cultural products related to the events of September 11, turning the death of 3,000 people into the greatest tragedy of this young century. The number of books written on this topic and the number of films devoted to this topic, and I say this with all respect, undermines the importance of this atrocious crime somewhat disproportionately. <br /> <br /> The fact is this: People die every day because of unjust actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or just lost people. We have a war in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Burma and many other countries. Every day we forget about the poverty that Africans suffer from, and we tend to sympathize with them to a lesser extent than the American victims of 9/11, simply because they are black and because their lives are not so common with our Western lives. Africa has neither the money nor the capacity to honor the memory of its national tragedies like America. So, I say the following: the reason we feel more about the 3,000 victims of September 11 and their families is that we are constantly reminded of September 11. Not a day goes by without a newspaper article, film, or book that talks about September 11. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: I sympathized with Charlie Feinman, but I wasn’t sure if I had the right to feel more about him than about the Hutu, who had lost his entire family in the Rwandan civil war. <br /> <br /> Did you catch my savings?
