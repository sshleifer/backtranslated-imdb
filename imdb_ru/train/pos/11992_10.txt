Since I remember, I have loved planes and flights. Now I am in college with a private pilot license and I want to become commercial. I could never remember why I was so obsessed with this item until I came across my old Tail Spin tapes in my basement, and it struck me, that's all. My parents bought all the tapes that they had, and it was the only show that I watched as a child. I remembered the theme when I grew up, and I can still repeat it today. It's absolutely awesome, and I plan to buy a DVD soon! It really is great for kids and adults and absolutely timeless. I can't get enough of this show.
