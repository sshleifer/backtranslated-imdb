I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing films, and therefore there is only one thing that keeps me from calling “Gentleman Jim” the best boxing film ever made. This is the Robert Wise / Paul Newman film "Someone Loves Me There." This film may be number 1, but “Gentleman Jim” is close to 2. <br /> <br /> The film tells not only about James J. Corbett’s takeoff, but also about boxing at a crucial transition time. In the late 1800s, boxing withdrew from the brutal days of the rules of the naked fist to the more “gentlemanly” days of the rules in the marquis of Queensbury gloves. And the sport departed from those times when it was an illegal spectacle, and approached the time of acceptance and respectability. <br /> <br /> “Gentleman Jim” doesn't look realistic in those days. It is romantic and, yes, even a bit deceptive at times. But always amazing so. Errol Flynn is great in the role of “gentleman” Jim, who is not really a “gentleman” at all, but just a talker from a working-class family. Alexis Smith is quite adorable as a woman from the upper class, with whom he has a love / hate relationship (and we all know that, of course, love will win this match at the end). <br /> <br /> At the end of the “Gentleman Jim” of the great John L. Sullivan (whose famous line was “I can lick any person in the world”, of course ... again romanticism), he sends his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the best scenes in any sports movement ever made. Realistic? But wonderful. Hey, if you want realism, see Crazy Bull. This is a much more realistic boxing movie. But "Gentleman Jim" is much more fun.
