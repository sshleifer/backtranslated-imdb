Some films seem to be made before we are ready for them. When I watched this film, shot in 1988, in 1999, I thought I was watching O.J. The defeat of Simpson (although I have very different opinions about the innocence of people in each situation). <br /> <br /> Australian media, according to this film, devoured the event of a possible infanticide and the truth was left as an afterthought. It was scary to see scenes of invasive, swarming media hordes, ridiculous reports of half-truths and lies and disputes about the alleged merits of the cause by people at all levels of society. <br /> <br /> The description of the media as indifferent and non-understanding technical information on the case is just as awful. I would very much like the case to pay more attention to the issue of religious prejudices (the defendants are seven-day Adventists). <br /> <br /> Today, these circuses have become commonplace, but this only makes the lesson more important. /> <br /> The strip, as usual, is great, and this is the best I've ever seen of Sam Neil. Australian accents at times become a bit thick, but not incomprehensible.
