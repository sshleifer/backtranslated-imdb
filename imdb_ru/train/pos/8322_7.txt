IQ - cute romantic comedy with the participation of two great actors who seem to look good on the screen. The plot is a typical guy, unsuitable for a girl, the guy gets the format of a girl, but emphasizes that you need to love with your heart, not your mind. The addition of Albert Einstein and his group of geniuses provides excellent comic relief. Overall a good movie. Not great but ok
