A beautifully directed mix of youthful romance and Richard Linklater's Parisian travel is one of the most romantic films of the 1990s. Julie Delpy turns into one of the most interesting performances of the decade as a Parisian girl who spends a day with a stranger on the train, Ethan Hawke. The dialogue (and there is a lot of it) is sometimes winding and unnecessarily valuable, but this portrait of two young imitation lovers who have a romantic, intellectual and spiritual connection with each other is full of amazingly funny, touching and insightful moments.
