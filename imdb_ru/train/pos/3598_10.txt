Being a man who usually doesn’t like boxing movies, feeling that he’s focused only on boxing, and not on the characters themselves, this film really excited me. I liked to see how the main character Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) passes through so much in just such a short time, it was amazing for me. Michelle (Rodriguez) perfectly played with Diana, especially since this was her first acting experience, she showed real emotions and portrayed Diana wonderfully. All the actors had chemistry on the screen and made this film even more amazing. I highly recommend this film even to those who usually don’t watch boxing movies. 10/10
