This film pulls you so deeply into two main characters. I inserted it into my laptop, even without reading the cover (not to mention the reviews), and was intrigued for two hours. Two lost ships from two different worlds collide. The sexual tension between the secretary and the criminal is almost palpable even without any physical contact. By the end, I could not decide what I want more: our hero and heroine take off their capers, or simply complete their passion. RML could do without a curious plot, and a traditional 100 minutes would be enough. I'm carping though. After a series of Netflix, Blockbuster and local library films, this film restored my faith in making great films.
