This is a complex documentary that shows a lot of things about gay's early life. To express this in perspective, it was when the word “gay” was used for the homosexual revolution, and not just “gay” as a descriptor. Or is it still in use today? I believe that most of the film comes from about 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993, so it was somewhere nearby. <br /> <br /> I was touched by documentaries showing one person’s love for another for more than 20 years of age. Love expressed in such a way that there can only be true love. There are many scenes of incredible sympathy and pain, along with scenes of joy and pleasure. There are scenes of gay life and gay life. The film itself was a work of love, and I believe that it is a diamond. <br /> <br /> At least one of them will get an idea of ​​the devastating effects of AIDS. When I write this, I think about how much this film seemed to me before. The advances in medical, political, and social sciences and culture that have occurred since the appearance of this film (about 15 years ago) are astounding. However, it is obvious that in the case of AIDS itself, we have not finished yet. Gosh, I think we are not finished on all fronts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is just a damn good documentary. I would advise anyone who believes that they do not fully understand the life of gays, the problems of gays or the destruction of AIDS, to watch this film.
