I have seen this film literally more than 100 times ... it is absolutely full of fun !!! Powers Booth gives stellar performance. As a fan of such actors as William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981), I never thought that an actor could capture an “intensity” similar to Shatner and Libmann in these roles until I saw Bout in the role of Jim Jones! As far as I know, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones ... this film captured his best performance !!!
