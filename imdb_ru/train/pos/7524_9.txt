For a film that is supposedly about sex and skin, he has no right to be as strangely sweet as he is. The story of Betty Page, a good Christian girl from the south, whose mother did not allow her to meet, until she married, moved to New York and eventually became the most successful girl of her age, driven by an outstanding game from Gretchen Mall. Her page cannot quite reconcile the pictures that she accepts (no one has the right to touch, everything is fun and respectful) with the pornography of the tests and the supposed harmful effects that her images have on the world around her. <br /> <br / Since then, Page has inspired every burlesque artist, not only because she had a figure to die for, but also because she endowed each picture with an innocent sense of joy, which was both uniquely sexy and simple Rather, like this movie, in fact. Filmde, both in black and white and in great style, is a great way to spend a couple of hours.
