I started riding horses relatively recently, and as anyone who has ever ridden should know, I fell in love with horses and their world. I rented Spirit at my whim, just trying to collect as much material about horses as I could in my life, and I was surprised at the results. <br /> <br /> What I expected was a good Disney film with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes. <br /> <br /> I got an amazing film filled with beautiful landscapes and animations, as well as an amazing storyline that has great potential to warm the heart. <br /> <br /> The Spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West, whose whole world collapses around him when he discovers that people are slowly taking over his homeland. The story unfolds with a wide range of characters, some people, some animals, they are all well written, and most of them are pleasant to watch on the screen. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a good story and who appreciates history and animals. <br /> <br /> I forgot to mention one thing, but it seems important that the animals in this film do not speak. It was a really nice vacation from the “Lady and the Tramp” cartoon that everyone is used to today.
