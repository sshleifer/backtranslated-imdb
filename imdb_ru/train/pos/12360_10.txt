I loved the movie. he perfectly analyzes the Italian petty-bourgeois society, as the left of the 70s abandoned all their ideals and came to a happy agreement, which they do not want to break. For example, an aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his son and does not want to be reminded of his more radical youth. <br /> <br /> I have long wanted to buy a video after watching a movie a couple of times on the big screen and on TV, but it looks like it completely disappeared from the market, even in Italy no one in bookstores knew about the film. very sorry. <br /> <br /> One sex scene that everyone seems to be talking about does not harm the film.
