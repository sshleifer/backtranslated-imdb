I love the show! Many stereotypes depicting southerners as hits are very obvious, but such people exist too often. The image of the southern government sounds too believable, but the responsive characters are reminiscent of many good things and of the South. Some things never change, and we see the “good old guys” every day! In every southern city there is Lucas Buck, who only needs to make a phone call for everything to happen, and the storybook “By 'white trash” is too familiar. In addition to the supernatural elements, everything else may well happen in the modern South! For some reason I think that Trinity, South Carolina, must have been in Barnwell County!
