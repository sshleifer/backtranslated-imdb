Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and includes James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Covax. In this film, James Stewart and Kim Novak played the second scene on the screen (after the classic Alfred Hitchcock's Dizziness game, released earlier that year) This was the last movie of Stewart as a romantic hero, since he was considered too old at 50 to play a similar role. The film tells about the witch played by Kim Novak, who is attracted by a mortal played by James Stewart. She bewitches him and he falls deeply in love with her. I liked the film and its composition. This film had a moderate success at the time and was nominated for Golden Globe for the best comedy. Gimmeclassics
