This film is about family for me. Jimmy Morris lived his dream not only for himself, but also for his family. I can't begin to tell you how I can tell my little girl that Dad is going to Kansas City to cover up Priest Holmes and the Kansas City leaders. She would think that this is the coolest thing, as the son of Morris did. Life of a dream with a family is what this one is. I think that only a father who has a close relationship with his family can truly appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
