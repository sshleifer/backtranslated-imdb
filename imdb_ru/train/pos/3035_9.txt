“MacArthur” is an excellent film, which tells about the great man - General Douglas MacArthur. This, of course, is the story of one of America’s great military leaders and a figure I have known from the earliest moments of my memory. Although there is a problem of continuity (there may be others), for example, MacArthur’s speech, depicted in the film as his 1962 appeal to the US Military Academy about receiving the Thayer award, did not contain the phrase “old soldiers never die; they just disappear. ” (This was in his speech to Congress after his dismissal by President Truman) in 1951 for his alleged disobedience (these two did not see face to face!) The Philippines in World War II. The film moves quickly and easily with the general, his family and his staff from the beginning of World War II to the end of his career. This film will be much more important for those who are familiar with the Second World War and the war in Korea. Nevertheless, Peck’s vision of this great man, who fought the evil twins of fascism and communism and who hated war, as only a soldier can, is really remembered. "In war nothing can substitute for victory."
