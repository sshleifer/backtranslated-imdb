I really liked this movie. It really intrigued me how Deanna and Alicia became friends after such a tragedy. Alicia was just an agitated soul, and Deanna was so happy to see someone after he was shot dead. My only complaint was that at the beginning it was rather slow, and it took some time to get to the bottom of things. Other than that it was great.
