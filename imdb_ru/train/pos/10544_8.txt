Well, "The Cube" (1997), the first film by Vincenzo, was one of the most interesting and cunning ideas I've ever seen when I talked about cinema. They had only one landscape, a group of actors and a plot. Thus, what made it so special was the whole effective direction, the magnificent dialogues and the strange condition that the characters had to behave like rats in a maze. His second film, “Cypher” (2002), was entirely devoted to his story, but he wasn’t as good as Cube, but here the characters are tested again, like rats. <br /> <br /> “Nothing” is something very interesting and makes Vincenzo return to his “days of the cube”, blocking the characters again in a completely different space, and you no longer need time to play again with such characters as playing with rats in the experience room. But instead of the sci-fi thriller (even some advertising teasers and trailers seemed so erroneous), “Nothing” is a free and easy comedy that can certainly be called modern satire about our society and also about the intolerable world. lived. Once again, Vicenzo will amaze us with a great idea in such trifles. 2 actors and a dazzling white screenplay, that's all you have most of the time, and you don't need more than that. While “Cube” is a claustrophobic experience, and “Cypher” is confusing, “Nothing” is completely the opposite, but at the same time desperate. <br /> <br /> This film proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget. Of course, sometimes the film fails, but its main idea means a lot and compensates for any shortcomings. There is nothing more to say about this film, because all this is a brilliant surprise and a completely different experience that I have received in films since the time of "Cuba".
