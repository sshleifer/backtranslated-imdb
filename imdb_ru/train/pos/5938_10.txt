Another exquisite taste of what should be a superhero movie after Batman: Dead End, which simply helps stimulate our taste buds and makes us want more! This is how a real superhero movie should look and feel! Even though it is a fan-made film. Attention to detail, character and action is undoubtedly real. Despite the fact that this is a production of limited resources, it is dishonoring big budget, star, popular statements of "other" superhero films. Here, the main and secondary characters act and look like real people. Finally, Superman, who actually looks “super” and looks like a real one! Batman, as it should be, without luxurious rubber armor, molded under the gum to hide skinny builds for overbought actors who can not cope. I just want some sensible leader Warner Bros. gave the go-ahead to create the full version of this gem. I don't care if it goes to the cinema or directly to DVD, I would never get tired of watching it. Just the plot itself is worth my hard earned test for this. I hope that “widescreen” productions of Marvel & DC will look and see how a really well-made film about superheroes should look like. There will no longer be a fiasco for “Batman and Robin”, or Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these little directors and find out that there should be no reason to “reinvent” the hero for the film just to bomb theaters. Mr. Collor ... We need more directors like you!
