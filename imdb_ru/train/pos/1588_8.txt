* What I like about SPOILERS * Teen Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) moves in with her older sister Valerie (Jenny Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; but she does not know half of the strange things that will happen to her from now on, and not only with her, but with her sister, her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Mann), boyfriend Henry (Michael) Macmilian), in love Vince (Nick Zano), boyfriend Valerie Jeff (Simon Rex), first boss (then fireman, then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second boss Peter (?) Have funny bone in your body please skip this; if you only like very hard comedy, this is not for you; if you like a funny, sometimes touching show with two hot chicks that can play a major role (and with no one but the fabulous “Mary Cherry” from the TV series “Popular” Leslie Grossman is in the lead role), then what the hell are you waiting for? ? Welcome to Casa De Tyler! What I like about you (2002-2006): 8.
