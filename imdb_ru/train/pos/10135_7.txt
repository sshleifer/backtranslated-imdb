What begins as a very predictable and somewhat dismal affair is, in the end, quite amusing and interesting. The “right to die” is not very disturbing, but it more than compensates for this with the help of some outlandish scenery and excessive heat. <br /> <br /> Spoilers are here: <br /> <br /> The best credits also go to Martin Donovan’s dead presentation as one of the most disgusting characters ever depicted on the screen. Playing for a hero in a special manner, you almost feel bad because of the guy at the end, when his grandiose plan eventually fails. Corbin Bernsen also chews around, playing a not-so-nice guy who just gets his desserts. <br /> <br /> End of the Spoiler. <br /> <br /> As revenge for the “Right to Death” brings great benefits to its performers, and this is more than a normal way to spend less than an hour.
