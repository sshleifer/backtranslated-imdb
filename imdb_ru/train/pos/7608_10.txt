I eagerly watched the first episode, but did not know if I would return again after a long break. Nevertheless, I tuned in to the first episode of the 2nd series and was reconnected. This is really a great telly; innovative things like Mission Impossible in the 1960s. Characters are well rounded and expand as the series continues, they change as they adapt — some more readily than others — to their new environment, but they cleverly remain strictly in character, and yet it is more than possible to have sympathy someone you wouldn’t think you would ever feel sorry for when something really shattering happened to them. I hope that for many years “Lost” will look forward to - and I really do not mind all of this if I never get answers to all the riddles!
