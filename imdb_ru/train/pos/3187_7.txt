A few years ago, I bought several DVDs for $ 1, each with two films each. One of them had “Three Broadway Girls” (an alternative name for “The Greeks had a word for them”), and this one had “Happy Love”. This is basically a backstage musical comedy that takes place in Scotland and concerns an erroneous identity when one of the dancers rides on a millionaire's limousine. Vera Ellen - that dancer, and wow, what legs! Caesar Romero is her producer, who risks her after the departure of the first leading lady, because he thinks she is dating a millionaire whose car I just mentioned. And David Niven is the rich guy who, when looking for Faith-Ellen, is mistaken for a reporter who should interview her, but Romero stops. What I just mentioned can be confusing, but (mostly) it makes sense if you want to test your brain by watching this charming, humorous comedy with wonderful musical numbers performed by exquisite Miss Vera-Ellen. Romero may be a little insane here, but Niven gets ridiculously embarrassed everywhere. The imprint that I saw was actually quite good, considering his age and the fact that he was freely available. And Vera-Ellen does a good job with her lines, because she really isn't an actress. Therefore, I highly recommend Happy Go Lovely for movie lovers who love old-fashioned musical comedies.
