After realizing what is happening around us ... in the news ... in our homes ... a whole new world .. I remembered this show and how obsessed I was watching it every week (in my city) .. <br /> <br /> I started looking for this series .. 3 days ago .. until that moment I had no luck ... and I was shocked when I read about it and about CBS .. <br /> <br /> People, I I suppose they stopped the show because it speaks of something far ahead of our understanding of the new world ... it tried to convey a hidden message about something terrifying. Now the same people control the world. I remember, in one of the episodes, it was about ONE dollar and the pyramid with one eye ...
