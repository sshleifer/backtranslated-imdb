FLAVIA THE HERETIC - a strange record in the genre of non-exploit - an equitable image, a feminist journey and “history” when we follow Flavia on her strange journey. <br /> <br /> We start with Flavia in the monastery. She is not very happy because she does not believe in all the male-dominant “rules” and machosis of the world and escapes from the monastery with her Jewish friend Abraham. They are both eventually caught, and Flavia returns to the monastery, where she joins another "unbelieving" nun to hasten the Muslim invasion. Flavia hangs out with Muslims who capture the monastery and are "busy" with nuns in strange scenes. In the end, Islam unfolds, and Flavia is punished as a traitor to Christianity in another unusually cruel scene ... <br /> <br /> In this film there is almost everything I like to see in the film about the exploits of the 70s. - some blood, including the removal of nipples and a beautiful scene with bare legs, a bit of a decent naked body - including the necessary front, as well as a decent storyline. I will say that it is a little bit tightened, but this is not enough to miss him. I would definitely recommend this to nunsploit / fans of 70s exploits ... 8/10
