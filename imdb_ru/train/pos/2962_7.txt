Parker and Stone transfer their passionate humorous humor from their animated masterpiece to a full-length live-action movie with good results. Much of the film is Trey and Matt, who are crazy about their new toy box. The plot itself is simple: two middle guys invent a new sport, a mixture of a basketball track with baseball glasses, which becomes a national hobby. Along the way, they encounter numerous sports movie stamps and send them along with any other popular culture that comes into their field of vision. This is similar to an episode from “South Park”, with the usual machine-gun dialogue, toilet humor and a good heart. <br /> <br /> If this film has a weakness, then this communication with the team that gave us the “Airplane” and the “Naked Gun” series. This influence is clearly seen with heavy use of weak sights and the presence of a glossy and rather two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the role normally assigned to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn plays a little better by playing the corporate brand, which has been his part of the party since Bullitt and Ernest Borgnine are replayed as they can, but you have to admit that he is perfect for the role of the owner of a crazy team. /> <br /> for those who have not yet noticed, Parker and Stone seem more comfortable than rock star imitators than comics. This is manifested in the fame of the soundtrack to almost everything they create. As usual, they give a good choice, including a mandatory track on their own own ultra-pc dvd media. <br /> <br /> Diane Bachar is particularly worth mentioning, who deserves a reward for having endured the difficult task of playing Stan and the frantic guerrilla Cartman and Parker. <br /> <br /> In general, this is an entertaining comedy that is completely devoid of its potential due to too much dependence on the “Bare Weapon / Plane”. formula. Parker and Stone could have done something really brilliant (or absolutely terrible) if they got complete control over the future movie. America, either shut up these guys, or put the responsibility on them.
