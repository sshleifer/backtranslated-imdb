Barriers seem to be one of those series that were lost in the depths of ages. After his transfer in the early 80s and one replay, he sank without a trace. This is a disastrous shame. <br /> <br /> I originally watched this when it was broadcast in the southern television region on Sundays and was a classic tea viewing. Although I don't remember much about the program, some things are stuck in my head. The most noticeable were the unforgettable names. The sad flute music accompanying the escape attempt across the Eastern European border and the subsequent car accident (and this scene left me with an unchanging love for the “tails” of Mercedes models, as they used the Merc 200). Although it was not obvious from the very beginning, the riddle of the series’s mystery was in these names. <br /> <br /> The story of how a young musical student is trying to understand what actually happened when he finds out that he was adopted, there were many turns, but “Barriers” were surprisingly “childish” children's drama. Benedict Taylor was great in the role of Billy, and it was a pity that he did not do much more. <br /> <br /> It was a quality drama long awaited for the DVD release, and I hope that I will have the chance to get to know it again in the future. <br /> <br /> Favorite memories from my childhood
