“Secret Rage”, in many respects an ordinary romantic drama of the unknown (directed by Mel Ferrer), can boast of first-class principals in Colbert and Ryan; it remains mysterious, if not completely fascinating, to the very end, when the improbability overcomes the suspension of unbelief - as is often the case in this genre. But for some viewers, the highlight of the film will be the image of Vivian Vance, which features the agitated Leah - the immortal Ethel Mertz in the film "I Love Lucy." Oddly enough, Vance had very few film roles; her true home was Broadway, where (among other concerts) she did not study enough of Ethel Merman. Here she makes her winning move as a maid, subject to playing a minor role in the vile scheme; watch her hesitantly trying to brush off the smoke when she lights a hidden cigarette in the hotel’s laundry room — a crime for which she ends up paying the highest fine.
