Charming does not even begin to describe the "Salvation of Grace"; it is absolutely irresistible! Anyone who ventures on this film will leave with high spirits (haha). <br /> <br /> Grace Trevetin (Brenda Bletin) has just lost her husband, but her problems will become much worse. Her deceased left her without money and debt. Faced with the loss of everything, she must find a way to get a lot of money ... quickly! She gets the idea when her gardener Matthew (Craig Ferguson) asks a well-known gardener to give him advice on a plant that he secretly grows. Grace immediately realizes that his plant is marijuana, so they decided to use her gardening skills to grow large numbers of high-quality weeds, and then sell it to pay off their debts. <br /> <br /> The most noticeable quality about the “grace of salvation” is its appeal. Each character is extremely responsive, and, except for the first 20 or so minutes, the movie is always good. Everyone wants a happy ending for everyone, even if it means turning a blind eye to some rather illegal actions. <br /> <br /> Acting at the highest level. Brenda Bletin is one of the best British actresses, and here's why. It turns what could be a caricature into a fully living and breathing person. She is a good lady, but she is not a fool. Craig Ferguson is as friendly as Matthew. He is a loser a loser, but he is so pleasant that it does not matter. The rest of the cast is also suitable for this category, but special attention should be paid to Cheky Karyo. The French actor always has an aura of threat, and it suits him well, but he also has excellent comedic skills. <br /> <br /> Nigel Cole finds the perfect tone for Saving Grace. It's all about charm. One of the problems I face with British humor is that all the energy seems to be leaving the film. This is not the case. The film is very nice and always funny. This does not mean that “Salvation of Grace” is just a cute film that will leave you with a smile and a good feeling. Although this film is not a comedy, it boasts two or three scenes that are simply hysterical. <br /> <br /> If there are any problems with the film, then the climax is a bit confusing. The answers to the questions are still there, and the finale boasts an unexpected turn. <br /> <br /> See “The Salvation of Grace,” especially when you have a bad day.
