The origin of this film is a mystery to me, since I know as much as IMDB before I rented it. I assume that before the Star Marine, Killshot was one of the countless pilots who never went online, by cable or other means. The new name “Kill Shot” is comically added to the intro sequence, the first of many quick clues that it was never intended for the movie. The quick passages, the sweet music of “Melrose Place” and the short two-second candid shots of the main actors make it possible to understand what you are for. <br /> <br /> And I don’t mind everything. I made this film after seeing the repackaging on which Casper Van Dean and Denise Richards are on the front cover of the volleyball net, thinking that it would be fun to see them in the film, in addition to the SciFi parody from “Star Marines” (in my opinion, excellent the book is not a very hot movie - but this is another review). After studying it in IMDB, I and my roommate suggested that the pilot was delayed after the obvious success of his own career, the Troopers and Richards (see Here for links to Bond-Girl and Wild Things). They added a sex scene with a minor character in order to achieve the desired R-rating — desired in the “Rental Video” sections. In any case, they should have left it without a rating if you are trying to sell it in the / erotic porno suspense section. <br /> <br /> In general, this is interesting. But I do not want to spoil the pleasure, saying that this is a television pilot. It was the biggest thrust while watching - when you anticipate a cinematic and get a TV show, the differences between them become clearer than usual. <br /> <br /> Would I take it off again? Not. Will I watch this TV show? Well, why not - it's better than Baywatch. And their meager attempts to hit all the demographics would have succeeded in the mid-90s. The black guy (who is gay to avoid the TV taboo on interracial dating), Asian Asian (Japanese, on behalf of Kouji, I guess) is more skilled in science and computers than talking to women, a handsome, intelligent Latin preschooler who is goes to her, except for her family’s bank account - this show would probably be good. <br /> <br /> But like a movie, it just amazes me. <br /> <br /> I gave him 7 points out of 10, given that it was and that he was forced to become. It made for a very pleasant evening, and that is all I ask for a rental.
