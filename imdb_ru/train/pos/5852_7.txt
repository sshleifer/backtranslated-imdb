It was the first PPV in the new era for WWE when Hulk Hogan, the Ultimate Warrior, Rick Flair and Sherry Martel left. Need to push the new crop of talents. And it all started with Lex Luger, the former NWA heavyweight champion of the world, who won the title fight against Yokozuna. Lex traveled throughout the United States on the Lex Express bus to inspire Americans to rally behind him in his quest to defeat the Japanese monster (who was actually Samoan) and bring the WWE Championship back to American hands. Thus, there were many expectations in this match. <br /> <br /> But every good PPV needs an undercard, and there were some good things about it. <br /> <br /> The night began with the razor Ramon defeated Ted DiBias in a good match. The story is that DiBiase chose Ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after losing a shock for a 1-2-3 Kid in RAW in July. Annoyed, Ramon teamed up with a 1-2-3 Kid team against the Money Inc tag team of Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster. To settle their differences, they were both given DiBiase vs. Ramon and Shyster vs. The Kid fights. Razor was able to settle his side of the deal after hitting the Razor's Edge. <br /> <br /> Then came the Steiner Brothers, who put the WWE team title on the line against the heavenly bodies. Despite the intervention of the manager of The Body, Jim Cornett, who hit Scott Steiner in the throat with a tennis racket, they were able to snatch victory in a decent match. <br /> <br /> Sean Michaels and Mr. Perfect Fought with Wrestlemania IX when Sean Michaels faced Perfect after his defeat by Lex Luger. Perfection then cost Michaels the Intercontinental Championship when he distracted him in a title match against Marty Janetti. Michaels won the title again and put him on the edge against Mr. Perfect, but now Michaels had a strong ally in his corner in his 7-foot bodyguard Diesel. Micheals and Perfect had a great match, but it was Diesel that proved the difference by pulling Perfect out of the ring and throwing it in steel steps so that Sean could win by counting. <br /> <br /> Irwin R Schister took revenge for the loss of his partner in the tag team early in the evening, easily explaining that he was a 1-2-3 child. <br /> <br /> Then came one of the main matches of the evening, when Bret Hart was preparing for a battle with Jerry. Lawler for the title of undisputed king of WWE. But Lawler spoke out with crutches, saying that he had been injured in a car accident earlier that day, and that he had appointed another opponent for Hart: Doink the Clown. Hart and Doinka had a fair match that Hart won with a sniper. Then he jumped from behind Lawler. It bought WWE President Jack Tanney into the ring, who told Lawler that he would get a life ban if he didn't fight Hart. Hart then destroyed Lawler, defeating a sniper, but Hart refused to let go of the hold, and the referee reversed his decision. So after all this, Lawler was named the undisputed king of WWE. Following this match, Ludwig Borda destroyed Marty Janetti in a short match. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker ended his long rivalry with Harvey Wippleman, which began in 1992, when the Undertaker defeated Wippleman Kamala’s client at Summerslam and continued when Wippleman’s last monster, Giant Gonzalez, destroyed Tucker in “Rumble” and then again in Wrestlemania, a decisive victory over Gonzalez here. Then Gonzalez turned on Wippleman, strangling him after an unsuccessful match. <br /> <br /> Then it was time for action with six men, when the Smoking Gunnas (Bart and Billy) and Tatanka defeated the Kills Head (Samu and Fatu) and Bam Bam Bigelow with Tatanka, pinned to Sam. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the main event with Yokozuna, surrounded by Jim Cornett and Mr. Fuji, putting the WWE title on the line against Lex Luger, and it was all on board. Lex Express. Lex went on the attack, but Yokozuna took control. Lex came back, though, as he avoided the fall of the banzai, and then hit Yokodzun's body before knocking him out of the ring. Luger then attacked Cornett and Fuji when Yokodzuna was counted. Luger won a wonderful match !!!!! Balloons fell from the ceiling. All the characters came to congratulate him on his victory. Yokozuna may have retained the title, but Luger proved that he could be defeated. The only question was who could beat him in the ring and take the title off him?
