It will be somewhat short. First, do not listen to critics, as this is not as bad as many say !! The sniper uses the classic formula of the film, which many immediately consider unfair. Although the sniper does not reflect the 100% truth about how military snipers work in our country, it gives those who know nothing about the professional sniper the opportunity to look into the world of snipers. And yes, the film has many flaws, but which film does not have? There are a lot of good scenes and a good acting game by Tom Berenger. I have to say that the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with Billy Zane in the Helicopter, accompanied by Zane in the Marin bar scene. The best scene in the Sniper - with Berenger in the center of the field, where the opposing force captures him !! There are also many good jungle shots and some classic shots using the camera, as if you were looking at the scope. And yes, the motto "Sniper" is "one shot, one kill". Judge Sniper for yourself !! <br /> <br />
