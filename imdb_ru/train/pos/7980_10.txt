A man on fire tells the story of a former special forces guy with the problem of alcoholism, who gets a job as the personal bodyguard of a little girl in Mexico during a wave of abductions for ransom. At first he is not friendly, but then they are friendly, he decides to quit drinking, etc., D., Etc. D. ... then one day she is kidnapped ... and killed ... <br /> <br /> AND HE I will stop at nothing to get revenge. <br /> <br /> This is basically a story of Man On Fire, but at least a few big turns, including the final, which is beautiful and will probably make you cry. <br /> <br /> This is also due to the great music of Harry-Gregson Williams with Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator). <br /> <br /> But the strongest part of the film ... wait .. The fact is that everything is perfect here. <br /> <br /> First - do it. Denzel Washington is at his best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken are, as always, good, wonderful Radta Mitchell and amazing young Dakota Fanning. And this is not the end of the list ... <br /> <br /> And then came dazzling cinematography, which, along with a great installation, was sure to get an Oscar. <br /> <br /> History is ... not just a film of revenge. The story is smart, the story makes you think ... and pure is beautiful. Really. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that you need to watch in life, at least once!
