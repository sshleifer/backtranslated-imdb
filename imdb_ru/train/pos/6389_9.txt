“Passing Stones” is definitely one of the best independent comedy films. You must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy it. This film for some reason did not receive proper evaluation. First, let's start with the storyline, everyone loves a good treasure hunt. When the dead father leaves letters with tips about hidden treasures, he not only unites two families, but also begins a whirlwind adventure. Mix Polish translator, mother-comatose mother, dizziness with turret syndrome, perverted homosexual hypnotist and one wolf cub - money not only makes the world go round, but also turns the family into enemies. My favorite character in this film was to be a sister / crack cracker with turret syndrome, her sudden blast would make you cry and imitate for weeks.
