This film took my breath in some moments, I just liked it! <br /> <br /> I admit that the character dialogues and storyline could be a little better, but it's just a (short) story about a couple of guys trying to kill a dragon, there's nothing more to it! <br /> <br /> The overall design, the atmosphere, the beautiful scenery ... itâ€™s all just magical! <br /> <br /> They put a lot of love into this movie. Character design was great and fun. Little Tim Burton if you want. I can recommend this film to anyone interested in great design, presented in a simple, small but beautiful story.
