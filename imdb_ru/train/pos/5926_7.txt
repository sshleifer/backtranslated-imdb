Lunatics are creatures that completely survive the life force of humans in order to survive ... but they can only use virgins (it doesn't explain why). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one of those who need to feed his mother Mary (Alice Krieg). He goes for a nice Tanya (Madchen Amick). Can she escape? <br /> <br /> On the one hand, this is a BIG horror movie. Fast paced, lots of blood and gore, good sense of humor. There are many humorous references to horror lovers (Castle Rock is mentioned once). Krause is also great (who would have thought that he could act after “Returning to the Blue Lagoon”), as well as Kirge and Amik. But I find this film annoying. <br /> <br /> He was written for the screen by Stephen King, and he is incredibly vague. Lunatics are never fully explained. Where are they from? Why are they so called? Why should a son feed a mother? Why do cats hate them and kill them? What are their strengths in the end (once Krause makes the car disappear And change color and style!)? Why should they feed on the life force of people? Why should it be only virgins? Why does son have sex with his mom? None of this is explained, leaving the story confusing. This is really very bad, because if you leave these questions aside, this is a great horror movie. Great makeup and special effects too. <br /> <br /> Fast, bloody and very fun. If only the script was better. A rather frank sex scene between Krause and Krieg was also edited to get a R. rating. I can only give 7.
