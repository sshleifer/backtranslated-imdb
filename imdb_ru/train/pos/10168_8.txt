Look, this is Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in a movie about a dead girl chasing a new girl. This is Gabrielle from “Desperate Housewives” and the guy who wore “sex cologne” in “Lead”. If you are expecting a Golden Globe nominated film, you need to rethink how you watch movies. However, if you are ready to suspend reality for 90 minutes and see a funny movie, you have come to the right place. All characters are funny. They work together very well. The real match is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He is just as funny as Friends, and she was funny and good looking at the same time. I went with my wife, she liked it, and so did I.
