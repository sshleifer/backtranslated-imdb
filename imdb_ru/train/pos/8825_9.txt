This nominee for the 2004 Oscar is a very short b / w movie in Spanish. A young woman walks into a cafe, takes a coffee and notices a couple of musicians standing silently with their instruments. All visitors are motionless, like mannequins. One guy, however, is quite cheerful and breaks into a song about what is happening at 7:35 in the morning. Ahead of one amazing moment after another, which is very surprising. People, place, everything looks pretty ordinary. Like the musical play Bolero, it continues to evolve to a climax. With its structure, theme, movement and wit, this is an 8-minute masterpiece.
