I was taken to this film by a friend and skeptical of the Swedish film with subtitles. However, I really enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film. The unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was depicted confidently, without overwhelming images - although animal lovers might have to cover their eyes for a short couple of seconds somewhere in the first 10 minutes. The traditional story of humility against cruelty and hope against tragedy has been illustrated from a rather new point of view using a spectrum of characters with very natural flaws and features. I especially liked how the film reveals many aspects of hypocritical human behavior relating to bias, discrimination and sanctimonious pretense. The absolute jewel of the film, which I will promote to all who will listen.
