Not surprisingly, screenwriter / director Michael Powell considered The Matter of Life and Death as his fascinating fantasy of 1963 with Emeric Pressburger as his favorite movie together. Released after World War II, this colorful, romantic adventure would only provide a tonic for a traumatized, recovering nation in need of a good lift. <br /> <br /> After a series of other films about the patriotic war, the Archers made him the most bizarre, capricious, and most patriotic of all. He is truly British to support British heritage (Shakespeare, beer, fair play, good manners), he is also markedly Americanized in his compositions in the Baroque style, technical ingenuity and beautiful multi-ethnic composition. <br /> <br /> Strangely repeating another 1946 Classic, “This is a wonderful life,” AMOLAD opens in a large firmament, with one of those funny voice-over voices preaching about earth and heaven, and how big, wonderful world we live in. <br /> <br /> Then he cuts through the inside of the British cockpit, is very impressed, caught fire, and the co-pilot is already dead. It sounds wrong, but soon the connection becomes clear with subsequent events. <br /> <br /> Almost 5 minutes takes place, the rapid exchange between the British pilot Peter (David Niven) and the American radio contact in June (Kim Hunter) is breathtaking in its closeness. Having reconciled with the fact that he died, Peter, nevertheless, exhausts a lot of energy, charm and outpouring, and his warm connection with June ends with the mutual exchange of the words "I love you." <br /> <br /> Without looking up from the magic of the moment, Peter, under the supervision of his Explorer 71, whose task was to bring him to the "Other World", escapes from death and finds himself aground on the beach. Later, he meets June on a bicycle and instantly picks up the body with his voice. <br /> <br /> But, realizing his mistake, the Supreme Court wants Peter to send back, and ordered the French conductor (Maurice Goring) to go down to earth to take it. But Peter is adamant about life because of June and the mistakes of the Conductor and deliberately guarded his corner. <br /> <br /> The fate of Peter ultimately depends on the court of heaven and the American prosecutor (Raymond Massey), whose jury consists of several deceased war heroes and smart British delegates. The surreal process, which turns from black and white to rich "Technicolor" after the announcement of the sentence, may well be a dream, but the last shot at the hospital confirms the predictable result. <br /> <br /> Annotation, filling the frame “stairs to the sky” (the American name of the film) is used twice: for the first time in b / w, when he raises Peter and his mysterious French guardian upwards, crossing the giant statues of potential lawyers for Peter proceedings including Abraham Lincoln and Plato. The second time the color staircase with soft lighting gives an idea of ​​what is a symbolic image in the cinema - Peter and June froze side by side, their astonished eyes are fixed forward in the frame, their fate is predetermined. <br /> <br /> The unlikely attachment of Peter and June never becomes tender or verbose; he is treated with generosity and the feeling that the couple is already sufficiently suited for marriage, and they just need to convince people of their love so that they can keep them together. <br /> <br /> A French conductor who can freeze people's time and bodies imposes many of their key moments together, giving Peter’s lectures on history and among his tricks, squeezing Peter’s book The Top 100 Gaming Tricks and His Coffee Cup. <br /> <br /> Visually inspired, like Powell / Pressburger's other collaborations, was this the first time they combined color with b / w ?? the latter has a cheerful quality when used for heavenly scenes, and both are equally adorable. <br /> <br /> An outstanding script more than corresponds to the creative design of the scenery, with a dialogue that sounds so fast that it seems that it was not written or made for the screen. Funny and witty, the essay of Powell / Pressburger deserves equal approval from his strong point in color and composition. <br /> <br /> Made in 1946, “The Question of Life and Death” is one of those films that challenges its age, looking fresh and inventive, even at an age when CGI enhances its artificial effects, probably depriving them of an emotional miracle. <br /> <br /> Other unexpected changes include the need to reduce average seconds for cutting and the inevitable call for reducing dialogue so that it can maintain a low concentration of attention from most audiences. Powell weaves a spell that subconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame, giving him the freedom to experiment with images, without changing the logical development of Peter's position.
