I took the film without a cover and did not even know what it was, but when I watched it, I laughed so much. Now this is one of my favorite films of all time. Grow up and the guys have created a masterpiece, I highly recommend this film to anyone with a sense of humor. Thank you, Rusty, that gave us something to laugh.
