The novel transcends easily, and the best parts of the film are direct translations from what Green wrote; for example, the quiet but dark humor that bursts into scenes with Boyer and Lorre, or the obsession with a murdered child that captures part of the plot. Where the film deviates from the novel, it tends to be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> However, I donâ€™t want to assume that the film is bad anyway. It always looks the part, and the story stays in the mind, like a good one. Some of the minor characters were actors who could turn a hand to everything. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the film is not available on DVD.
