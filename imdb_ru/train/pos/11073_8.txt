I never knew about a movie that would have caused such controversy in my life. Believe me, when I say that this film will eventually be remembered as a classic for all times. I waited in anticipation of this film, because I used to like Lock, Stock .... and Snatch, but after some negative reviews I thought that I would be very disappointed. I really liked this movie and I can't wait to see it again. This film is completely different from both the aforementioned Richie films, and also much better. I have a selection of favorite directors, but not one of them has done such a wonderful job as Guy Ritchie has just done with this film. I believe that he raised the film industry to another level (I know that most people will laugh at this comment, which controls the reaction to this film, but I believe that time will prove that I am right). This film is very confusing and lasts much longer than 2 hours or so, since I could not stop thinking about it or trying to put things together. Now I have a pretty good idea of ​​everything that happens in this film (some answers from endless hours of reflection, some answers from reading other people's films), and now I can’t wait for Sunday when I see it again. I just hope that people go to the movies with an open mind, and I hope they will be rewarded, like me and many others.
