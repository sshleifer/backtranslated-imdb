I saw it in cinemas and absolutely adored it. Geoffery Rush has shown himself to be a super villain I've ever seen since the days of Gene Hackman as Lex Luther. Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens were a girlfriend in heaven. This film also introduced me to William Macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was great in the role of Blue Raji, and I especially liked that this character was not British. The scene with him and his mom saying that he is a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes. I liked the fact that The Bowler spoke with the ball. Some of the funniest things were the false anger of Stiller and his character Mr. Fourius, and the fact that all his threats and cues were meaningless and that they never had any meaning. I could barely stop the applause when he said “factionalist, Freinken-kit”. But one of the things that I liked the most was that Captain Awesome really dies in the film. I STRONGLY recommend this film for any occasion, and I give it my own thumb up.
