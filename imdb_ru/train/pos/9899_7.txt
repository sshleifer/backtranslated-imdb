I saw Slaughter High several times over the years, and I always found that it was a nice slasher with a strange sense of humor, but I never knew that it was filmed in the UK, and I never knew that the actor who plays Marty Ranzen ( Simon Scaddamore) committed suicide after the film. Probably, I noticed while watching last night that the phrases of the actors seem rather strange to Americans, and some of them are not very good at hiding their English accents. <br /> <br /> Still, apart from this, this is a story about Marty’s cool nerd, who is a joke from his classmates, and on one particular day, on April Fool’s Day, one girl, Caroline Munroe, lures him into the dressing room (yes plays a teenager and humiliates big time on tape. Of course, the trainer catches the gang at work, and they are all given an energetic workout to punish them, but not before a couple of guys break Marty's joint, which he is trying to smoke in the chemical laboratory, but he is full of something that makes him sick, and when he runs to the toilet, one of his classmates slips and puts a chemical that reacts with something that mixes Marty, causing a fire and a bottle of nitric acid that leaves poor Marty burned and badly injured. <br /> <br /> Ten years later, the same gang is sent to reunite its class in the good old Doddsville, which seems strangely boarded up and inaccessible, but thanks to ingenuity they manage to penetrate and find a place that seems to be abandoned ... besides that there is a room where the banquet and liquor are distributed, and, of course, they eat, drink and have fun. Soon they will die, of course. <br /> <br /> The gang is pursued by a figure in a jester's mask, but can it be Marty? They do not know, they believe that he is either in an asylum, or working for IBM, but they are not sure which one. But whoever it is, he quickly copes with them. Especially unpleasant is the girl who takes a bath to wash off the blood from one of her classmates, whose insides burst all over her head when he drank poisoned beer. She became a victim of an acid bath, which, I think, was one of the parts originally cut out in the tape version, because it seemed especially unpleasant to me when I watched it this time. I could be wrong, but I believe that it was not on the tape. <br /> <br /> In any case, there is some end of the twist, which also contains frames that are not on the tape, I suppose. In the beginning there was also a bit of frontal nudity, which was also excised, but besides that I didn’t really notice if there were other fragments in this uncut version, perhaps so, but I’ve seen it for a long time <. br /> <br /> In any case, if you are a fan of slash movies of the 80s, then launch a new DVD release, because this is a funny little slasher with a good atmosphere and a feeling for it. 7 out of 10.
