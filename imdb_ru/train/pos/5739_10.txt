Ray Liotta and Tom Hulse shine in this beautiful example of fraternal love and dedication. Hewles plays Dominic (Nicky), a young man with mild mental disabilities who teaches his younger twin brother Liotta, who plays Eugene for 12 minutes, in medical school. He is in Baltimore and deals with the rivalry between brothers and sisters, the inextricable bond of twins, child abuse and good, always defeating evil. It is fascinating and filled with laughter and tears. If you have not seen this film, please rent it, I promise you will be surprised at how such a wonderful film can go unnoticed.
