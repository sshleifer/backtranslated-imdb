This is something new. <br /> <br /> This is a coup d'état, and a couple of Irish documentary directors are right there. <br /> <br /> A democratically elected president who uses his power to bring the literacy of his people and encourages him to read the constitution to slander the private media openly as a dictator, mentally unbalanced, new Hitler, etc. without consequences by governments (as, say, silencing them with bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods). ). Yes, and they still claim to be suppressed, of course. <br /> <br /> See how the media gloat over their role in the coup d'état after they overthrew the government with the help of Rouge. generals (how much dumber can you get ??). <br /> <br /> And see how the people of Venezuela go to the palace, holding the constitution in their hands, and restore their elected government. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a Hollywood tale, but it really happened, contrary to the obvious wishes of the United States. The documentary is a historic masterpiece shot in the center of events, sharp and completely awkward for the main supporters of the coup: the good, democratic, freedom-loving, benevolent USA (who still send large sums of money to Chávez’s political opponents). ). <br /> <br /> Also very interesting and exciting. 10 points.
