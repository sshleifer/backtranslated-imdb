I read one commentary in which this film was called “rubbish” and “waste of time”. I think this man has pulled his political underpants too hard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I just rented both the Yellow and Blue Criterion DVDs. <br /> <br /> These films, although hardly great, are at least of historical interest as the so-called “radical student <br /> <br /> political and social movement” of recent times. “60s. <br /> <br /> I didn’t see any pictures, and from their notorious reputation, I <br /> <br /> was expecting some real porn (there wasn’t any.) there is a frontal <br /> Nude nature (including male bare breasts in the frontal leg (NC / 17 automatically <br /> <br /> - Orwellian-X) in the USA. But I didn’t expect films <br /> <br /> Democratic Socialist message in your face. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it tends to be simplified, I thought that it sometimes underlined its position. Both films sometimes made me laugh out loud <br /> <br /> and comment director yes l understand that the movie had a lot of parodies <br /> <br /> osedly "pornographic" sex <br /> <br /> the scene. The first such scene is very realistic. The first couple <br /> <br /> is clumsy, inept, funny and sweet on her first mating scene. <br /> <br /> The second one that caused the most complaints faked <br /> <br /> Cunnilingus and fellatio. And finally, the end of a fierce fight, believable < br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Add-ons include an informative introduction to the film, <br /> <br /> an interview with the original American distributor and his attorney, <br /> <br /> excerpts from court testimony in the US, and “diary” <br /> <br /> director's comment about some scenes. <br /> <br /> This is a film that “blue noses” would not have left alone and led to a <br /> <br /> key “negative interest” without a standard for the social value of redemption. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it still stands. <br /> <br /> Those who are interested in the quirks of history will deem this mandatory. <br /> <br />
