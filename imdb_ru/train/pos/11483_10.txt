What makes this film so scary is that Andre and Calvin are depicted in it (relatively) normal guys. These are definitely not the people who want to become professional directors, because they mess around in front of the camera, forget the scripts, etc. They only make videos in the form of a diary to show to the “survivors” how normal their life was. Their parents just think that the guys are shooting for a family home video. By studying the attacks of other children on their schools, Andre and Calvin learn what they shouldn’t do and inform (usually the stupid “This Old House”) any potential “Andres and Calvin” who can watch this video on how to make bombs, get Weapon and do not get caught in front of the zero day (day of attack).
