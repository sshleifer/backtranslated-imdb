Nicholas Roag’s designs are variable, if not more, but never less interesting. “Insignificance” is, first of all, an adapted scenario: it is verbose and largely “limited”. BUT, you should watch this film more than once: the main themes are not presented openly, and, moreover, it takes time to adjust to the juxtaposition and change of roles of the four main characters: Einstein, McCarthy, Munro and DiMaggio, <br /> > Einstein is embroiled in Hiroshima’s guilt, but he likes the simplicity of having sex with Munro; Munro feels sick of being perceived as a crank, and he craves intellectual trust; Senator McCarthy is at the peak of his witch-hunting abilities, but an impotent scumbag; DiMaggio is not sure of his celebrity, obsessed and prone to violence. Each one contains the seeds of its own destruction. Each character has a turbulent, offended / abusive past and a dubious future. Gradually, we see that obsession itself is a central theme. America’s obsession with its post-war cultural icons and mores; obsession of the main characters with something that no one can have: peace of mind and / or happiness. <br /> <br /> Compared with the theory of relativity, the proposed single field theory and, in fact, the cosmos itself, all the aspirations and interactions of the main characters of Roag seem insignificant. However, these aspects of the physical universe (these are all quanta, believe me!) Affect us when they are used to develop the means to destroy us. Monroe’s mention of the principle underlying the neutron bomb (not calling it one) is not in itself an anachronism, but can only be understood by a modern audience. Indeed, ALL references in the script are available only to a knowledgeable viewer: one case with the events of the 50s / personality cults and their influence on us in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> This film and its script is either very, very smart, or extremely opaque and pretentious. Ultimately, however, probably insignificant. <br /> <br /> live long and flourish :) <br /> <br />
