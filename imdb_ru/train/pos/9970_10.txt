The brilliant use of overpriced technician illustrates the optimistic extremes of modern Christmas ceremonies. The element of voyeurism during the scenes (Santa and Pedro summarize the behavior of society, peering through the telescope) is unique (and, obviously, Jean-Luc Godard, although thin, stole this topic in his film “Piero le Fou”). Highly recommended!
