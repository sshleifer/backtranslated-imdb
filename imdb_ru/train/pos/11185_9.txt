Since this is one of the most beloved novels, I was very excited to see this step. I was not disappointed! Yes, of course, there are a few things I could choose, but I think the film was true to the book and was a really good movie. It seems that Stephen King's films basically get a bad review, but this is one of the good ones. It's such a dark story, which I think is why I like it ... and what's better than the revived dead ... and something about the animals returning from the grave is also rather creepy. If you've seen the movie, do yourself a huge favor, and now read the book !! This is a well-written script, the actors could do better (I say this only for Rachel and Ellie ... she was such a hooligan). true with romance.
