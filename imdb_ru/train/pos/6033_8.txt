I would just like to state that this can be biased, since I am the producer of the film. However, I will maintain self-esteem. <br /> <br /> The film's star, Oscar Ovis, gives a stellar performance in the role of Jeff Grinderlin, an ugly hypochondriac who spends more time worrying than living. He brings a certain character to his character, which really allows the audience to connect with him, often expressing his opinion and a sense of harsh comedy. His mother, played by Christina Haber, is a constant reference beam, without which he would fall on herself. His friends also help in Jeff's life, often making choices for him, rather than letting him use his free will ... which he often ignores, one way or another. <br /> <br /> Writing is superb, and conversations run like scenes from a Kevin Smith movie, with half as many Ben Affleck festivals. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera a bit In some moments, this is a crappy sound, and the sound can also enhance the sound, but its performance illuminates small details. It is also supported by a beautiful soundtrack with local talents and an exceptional composer. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a pleasure. Rare gem, among many gems.
