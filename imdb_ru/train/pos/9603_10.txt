I have one word for this movie, WOW! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. People in the theater wept. This film shows the difficulties that Darius suffers from muscular dystrophy. The film was very well made and really made you part of the film, I was so emotionally moved by the film because it made us remember that we were very lucky to be completely healthy, some people in this world are less fortunate than we are. And sometimes we have to give them help and help them to the very end. I would give them ten stars, they gave Darius when they were not asked, they did not do it for money, they did it for a needy friend, Darius, the world should know, Darius went west.
