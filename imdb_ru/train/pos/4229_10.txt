Do not waste time reading my review. Go outside and watch this surprisingly good episode, which is quite possibly the best Colombo ever written! Ruth Gordon beautifully played an intriguing but charming mysterious writer who kills her son-in-law in order to avenge the murder of her daughter. Colombo is his usual battered, confused and much smarter than he seems, and this particular episode shows the fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically, it was not written by the proclaimed creators Levinson or Link, but perhaps this is Columboâ€™s most dense, most original and perverted plot. Completely satisfying in almost every department and overflowing with silly and witty dialogue and thinking. Really unexpected and resourceful climax surpasses everything. 10/10 ... look it up on Netflix!
