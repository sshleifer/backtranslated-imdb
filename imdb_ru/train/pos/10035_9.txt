I think James Cameron may be my favorite director because this is my second review of his films. In any case, everyone remembers RMS Titanic. It was big, fast and "unsinkable" ... until April 1912. It was in all the news and one of the biggest tragedies in history. Well, James Cameron decided to make a film out of him, but instead of two ships, two fictional characters were in the spotlight. Well, to the main review, but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact, and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film. <br /> <br /> So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They are not too annoying, but look at this and you will understand why they can become annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). I think that the main villain is failure, fate, the hand of God (not blasphemy), or simply Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what do you get ?! Oh yeah! We get a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting characters are as follows: my personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber) (he seems so nice), Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Evan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), captain Smith (Bernard Hill) Molly Brown Kathy Bates) and many others. We also have a real treasure hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action here is amazing, especially in the second half, the drama is also good. In the end, your eyes may fall due to rain or quiet tears. The story is simple and it works. The treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the diamond. She calls and tells her story about RMS Titanic. The two lovers are divided by the social class and ultimately the fate of the ship. Everything in history works, and there are very few flaws. I give the Titanic, 86% awesome
