I just saw this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who was working on it, so I decided to check it out. I thought it was a really beautiful film, and I can't wait to watch it again. the actors were really good, and I loved all the music! there was not much talk in the film, which at first seemed a bit strange to me, but as soon as I got into it, I thought that the story and the action were really emotional and meaningful, and I thought that it left much to the imagination. I want to watch the movie again because so much has happened in it that I forgot many small things, but I know that I left the theater thinking about the movie. It was beautifully shot, and it was all really unique.
