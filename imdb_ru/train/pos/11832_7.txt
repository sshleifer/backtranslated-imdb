Time to rant, yes: I thought Spirit was a great movie to watch. However, there were a few things that made it difficult for me to rate him higher than 6 or 7 (I am a bit generous to 7). <br /> <br /> Point number 1: Matt Damon annoys me. I thought, “What a stupid voice they got for the main character,” when I first heard him tell, and then I realized that it was Matt Damon. This person gets me very badly - his performance in The Departed was terrible and destroyed the film for me (before the film had a chance to destroy itself, but that was a completely different story), as was almost the case with Spirit. ” I was able to get around this fact due to the fact that in fact there was little narration ... fortunately. <br /> <br /> Point number 2: Brian Adams sucks ... The whole account was terrible ... The songs were unoriginal, common and poorly performed; I have never found the right music; and the lyrics were terrible. Every time one of the lame songs appeared, they turned me off. I almost thought that I would start to hear some kind of patriotic propaganda, leaked into the super-American lyrics in the style of freedom (I couldn't help but recall those awful patriotic songs that were constantly heard on the radio after 9/11). In the light of the Native American aspects of the film, they had to go with the right music, using the right tools, rather than petty radio shit, teenage shit, 14-year-old girl's shit. I thought I was back in high school. I can not believe that nothing better could be done - I refuse. If it were not for that, I would appreciate the film more with Disney, who knows something about originality (well, don't say that, I know, some of you probably think;). It is a pity that it is a pity that they could not hire the best musicians. <br /> <br /> I liked the graphics and animations, except for some things here and there ... how sometimes the corners seem too sharp on the face and the lines are too thick or dark on the body (thick / dark lines are mostly near the end ). There have been cases when I thought that they tried too hard with all their strength and emotions and facial expressions and could not evoke any real emotions. But there were also times when emotions ran high. In any case, many scenes were lazy, and the layers were obvious. <br /> <br /> OK, I’m falling asleep here, so I’ll summarize before I start to lose meaning ... <br /> <br /> Good try on an epic film ... it turned out to be mediocre, though. Matt Damon, you suck!
