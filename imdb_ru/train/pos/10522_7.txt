This is a good adaptation of the Austin novel. Good, but not brilliant. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is inventive, sometimes crossing the border with stunts, but it certainly avoids the pitfalls that turn it into a boring television soap in costumes, given that the whole story is based on dialogue. <br /> <br /> Act competently. Miss Paltrow is alienated as her character requires, but the necessary distance from other characters is accompanied by a much less suitable detachment from her own actions. In other words, she doesn’t seem to care about the results of her partner search efforts. Some of the cast are guilty of excessive acting - very much in a style that is valued at the stage but is out of place in the movies. I personally had problems accepting Alan Cumming as Mr. Elton through no fault of my own, except that I left such an impression in Secular Life as a gay trolley that it’s hard to accept him as a serious role. . Acting honors go to Tony Collett, who manages to radiate heat, and Jeremy Northam, who puts his character on the proper level.
