I really liked this movie, and it was a bit difficult to do this when your brother makes silly comments in it every 30 seconds. But I liked this film, mainly because I was used to the usual HK action films. Most of these films do not watch the storyline, see meaningless actions. And mindless actions are right. You can see Jet Li Jump, spin, kick, punch, shoot, make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets. It is true that this film was released to a wider audience after Li was in "Deadly Weapon 4". This is one of the reasons why the ratings of this film have fallen. Most people probably expected to see a film that was as polished as a North American film. But you have to remember that most budgets of HK films are not as high as in North American films, and the style of the HK action movie is usually very different, which requires wired work in many of them. If you want to see a good fighter, you should see this, just try to ignore the duplication. <br /> <br /> My rating was 8.
