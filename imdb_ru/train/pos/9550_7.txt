Despite the success of comedy or drama, Turkish directors fail in a horror thriller. Okul-D @ bbe is a good example of horrible Turkish horror films. <br /> <br /> But if you look at “Gen”, you will understand that this is a blow. The atmosphere of the film is impressive and gloomy. Also features are colorful and not cheap. The soundtracks fit the film, but the script is not quite perfect, and the theme of the film is normal. <br /> <br /> As a result, “Gen” does not add any difference to horror films, but thriller fans do not disappoint. In this respect, this is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)
