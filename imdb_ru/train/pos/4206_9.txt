Skip McCoy - a three-time pickpocket for losers, unable to curb his instincts on the street, he picks up Candy's wallet on the subway train. What he does not understand is that Candy has a top secret microfilm, which is of great interest to many organizations. <br /> <br /> Director Samuel Fuller created an exceptional drama performance amid the terrible underworld of New York. City. Communist spies and questionable government agents come together to make “Pickup on South Street” a spectacular show from the first minute to the last. Based on Dwight Taylor’s story titled “Blaze Of Glory,” Fuller led this adaptation into a tense political agenda, which many at the time felt like it was finished, but focusing only on its anti-communist beliefs makes it a great disservice. /> <br /> Rummaging a little deeper, you will find that the characters are as intriguing as everyone Fuller led, the main character of one of them is the play’s hero, rogue and petty person, his heroism is not born love of his country, they are born out of his stubborn behavior. This is a great achievement that Fuller created one of the best antiheroes of the 50s, and I am sure that he was very grateful for Richard Widmark’s performance as McCoy with all his smile and icy cold heart, for his interaction with the wonderful Gene Peters. Candy is great and that is the heart of the films. Nevertheless, Oscar-nominated Thelma Ritter takes acting honors, her Mow is strong and no less miserable than the surrounding characters, but she has the tired warmth that Ritter majestically conveys. <br /> <br /> This is a B film in texture, but the film, “Pick-up on South Street” is a real cool and exciting film, the best of its most intriguing directors. 9/10
