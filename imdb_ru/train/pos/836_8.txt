This is unlikely to be recognized as the best comedy of the year, too many coincidences and plot holes. However, we are talking about a film where an assassin and white bread seller become pals, so a few surprises should not come as a surprise. Brosnan does an excellent job with this role, wooden James Bond is gone (the role he wasted). If he can maintain this quality, I hope he will continue to make comedies. Greg Kinnear is also gorgeous as Brosnanâ€™s straight man. I read here a few negative comments about Hope Davis, but I thought she was very good as a housewife with a dark side hidden deep inside. There are a lot of good chuckles when Brosnan is having fun, and a few scenes where I almost died laughing. My father (a consultant) almost lost him when Julian calls himself a "middleman." Just like Grosse Pointe Blank, another comedy for an assassin, humor can be very grim. If you are ready for this, be ready to enjoy.
