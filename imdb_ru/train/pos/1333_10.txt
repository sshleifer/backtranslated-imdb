I really like this movie, I watched it again and again. I do not understand why someone might think that this film is bad. Maybe you have seen better or something else, I personally love it. This is one of my favorite movies, and I'm not at all Hindi, but I like it. It may be a bit like “Pretty Woman,” but I haven't seen it and don't think it's better than this. I do not know why you are all so offended, but maybe you have a good reason, but I think I have said enough already, but I really like this film, and those who say that it’s not very good I wonder why you watched and what movies you think are good. As for everyone else that I watched with them, they also enjoyed it, so it surprises me that many don't like it. As for Rani Mukherjee (I think this is how you write her last name), she is very beautiful and my favorite actress!
