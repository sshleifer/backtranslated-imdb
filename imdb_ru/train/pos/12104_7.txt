Well done old and very dark house horror. Good setting, which includes the character himself Poe, hinting at the story in a London pub. Although from here it is largely the only guy who dared to inspect the house one evening or another, running from room to room, looking for or avoiding people, he still remains the most pleasant. Plus we have the delightful and mysterious Barbara Steele. There is some wooden dialogue and some unexplained beats and wiggles, but this is a super creepy atmosphere that is maintained everywhere, this is also a super musical accompaniment that supports this moving well. The DVD comes from the USA and has several additions.
