This is a very exciting and romantic movie. I have seen it several times and never got bored. Everything is realistic and this is a good storyline. The actors are gorgeous Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. <br /> <br /> I actually prefer this film to “Braveheart”, because “Braveheart” has so many historical mistakes. There are many exciting scenes - watch the bridge scene and the latest fencing scene. These are really nice and amazing scenes. <br /> <br /> The music is beautiful ... it really fits the film. The setting is awesome.
