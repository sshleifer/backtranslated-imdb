This is one of the best films I have seen in the last 2 years (premiered in Tel Aviv, Israel, in the summer of 2006, just when the last war began) ... This problem is in communication between people who cause wars, I have long been They are interested and it doesnâ€™t matter who are boys and girls, heterosexuals and gays, Jews and Arabs ... I have already seen the bubble 3 times already, and it still surprises and excites me - every character reminds me of one of many people, whom I know, and about the difference between them, as between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... The last time I saw this , was with my friend, a Christian arab, and it was on the day of independence of Israel (the most symbolic one I could! how ironic) and ... in the end, he cried !!! - if he was touched and not embarrassed - everyone would be touched by the bubble!
