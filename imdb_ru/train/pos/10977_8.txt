I took it arbitrarily from the library that night, having no idea about the cult of the film, its influence or that it is currently being put on like a musical. sad, and yes, a little exploiter, despite the good intentions of the filmmakers. The expanded edition of Chriterion is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out. <br /> <br /> I think you can also see the fall of the class in little Edie, which has disappeared, you can hear it in the old Jackie O films; people just don't talk like that anymore. I think, as a documentary, it would be interesting to get more information about how the house got into disrepute, at least Old Edie still knows what is happening to a certain extent; really she did not see how the once impressive house collapsed? <br /> <br /> However, the theme of the film is the life that two women built for themselves, real life, Tennessee Williams, one act. It is worth spending time.
