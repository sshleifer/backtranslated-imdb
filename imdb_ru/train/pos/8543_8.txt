It was one of those films that I probably would never have taken off the shelf, but one day he appeared on the IFC, and I said - Eric Stolz, William Forsyth ... why not? If I had changed the channel, I would have really missed the treasure. <br /> <br /> The theme is depressing - the young author is paralyzed in an accident while climbing in a lower-class rehabilitation center. It would be so easy and tempting to make this manipulative breakthrough. But this does not happen, because it was written by Neil Jimenez, after he himself was accidentally paralyzed. There is no Hollywood happiness. All patients in the ward come from completely different strata of society, but they feel a sense of helplessness at the mercy of others. Stolz is very good as a "lone wolf" type, forced to confuse dependence on his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is good as a former man whose family is falling apart; but William Forsyth sees the cake as a tough guy who decided to get someone to pay for having deprived him of his independence. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie.
