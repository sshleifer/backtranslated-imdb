It was another great film about Tom Berenguer ... But some people are right, he looked like another SGT BARNES character, but he was still awesome ... Tom Berenguer played a great sniper in the jungles of Panama! At first, Billy Zayn looked like Apkham's drop from Saving Private Ryan, but then he became a little more aggressive! The sniper was awesome, and action lovers should watch him ... I remind you that he will not have as many actions as in an ordinary action movie ... I also have this film on DVD, and it is excellent!
