I've always been a big fan of Cybill Shepperd since I saw her show a few years ago !! This film certainly shows it in the best light! The film was so wonderfully played and played !! From time to time she throws little funny lines, just to make this movie one of the best I've ever seen !! Everything is really beside myself! Especially Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepperd, they really made the movie a reality !! I also liked the little moment when Mavis loses her wig, and she almost dies when she falls to the floor !! This is a movie at its best!
