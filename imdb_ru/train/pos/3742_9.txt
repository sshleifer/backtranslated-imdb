I really liked this film, but there is nothing new in it. <br /> <br /> Everyone here combines it with other war films, this film was misclassified! This is not a war film, no more than "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", this is a film about asylum, or "Luke's Cool Hand" is a prison film. This film is about individuality, inconsistency, self-confidence and the value of this type of person. <br /> <br /> The plot is the same as “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest” and the “Cool Hand of Luke”. in a GOOD company, and it has its own. These films should be confronted and compared, not Apocalypse Now or Platoon. <br /> <br /> Eric
