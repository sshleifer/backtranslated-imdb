The complex story is laid against the background of the section of Bharat. An honest Muslim who kidnaps an innocent Hindu girl and an educated Hindu who burns the harvest of a Muslim - but in the end you love them both. The story is strong, but the script and the flow fluctuate. Background music and songs are outstanding. Then follows the unforgettable performance of the veteran Urmila Matondkar. Photography very well reflects the time, violence and flavor of rural Punjab. Other actors either acted poorly or were unable to act. The direction is really the weakest link. The characters were not well developed. Not clear, unlike the "Earth", where even the 5-line character leaves a mark. The end is very interesting. This story can have several different endings - and they can all be equally good.
