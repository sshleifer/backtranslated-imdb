If you've ever seen the trailer for Recruit with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you will never have to watch this movie. Unfortunately, the Renaissance had the same frank trailer manufacturers. <br /> <br /> The story of the Renaissance tells about a detective who investigated the kidnapping of a young woman and a medical researcher. The setting is futuristic Paris, and science fiction elements are shown everywhere. The peculiarity of the Renaissance, however, is in its visual style, and not in its history. Renaissance is a 3D computer animation similar to Final Fantasy, but heavily stylized in black and white with ultra sharp contrasts. The result looks stunning (although the problems of 3D-animation of people are still noticeable from time to time: slightly robotized movements, slightly wooden facial play, etc.) visually. The history and composition, however, is not quite at the same level of quality as the visual effects. This is not a bad story (and, apparently, if you have not seen the trailer, it is much more exciting than for me). But this is a story that is not very original and borders on the banal. A few lines of dialogue were painfully banal, which made the letter look like the first attempts of a novice. <br /> <br /> I will definitely recommend Renaissance to my friends. It’s not like anything I’ve seen before, visually, and I believe that its originality alone makes it a rewarding experience. It is also a watchable story, even if it is not perfect.
