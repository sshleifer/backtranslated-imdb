Miracle One of the best musicals. The three numbers of Busby Berkeley that end the film are exciting, but what makes this film so remarkable is an incredible non-stop patter and a natural game of Cagney and Blondel. (Keeler is also beautiful, although perhaps she was not a good actress). There is freshness in the film that you donâ€™t see today, especially in the films of the 1930s, although the plot, including the installation of the film prologues, is rather outdated.
