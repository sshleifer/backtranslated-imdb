My Take: uses a familiar storyline with beautiful performances and a few authentic moments of excitement. <br /> <br /> The plot is familiar. An innocent man is plotted to assassinate the President of the United States, the first traitor in the United States secret service. When his colleagues, intelligence agents, pursue him, he tries to prove his innocence. Of course, we know his innocent, and the real criminal is not far off, but I was still entertained by Sentinel. At this time, when thrillers come down to being too ridiculous and too numerous in action sequences, THE SENTINEL is a good answer to all these old-fashioned political crime thrillers. Familiar story raised neat exciting episodes and stunning performances. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas, the ideal person for this job, is long-time secret service agent Pete Garrison, who was framed for conspiring to kill the president. Former colleagues in the secret service (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) are pursuing Harrison, trying to find out who is behind the possible murder and traitor in the secret service. This leads to many scenes of harassment, which, surprisingly (and fortunately), are never incredible. The script also offers a plot in which Harrison has an affair with the first lady (played by Kim Basinger). Fortunately, this was not necessary, as in most subjects for such films. <br /> <br /> The director of the film is Clark Johnson (SVA), who manages to make the film look good. Although many have criticized him as “there should have been a television movie,” I must disagree. Agree, this is not an ideal film, and most of it is inspired by other action films and political intrigues, such as On Fire or an episode of the television series 24 (which this film very much resembles when it comes to style and the star of Sutherland). ), but even in this case, this film raises its plot to serious heights and does not leave even small details. The performances are amazing (with a first-class performance, it must be, even with a script with numbers. <br /> <br /> In general, I reward him *** 1/2, not perfect, but not far from him. <Br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 of 5.
