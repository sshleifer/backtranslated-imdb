Just the funniest and most brilliant comedy of all time ... she is definitely on my personal list of the top ten. This one also gets a solid top ten on the voting scale. Millionaire heir Arthur Bach (Moore) is a “child” of middle age who refuses to go on a mature way in life and avoids all necessary duties. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day, he and his personal butler Hobson (Gilgud) go shopping in Bergdorf Goodman and face petty theft by Linda (Minnelli). Chemistry of Arthur and Linda adds electricity to the rest of the film. There are lots of fun parts of the set. In one of these scenes, Arthur (drunk for most of the story) knocks on the wrong apartment and receives terrible threats from the human “siren” (“My husband has a gun !!!!). duly noted: Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Arthur's loving but ruthless grandmother, Sir John Gilgud almost steals the entire show with his sour perverted looks (for this he took Oscar home), and Christopher Cross provides the song Main Theme (Oscar winner) "The best You can do"). It is a pity that the late Dudley Moore passed away last month (March 2002).
