This film I highly recommend. This is about the boy Stanley Yelnac (Shiit LeBefe), who was wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to the Green Lake camp, the boys' detention center. There he is forced to dig holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diameter. While there, he meets the other boys of the camp (Zero, Magnet, Armpit, Kalmar, X-ray and Zigzag). They all dig not to “build a character,” but to find outlawed Kate Barlow's treasure. Throughout the film (and the book), Stanley learns more about the past, more about himself, and more about digging holes. I give this movie 9.5, because I am very picky when it comes to books for films (I want the film to exactly follow the book). But still it was really good.
