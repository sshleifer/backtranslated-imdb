Ya This is what I think. Of course, it was a great show with John, but I personally think that without him is much better. <br /> <br /> I like CJ and Grandpa living in the house because they are so funny together. <Br /> <br /> When John was still there, I really didnâ€™t laugh as hard as I do now. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that they do nothing more. (I do not think ...), because I would like to see some new material. <br /> <br /> My favorite character is Rory. Poor Rory is almost always left out. It's always about Bridget or Carrie. What about Rory !!! ??? Honestly, this is a great show, and for anyone who has never watched it, you should go and watch it. I almost guarantee that you will laugh. good even laugh
