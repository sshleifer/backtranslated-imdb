Before I comment on this film, you must understand that when I watched this film, I was expecting typical shit, horror, B-film and just wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is one who not only delivers, but also is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Scott MacDonald is great in the role of Jack Frost, in fact, I think he has a future in the role of psychopaths in big films, if such an opportunity is ever given. MacDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through some silly random mixture of ridiculous elements. As soon as this snowman begins to move and kill people, it will be difficult for you not to laugh. The said lines are completely backward, but very funny. The fact that the rest of the cast completely overplays only adds stupidity to the film, but stupidity is genius. The scene where a snowman with a teenage girl is truly classic in a B-movie, a horror movie fashion. I really hope there is a sequel, and I will be right there to watch it on any cable channel that does this. Of course, it is interesting to watch the first few times, and this is not a very good movie technology, but I just like to watch snowmen kill people. I gave him 7 out of 10, this is a great movie for dates and couples in the late hours.
