*** Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, Ian MacShane, Romola Garia. Directed by Woody Allen. Immediately after his work with Johansson on Match Point, both return to Scoop on an exciting and fun comic trip. When a student reporter (Johansson) learns a new sensation from a dead reporter (McShane) when she enters the materialization of a lame mage (Allen). A sensation about the new killer of the Tarot Card in London, which may be tidy by Peter Lyman (Jackman); while Sondra and Sid are playing a detective, Sondra falls in love, because the handsome will be the killer. Allen finally hit the mark, not as good as “Match Point,” but definitely more fun. I laughed a lot more than I expected, one of the years must see
