A great movie! Slow: YES. <br /> <br /> ... but original, deeply atmospheric, gloomy and terrible, quite ESSENTIAL (like a nightmare). <br /> <br /> I would compare this with David Lynch (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet), possibly in combination with a small amount of Barton Fink and Naked Lunch (Insects!). Also a little Jodorowsky (Fando y Lis) .... <br /> <br /> Add some Nights on Earth, an Angel Heart and a little Born, Pi, (would it be wrong to mention Tetsuo?) "Barker - this should form at least the concept of a dark night ... NUIT NOIRE. <br /> <br /> If you don't like avant-garde and / or surreal cinema (like me) you will like this one. If you expect something else, such as a movie, a full action with some kind of medium storyline - try your luck with something else. <br /> <br /> Final words: the plot is very, very strange and unusual, and this is probably 1 reason why most people who donâ€™t appreciate this film hate it.
