I found this movie fascinating from the start — like Spielberg’s — and found the plot intriguing, trying to figure out what the real situation was. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning the beginning - before the opening of the titles - the action begins, which leads to an immediate wait. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are very cute. (It’s hard for me to love any of the Baldwins because of Alec’s extracurricular political activities, but William wasn’t that bad in this film.) <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there were many places where an annoying high-pitched sound sounded in the soundtrack - something like 19K Hz. I suspect the microphone was shooting video monitors on the set.
