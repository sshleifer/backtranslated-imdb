There are really a lot of complaints about this version of the Molnar movie — Farrell looks good in the lead, but his revelations stink, to be honest. It also suffers greatly from the fact that it is considered the first film to use the reverse projection. Kits look fake. <br /> <br /> However, this show has two strengths: although the evidence in the dialogue is weak, the visual presentation is impeccable. Rose Hobart, like Julie, is little remembered today: mainly for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cut EAST OF BORNEO programmer, simply removing it: credit for Melford’s stylish visual guide of the original. Her gorgeous beauty and simple (albeit modest) performance helps to repair some of the damage to the earthly passages of this film. <br /> <br /> However, one of the themes of Borzaghe is the mystical power of love, and this is the processing of the heavenly sections that make it great, from the arrival of the heavenly train to the trip to the “Hot Place”. H.B. Warner's work here, as always, is impeccable. <br /> <br /> So, we have an incorrect but very interesting version. I think that Lang's 1934 version is better, as well as the heavenly scenes in the version of CAROUSEL by Henry King, a diluted musical remake. But I still enjoyed this version very much and I think you should give it a chance.
