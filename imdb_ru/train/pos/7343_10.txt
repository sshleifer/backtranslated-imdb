Why this film has almost disappeared into obscurity is an absolute crime. "Conan" is probably the only film "The Sword and Magic" is better. Violent violence, cool character design and a good pace make this dream one of the best. This is by far the best animated film intended for a more adult audience I have ever seen. This is not like the usual mad style of Bakshi. This is the real care of Bakshi, and, in my opinion, his best work. I hope this film gets the recognition it deserves.
