Firstly, I really liked the music of Bruce Broughton, very lyrical, and this in itself added the charm of the film. The best aspect of the film was the three animals, excellently voiced by Michael J. Fox, Sally Field and the late Don Amechem. Whereas Fox has the funniest lines, Ameche plays a rather thoughtful, otherwise attractive character (voice of reason), and Field adds wit to a character who always notices a Chance passage. People were not so attractive, sometimes the film was drafted, but this is my only complaint. This is one beautiful film with great footage from Canada, I think. Although the film itself is quite long, there is never a serious boring moment, and this is facilitated by voice work and a well-written script. All in all, a charming and possibly underrated film from 9/10 from me. Bethany Cox
