Very beautifully made movie. It remains in your memory. It is better to be declared as a novel than flight or war, although the flying parts are realistic and almost infallible. Flight enthusiasts like me will enjoy this film, even if it is attracted to planes, if they are not sensitive or have never been in love. <br /> <br /> Funny to watch early Crow. He is good and exudes charm. His reading "High Flight" is superb. <br /> <br /> cheers, boom
