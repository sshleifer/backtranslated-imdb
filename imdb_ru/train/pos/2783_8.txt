Not one of your hardest stories, and that's the real power of this film. There are at least two relationships in which less confident authors would add too predictable romantic tension. They not only relieve the audience from this, but also present surprises at the same time. There are a few Disney moments, especially towards the end, but they are manageable. Overall, it was worth it, and it was good, relaxed entertainment. By the way, if you get a DVD, watch the episode where the director teaches you how to make gobi with aloo. We followed her directions and it was great! Next time we do it the day before we plan to eat it, because this is one dish that definitely improves if you release spices all night in the fridge!
