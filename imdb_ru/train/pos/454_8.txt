Was it a bad day? The dog bit the postman? The car will not start? Are people nervous? Then refresh yourself in a delightful experience. <br /> <br /> Two women decided to pool their resources in response to the announcement of the monthly rental of a villa in Italy. Due to financial circumstances two more women join them. Two have a funny family life; one is an elderly woman who prefers to live in the past; the fourth is a rich and beautiful woman, completely exhausted by life. <br /> <br /> As the villaâ€™s spell penetrates their moods, each of them grows in its own way and is inspired by its outlook. It also changes the people in their lives who have visited them. When they leave, you know that the magic of the villa will stay with them ... and you will find that your worldview has changed for the better. A delightful inspirational movie!
