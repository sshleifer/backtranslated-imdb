True, I don’t know anything about baseball, I’m not even a sports fan, but that didn’t stop me from enjoying the latest film by the Farrelli Brothers Fever, a charmingly disrespectful romantic comedy. The film is not entirely about baseball; rather, it is about relationships and emotional disconnection, which can often be the case. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Fallen? giving your best performance to date ?? Stars like Ben, dumb, slightly boring schoolteacher. Ben is a kind of guy who, unfortunately, never grew up, and he has an almost fanatical dependence on the Red Sox baseball team. Ben has dedicated his life to the Sox and does everything from pilgrimage to Florida for spring training and ending with decorating every square inch of his apartment in the team paraphernalia. <br /> <br /> One day while attending a geometry lesson with honors On a trip to his office, Ben meets the enraged Lindsay (wonderful Drew Barrymore). Lindsay is a corporate, career-oriented girl, but she has such a pretty woman that Ben finds quite nice. Initially, he does not dare to invite her on a date, thinking that she is leaving his “class”, and Lindsay does not immediately see a potential partner in Ben. <br /> <br /> Their first date fails disastrously. when is lindsey hit by a severe case of food poisoning ?? and her resonant vomiting gives the first clue that we are actually watching the film of the Farrelli brothers. Instead of accepting Lindsay's request for postponement, rather urgently, Ben remains to play as a nurse, orderly and cleaner. So Ben cleans the toilet and the dog’s teeth, and his love interest is lost in the bucket next to her bed. <br /> <br /> When Lindsay wakes up in the morning and finds him sleeping on the couch, she begins the long, exhausting process of breaking down the web of status anxiety and ambition, which she regards as her standards. They soon fall in love, and Lindsay recklessly accepts Ben's fanatical devotion to his sport. <br /> <br /> Having inherited selected passes from his beloved uncle, did Ben organize his life throughout the season ?? he never missed the game. But their relationships, which have developed without failures throughout the winter, cause obstacles at the beginning of the season. <br /> <br /> Lindsay wants Ben to do other things, like rest with his parents and have fun with friends. but Ben begins to have difficulty modulating his interest to meet Lindsay halfway. Can Lindsay accept his irrational devotion to the boys of summer to make their relationship work? Could she really fit Ben into sports? Can a die-hard and boring Red Sox fan find true love in the end? Of course, Lindsay and Ben come with a vibrant assortment of friends inclined to opinion. Lindsay's strictest buddy, skinny, rich and blond Robin (KaDee Strickland), insists that there must be something wrong with the guy if he is still not married at 30 years old. However, the plump, curly Sarah (Marissa Jareth Winokur) and Molly (Ion) Skye offer a more optimistic and positive view of Ben. <br /> <br /> Ben’s eccentricity can be applied to almost any obsessive sports fan, while Lindsay’s frustration can be representative of any career-driven woman. Fallon is awesome, like Ben, demonstrating a really big screen potential, overcoming an important task - not letting Ben be sympathetic. Meanwhile, Barrymore is as charming as Lindsey's workaholic, especially since she struggles to accept Ben as he is, not losing sight of her own needs. <br /> <br /> Fever Pitch really works, and although there are many inspired by comedic moments, the film also addresses the serious problem of sports addiction and how difficult it is for couples to negotiate this fragile territory. <br /> <br /> Most of the film was shot in Boston Fenway Park. adds a wonderful sense of authenticity to the process, as well as the atmosphere of the games, although to fully appreciate what happened with the team is likely to be limited to baseball fans. Despite this, Fever Pitch is endowed with such a carefully thought-out and intellectually fun scenario that even beginner baseball fans will find a lot to contact. Mike Leonard September 5th.
