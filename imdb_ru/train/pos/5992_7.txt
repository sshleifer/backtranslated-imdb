I admit that I had no idea what to expect before viewing this highly stylized fragment. It could be a cure for a zombie virus or a cold for everything I knew. It all started with great visual elements, small fragments that caught your attention and made your imagination explode. As I continued, I quickly learned from the voice what was happening. The good little neo-noir story I felt was not the waist of a few minutes of my time. The little clues provided to the audience with the visual elements at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment when they put the plot together. Along with a pleasant twist at the end of it is a cool package in general. The rating, although not bad, gave the film a feeling of almost a music video. It's just a bit out of date, adding nothing to the storyline. Some performances seemed too dramatic, but ideally fit into the overall composition. I'm leaving this very pleased. In a short period of time I was given a lot of information, but thanks to a lot of editing and dubbing she didnâ€™t feel that she was in a hurry. Great job!
