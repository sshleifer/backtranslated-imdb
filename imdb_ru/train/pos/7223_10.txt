Comparison with Sleuth, an earlier stage performance turned into a film, obviously, and when I first watched, I also thought that Sleuth was better, but Deathtrap, at least for me, has much more repetitions than Sleuth. <Br /> <br /> I bought a deathrap in a grocery store at Wal-Mart, assuming that there is a Kane and an underestimated Reeve, and it costs 6 bucks. It was one of the best DVD purchases I could get. <br /> <br /> This is one of those very secrets that movie lovers are always happy to discover. And it is worth it to repeat them. <br /> <br /> Although Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine participated in bravado performances in the movie “Sleuth”, I was doubly impressed by Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Reeve, rightly associated with his now legendary Superman image, stole the show in what was supposed to be a worthy Oscar. I always felt that Reeve was an acting actor who didn’t have a great chance to prove himself outside of Superman films and several other imperfect but fascinating films such as Somewhere in Time, but this film shows that his potential was indeed Glory god knocked and used. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the performance of Michael Kane. He was lively, delightfully manipulative and sadistic. And watching him work with Reeve and Diane Cannon was an absolute pleasure. In fact, it was thanks to this film that I got into the “Michael Kane phase” and began renting as many of his things as possible. <br /> <br /> With regard to Deathtrap, there are enough juicy dialogues here to fill out the “memorable quotes” section. (Unfortunately, most of the dialogue in its essence would spoil the incredibly interesting plot). <br /> <br /> It’s really very difficult to talk about a movie without spoiling important plot moments that are infinitely more interesting to discover on your own. Needless to say, this is a must see. But for me it was the biggest and most profitable blind purchase of all time. <br /> <br /> Repeated views are a must. <br /> <br /> And it deserves to sit next to Clute on your DVD shelf. <br /> <br /> I will leave you with this beautifully written quotation from the film: “Interesting, isn't it? to be ... well ... just a trifle so that I could enter into such a risky and exciting collaboration ... where I could not count on a sense of moral duty ... in general.
