On the eighth day, God created Georges. But just as the eighth day does not fit into the week, Georges does not fit into the modern world: he has Down syndrome, and therefore he was marginalized by society, fired into a shelter after the death of his mother four years ago. She was the only one who loved him. <br /> <br /> Harry is another man who is no longer loved. His wife left him for reasons she cannot explain. He also loses the love of his daughters when he is late for the train station to pick up two children who wanted to spend the weekend with their father. <br /> <br /> Harry is a high ranking businessman. He knows all the rules that allow us to succeed in our modern meritocracy. But he entered a state of crisis, which reaches its apogee after losing the love of his daughters. He questions the meaning of his life without getting any definite results. <br /> <br /> Harry and George are dating. At first, Harry tries to get rid of Georges, just like everyone else. But Georges can not be shaken off. And gradually it reaches Harry how much he needs Georges if he wants to overcome the identity crisis. It is Georges who opens up a new access to the world for him and makes him look at his life with different eyes. Friendship and human warmth replace desire for success. It is no wonder that Harry now cannot avoid failure in his work. <br /> <br /> Georges helps Harry recover his daughters recognition. Even his wife must admit that the fireworks organized by him were worth seeing. However, reintegration into the old life is no longer possible. And the new is nothing more than a dream with a time limit that will uncontrollably reach its end. The camera watches Harry and Georges for one long minute, when they both lie in the grass, just savoring the moment. But just as this minute will inevitably pass, the friendship of two men, having arisen in such a miraculous way, will not be long. Georges destroys the impossibility of loving the opposite sex, and he sees no other way but to commit suicide. Harry turns into a city tramp who asks car drivers who are waiting at a traffic light for charity. <br /> <br /> In the film, modern meritocracy is seen as a destructive mechanism that devours positive values, such as human warmth or friendship. This Georges, the Mongolians seem to be able to show a way out of this dilemma, but, unfortunately, his plea ends unsuccessfully. However, its failure does not necessarily mean that it is impossible or undesirable to achieve the desired goal. The way he shows us is certainly tolerable, although this requires a huge amount of willpower and, above all, the courage to apply radical non-conformism.
