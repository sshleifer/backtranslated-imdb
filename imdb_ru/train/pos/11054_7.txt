My brothers and sisters and I stumbled upon the "Champions" when one day in the 1970s our local station showed it again. We absolutely adored it. There was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially compared to ordinary American replays (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... you get the idea). He looked like The Avengers (not too surprising, since he was also British and in the spy / adventure genre). <br /> <br /> I would like to see it again now - I hope it keeps. I mentioned this show to others, and no one had ever heard of it, so I began to wonder if I represented the whole of his existence. But the miracle that is in the network, allowed me to track information about it. I hope he finds a new generation of fans.
