I first encountered My Friend Tutor by chance one or two years ago while watching TV. Before that, I had never watched any Korean films in my life, so MTF was really the first Korean film I watched. And what a delightful surprise! I was completely surprised from start to finish, and had a great time laughing. His comic style is quite different from racing films in Hong Kong (to which I have been used all my life and, therefore, tired of it), breathing fresh air into my boring movie watching experience. I thought that in MTF there are quite a few scenes and tricks that are quite funny, witty and original. <br /> <br /> I watched the MTF a second time a few days ago, and once I watched it, the unexpected / comic effect on me is kind of softened. This, however, in no way affected my opinion about the film. Instead, after this time, something else came - it touched me - the story of how two young, seemingly “incompatible” enemies unite, and how they gradually resolve their differences and begin to care about each other without realizing their feelings. . by themselves, remind me of long past school days. For me, Su Wan and Ji Hoon are truly compatible, as there is something pure and genuine in them, a quality that distinguishes them from people like, say, the impudent girlfriend of Ji Hong. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two separate parts - the first part is devoted to the “struggle” between Su Wan and Ji Hoon and is more brutal and faster in pace. After Ji Hong gets a pass in his last exam and Su Wang dances (according to Ji Hong) a provocative dance, everything begins to change. The pace slows down and ... Ji Hoon suddenly realizes that he cares about Su Wan more than he could imagine. So the second part is devoted to the development of their mutual feelings, which, of course, leads to a happy ending, followed by a final encounter with a gang of bandits. <br /> <br /> Just one last comment. I find it a bit unbelievable - the fact that the 21-year-old self-proclaimed "bad boy" will feel embarrassed, being almost naked in front of the girl he intimidates and loses his "slope" - this is just a little ... strange. I guess it shows that Ji Hoon is just a boy at heart and not at all like his appearance. By the way, Kwong San Wu (Ji Hong) has a sexy body and a perfect figure! ;-) <br /> <br /> MTF is definitely on my list of the top 10 favorite movies of all time.
