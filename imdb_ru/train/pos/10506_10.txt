Rated E <br /> <br /> I have never had a Nintendo 64, but I have played it many times. In my opinion, along with Conkers Bad Fur Day, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for the Nintendo 64 system. I have played this game many times and it is good every time. If you have an N64, and you do not have this game, you should try to find it. The original Super Mario Bros games were side-scrolling video games, but Super Mario 64 has 3D Mario in a nice 3D environment. The game is rather strange, but there are many things in it that you can do. You play as Super Mario, and again you need to save the Princess and 120 stars of power from Bowzer. Now you can do it in a 3D environment. Super Mario 64 is a very fun and good game for the N64, and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
