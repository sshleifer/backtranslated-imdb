I intended to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the death of Marcello Mastroianni with his numerous unnamed films that I have on VHS; however, given my ongoing carefree Christmas marathon, I had to get by with just that! As it happens, it shows one of his best performances - and he was fairly nominated for an Oscar for this (with the film itself, which was also honored). It was also one of 14 collaborations with another famous star from Sophia Loren; both, by the way, are playing against the type here - she’s like an untidy housewife and he’s a homosexual! <br /> <br /> By the way, the title of the film has a double meaning: the main characters get together on that historic day when Hitler came to Italy to meet with Mussolini (the event itself is shown in lengthy archives). but it more specifically refers to the “short meeting” of stars in which they share moments of friendship, revelation and, in short, passion - although everyone knows that a return to their normal existence is inevitable, which leads to a sudden bitter-sweet ending of the film, almost double-handed (with all the other characters — except for the curious concierge of the apartment building in which the story unfolds entirely — including rude and hotly patriotic husband Lauren, who was surprisingly played by John Vernon, appear nly the beginning and end of the sequence); However, the cramped situation does not keep the director Skole (for the record, this is his 7th film, which I watched, and I have 3 more on VHS) and cinematographer Pascualino de Santis, so the result - although essentially low - is the key - far from stagnant: the camera can wander through the various sections of a large building, watching what is happening carefully or impartially, as the situation requires, but always sharply. <br /> <br /> The narration, of course, depends entirely on the performances of the two stars, so that they are convincing, and they both deliver (their screen chemistry is completely incomparable); It is interesting, however, that although Lauren left with prizes in their own lawn, this is a moving but not sentimental outsider Mastroianni (the film, somewhat doubtfully, seems to equate his sexual deviation from anti-fascism!), Which generally impressed the international audience!
