The humor, implied in the full capital proverb, follows from the Sunday School saying that it would be better to advise you to prepare yourself before you die for the devil's check, that is, for the devil to spit when you die. There is no percentage in trying to defeat the devil. The characters, apparently, did not pay attention to Sunday School and were forced to engage in crisis management, avoiding the avoidance of crises. But even an experienced CEO will have a hard time coping with these crises. A dice roll is much more unpredictable than a coin flip; when people are involved, the list of possible outcomes becomes even longer than Sidney Lumetâ€™s long list of unforgettable films. Until now, Hawke may not have been an unforgettable actor, but here he might have intended to make money among other Lumet stars such as Steiger and Pacino.
