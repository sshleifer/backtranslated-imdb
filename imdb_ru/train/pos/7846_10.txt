Usually I am not too keen on certain shows (except for OC and Desperate Housewives ... hey, I'm 20!), But, if it was a joke, after one episode of Reunion I was hooked. <br /> <br /> I cannot even say how distressed I was that this time interval contradicted Bush’s speech last night, because I was really looking forward to the 1987 episode, which will now be broadcast next Thursday. Again, this conflict was unprofitable, because, being a new show, it must create the next one, and the second episode, postponed for a week, kills some impulse. <br /> <br /> However, television does not always have to be an Emmy worthy to be enjoyable. I don’t expect Reunion to take any prizes home, but I hope he can get my attention all season. Ever watched the first few episodes of your favorite show years later? Sometimes you wonder how you got hooked. Creating a character takes some time. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, one episode for each annual idea is wonderful. The only other show I can remember when I did something similar is 24, where each episode lasts an hour ... and a busy year is more realistic than a busy day! Please give this show a chance. Relax about the art form ... it's just TV!
