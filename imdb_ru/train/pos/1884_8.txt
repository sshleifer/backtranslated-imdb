This is one of my favorite comedies. Not wanting to indulge in the boring way of life of his hero, but taken for what he stands, and not as a banal alcoholism, the film is just very funny. It tells the story of an unlikely story of an ever-drunk, irresponsible 40-year-old bachelor named Arthur who is going to inherit a huge fortune, but only if he marries Susan, chosen because the family thinks she can make something of him. Arthur suggests, but then foolishly falls in love with Linda, the waitress and the petty thief. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the most charming drinker in the world, whose antics are laughter per minute. It should be recognized that Moore I.S. Arthur and I agree with those who cannot imagine another actor in this role. Ladies parts are also well depicted. Lisa Minnelli shines like Linda, and her boring chemistry with Moore is gorgeous. Jill Clayburg plays Susan, a wealthier and more suitable woman chosen for Arthur. <br /> <br /> However, this film is literally made by Sir John Gilgud, who portrays the sarcastic but moral butler of Arthur Hobson. Obviously, these two experienced a strong mutual feeling during Hobsonâ€™s lengthy work. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and provider of unsolicited comments and suggestions. The most interesting relationship in this film is not Arthur's novel at all, but its unusual connection with this witty and, of course, constantly condemning servant. This is the butler, whom you will remember best after closing the credits.
