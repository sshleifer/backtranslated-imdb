Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War, “Jacknif” came not too late or was even superfluous. This is one of the few who is trying to cope with the second sad side of the war: a while later. Unlike films like Taxi Driver or Rambo, in which their main characters are portrayed as broken heroes in a bad post-war setting, this film allows viewers to take a different look at Vietnam veterans. Their development is manifested very precisely before and especially after the war. The problems are obvious, but in all this tragic there is always a feeling of some kind of hope based on love and friendship. “Jennif” may be the quietest film in Vietnam, but after almost 15 years it’s really believable and justified. Moreover, it may lead us to believe that the war is not over; at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are awesome. De Niro did one of his best works, but Ed Harris is the star of this film. Perhaps this was his best performance.
