As an amateur historian of World War II / Nazi Germany, I could not wait for it to be released on DVD. I missed it when it was first time in 2003. I do not want to repeat what has already been said on the previous 8 pages of comments about historical inaccuracies. The best work could be done by portraying the "charming" Hitler. I also had a small problem with some casting options, not so much because of their game, but because of their appearance. Peter Stormare is not very similar to Roma, why didn't they make Babson when Hess was wearing a wig? And my biggest complaint ... so much has always been done about Hitler's amazing blue eyes, why didn't they make Carlisle wear blue contacts? On the other hand, I thought that the actors who played Goering and Drexler looked pretty good. Again, as long as the people who watch this realize that this should be the 1st entertainment, the 2nd story, I do not think that there will be much harm.
