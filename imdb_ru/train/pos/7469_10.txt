This movie was just great. It really made me think. I was confused during the whole film. I loved everything about it ... it was so confusing, so perverse and strange that it was hard not to love it. All the actors were phenomenal, and no one could do a better job ... This is one of my favorites of the year ... he deserves ocar.
