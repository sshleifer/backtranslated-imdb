I was speechless and empty after my first viewing of this - many parts of GRAY GARDENS are very funny and incredibly surreal - a documentary film that it really gives Fellini or David Lynch a chance to make money in the Virdsville lotteries. I continued to focus on how these women (who are clinically far beyond eccentricity) reveal their own humanity in a most amazing way, and I wonder if their departure from the world was caused by something other than sultry life in unreal blue blood? The universe, perhaps some kind of insult, or just a strip of disobedience and rebellion, which went out of their control and found their own lives. This may be one of the greatest films ever, when he approaches exploitation in a dangerous way, without crossing the edges — when Edie does his job, I continued to mark things like empty gin bottles in a bedroom covered with rubble, cats urinate on the bed, the raccoons emerging from the holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - like a kid's birthday, which had seriously deteriorated. It is definitely worth seeing and searching - you will never forget it, but it’s very disturbing.
