According to the tradition of G-Men, “The House on 92nd Street”, “Street without a Name”, the FBI Story is now released, one of those films that are carefully controlled and which showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best light. While its 48-year-old director J. Edgar Hoover was alive, it would not be shown in any other light. <br /> <br /> Don Whitehead’s book on which this film is based is the bureau’s direct history. from its founding in 1907 until about the time when the film "The FBI Story" was released. Sometimes it is important to remember that the FBI was there before it was headed by J. Edgar Hoover. Some of this time is also covered in the film. <br /> <br /> But Warner Brothers didn’t shoot a documentary, so in order to give the FBI flesh and blood the fictional character of John 'Chip' Harstead, it was created. The hardest thing when playing James Stewart is a professional man from the FBI who graduated from law school and instead of going to practice, he got a job at the bureau in the early twenties. <br /> <br /> In real life, the Bureau was headed by William J. Private Burns Burns Detective Agency. In fact, it was an extremely political operation, as shown in the film. Burns were on the periphery of the Harding administration scandals. When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to attract professional law enforcement agencies and strict standards of competence, he did just that. <br /> <br /> In the Hardesty family, which is Stuart and his wife, Vera Miles, we see the story of the FBI. In addition, we see a lot of their personal family history, which is fully integrated into the history of the FBI itself. Stewart and Miles are undoubtedly the whole American couple. We follow the FBI through some of the cases in which Stewart is involved, arresting members of the Ku Klux Klan, plotting to kill oil-rich Indians, kill the notorious criminals of the thirties, their participation in the detention of Nazi supporters in World War II and against the Communists. espionage in the cold war. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of prologue in which Stuart tells the class at the FBI Academy before entering the bureau’s history, as it is intertwined with his own. This includes a bomb planted by the airline by a son who acquired a lot of life insurance from his mother before the flight. Nick Adams will give you creeps as a criminal, and the story today, unfortunately, is relevant. <br /> <br /> Of course, if the FBI Story were written and released today, it would reflect something different and not entirely American. However, the FBI has a story to tell, and it is by no means negative. <br /> <br /> The FBI story is not one of Jimmy Stewart’s best films, but this is the first film I've ever seen with my beloved. an actor in him, so he has a special love for me. If the whole FBI was Jimmy Stewarts, I would feel much better. There is also a good performance by Murray Hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who died in a shootout with Baby Face Nelson. <br /> <br /> Vera Miles not only married Stewart, she actually married the FBI as the film shows. Basically it is dated, but there is still a good and interesting story.
