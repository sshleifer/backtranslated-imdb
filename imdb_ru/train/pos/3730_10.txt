If you want to watch a movie and enjoy watching it, then Tigerland is the movie for you. I love this movie from top to bottom. The ideal scenes of this film look so real; it's almost like a documentary about what happened in real life, but with a dramatic plot. Boy, I tell you ... A REAL drama, they are in fact the real "fought" in one of the scenes (get a DVD, listen to the comments, it's not obvious). I see this film as a group of desperate young people trying to avoid an ill-fated fate, after watching “Saving Private Ryan,” I understand what “ill-fated fate” is, and I know exactly what men feel in the film. I see this film as a cross between Stand By Me and Saving Private Ryan. What do men do when they are in a situation when in real life they find it difficult? Someone is going crazy, someone is crying, someone is punched, someone is using drugs, someone is accidentally sleeping with prostitutes, ruthlessly trying to eradicate the meaning of love from his life, someone is trying to drink pain, someone jumping from buildings or bridges, someone feels guilty, while others feel so painful that they are so sick that they collapse - physically. In this film, all these desperate emotions are combined into one ball. But don’t get me wrong, this is not a depressing film, its realism, this is a very very humorous film, a defiant and funny Bozz (character Collin) covers all this, and, moreover, in the film about 5 female actresses. ; I'll let you know what they are for! With dialogue, military / hostilities, imagine the perfect scenes with the appropriate music; In this film there is everything, as I said: from top to bottom. I do not know why Tigerland is greatly undervalued. The best thing about this film is that it’s written in bold “The Best Film of the Year” on the cover and says absolutely nothing. Store rare jewels arriving in Hollywood, 10/10.
