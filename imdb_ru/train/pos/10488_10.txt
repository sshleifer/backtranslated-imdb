After her Oscar nomination in “Secrets and Lies”, Brenda Bletin played in the equally great “Saving Grace”. And let me tell you that this is not the movie that you find every day. <br /> <br /> After her husband committed suicide, Grace Trevetin (Brenda Bletin) discovered that his irresponsible financial decisions left her a huge debt. Fortunately, she finds a way to make ends meet: marijuana. That's right, Grace starts to develop it. <br /> <br /> Every aspect of this film was played with great effect; Nowhere is there a boring moment. And I'm sure I did not see the end of this scene! But in any case, you should see this movie. You may feel more than festive when you see this. If nothing else, it can serve as a good lesson about knowledge of finance. But, of course, there is much more than that!
