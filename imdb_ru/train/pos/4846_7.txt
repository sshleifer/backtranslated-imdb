This is a classic British comedy thriller, which I always wanted to check, but so far I have not had such an opportunity. It is based on the popular stage play, which was already shot several times earlier (in particular, in 1931 by the same director, but, unfortunately, this version did not seem to have survived to the fullest extent!); for a remake that is pending, the plot has been updated to the current wartime situation. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was mostly familiar with Will Hay’s early British comedians: given that this film has a similar plot of legendary persecution, smuggling and enemy agents, this is very much in the same vein ( in fact, it was the script of the regular writing team of Hay from Marriott Edgar, Val Guest and JOC Orton); the flashing travelers element was thus an equally proven formula. The star this time is Arthur Asuka (incited by Richard Murdoch) - not one of the films I've watched before - who is just as unlikely a hero as Hey himself and whose personality turns out to be just as potentially annoying ... but one will soon warm him up , and Asuka, of course, came up with several witty lines and funny pieces of business to justify the fact that the main character of the play (and the 1931 film version) was divided into two parts here, with Murdoch acting as the Direct Partner of the star. <br /> <br /> Remote solo production (film events mostly take place during one stormy night) creates an amazing atmosphere; last half an hour — with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and eventually with the arrival of the title vehicle itself — especially exciting and well-managed. Of the remaining cast, Kathleen Harrison is also worth mentioning as a stereotypically frightened maiden, with the parrot as her constant companion and motivated by all her desires to drink her very first drink.
