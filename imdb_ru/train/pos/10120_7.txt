The film begins with something like a less hyper-kinetic, more variegated Dead or Alive: strange, clandestine actions are performed when police officers discover bodies. But when a policeman is killed, one of Tatsuhito becomes involved ... and when he discovers that his brother Shihito is also involved, things are going pretty fast. <br /> <br /> Miike's earlier work, the Shinjuku Triad Society, is still full of his usual in old ultraviolet and sadistic sexual activities, although this is not one of his more eclectic or vibrant parts. Rather, it’s a pretty well-researched story about fiction, when Tatsuhito delves into the underground, a maze that leads him to the gay triad leader who sells illegally obtained organs of the body from Taiwan and holds almost a brothel of young boys in particular a character who kills a policeman at the beginning). Brother Tatsuhito becomes a part of the aforementioned society, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty policeman and use similar cruel and sadistic tactics to penetrate this dirty kingdom. <br /> <br /> What is interesting in this small work? Such is the relationship of Tatsuhito and his sworn enemy, Van. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China who later moved to Japan and was alienated for it. Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China, so he killed his father and created a criminal wing in Japan. Van is also an amazing Shakespearean character, which is rather strange, especially since you actually begin to regret him by the time his final confrontation with Tatsuhito comes. And Tatsuhito himself is the same tragic figure when he has to contend with his inability to control his brother. Although it would be rude to say that Miike’s films are successful mainly because of their shock value, it’s sometimes true that it’s easy to lose sight of how well Miike can create bitter, passionless characters. <br /> <br /> - -PolarisDiB
