I do not understand. Not being a critic, I do not appreciate the quality of the game, which I consider to be believable, is a good thing. My confusion is about content. No one is sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women justified their betrayal of men who fought and bled to guarantee the permanent freedom of their families and their country. Shouldn't there have been a prologue informing us if the men returned home, and if so, how did the infidelity of their changing "women" affect them? While these women sheltered their lovers from a sense of loneliness, did they think that their husbands like to be shot at every day, facing death or dismemberment? They never thought about their husbands! Only from myself. Forgive me, except when they wished death to their husbands.
