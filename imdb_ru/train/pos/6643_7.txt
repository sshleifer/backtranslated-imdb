When I heard this movie coming out the night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I learned that this is a book written in 1978, I had to read it before watching a movie. I am sure that the film would be completely different for me if I had not read the book. The authors really did a good job, remaining true to the main plot of the book, with a few differences, of course. I think what disappointed me most about the film is that Boyle is playing the role of colonel. I'm not a big fan of Boyle, and it seems that regardless of the mood during the film, she always tries to use her more-puffy lips and darkly made-up eyes to make herself look super sexy. In fact, I think the film has withstood the true eeriness of the house. My favorite story was the Sheehan family (which is so strange because the son was killed in Iraq, and in current events there is Casey Sheehan, whose mother went on a huge anti-Iraqi tirade). In the book it is obvious that the war was not Iraq, but Vietnam, and when this video of my son was turned on in the helicopter in the house, I was really scared. In general, the film impressed me, as he was very good at following the book.
