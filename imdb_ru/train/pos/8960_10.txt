it may not be War and Peace, but two Academy numbers would not have been received if it were not for the genius of James Wong Howe ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that I Fell in love with my childhood and returned without dissatisfaction. Whether you are interested in what it offers or not, BB & C is a visual feast. <br /> <br /> I’m not saying that this is his best work, I’m definitely not an expert. but the look of this movie is amazing. I like everything about it; Elsa Lanchester, cat, crazy hoo-doo, retro city center; but the way it was captured is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> I even like the inconsistencies listed on this page above, and the “special effects” that now seem backward. all this creates a truly consistent world.
