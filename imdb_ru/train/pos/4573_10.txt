Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It's amazing how much he puts into each of the characters he plays, making them real. <br /> <br /> I remember many years ago we had a party in our house - friends came, we sat at the table, ate, drank wine, talked, laughed - had a good time. The TV was on - there was a movie that we didn’t pay much attention to. Then, suddenly, we all stopped talking and laughing. The glasses did not ring, the forks did not move, the food cooled on the plates. We could not take our eyes off the screen, where a young crippled man, whose whole body was against him and who controlled only his left leg, raised his piece of chalk with his foot and it seemed that eternity was trying to write only one word on the floor. When he finished writing this one word, we all knew that we witnessed not one, but three triumphs - the triumph of human will and spirit, the triumph of the movie that could capture such a moment in the film, and the Triumph of the actor who did not play, but became his hero. <br /> <br /> Jim Sheridan's “My Left Foot” is an exciting, unsentimental biodrama about Christie Brown, a man born with cerebral palsy. Dublin Slums; who became an artist and a writer and found the love of his life. <br /> <br /> I like all the performances of Day Lewis (I have mixed feelings about his performance on GONY), but I think that his biggest role was Kristi Brown in “My left leg”
