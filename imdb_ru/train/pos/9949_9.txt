This is quite a pleasant surprise. A cute little story about the search for the heroine, a very amazing metamorphosis of the four-eyed type, soon turned into a girl, into the promiscuous sex queen of the DD-Cup. <br /> <br /> A visual sight for sore eyes, not only for two rather stunning actresses, but also for (most of) the costumes and makeup of the actors. Excessive cheapness arose in some ridiculous imitation of the castle. <br /> <br /> Returning to the positives: the film has some unusually clear camera shots that you donâ€™t expect in the soft core. I liked this scene with icicles, the absolute potential of the classics. A small minus only for (very) a few odd scenes where the poor behavior of small castes soon stopped the suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> 9/10, including extra credit for serious drooling effects.
