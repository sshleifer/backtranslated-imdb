The sad story of the downed pilot B-17. Brady is shot down in occupied territory. Local ranchers rendered him kindness and protection at the cost of his own life. I had never heard of this film, and he caught me in two hours. After the movie ended, I'm glad I found the time. This is a whole story told to explain Brady's facial expressions at the beginning of the film.
