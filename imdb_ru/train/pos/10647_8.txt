I can not understand what did not like the fans of the genre in this film. It was really fun. The special effects were great. I generally agree with the reviews and with the voters of IMDB, but not this time. I waited until the home video came, which I thought was another reason I didn’t like the movie. I think that movies with special effects need to be watched on the big screen, but again this was not the case. For me, the film requires comparison with two films released at the same time. Blair the Witch and the Mummy. Both films that I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror movie of all time. Mummy earned a lot of money, and it was pure dirt. People liked it because it’s special effects. Such films as “The Mummy” and “The Ghost” are not rich in character development, they are more like attractions. Well with this analogy, the Mummy was B ticket on the Ghost e-ticket.
