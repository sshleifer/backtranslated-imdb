My only insignificant chatter about the film that I grew up knowing, like “Stairway to Heaven,” is that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY has been put off for the last twenty or so minutes on the ordeal. And the test itself, IMO, is the least interesting part of this exciting fantasy. <br /> <br /> David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER perfectly played the role of young lovers, but it is ROGER LIVESI who gives the most lively and trustworthy performances. , Marius Goring with a French accent is a delight (he even gets a comment about Technicolor), since the heavenly messenger is sent to return Niven when his death during the war is not reported due to oversight. Goering has some of the most witty lines, and they deliver them with pleasure. <br /> <br /> Seeing this at TCM tonight for the first time in twenty or so years, I think this is an excellent example of what a wonderful 1946 film was for. The photograph of Technicolor, slightly muffled and not at all conspicuous, is excellent, and the way it turns into black and white for celestial episodes is done with great imagination and efficiency. <br /> <br /> The first scene is what really attracts. The viewer in the fantasy aspects of the story - and Niven's intense conversation with the radio operator Hunter, when his plane falls to the ground, unexpectedly leads to an unforgettable romantic meeting. A truly amazing film from start to finish, another triumph of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
