The curiosity of Ladislas Starevich with insects and cinema is mixed in a short film about the love triangle between Mr. Zhuk, the artistic grasshopper and Mrs. Zhuk. The rather simple story of a married couple who seeks stimulation outside of marriage is like a biography or a whitegraf, except for time. The turn of Starevich in this story is to use embalmed beetles with wires that straighten legs in time-lapse animation. The story unfolds when Mr. Zhuk unknowingly hits a camera with a dragonfly from a local nightclub near a jealous grasshopper. When Mr. Beetle comes home to find his wife in the arms of his artistic friend, he angrily stalks her, but in the end forgives her and takes her to watch a movie. However, Mrs. Beatle will soon find out about her husband’s infidelity, since the film they are watching represents the images of a jealous grasshopper about Mr. Beetle and dragonfly together. Mrs Beetle beats Mr. Beetle with his umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps over the screen, and they both end up in prison after the projector, which they destroy, lights up. Insects are placed in humanized places, such as a house or a nightclub, and given human qualities are jealousy, anger, lust, and revenge. Insect characters carry briefcases, drive cars and even wear shoes, but they also pull their antennas and open and close their jaws, like real insects. The novelty of this story does not wear out even after several views, but, no matter how moving the movements are, the film moves slowly. The action takes place with complex detail, but in the process the speed and speed of filming is lost. Despite its pace, the film is an excellent example of Starevich’s early puppet art and is highly recommended.
