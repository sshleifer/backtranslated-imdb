Great Woody Allen? No, okay, Woody Allen? Definitely. I was with the audience present, laughing and often at some of the best Woody Allen lines we have ever heard. An aging Allen has created for himself the suitable role of "father" Scarlett Johansson ... well, sort of. Some say that Johansson plays "young Diane Keaton." I beg to differ. She plays Woody's dialogue, which in his comedies is always very similar ... like, well, Woody Allen's comedy. This is good for us, connoisseurs of Woody. She certainly made Woody's dialogue much better than the young cast of his latest comedy, Melinda / Melinda. Some may find Woody's humor tedious, but for those of us who love him, when done correctly, we look forward to the next.
