a little slow and boring, a story about an elderly man and his wife, living in a ruined building and interacting with a permanent composition of characters, such as a postman, brothers sitting on the porch, a rich man smoking cigars. The photograph of the river is amazing, as is the decoration of the period interior. If you like the design of Banana Republic stores, this is a must.
