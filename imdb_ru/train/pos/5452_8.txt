Stanner with a preliminary code in which Stanvik plays a speculative whore who sleeps on her way to the top. These pre-code editions really allow everything to go against the imagination. Stanwyck is outstanding as Lilly, the daughter of the owner / father of Speakeasy, who sold more than his drink to his patrons (Jones). After the old man dies (well!), Barb heads to the big city for the best things. Sleep her way to the top. John Wayne makes a bad "cameo" and proves that the actors are getting better with age and acting coach. I loved banter and strong lines between actors. I highly recommend this movie to all movie lovers and watch Stanwick, who is as gorgeous and beautiful as Lilly.
