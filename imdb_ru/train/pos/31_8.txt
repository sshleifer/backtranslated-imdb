Kitty complains about Evelyn, and Evelyn looks at the painting hanging on the wall with interest. Evelyn begins to repeat: "I am a red lady, and Kitty is black." Suddenly, Evelyn grabs a dagger lying nearby, stabs the Kitty doll, and then cuts her (doll) head. The fight begins. And Evelyn almost uses a dagger against Kitty.
