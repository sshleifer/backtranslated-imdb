George Maxwell, a frustrated middle-aged deputy district attorney (George E. Carey's excellent performance, who also created this picture) can no longer tolerate his arrogant, cold wife Edith (completely naughty Ann Bellamy). Worse, poor George is burdened by a newborn sun and a lustful lesbian daughter (dirty brunette Cherie Jackson). George has an adulterous affair with a sweet, seductive and energetic swinging hippie nanny Candy Wilson (adorable playing with sexy aplomb of delicious blonde knocked out Patricia Wymer). Complications start when George turns blackmailing bitter Julia Freeman (nicely poisonous game Katie Williams), who wants George to provoke her biker Lawrence McKee (frightening Robert Tessira, who has a head with hair) to her boyfriend, wicked. Directed by Tom Laughlin (yes, that same dude who portrayed Billy Jack!) And screenwriter James McLarthy filled the magnificent, sinister story with a victorious and very entertaining overly delightful female nudity, hissing sex sex and brutal violence. Moreover, they pin down all the wild and unconstrained sensibilities of the youth culture of the 60s and tie the plot in 75 minutes, which guarantees that this film will not cease to be welcomed. One obvious event occurs when Candy invites his clockwork friends to the Maxwell house on an improvised basement full of smoking marijuana, growling rock music and, of course, hot naked dancing chicks. Robert O. Ragland's funny score hits a gloomy spot. Stanton Fox's strict black and white cinematography adds an extra rough edge to insanely sloppy performances. Best of all, this film is rated as an amazing showcase for Patricia Wymer, an absolutely charming and freshly pixie, who positively illuminates the screen with her sweet, playful personality and charming beauty. Full cheesy fun.
