This is a comedy of morality, so sometimes there is a slight feeling of bitterness, but the ease softens all streams of sarcasm and irony, until in one moment it stops your heart and changes everything. <br /> <br /> This film is amazingly written and directed, it is a gem that shines beautifully, with a wonderful game of all. Jean-Louis Trintignan, as usual, found, and Romy Schneider - a pearl, perfect and radiant, which can not be missed. Really wonderful movie !!
