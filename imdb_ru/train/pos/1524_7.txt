This movie should be a classic. This is not perfect, of course. The tempo, although perfect for the scene, is in the form of a film slowly, like a tortoise with arthritic knees. Jean Seberg is misdirected to be too sweet and too gentle. She fully shows acting talent, skill and skill to convincingly play a smart, passionate and confident Joan, but, unfortunately, the director has lost sight of the character. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. In no other play, his dialogue was sharper, and the lines more musical. However, the processing of this film requires that you look at it as a lawyer. This film is a case, and the viewer is a judge. Here's how this picture should be like. 7/10.
