Clara Lago is remarkable as the main character of the film, in fact, a film about a Spanish-American girl who moved to Spain with her mother during the Spanish Civil War. It turns out that the mother goes home to die, and she is left with her grandfather. She also makes friends and experiences a lot in a short time. Tomic (Juan José Ballestra) at first gives her trouble, then they become close. The film was shot beautifully, mainly in soft colors. Carol pines for her father, who is a pilot in the war, and you feel Sher's love for him. Although the war itself in this film is relegated to the background, it envelops the character’s life. I think you will like. Watch it specifically for Clara Lago, who does an excellent job with Carol. She is definitely one to watch.
