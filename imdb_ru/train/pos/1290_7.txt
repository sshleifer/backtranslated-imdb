Yes, I remember it! Many years ago, I actually watched it. The story was completely surreal, but nonetheless gorgeous! Anyone who evaluates and reviews films should keep in mind what the corresponding film is aiming for. The same applies to the "First Child", which follows a similar pattern. Some films - like this one here - just tend to simple and funny nonsense. Such films cannot be rated from the point of view of the browser. Of course, these films lack quality, lack a complex storyline, very often lack first-class acting, but if they fulfill their basic premise, this is normal. I don't have this film on my list of favorites of all time, but I still thought it was funny, had some very pleasant episodes and made a good story. Brian Bonsall is an intelligent actor anyway.
