I bought a DVD on the recommendation of Amazon.com, based on my other interests. They hit a nail on the head with this. I remember watching the show when it was on TV, but I always wondered what happened to it. Ten years later, it's like watching it all again for the first time. Lucas Black as the Temple of Caleb and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck get on well with each other, although they are somewhat rivals. Almost symbolizes good (Caleb) and evil (Sheriff Lucas Buck). I never understood exactly who Lucas was supposed to be, but let's say it suffices to say that he has special powers that I believe were not provided by the Saints. It can make phones ring, write, or even cause changes in a person’s emotions. Nevertheless, there are several episodes when he really becomes a good guy, despite all this. In general, this is an excellent series that, like many others, that I can think of (for example, “Point Pleasant”, “Threshold”, “Nowhere” and “SeaQuest DSV”) were canceled long before their time. Stephen King’s “Dead Zone” (US Sunday Network) seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to do that. It's just that there's nothing more to watch on TV. This is because everything related to Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and should be immediately removed from television. So for now, I’ll just buy DVDs and watch shows that still need to be on TV, but have been downloaded from television by religious fanatics so that we can watch “quality” shows such as Family Guy and American Dad and The Simpsons (which a bunch of shit that is).
