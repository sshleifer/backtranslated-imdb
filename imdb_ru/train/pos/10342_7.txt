Melvin Douglas once again gives a brilliant performance, in which this time he plays the role of a detective who cannot put love before duties and adventures, and the warmth of the beautiful Joan Blondel (who is far from illiterate, as one reviewer suggested, wrote a novel about her youth) as pleasant as ever, his ever-suffering beloved. This is almost a comedic hype, almost a film in the style of “Skinny Man”, almost a TV series, I believe that this did not quite help the sequel. He does not reach the classic status, but it has everything you need for a fun 85 minutes with an episodic, but dynamic scenario, good character actors and a direction that makes everything move fast enough, so you hardly notice that Williams (Douglas) is not quite Colombo, when it comes to detection. I wish there were more such films.
