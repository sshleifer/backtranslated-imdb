Without Kirsten Miller, this project would not have been completed. However, with Miss Miller, awe-inspiring beauty and talent, I definitely recommend it. It looked as if other actors were playing only for her strong performance. Wagner's dismal attempt to read this film was a little disappointing, but several scenes did not distract from the entertainment. Basically, my criticisms relate to writing and plot, a group of collected talents did a heroic job of saving what should have been a disaster. Miller's charismatic delivery and timing were flawless and believable. She plays that fine line between assertive and domineering, but never insults, in fact she is a civil engineer she claims to be. I wish I could see it on the big screen, but, alas, I was lucky to rent it before it was lost.
