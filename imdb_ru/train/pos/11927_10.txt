I must say that, despite the fact that this is “Testimonials”, “Angels in the Outfield” was a pretty good movie. I like the fact that it teaches children to always have faith and never give up, because yes, miracles can happen. Unlike other baseball films, this particular film stood out with hits, amazing special effects and a well-organized soundtrack, which was very interesting. Although I liked this film, it had some flaws, such as some irrelevance (that is, by the end, when Ray Mitchell hits Homer, he will not step on the plate, and therefore it will not be evaluated. But this is just nagging). I have to say that I was really impressed with the presence and morality of this film: just have faith, don't give up.
