This is definitely one of the best films I've ever seen - it has everything - a truly touching script, wonderful actors who make subtlety wonderful art to watch, a really elegant novel no longer exists), beautiful songs and lyrics (especially the final song), artistic score, costumes and decorations that make you want to live in them. The ending was just a disappointment, because I expected an exciting movie to have a brilliant ending - but it was even more remarkable than the vast majority of movies there. Be sure to watch this movie again and again. There are many details that you miss the first time that deserve a second look.
