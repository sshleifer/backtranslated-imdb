PEOPLE IN THE MOON is a warm and touching drama of the majority, centered around a farming family in the 1950s. The main story is about a 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who falls in love with a 17-year-old neighbor (Jason London) who falls in love with her older sister (Emily Warfield), and how an unexpected tragedy changes the dynamics of this family forever. The 1950s are remembered with love here, and the script gives you characters that you take care of almost immediately. Witherspoon is already beginning to show Oscar-winning talent, which she will develop in this early role, and London becomes a charming leading man. Warfield lends a calm maturity to the role of an older sister, which is also effective. Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper, who plays the parents of girls, and Gail Strickland, who plays the London mom. I was unexpectedly touched by this quiet and thrilling drama, which awakens strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase “family ties.”
