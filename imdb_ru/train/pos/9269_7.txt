I probably doubled my knowledge about Iran when I saw the Secret Vote (2001). Now I know about four times more (I doubt that I learned a lot from “Not without my daughter” (1991)). <br /> <br /> Offside is a great Iranian budget comedy about a group of girls (working individually) to participate in a crucial football match for the place of their country at the World Championships. Women are not allowed to attend football matches, so the country's armed forces were mobilized to rescue any women who are trying to enter from themselves. Some (teenage?) Girls try to break the party by dressing like boys, but they are caught. The film is mostly shot on this pen, where the girls are held up by the soldiers in anticipation of some unspecified punishment (although the girl, dressed as a soldier, claims that she was one sign of difference from execution!) <br /> <br /> The film explores the absurdity of the situation. The idea, which prohibits women from participating in football matches, is that this is too rough an experience for women - a philosophy that was not known in the West less than 100 years ago. This farce comes to mind when a girl needs to go to the bathroom, so the soldier who accompanies her demands that she close her eyes so that she cannot see the graffiti. The conflict is not entirely about sexual battle: at some point, there is some friction between the soldier who lives in the countryside and the girls who live in the cities. Fortunately, this film was not too esoteric culturally, that the comedy was lost on this neighbor and the cultural cousin of the Great Satan. You should be in the mood for this, but no one should avoid this film because they think they will not get it.
