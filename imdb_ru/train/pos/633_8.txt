Stardust Another Guarded Review (originally written June 15, 2007) <br /> <br /> A marketing machine just for this start (no website yet? Wth?), So I doubt that most of you have heard of that. Truth be told, I didn't have (sort of). When I received the message, I thought it was a different code name, and actually worried that it was Transformers, one of the films I want to watch when I don’t work, so I enjoy it 100% like a mere mortal moviegoer. It turns out that it was not Transformers, and I knew about it even when it was “that film of Neil Guyman”. What is it about? In short, this is Guyman’s fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star. Moreover, and I will distribute information about the plot, which (a) is a violation of the contract, and (b) spoils your pleasure. If you really want to know what it is about, buy a book. Rumor has it that Guyman may be something of a writer. <br /> <br /> Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so nice if the surprise is worth it. And for this, it certainly was. This show was “special” in the sense that not only film critics took part in it, but also exhibitors (they rarely have a mixed show), as well as local science fiction and fantastic people. So, you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and the name "Stardust" I knew what to expect. <br /> <br /> Oh, how cute I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a fairy tale, written by the author became famous in the comic. But it was not the Lord of the Rings. It was not even another imitator of the Lord of the Rings (hmm, Eragon). It was much more intimate than all that. <br /> <br /> But, like The Lord of the Rings, it’s the humanism of the film that sells fantastic qualities. This is definitely a romantic tale, but with a generous outburst of humor. And this is humor, which is not a slap. This is more like a drama than a comedy. Before I continue, let's do this film review. <br /> <br /> Act at least well. For fantasy movies, it's always difficult to say something more, but I believe that there were important superbly played roles. Michelle Pfiffer, unfortunately, not one of those. She plays a villain and she does her job. Nothing special. Rupert Everett, however, he was a real jerk. That is a great villain. Peter O'Toole, well, Peter, damn it, O'Toole - this is wonderful. Ricky Gervais played well and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed to be too much fun. When he wanted to deliver the goods, he did it. And Charlie Cox (who?) As the main character was a great surprise from a guy I had never heard of. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I always had a mixed opinion with her. She can be gorgeous, and then she can seem like she missed the mark. In this she is the first. And she, literally, the star of this film. Of course, her accent stumbles here and there. And yes, it is not as good as it could be when Coke is not on stage. However ... well, see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Special effects are muffled, but achieved and are significant only where they should be. Best flying ship - sorry, Potter. The direction is carefree and beautifully flowing. Cinematography could be better, but not all films in New Zealand. Everything else is the top bracket. <br /> <br /> And now that everything is ready ... <br /> <br /> ... a letter. Oh, the letter! Neil, the devil In today's environment it is difficult to do something original, and first you start to wonder. The kingdom, the dying king, a boy to prove his worth, witches, ghosts, a quest (or three) - what's new? But the story of Guyman attracts you with its superficial acquaintance only to turn it all into a sweetly original story about a boy and his heart. And, although you suspect how it all will turn out, you begin to wonder in the third act and — if you — I — find yourself embroiled in causing climate confrontation and hoping for the best. In the end, you will find this story, this film, what all fairy tales should be, but too often it is not. Fantastic and real. <br /> <br /> (I would like to talk about Septimus against Tristan, but I will not spoil it for you. For those who read the book, be sure everything is done correctly.) <Br /> <br /> Those who I spoke with later, made the same impression as me. A great film for all ages, as well as a new {OPEN} for this generation. The form is filled only after the film is released in a wide sale, because perhaps you are expecting it. You will still know when you exit. I sincerely hope that Stardust will not get lost among the tents. Even if that happens, I’m happy to extend my hand to everyone I know. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> <br /> Forgot to add the message {WITHHELD}. I was a few years late, but ... "A great film for all ages and a new PRINCESS OF BRIDE for this generation." <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is a slightly elevated assessment, but I am still sure that there will be years now, the same answer will be “Oh, I love this film”, as for “Princess of the Bride”. ,
