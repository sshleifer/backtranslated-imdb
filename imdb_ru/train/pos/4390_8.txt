In the process of establishing empathy for viewers to Jake Redell (Tobey Maguire), filmmakers slander the North and Jehohoker. Missouri never left the Union, and the Union Army was not an invading force. Southerners fought for the rights of the state: the right to own slaves, elect dishonest legislatures and judges, and use the system of political booty. There is nothing noble in this. Missourians could easily go east and join the Confederate army. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this story has nothing to do with ambiguity. When Jake leaves Bush hackers, itâ€™s not because he saw a mistake in his path, he is certainly not inferior to the dignity of the reason for the cancellation.
