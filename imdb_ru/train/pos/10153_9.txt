I caught this movie on a test view. I was very surprised to find a really sweet and funny story. Well acted. Natasha Henstridge - the next Julia Roberts. Male leadership was awesome. Very funny movie. Located in the best places in New York. Made me want to go there. I just saw “You have mail”, I thought that “It must be you,” it was a much better story. Fresh. <br /> <br /> It was clean and healthy for the whole family. The audience, which I saw, very much. Definite recommendation!
