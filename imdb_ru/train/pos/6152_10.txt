Fabulous, fantastic, probably the best musical adventure of Disney. I have loved this film for over 35 years, because it is so creative, smart and funny. Even in spite of the silly "flying bed" scenes, other scenes and dialogs are magical and funny. Could they have picked anyone better than Angela Lansbury to play at Eglantine? I can't think of anyone more suited to the role. Redoing this classic would be just as stupid as redoing Mary Poppins. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson, although he had few quality movie roles, was absolutely brilliant in this adventure. He was a comic genius who is often forgotten today. Agitated, prim and proper Englishman - no one could really do a slap in the face and pull it out as gracefully as he. It would be tragic to remake this film, because Tomlinson had been dead for several years, and no one could stand in his place and do justice to his character. <br /> <br /> Dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura about them that other movies with witches simply do not shoot. I especially like the places where Germans invade Eglantinaâ€™s house, and she must defend him in all possible ways. <br /> <br /> Jumping on it, swaying along the bottom of the beautiful salty sea. Richard and Robert Sherman outdid themselves for their musical numbers. All of them are fantastic and worth remembering, Portobello Road is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> An excellent film that is still being preserved !!
