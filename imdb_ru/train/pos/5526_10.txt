I love cinema, so what I'm going to confess embarrasses me deeply. I gave a thumbs up "Che, parts 1 and 2" without seeing the film. I know terribly. But I was trapped by ... who? I really do not know, but there was a negative word of mouth that spread like wild fire, and no matter how clever I was, I fell into it. But, fortunately, I stumbled upon the argenine director Martin Donovan, the man I love and admire. When I told him that I would not see him, because I knew that the film was a failure, he looked at me as if he were ready to hit me in the face, and Donovan was a pacifist! He took me aside and said how much he loves the film and why. I immediately watched both parts, and “Che, Part 1 and 2” is the best film I saw in 2008. He is so pure that he reminds you of the work of some of the great masters of the past. Respect for our audience is something we are no longer used to. I don't know if we ever were. To rivet, to move, without concessions and Benicio del Toro is just extraordinary. We can see his soul, we can actually perceive it. Human humanity is enormous. So, thanks to Martin Donovan again for teaching me so honestly. Bravo del Toro, Bravo Soderberg and all who participate in this landmark film. Don't make the mistake I was about to commit. Go look, now, on the big screen
