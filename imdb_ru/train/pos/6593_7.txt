I have already watched this film twice and think it is quite good for the limited equipment used to make this film. (filmed in 1947) Dr. Heyerdal explains his theory about the migration of South American pre-Kolubian Indians to the Polynesian islands by dropping a raft of large balsa trees. This documentary follows Dr. Heyerdal and his team when they select balsa trees at Ecvidore and float with them along the river to the Pacific Ocean for gathering in Peru. They set out on a 101-day sea adventure, testing the strength of their primitive raft, which survives only through the means available to the natives of that era. See for yourself, a real adventure!
