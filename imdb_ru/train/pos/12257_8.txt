This is a better adaptation of the book than a book with Paltrow (although I also liked it). It's not that Beckinsale is better - they are both very good - but the script is better. Davis is the master of Austin's adaptation to the shooting, and there are very good production figures here. He is not as brilliant as Hollywood, but he is close, and I thought that places and costumes actually work better.
