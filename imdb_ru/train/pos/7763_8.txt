One thing about Hollywood, someone has success, and he is always in a hurry to copy. And one more thing: the players give their best performances away from their home studio. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson received such awards for his work in the Texas film The Giant, which Universal executives were supposed to think about, let's quickly take it to another modern Texan environment. <br /> <br /> Robert Stack also received excellent reviews about High and Mighty, as a pilot who cracked under the pressure of flying on a damaged plane, which was quite natural to give him another crack to the role. <br /> <br /> Both of these goals were achieved in "Written in the wind." Previously, Hudson was the owner of a large ranch, now he is the son of the hunting companion of father Robert Stack, who took Hudson under his wing. In other words, James Dean breaks up without the racism of James Dean from the Giant. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency that Hadley Oil Stack uses. Hudson loves her, but she is blinded by millions of Stack, and when he cares for a girl, he has the means to actually campaign. She marries Stack. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, we have Dorothy Malone, the immoral sister of Stack, who loves Rock, but Rock is not going to get confused with this wild child. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone spent more than 10 years in a heap of colorless roles of the heroines of the film before landing on this gem. She received an award for Best Supporting Actress for the role of Marily Hadley, and it was well deserved. <br /> <br /> If you like the catchy technical soap opera of the fifties, then this film is for you.
