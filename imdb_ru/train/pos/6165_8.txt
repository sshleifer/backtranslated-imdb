Yes, some of the stories are a bit difficult to track, and Bill has a propensity for violence, but in fact this is an exciting show that I try not to miss. The overwhelming majority of episodes are very exciting and rather tense, and the acting is pretty good, although I miss Robert Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carti as Gabriel Kent. I admit that I prefer the older episodes to the new ones, and I am a little ashamed that the program is now at the watershed, since it was easier for me to watch when it was at 8.00. Nevertheless, why I like The Bill, because it is not only fascinating, but in the end, the scraps make the next episode inaccessible. True, it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this program as a program that does not try to take itself too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
