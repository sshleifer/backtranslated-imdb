“Shower” is a story about loyalty, about the steady progress of the modern world at the expense of a rather traditional and more human way of life. A man is forced to choose between a successful career in business, life in a big city, his wife and his backward young brother. An eternal doubt between what we WANT to do and what MUST do. Modern China vs ancient. Public baths with its collections, its cricket battles against shopping centers and skyscrapers. Many old men and women who are no longer needed. China, one country, two systems, as Xiao Ping said ... although one of them kills the other. <br /> <br /> Gentle, lively, full of funny moments and bitter-sweet. Sensitive will cry and laugh equally Actors are huge, especially the one who plays the role of a backward boy; and Yang Zhang does a good job, easy, simple, allowing history to develop independently. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
