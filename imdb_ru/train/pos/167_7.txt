"Dance, Fools, Dance" - Crawford Gable's early vehicle since 1931. Crawford plays Bonnie Jordan, a rich young woman whose life consists of parties, drinking and taking clothes to jump from the yacht and swim. It all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (William Bleckwell) penniless. Bonnie gets a job in a newspaper under the name of Mary Smith; her brother goes to work for the bootlegger. The main character is Jake Love - he is portrayed by Clark Gable, when he plays another cheater. Later, of course, he turned into a romantic hero, but in the early 30s MGM used him as a bad guy. Not realizing that her brother is engaged in illegal activities, Bonnie is getting close to Louva. <br /> <br /> Gable and Crawford have created a great team. Her facial expression is a little wild, but this, along with her dancing, is one of the things that makes the movie fun. Look at Cliff Edwards, Gimney Cricket's voice, like Burt. <br /> <br /> It is always interesting to watch films with a preliminary code, and “Dance, Fools, Dance” is no exception.
