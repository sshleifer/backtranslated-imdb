The lady from Shanghai is proof that the great genius Orson Welles could make a mainstream movie if he wanted to. Compared to his other, more artistic works, this film has only a small amount of cunning and almost no esoteric elements. <br /> <br /> An exception is, of course, the final scene in the hall of mirrors. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest scenes in cinema history. It alone is worth the cost of renting. <br /> <br /> The gorgeous game of the beautiful Rita Hayworth was a sweet surprise. Her play at the beginning and in the middle of the film is so excellent that she made other actors appear caricatures, not characters. Even the great Mr. Wells.
