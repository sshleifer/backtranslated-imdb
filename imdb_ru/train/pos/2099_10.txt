It is superb - great game, scenery, clothes, music - but most of all a story. <br /> <br /> I am amazed that there are no more reviews of this film - certainly one of the best of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This is also a wonderful film that can be seen in tandem with a magnificent “Random Harvest”, which in many ways resembles the initial crisis. <br /> <br /> is an unknown English middle age from the First World War. The officer is in hospital by the end of the war, suffers from shock and total amnesia, having no idea of ​​his name, origin or anywhere else where he belongs - he turns out to be a very wealthy person - when he “recovers” he doesn’t remember before the war - <br /> <br /> But this is where the similarity of the films ends. <br /> <br /> I warmly thank everyone who took part in the film, especially the actors Jan Holm, Alan Bates, Ann Margret (what a wonderful and amazing choice of actors), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. <br /> <br /> This one will stay with you forever.
