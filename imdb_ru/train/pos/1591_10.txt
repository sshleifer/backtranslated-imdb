My mom and I just recently became addicted to this show, laughing at our asses! I only saw about 10 episodes, and I am disappointed that I did not pay attention to this funny series until they were canceled! The storyline is very funny, the characters are really great personalities (or not so good, but they are all funny!). I TiVO every episode that I like about you. Amanda Bynes and Jenny Garth, like all actors, never leave me bored while watching! There is some inappropriate language for children and some sexual content, but you shouldn't have too many problems along with parental guidance. There are some kind of "Friends" relationships that attract me to this show. I really like it.
