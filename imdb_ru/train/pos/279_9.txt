I love how this game can literally make you jump out of your seat while you play. The way the screen jumps and blinks when you hit is very realistic, and at the same time you have to remember that this is just a game and you are not there. The sound effects and sound are awesome. There are many weapons and various spells that you can play, and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not. You get this gem that can beat off enemies while you regain mana to blast your enemies with even more magic. The best part is that all the time when you play it, you are really nervous and afraid of what might be hiding around the next corner or what might jump out behind you. If you want to get the full experience, try to play it with headphones.
