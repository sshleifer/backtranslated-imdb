According to the lyric shot of John Ford, a fictional biographical film about the life of Abraham Lincoln, his greatest shortcomings may have been stupidity with a woman and the ability to dance in the “worst way”. Ford’s camera has only commendable looks to show Mr. Lincoln’s youth. But the fact that the film lacks the complexity of character, this compensates for the beauty and depth of vision. Uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of the early film, which could be a series of magnificent photo frames, Ford has a unique eye for telling the story. The film sings about the life of an encouraging young man. Henry Fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously intelligent Lincoln in one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> The film tells about two young men, brothers who are being tried for murder, which they both claim to have committed. In the classic style of the evil mafia, the city decides to take justice into its own hands and lynch them until honest Abe enters the fray. He fascinates them with his humor, telling them not to take away his first big case from him, and that they are as good as lynched to him, like the boys' lawyers. The following, it seems, becomes the basis for all judicial drama murders after Abe slyly interrogates the witnesses of delight and humor of the judge, the jury and the city, before stumbling on the missing links. <br /> <br /> The film is played out like so many of John Ford’s films: a tablespoon of Americana, a dash of moderate predictability, a hint of sarcasm, which you are not sure of whether you put in the recipe or whether Ford did it. Despite the frank "Hollywood" feeling of the film and the overly patriotic banter hinting at the future presidency of Lincoln, the film is completely pleasant and pleasantly built, if you can take your drama with a crumb of salt.
