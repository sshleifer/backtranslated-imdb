I am grateful to Cesar Montano and his team for reviving the once-dying Visayana. We hope that “Panagkha” is a forerunner of rebirth in this native language (which requires more speakers than Tagalog). Details of the dialect and way of life exactly resemble this region of the Philippines. Disadvantage: banal and untidy actor of the American antagonist. Another thing I did not appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the “historical” costume of the same character, and, above all, his bright red car, which, I believe, was intended for the roadster of the 30s. Without these small but glaring details, Panagkha would have been at least 9 out of 10 in my ranking - Daghang Salamat, Manoy Caesar! Addendum: this film certainly surpasses Pera Gallaga's Oro, Fee, Mata, in which another view of Visayi was presented during World War II. Alos, there are some parts where the cinematography goes back to Spielberg's Color Purple, and the storyline begins to resemble Noli Me Tangere.
