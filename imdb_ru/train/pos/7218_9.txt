The “death trap” is like a play in a film about who did what with whom, as it happens mostly on the same set. The premise is that an experienced playwright, whose star is falling, receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student, and therefore he plans to dismiss his protege and assign his play to the (loud) protests of his wife. Or, as you think, for the first half of the film. After the “halfway” mark, the “Death Trap” begins to produce unexpected turns and surprises that turn its premise upside down, then right around, and then in a crazy spin, all the while keeping its name appropriate. This is an excellent mysterious movie, soaked in wit. <br /> <br /> Michael Kane, as a senior playwright, plays himself in this film - a slightly crazy and very dramatic Brit. There are no surprises here - he does his usual good work. He gets the best Deathtrap line, which he perfectly performs: “How do you define success, being a gangster in the state prison?” <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve, on the other hand, mixes comedy and drama in an amazingly strong performance, playing an ambitious (and psychopathic) young playwright. He also shows off his very toned body, which he must have retained while filming Superman movies. <br /> <br /> Kane and Reeve collaborated on another film, which is one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off. He also revolves around the play, although this time Kane is the director and Reeve is the actor. They are joined by comic veterans Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilou Henner (Taxi) and Mark Lynn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together they demonstrate the disasters that happen to skipping ropes and the crew. At first glance, the film looks mostly like a farce, but after watching it, you will find that it is a lot of thin jokes that require more than one viewing to catch. It is a pity that this underrated film was available on DVD.
