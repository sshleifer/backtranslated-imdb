Skippy from Family Ties is transformed from a pure guy to a metal guy in this pretty funny movie. It seems that this film was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed that the metal music turns their children into evil or makes them kill themselves - except for this, the dead metal star of Satan tries to return from the grave to help out). And while the plot is banal and cliché, the perversity (for example, the evil green mist that removes the girl's clothes) and the soundtrack make the movie so fun (and gorgeous). And, of course, there is nothing better than Ozzy Osbourne playing a preacher who asks what happened to the love song :). Definitely a movie for a few friends to laugh. And while you're at it, make it a dual function with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - there is an “evil rocker” (as indicated on the video block) a driller’s killer in black leather with a fringe. Be sure to look for crappy movie fans.
