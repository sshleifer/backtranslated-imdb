Great job of Warner Bros with Errol Flynn in one of his best screen shows. He is often called his best, and I cannot judge fully until I see him "Dawn Patrol." However, his work in “They died with their shoes” is defeated. I'm a big fan of Flynn (he is my favorite actor after James Mason - it also helps him to be Australian), and I think he's just amazing, great on screen, and also great. He is the protagonist of "Gentleman Jim" as a legendary boxer with fashionable footwork, but he is also backed up by a literate, warm and funny script and an indication of Raul Walsh. Every Walsh film that I saw never loses the beat, he was really a born director. Walsh perfectly manages the ring scenes, as he does with the lighter moments and this sharp, gorgeous final scene between Ward Bord and Flynn. Add to this the excellent production values ​​(“The Merry Nineties” have never looked better!) And an excellent cast, and this is pretty much the perfect entertainment. Alan Hale used to play Flynn's bosom friend, but here is his father, and he still works. Alexis Smith is Flynn's love interest. A pair of ears in love with a fight with each other.
