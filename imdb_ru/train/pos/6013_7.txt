Watching this again after a long break and recalling the failure that occurred after his initial release, I wonder how well he endured. One of the reasons for his failure was that one generation simply thought that it was over with indulgent shit, and the younger one was disappointed that it did not show the full fame of hippies. Now it is clear that Antonioni was already aware of and admiring the intoxicating mixture of hot enthusiasm for change and the absence of any clear vision of the future. The lead couple is great, and it's a shame that they took so much for the alleged failure of the film. They are ideal and perfectly convey various contradictions and demonstrate pure enjoyment of love. I blame others for the fact that at the beginning they focused on the succession of the student uprising, but I must say that from this point on it is one of the directors of the most beautiful pictures, and he certainly received the best of artificial and natural landscapes. Oh, and I didn't even mention the explosive end.
