This film is about the side of Ireland that Americans usually do not see, the narrow-mindedly religiously prejudiced side of the “most friendly race in the world.” The film, according to Fethard residents, who are old enough to remember events, is quite accurate (although they insist that the filmmakers invented some of the most cruel scenes just to liven up the action). <Br /> <br /> The film was very unpopular in Ireland because it portrayed the Catholic Church in a bad light, but the simple fact is that representatives of the Catholic Church * organized * minority vetoes (before the Protestants were Jews). <br /> <br /> The film is a fascinating insight into the whole problem of religion in Ireland.
