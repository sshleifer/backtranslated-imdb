John Tau, the famous inspector Morse, plays old Tom Oakley in this film. Tom lives in a tiny English village in 1939 and at the beginning of World War II. A little recluse, Tom was still recovering from the death of his wife and son when he served during the First World War. If you can imagine Inspector Morse is old and retired, doubly knitted than when he was a policeman, then you have the character of Tom Oakley. <br /> <br /> Yet this heart of flint is about to melt. London children are evacuated before the blitz. Young William (Willie) Beech is quartered with the protesting Tom. Nick Robinson plays Willy with good effect. <br /> <br /> This boy needs to be cared for with a capital C. Behind the school, still wetting the bed and unable to read, is the smallest of his problems. He comes from London terribly, his mother, to put it mildly, is unable to cope with this. <br /> <br /> Slowly but steadily, a man and a boy warm each other. Tom again discovers his ability to love and care. And the boy learns to accept this love and care. See how Tom and Willie build a bomb shelter at the end of their garden. Look at Willy's joy because Tom was probably the first to have a party for his birthday. <br /> <br /> Not to part with the ending, but after a great struggle, Willy is adopted by Tom, and the couple starts a new life much richer for their mutual love. <br /> <br /> In this film, Thaw and Robinson follow a long line of films where a man meets a boy and develops mutual love. See the late Dirk Bogarde and John Whiteley in The Spanish Gardener. Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti in the movie “It Started in Naples”. Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Wadas in the movie "Captains courageous." Or Mel Gibson and Nick Steel in Man Without a Face. <br /> <br /> Two interesting things. This is the only kind of thaw that I know where he sings. Only a verse from the hymn about New Jerusalem, but he sings. <br /> <br /> Secondly, young Robinson also starred in the second film with the participation of "Tom" in the title "Midnight Garden of Tom", which is based on the classic children's novel.
