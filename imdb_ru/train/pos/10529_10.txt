By no means is my favorite Austin novel, and Paltrow is not my favorite actress, but I found the film almost entirely delightful. Paltrow does a good job, and Cummings, Stevenson and the one who plays Miss Bates are absolutely amazing. Period details are not alienated; In fact, the feeling of the film is just right. But the real “find” is Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley. There can be no more perfect casting, IMO. I hated Mr. K. in the novel, but I found him surprisingly humane and humane. Beautiful appearance of Northam and smiling eyes is also not an obstacle for pleasure! Highly recommended. Anar
