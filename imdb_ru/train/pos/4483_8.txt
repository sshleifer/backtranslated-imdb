Everything should be a musical comedy. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) does not miss a single step, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) does not miss a single note. The scenes with them are very good, showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot. “I fall in love too easily” with Sinatra is an indication of his then and better future. "Mexican hat dance" Kelly with a young Mexican girl is amazing. Kelly certainly deserved her nomination for the best male role. And there is a bushel of truly ridiculous lines, such as: “Do you think the navy is taking dope?”; "Do you think someone sleeps a sailor to sleep?"; and "We have small problems, we picked up a small child." An extremely pleasant film, just to shake off the dust from the recently concluded World War II.
