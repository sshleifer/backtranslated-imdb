A flock unfairly slanders the lesser robbery of the "Se7en". It makes no sense to compare them, with the possible exception of a similar landscape in the final fight. <br /> <br /> Now that I cannot understand why The Flock is in some ways very interesting. Basically this is a drama, not a full-length thriller about a very vigilant social worker who watches sex offenders. At the very beginning, you can clearly see that his work got the better of him. This can be seen in two scenes, where he first interviews the criminal and slaps him, and secondly, when a woman tries to pick him up, and all he can think about are his standard questions from his questionnaire. <br /> <br /> Gere is very good as Errol Babbage, the aforementioned social worker. His way of doing his job is no different from a policeman, he carries a gun and constantly checks newspapers and supplies law enforcement officers with information about whether someone from his “flock” can be responsible for a sexual offense. He is also a man who has lost all the happiness of life, and his only relief seems to come from the need to seek his own justice in his flock. You see his smile twice: once when he apologizes for abusive behavior with his partner, and the other after he has beaten a member of his flock. <br /> <br /> Like an unexpected film, “The Pack” is not so successful. Somewhat confusing and with some annoying holes in the plot, but it has some striking scenery. <br /> <br /> In general, “The Pack” is a serious drama about a person performing inhuman work, and in the end he has to work hard not to be absorbed by the abyss in which he surrounded himself. The world in which we live is quite a sore point, and the further you can move away from the worst, the happier this person is. The pack perfectly understands this.
