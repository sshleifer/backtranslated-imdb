British newspaper reviews seem to have focused on the fact that reviewers tend to know Toby Young, the journalist on whose real film this film is based. The key word here is "based." How to lose friends is a fictional romcom. <br /> <br /> Sydney Young joins the prestigious gossip magazine in New York, where he begins to do stupid things after he finally understood and did everything right. This involves him in the sale, and the film has some serious points about journalistic honesty. However, they have not overdone it: the main content remains a comedy that centers around Sydney's misadventures. The script has its own cake, and it is eaten up by the fact that Sydney is a stupid, well-intentioned jester at the same time as an intelligent, moderately nasty skilled writer. This contradiction is never a big problem, because Simon Pegg (as Sydney) is too good at projecting sympathy. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges too underestimates editor Sydney, and Kirsten Dunst is quite anonymous because of the conflict in the end. The object of affection is Sydney And, as for Megan Fox (who plays the breathtaking star), I can only say the following: just say the word, Miss Fox, and I will leave my wife, sell all my things and buy myself a plane ticket to take my place on your side as your spouse. Of course, given that I'm a fat 56-year-old English accountant, you may not find my proposal too tempting, but it is still on the table. Considering how short her career was so far away, you might think that Megan Fox took on the role too early, mercilessly stirring up the role of an actress she seemed to want to become: however, she does it sweetly, with some skill and very sexy. This girl will go far. <br /> <br /> There is support from the most experienced performers - Mariam Margolis and Bill Paterson from the UK, Gillian Anderson and Danny Houston from the USA. <br /> <br /> There are a few moments of laughter, and I smiled most of the way. As always, an F-word appears when it is not really needed, although at least a couple of them are very funny.
