Unfortunately, the “8 Simple Rules” for exploring my teenage daughter was the latest comedy series that John Ritter began working on after his tragic death in 2003. He was one of my favorite actors. He had everything, a comedy (who can forget him in Three's company), but he was also a great dramatic actor (Unforgivable - you should watch TV movies). How much I loved all the other actors of the show (Katie, Amy, Kaylee). and Martin) John was a star, he was the main reason why I was attracted to the show in the first place, and it was his ideal comedy production that could cheer me up every time. <br /> <br /> I liked that the series was not sweetly sweet (just like I loved The Cosby Show, come on, they were too pleasant to each other, laugh), they brilliantly portrayed the typical family dynamics. It was quite realistic, despite the rivalry between brothers and sisters and quarrels between the parents, but they still remained funny. Many American sitcoms are trying to fill the show solely with morality, and what is not, and this show has not done so. Yes, there were some, such as addressing important issues, such as drugs and bullying, but they did not try to be anything other than a fun family comedy. <br /> <br /> The way they wrote John’s death on Shaw was brilliantly done, I still sob like a child every time I see him. You could feel how rude the emotions were during these incredibly heavy episodes. <br /> <br /> I am sad that the show has been canceled, I still enjoy watching the replays and never get tired of it. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, you will always remember for you the ridiculous image of this overseer father, who would prefer to lock up his daughters in his room, than invite them to meet with the boy =) You rock Ritter !!!
