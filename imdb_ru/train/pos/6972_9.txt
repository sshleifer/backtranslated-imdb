The epicode of Caprica (S01E01) is well made as a pilot. Indeed, this episode is exactly the same as the pilot DVD release. As already mentioned, episode 01 provides a very substantial basis for the very popular series "Battlestar Galactica" (both the original and the remake of 2007). This is most relevant to the 2007 series. Like the latest science fiction plots, this series explores "Virtual" life or the environment. On top of that, we have been given a lot in common about the line of the Adam family, as well as their relationship with the unrevealed (in the Battlestar Galactica series) creator of the Cylons. For the most part, this first episode revolves around the popular theme “Virtual” life and (as expected) the early life of the colonies and the birth of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> Overall, I rather liked this episode. Although it was not a new material for me or anyone who has already seen the release of the Caprica DVD pilot, the series seems very promising. As with many pilots, episode 01 leaves us with a coat hanger to provide an audience (science fiction community). I will definitely follow determination and development. <br /> <br /> I give this series 8 stars.
