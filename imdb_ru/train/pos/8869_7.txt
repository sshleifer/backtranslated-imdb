In this little movie we have some wonderful characters, but a very small plot. In fact, it's nice to watch, because Singleton does an excellent job with esoteric conflicts and interpersonal relationships. This makes the viewer forget about the non-existent realism for which this film is supposedly intended. In fact, we have all the possible clich√©s and stereotypes superimposed on celluloid at a speed higher than that of soap. Definitely not a deep film (even if he wants to), but better than a regular college film.
