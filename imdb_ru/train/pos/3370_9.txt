Having finished The Chronicles of the Heroic Knight just a few minutes ago, I feel extremely welcome, but questions still hang over me. Although it may seem that the first 7 episodes or so are a retelling of the events of the first Lodoss War Record, in fact it is not. It may seem that the creator of CotHK had a different vision of how the original ended (and this may be the reason for the appearance of the first 7 episodes), but I do not think this is so. CotHK really says that it starts 5 years after the war with Geros, of which Parn was a part. I think the director made the first 5 episodes look just like the original's summary, just to give the viewer a small reminder and introduction to the characters and their actions, because they appear much less after the show breaks into Spark's story. Now, when the series goes to Spark, we will be raised another 10 years (15 years after the war with Geros). Spark and his team in some cases remind Parn and his team as soon as the journey begins, especially the love story that is brewing between Spark and Bottom. I also thought at CotHK several times that I threw it into the original series, and if it were not for Spark's long blue hair, I would have known that I would have pressed the Stop button several times to make sure that the correct disc was inserted. however, given these major failures, the authors did an excellent job of creating believable characters and a wonderful storyline. The only thing that upsets me is the return of the Ashram and Wagnard. Hmmm ... how ??? Do not misunderstand me, both great villains, although the only evil feature of the Ashram is that it supports Marmo. Perhaps I missed something during the rough series that explained this part. As for the sequels, I highly recommend CotHK. I put CotHK, and even more, the original Book of War of the Lodoss much higher than the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Both are more epic than anything I've ever seen or read. I highly recommend it.
