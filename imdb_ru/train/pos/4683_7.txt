(Question) What do you call the 100 film critics buried by the neck in the sand? (Answer) Good start. Well, I don’t know Peter Matthew from Adam, but if he is a budding author, his filmography suggests that “Love at the time of money” is a “good start.” A stylish shot with fancy music box-style music, this film looks at a chain of obscure relationships when it moves from person A to person B to person C ... and so on ... and back, ending with people A & B in a carousel manner, the film gently examines the unfortunate circumstances of nine people with subtle strokes beginning and ending with a street whore and her client. The disadvantage of this film is the lack of a story that may have something to do with the many critical blows it received. Last night I watched the behemoth Angels in America, and I was bored at the end, as long as this small group of character studies did not give me rest. Be careful. I may be the only person who really loved this movie. (AT)
