This independent black and white camcorder constantly shocks, surprises and surprises with its ability to create the most insane situations and then find humor and interest in them. These are all funny and ridiculous things, but no matter how ridiculous the majority of the film is, there is a heart and a reality that keeps the film in sight, keeps the entire film from drifting to complete madness, and this is the real message. This film is about how we all survive in a mad world. This seems to be the heart of the movie. Leon, 30 years old. the old newspaper peddler, the protagonist, always tries to keep it together. He is like a child who always tries to catch a balloon that floats away so that everything will work out in the best possible way so that everyone can have what he wants. <br /> <br /> A scene from the film might have gone far beyond that, but an exceptional cast does keep the piece connected. Van Meter, perhaps the best of all, who performed here, thanks to the play, shining through her ridiculous tics. Like the characters in the film, we lose sight of her sudden flashes to see the real person below. <br /> <br /> Maikovsky is a real genius here. He takes the most ridiculous bends of the plot and keeps them real. It is his script and its composition that helps to keep it all afloat. This is a real testimony of Maikovskyâ€™s mastery and all the participants that this film, with its fascinating plot and characters, never gets on our nerves. Maykovsky made a film that could be abrasive and disgusting, and somehow gave him composure and humor. This is a unique film. Do not miss. <br /> <br />
