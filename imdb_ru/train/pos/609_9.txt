Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside the fantasy world to find a little fallen star and find that the star is alive, young and beautiful. The kingdom whose king is about to die said that the king had unleashed a contest with his several sons to find out who could get the ruby ​​first to become king, while the trio of witches wanted the star to be shared and used to save their young. These three subject threads are closely intertwined throughout the whole picture, mixed with good acting, dazzling special effects, as well as solid feeling and humor. “Star Dust” is a funny movie, in which there are several funny performances, such as Claire Danes as a star (I could look at it for quite a while) and Michelle Pfeiffer (I could look at it with full magic power even longer), playing the terrible witch Robert DeNiro playing a little boy in an air pirate to perfection. Charlie Cox in the role of leader. Tristan is friendly and trustworthy, and we get a very good job from a group of guys playing sons like a king who constantly and consistently try to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Fleming and Ruppert Everett play their part well both in life and in death (I really liked this whole topic). Peter O'Toole plays the dying killer dad and watches the funny man Ricky Gervais, who made me laugh the most for the entire movie in his short five minutes (beautiful legs). But the real strength in the film is Neil Gaiman’s novel and the script created by his creative and fruitful mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world, and it works.
