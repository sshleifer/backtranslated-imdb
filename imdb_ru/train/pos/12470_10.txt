I just watched this movie on tv. <br /> <br /> I lost my father when I was young, and this film certainly touched me. <br /> <br /> I feel that I lost a little girl Desi had a feeling <br /> <br /> of wanting to see her father again .. <br /> <br /> wanting to talk to him .. <br /> <br /> or at least I gave the opportunity to say goodbye .. <br /> <br /> and I am so touched by the letter that was written to her. <br /> <br /> Saying her father read her letter and sent it to someone to answer her and buy her a gift, because there is no store in heaven .. <br /> <br /> it just allows I feel that miracles really exist ..
