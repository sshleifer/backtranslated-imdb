Bruce Almighty, one of the best pictures of Kerry in ... well ... for a long time. It contains one of the funniest scenes I've seen for a long time ... Morgan Freeman plays God well and even chips in a few jokes that are amazingly funny. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring, but overall a great movie with some funny scenes. The best scene is where Jim spoils the lead voice. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
