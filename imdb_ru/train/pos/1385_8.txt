I saw him at Cinema MK2 Hautefeuille just one night after his first public show in Paris. A very cute film about three 15-year-olds, all of them at about the same psychological stage. Many scenes allow us to return to our youthful age and our first feelings about sexual relationships. One can imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of girls to lesbianism, but even in this case it does not spoil the likelihood of the story. Sometimes a movie may seem a bit slow, but this is what creates this intimate atmosphere. I finance young talent actresses, especially the mention with Floriana and Marie, very convincingly. There are many small details, but this film also let me know what synchronized swimming is: impressive!
