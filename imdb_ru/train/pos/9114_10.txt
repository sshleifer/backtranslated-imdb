Given the lack of art in African cinema (or Black American Cinema). The idea offers a multi-dimensional view of the community, designed for hoods and dealers. But the funny thing is that this is not a focus or even a short circuit. But this is the most irrefutable assertion of independence from these topics. The genre is unique, not typical wait. It is this departure that is the first to strike the eye, so watching it twice is very important. The film has an aesthetic quality that is supported by the real art of cinema. <br /> <br /> And it is this art with an African voice that is extremely rare. The film does not copy, in order to reach its message, it innovates and provokes, drawing thin stereotypes (not racial, but character-based stereotypes). From the point of view of writers, the film is great. He carries many messages that include very fast character development. It must be remembered that this film is less than 10 minutes and it manages to establish a character very quickly. The use of color textures and music is also commendable. But, given that the director, the last enterprise of Owen Alik Shahada 500 years later, you can expect music. But from the thematic point of view, it seems that the idea is a withdrawal, and the satire indirectly goes into a social problem - brilliant material!
