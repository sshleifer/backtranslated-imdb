Joyful, but naive, big Joe Buck leaves his home in Big Spring, Texas, and goes to the Big Apple in search of women and big money. In New York, JB meets with disappointment with Ratzo Rizzo, a scruffy, but cordial cheater. Somehow this inappropriate couple manages to survive each other, which in turn helps them cope with a tough, sometimes brutal, urban America on the way to a sharp ending. <br /> <br /> Both the funny and depressing “Our Midnight Cowboy” crashes into a whirlpool of cyclonic cultural changes and thus confirms the viewers of 1969 that they themselves were swept away from the era of innocence of the 1950s and rejected as Dorothy and Toto, in the epoch of the 1960s, Aquarius. <br /> <br /> The director of the film is masterful, the casting is perfect, the game is top-level, the script is clear and convincing, the cinema is fascinating, and the music enhances all of the above. Oscar 1969, and I would call it one of the best films a cyclonic decades.
