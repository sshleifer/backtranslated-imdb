As a disclaimer, I saw the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I just saw a musical this week. This allowed me to judge the film without being spoiled by what was or was not in the musical (however, it spoiled me when I watched the musical :)) <br /> <br /> I really think Michael Douglas worked quite good in this role along with Casey. I think her scene “Let me dance for you” is one of the best parts of the film, a worthy addition to the musical. The dancers and singing in the film are far superior to the musical, as well as the cast, which is at least 10 times more (in the film it is, of course, easier). Decors, lighting, dancing and singing were also much better in the film, which was to be expected, and was really delivered. <br /> <br /> Songs that were similar to a musical are better made in the film, new ones are quite good, and in my opinion, the whole film gives more than a musical, especially compared to a musical that has several decors . One bad point in the film is the obvious gaps between the actors, the singers speaking and voicing while singing for some of the characters, but their dancing is impeccable and the final product was more enjoyable than the musical one.
