The idea is a very short film with a lot of information. Interesting, entertaining and leaves the viewer to want more. The producer has shot a short film of excellent quality that cannot be compared with any other short film I've seen. I rated this movie for the highest possible rating. I also recommend showing it to office managers and business people in any establishment. This implies the fact that people with ideas are never listened to, their voice is never heard. This is a lesson that any office that wants to go forward can learn. I hope that the producer will produce the second part of this “idea”. I look forward to viewing the sequence. Once again, I congratulate Halaqah media on producing a film about excellence and quality with a lesson.
