It was a gem. Awesome game from Lyme Cunningham leads, Eagles Brady and all supporting actors. The film raises the topic of not only Ireland and Irish history, but also many communities around the world and many marriage associations in these communities. With intensity and sincerity, the film shows how religious beliefs and traditions drove a wedge into a loving and passionate family. The name "Love was divided" could not better understand this. Despite the fact that it was a true story that occurred in Ireland in the 50s, when I saw the life of the whole village collapse and the “pogroms” begin to remind me of the history of Russia. Intolerance and prejudice are still too strong in the world, and, unfortunately, they are deeply hidden in human nature. As in the film, Liam Cunningham's character says that "hate has always been beneath the surface." It was interesting to observe the moral decisions that people made in this story. Also, the character of the Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story were very significant. The story, however, gives hope that the love of two people can conquer everything, and love makes us better and stronger. The character of Liam Cunningham goes through the whole transformation in the course of history, becoming the man he always wanted to be. Again acting game at the highest level. History is dynamic. Irish countryside is more beautiful than ever. Highly recommended.
