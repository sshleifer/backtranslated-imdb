I got into this great program around the 4th season, and since then I have seen that all the episodes got all the episodes on DVD and continue to get better and better with the seasons 9 and 10. Now it may not have Richard Dean Anderson , but the addition of Ben Browder and Claudie Black gave the show even more strength and originality even after 10 seasons. Unfortunately, now the sci-fi channel got rid of this amazing show, and without hope of rebroadcasting during the 11th season, there are two films made right on DVD and, I hope, more. Atlantis is still strong in its 4 seasons. And in the works the third direction - the Stargate franchise is far from dead. This TV show must be seen by all lovers of science fiction and genre genres, because it has such a wide range of things that can appeal to all ages and different people. See IT !!!!! 10/10
