"Lost" - the best TV series that is. First of all, it has BIG actors and great direction. Writing is a very controversial problem, because in the first two seasons the writing was unusual, but after season 3 the writing became very difficult. Who is Jacob? Why are there polar bears on the island? What kind of fog? How did the island disappear? Who is Richard Alpert? Many think that writers are lost and that they have raised many questions and riddles. what they cannot explain. I think these people are wrong. I have confidence in the writers. I think that if the secrets are revealed, all the charm of the series will disappear. In any case, the lost is undoubtedly the greatest series and it will continue for a long time.
