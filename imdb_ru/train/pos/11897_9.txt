This is a good little horror movie that indie fans will truly appreciate. He has a good game, a lot of blood and a decent plot. Recall one of such films as “The Hills Have Eyes” and “Pumpkinhead”. Obviously, the budget was not so big, but the film really compensates for its atmosphere and solid performances of actors, which, apparently, are not enough in many of today's large budget films with special effects. The film is really moving, and it has excellent direction and good camera work. There are no wasted scenes, so the length of the film is a bit short. In addition, it seems that the final leaves a start to continue, which would also be very interesting. So take some popcorn, turn off the lights and enjoy it.
