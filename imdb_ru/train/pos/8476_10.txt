*** Spoilers * <br /> <br /> My dad taped this film for me when I was 3 years old. By 5 years, I watched it more than 400 times. I just watched it and watched it. And I still do today! He has a dark storyline, the mother of a lamb is killed by a wolf - a very emotional scene - and wants to become a wolf like him. After many years of study, the lamb turns into a REALLY evil thing. He and the wolf go to his old barn, but he cannot kill the lambs no matter how much he wants. He ends up killing the wolf, but his former friends no longer see him as a lamb, and he cannot return to his former way of life. <br /> <br /> The art is great, the songs ... well, okay, and the voice acting is better than today. <br /> <br /> In general, you just need to watch this movie, this is a great masterpiece. Although today it is very difficult to find. <br /> <br />
