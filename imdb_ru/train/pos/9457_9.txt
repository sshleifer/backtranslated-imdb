How can you summarize how well and correctly and touchingly this film is? For several weeks, this DVD jumped from me every time I went to the store — after seeing Steve Carrell in several films earlier, I didn’t want to smear my thought process about him — so I resisted and resisted, until finally I grabbed it with “ What the hell! ”Attitude! And how surprised I was! I just wanted to buy it before. Having seen him three times in two days, I still smile at how the widow's image fights with three daughters, craves for what is missing from the date of the death of his beloved wife, who thus meets the intriguing woman, enchanting her in such a deep and An interesting (dare I say, bookish?) way, sheds a completely different light on life, which makes him realize that she is what he was looking for. <br /> <br /> Understanding that a woman is his brother's girlfriend complicates questions — which portray Dan as comical and shy with sincere grief, seeing how his “someone special” brings such fun and pleasure to a family home, and also in the lives of his brothers. You just start to feel it. <br /> <br /> Then, when Ruti Draper meets blindly, this is a turning point in the assessment of Maria Dan !! The look she throws at him when he repeats her comment that he does not like Ruthie is a pure green-eyed monster! It causes a completely funny scene when two couples compete on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the most well thought out, as Dan begins to weaken against Marie. <br /> <br /> Other heartbreaking scenes - Dan returns from the bookstore where his brothers collide. to describe what just happened .... when Dan's face goes down, it causes a sharp breath !! <br /> <br /> His youngest daughter, Lilly, who gives a gift, celebrates her love for Susanna, his late wife, brings a little warmth and a little sip when Dan realizes that he was the one who lost in life. <br /> <br /> When Dan plays the guitar and sings at a talent show ... his voice breaks a little when he repeats the song. ... the absolute gem! <br /> <br /> Recognition of what happens at the end of the film by his daughters ... they all three love their father and want to see him happy, will not allow him to deny his love for Marie; Dana's desperation does not let down his daughters, because he is their stone, their stronghold ... and to tell him much more than that, with just a few words. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I will leave it now - maybe I will come back and add more comments here in the near future .... but in conclusion I will say .... <br /> <br /> .... if you want to watch a movie this is so damn good, with comedy twists to light up a drama that never feels compelled or sad, that becomes a true depiction of a person opening a new life — not just with a woman, but with his extended family, then look no further. <br /> <br /> DAN IN REAL LIFE - 9 out of 10 for such a well-developed cinematic experience with the score of Sondre Lersch, who will take you very close, although not intrusive, with excellent performances of the cast. I can't wait to review it again !!
