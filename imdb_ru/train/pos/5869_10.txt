after watching Deer Hunter, which is a masterpiece, Jennif was supposed to fill big shoes. It has the same themes as the “Deer Hunter”, the devastating consequences for a person after the Vietnam War. as in the “Deer Hunter” and very good here, as is Katie Baker. But this film belongs to Ed Harris, who gives a powerful, emotional and spectacular performance. The film is based on a stage play, and there are one or two scenes where it was obvious to me. By this I mean that for these one or two scenes it seemed to me that I was watching a stage performance. It was not so important, and in fact it does not detract from the film. I really liked this movie. This is not an epic like the "Deer Hunter". They are about a similar era and have similar themes, but they are two completely different films. in this one that makes it so wonderful. for me Jacknif - 10/10
