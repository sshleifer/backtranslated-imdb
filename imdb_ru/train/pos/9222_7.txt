There were too few popular films in postcolonial Africa, and those that were mixed. This one, with its altruistic claims to expose slavery in the 1970s, shows Africa’s best and worst values, which, as it turned out, are not too different from the values ​​of humanity as a whole. He also has flaws, given the excessive influence of Western preconceived opinions of Africans and especially Arabs. <br /> <br /> Dr. Anansa Linderby, the beautiful African American wife of English doctor David Linderby, captured Arab slave traders, as well as a teenage girl from Sanufu and a boy. The leading slaver, Suleiman, is equally a stage Arab, with his floral and sometimes humorous rhetoric and gestures to conform to - which would be out of place in “Carry On Follow that Camel”, but does not conform to the standards the film deserves. Of course, Pyotr Ustinov had more than enough skills to eliminate some of the flaws in the script, and he saved what could otherwise be a terrible one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> Continuing the stereotypical theme, all three Suleiman Arab servants do not understand, and one of them has pedophilic inclinations towards the boy, which, fortunately, are not shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> One of the first ports of call for David is a local policeman, a stereotypical pompous and incompetent African bureaucrat. Then David meets two stereotypical white ex-pats, an Englishman (Walker, played by Rex Harrison) and an American (Sandell, played by William Holden). Sandell is a mercenary with "traditional" views on a mixed race relationship, who initially refuses to help unless David gives a prepayment. Conquered by David’s love for Ananse and realizing his inability to find love, he agrees to take David in his helicopter to help find Anans. They find Suleiman and his prisoners crossing the border, and cannot pursue them in the neighboring territory - as a result of Sandell’s indecision and David’s lack of experience with firearms, his helicopter was shot down, but David survived. <br /> <br /> Then we see how David met Malik (Kabir Bedi), an African who lost his family because of Suleiman, and now he is being chased by revenge. They find a Sanofu girl with a group of Tuareg and know that they are on the right path to find Suleiman. <br /> <br /> In one of the most heartbreaking scenes, they kill a group of slave traders, only to discover that it was not Suleiman’s group, and she had no other choice but to send her captives to the Tuaregs they met earlier. <br /> <br /> Later we discover that the boy who was raped is a sorcerer and in a Great scene with supernatural overtones, he uses his knowledge to kill one of Suleiman's minions. Anansa on her part - and, despite the boy's skepticism, it is possible to provoke the demise of two other employees of Suleiman. <br /> <br /> By this time, Suleiman and his slaves for several days reach the slave market. <Br /> <br /> Suleiman, who no longer doubts that Anans is a “problem,” is trying to sell her to an indecently rich Arab prince (Omar Sharif) who is corrupt, but smart. Having learned that Anans is an American working for the USA, the prince rather unwisely decides to continue trading without taking into account the consequences. The scene where two men bargain is one of the best in the film. <br /> <br /> In the slave market, a boy is sold to a middle-aged German pedophile, and we can only guess that the Boy will still be considered a “Wunderbar” when his owner gets all his witchcraft skills. <br /> <br /> David and Malik finally confront Suleiman, and from the point of view of Malik comes a bitter-sweet end. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, David and Anans are reunited, and Malik, whose life is ruined, can be comforted by seeing the task he set for himself. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot of the film is excellent, but it loses its marks due to its stereotypical image of almost all the leading characters. We must pay tribute to all the leading players for eliminating many of the flaws in the scenarios.
