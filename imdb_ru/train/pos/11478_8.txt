Chris and Andre are two medium, ordinary teenagers. Some did not understand and others did not. But together they stand and everyone will pay. Together they form an "Army of two." They plan and plan a “zero day”. On this day, they decide to storm their high school and inevitably kill 14 people in cold blood. Narrated through the tapes they made “Zero Day”, this is almost a made-up story about the tragedy of Columbine. <br /> <br /> “Zero Day” is one of those films that will then spoil your head. The two main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuk) do such a good job that their characters seem almost any teenage voter walking down the street. Their performances were very believable, you liked these guys, and it was scary. Filmed almost entirely in terms of a teenager, "Zero Day" seems very real and authentic, as if you were right there. These children try to explain their actions to the viewer, and the actors sell him to you. But keep in mind that from tragedy from beginning to end, it follows the tragedy, and for some the end becomes shocking and unpleasant.
