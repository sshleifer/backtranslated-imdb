I first saw BLOOD OF SAMURAI at its premiere during the Hawaiian International Film Festival. BLIMEY! The blood simply shook us with its pure inspiration, blood, vitality, blood, excitement, blood, complete politeness and even more blood, and all this in such a GREAT FUN! Especially for those of you who love all these samurai films and ninjas about Japanese Chambaras, YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD SEE THE BLOOD!
