I'm so glad I got the chance to see this rare little gem of a movie. I saw it at the independent film festival, so don't expect it to come to your city soon. During the film, I noticed that about 10 people get up and go. Too bad for them (here in the south, people don't like to read subtitles). The film begins slowly, but is so full of dialogue that I was never bored. When the action finally arrived, I was glued to the screen, as if I was riding a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> I also got a big push from the titles of the chapters appearing before the chapters, especially those that represent the characters, as they appear on the screen. It reminded me of Zelda (Ocarina of Time) when you encounter level bosses. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of video games / comics movies, then I welcome that.
