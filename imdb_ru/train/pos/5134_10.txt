This short was nominated for an Oscar, and I would like it to win! In essence, this is a jam session filmed by several very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, incredible music! Hollywood quite often took jazz (especially animation, believe it or not), but this is a rare look at a film about improvisational jam. It was added to the list of saving films and deservedly. TCM periodically launches it as a filler and starts it every March sometime for its tribute "31 Days of Oscar". From the city center to the buzzer, the whistle, nothing but a net, and the shot is so smooth that the net barely moved. The most firmly and strongly recommended !!!
