This film horrified me so much that I watch it at least once a year. Sometimes I find it uncomfortable. Sometimes I find it encouraging. And I always find characters human and real. This is a film that shows you the harsh reality of life in Los Angeles, starting with the repeated lights of the search for a helicopter, which scan the dangers lurking so close to the ordinary life that the characters lead. It is also a film that shows you how a kind stranger can change your life and give you the opportunity to make a difference. The Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take, whether intentional or not, has serious consequences. I discovered that this film is in many ways similar to the film "Abbreviations" by Robert Altman. Both had a star list of well-played actors and actresses, and both films allowed you to gradually see how the characters interrelate and influence each other, for better or for worse. The Grand Canyon did a better job of providing a coherent message (hopefully, in the face of a desperate reality) than the Altman film, although I found them both intriguing in my own way. This film is a must see !!!
