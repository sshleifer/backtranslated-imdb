Great movie when I saw it. I must say, one of my favorite films of all time. I saw it as 8 times in the theater and got a DVD. When I got older and saw him again, I realized that the film is average. Compared to movies that are well-known and good comedies, this is nothing. I mean, Rock was hilarious in the film, and switching to racial things destroys small barriers, which is great. Also the thought of how the film goes is a good way of thinking. This is similar to most thoughts about the film, but also to a small twist, which is a very nice touch. I like the film as a whole, so I appreciate it ... <br /> <br /> Still a good 7/10 for me.
