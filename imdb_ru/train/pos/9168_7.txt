It was an incredible adaptation of Jane Eyre. the only problem I encountered was that I didnâ€™t like Zelah Clark. I thought she was too old and made Jane seem shy. in the book, Jane seemed like a much stronger character. I was really annoyed by this image of her. the part where the morning when Rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh. I think they made a bad choice in her role. but Dalton was absolutely beautiful like Rochester. he makes this version of Jane Eyre worth seeing. Another thing that made this version not quite 100% is the quality of the film. I know it was done in the eighties for television. if it was a feature film of better quality, it would be perfect. My main complaint, however, is that Zela Clark was definitely too old.
