I feel a bit defending against this film because it was my introduction to verse U.N.C.L.E. The year was 1972, and I.T.V. performed all eight functions in a single bumper run (followed by re-releases of Killers with starring Tony Curtis and Roger Moore) on Saturday evenings. Karate Slayers was chosen to open the season. It began with a cool action sequence when the Solo and Kuryakin sports car was attacked by a squadron of mini-helicopters THRUSH. From this moment on, I was a fan of life. <br /> <br /> After the main credits (it's nice to see a special sequence of headings here instead of the usual practice of slowing down the shooting), we go to the doctor's laboratory. .Simon True (Jim Boles), inventor of a new formula for extracting gold from sea water. The wife of Truth Amanda (Joan Crawford) had an affair with THRUSH agent Randolph (Herbert Lom). A really ruthless guy, he kills the doctor and his wife before looking for a formula. The truth is prepared for this event - he divided it into five segments, each of which is written in his photograph, and sent it to his five daughters, who are scattered throughout the world. <br /> <br /> Solo and Kuryakin intended to get the formula first, leading to a series of episodes in different places and cameos from such as Telly Savalas (like the Italian earl with a hard fist), Terry-Thomas and Kurt Jurgens. One of Dr. Truâ€™s daughters, Sandy (Kim Darby), accompanies U.N.C.L.E. boys in their global search. <br /> <br /> Having collected the formula, THRUSH turns and forces them to pass it on before throwing them away to their secret base at the North Pole ... <br /> <br /> Of all the uncles, feature films, this is which I thought should have been done specifically for the movie. It hurts to be a television product, even though it is a bit more expensive than usual. No on-site filming was done, and the various segments look like repetitive, usually ending in a scrap between U.N.C.L.E. and thrush. From the cast of Joan Crawford, Hammy remembered in her small role, and Kurt Jurgens was greatly mistaken as a sugar daddy. Like London's Bobby, Terry-Thomas is adorable as always, and Herbert Lom is good as the main villain. Kim Darby decides, though, as "Sandy." She should have told her to stay home. <br /> <br /> What is surprising about this is that she manages to be more fun and interesting than many of the official releases of cinemas of the time, including In Like Flint, Casino Royale and Ambush. I would like to know how Solo and company escaped from THRUSH H.Q. although after the death of Randolph.
