So your berns aren't sleeping? Wife visiting mother-in-law? Are you at home at least. This is a dark and stormy night, and there is no football on the TV, but do you need to fold the dishwasher? So what are you going to do? <br /> <br /> I will tell you! <br /> <br /> Go and make old-fashioned cocoa (Fries is better!) Take some ginger nuts and sit in front of the DVD. Now select and play in the thriller / horror film about the second world war of Arthur Askis “Ghost Train”, go back to this comfortable sofa and enjoy the night! <br /> <br /> The Ghost Train is a true British wartime classic! Arthur Asuka, with his side impact, Stinker Murdoch, entertains you, and I suspect that the cast, high octane, thrills and spills, is a spy thriller. It unfolds in old rural England during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> It is centered around a motley group of people who need to stay overnight, in circumstances beyond the control of anyone, in the old railway waiting room, which they discover is being pursued by an old train. <br /> <br /> The plot unfolds neatly and accurately, and this is the merit of the entire cast, it is with humor piece by piece, and sometimes really scary! <br /> <br /> (The fairy tale was written by that old boy Godfrey from the Army of the Popes, and he is smart) <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey is entertaining and very at home doing his exercises for you and the cast, he also shows that he can act a little! However, the actors never go on stage, even the railway porter and parrot give the film the necessary gravity. <br /> <br /> Oh, and when it's over, don't forget to fold the dishwasher!
