I watched the first 17 episodes, and this series is just awesome! I was not interested in anime series from the time of Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is actually based on the h-game, and I’m not sure whether it was done before or not, I didn’t play this game, but from what I heard, it follows very well. <br /> <br /> I put this series 10/10. He has a great story, interesting characters, and the best animation I've ever seen. It also has great Japanese music! <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen this show yet, watch it. You can find subbed episodes on some anime sites there, it is straight from Japan.
