This film is a very relaxed, romantic comedy that is very pleasant. Meg Ryan works very well as Albert Einstein's brilliant niece, although she believes in her skills. Tim Robbins does an excellent job with a mechanic who falls in love with her when she enters his store with her fianc√© after her car dies. I loved Walter Mattaw as the only Albert Einstein. This film has a very relaxing look, but it retains some seriousness (if it is really possible, it happens here). <br /> <br /> I personally found this film extremely interesting, especially old scientists - I thought they were terrific and fun! This film seems to be undervalued beyond understanding. If you have a cheeky sense of humor, this movie is for you!
