Dragon Hunters World is a three-dimensional gravitational world. The planetoids, pieces of buildings, and strange flat plants swim in the atmosphere, while the ground falls to most of the characters, is nowhere to be seen. This is a world that resembles the Infinite Story, when Nothing came to swallow the world. <br /> <br /> Funny enough, the villain here is also a World Gobler. This time it is a huge skeleton dragon with fiery eyes. The heroes are a big but silent warrior, an annoying and greedy assistant, managing the entrepreneurial side of the duet and strange useless animals. They are joined by the most talkative little girl in the world who, to my chagrin, did not die a terribly painful and, I hope, early death. <br /> <br /> The animation is great. Voices and sounds at the highest level. It is a pity that the story is as simple as you can imagine. They go to stop the World Gobler, they reach it almost immediately, they win it. The end. There is no real character development or plot twists. Even those that I would not expect from a movie with such a plot. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: it’s cute to watch, children will probably like it, but that’s it. There is no depth in this world (pun).
