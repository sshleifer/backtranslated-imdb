This film can be interpreted at different levels. Do not listen to other comments, beating the film and saying that this is a repeat story or something like that, and that this is just drugs. It has very open surface drug metaphors; however, the rest of the film (and why I think it was made personally) is really not about that at all. This is really mocking psychology and conditionality of society. For a split second you can see that the brother of the protagonist is watching these sick videos online. What for? My interpretation is to show that all this horror that we encounter helps us to be mechanical in our professions, and not to treat people as people. As for the logic scene, it also appeals to people who were in federal mandates for 1% of smart classes, who are confused and frustrated because life is not as predictable, mathematical and logical as it seems on a macroscopic level. You must apply Heisenbergâ€™s uncertainty principle (along with all other laws and uncertainty principles) not only to physics, but to life, and leave room to change your plans and adjust along the way. One of the best movies I've ever seen. It could go much higher than your head; it is not for you, it is for those people who have difficulties with life, and not mathematical problems. When you critically analyze a movie or write your critical review, try not to read the back cover first (written by marketers and parapsychologists)
