My interest rose when I leafed through and saw the name Iphigenia. My name is Eugene, so I thought, well, let's see what it is. I'm so glad I stayed on the channel. What a wonderful, wonderful story. Drama, sadness, some because of the incredible acting, but a great time. I watch it, and I feel sad about all the shit that the film industry is entertaining, and these beautiful little jewels are being missed. Give Iphigenia a try, and I hope you enjoy it just like me. I even made my children (27, 25, 20 and 17) enjoy it. It starts slowly, but the drama is being built, and you will be drawn into the story. Watching this beautiful movie made me want to plunge into Greek tragedy and pathos.
