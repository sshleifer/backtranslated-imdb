A nominal NR (will be R-R for common strong language and coarse sexual humor). Quebec rating: 16+ (must be 13+) Canadian home video rating: 18A <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy Crazy - Eddie's first comedy program. It happened in 1983. He then starred in the film 48 hrs and Trading Places, and he was live on Saturday night. Eddie shot two comedy action movies. Delirious and Raw. I preferred Raw because I just found the subject more humorous. as a kid and teasing celebrities like Mr. T and singers like Michael Jackson. Any fan of comedic films should see "Edith Murphy delirious."
