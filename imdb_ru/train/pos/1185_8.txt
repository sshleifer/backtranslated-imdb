Robert Taylor and Stuart Granger switched roles that they played in the film All Brothers were Valiant. Taylor seems a little awkward in his role as a bad guy, but Granger plays his part well. However, the real hero of this story is the bison and the northwest. The film is well done, with an atmosphere of wonderfully rendered times. The direction is tight, and although the film is not carefree entertainment, it is, in my opinion, a large film undeservedly ignored by Cognoscenti.
