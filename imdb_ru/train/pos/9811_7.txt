According to the book The Last of the Cowboy Heroes, which tells about Joel McCrea, Odie Murphy and Randolph Scott, the author says that Albuquerque was the only film that he personally did not watch because he claimed that he was lost. He has not been seen for years. <br /> <br /> Good for western fans when someone was doing spring cleaning at Paramount, because an imprint was obviously found, and now it is on the open market. Albuquerque is also a pretty good Western, and Scott is involved in a family feud with Uncle George Cleveland. <br /> <br /> George Cleveland sets off for his nephew Randolph Scott with the intention of making him part of his freight business headquartered in the rapidly growing settlement of Albuquerque. Cleveland is more than just a business owner, he is a city boss, whom he runs away from a wheelchair. He even has a sheriff in his pocket. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is not an evil cowboy hero. This includes not supporting relatives when they are villains. He goes to work for a rival, headed by brother and sister Russell Hayden and Katherine Craig. <br /> <br /> Cleveland is full of all sorts of tricks and even sends a Western Mata Hari in the face of Barbara Britton to gain confidence in his rivals. Barbara is great as a homegrown fox, who is developing her own program. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott's original home studio was Paramount, it was there that his first studio contract was made. Albuquerque marked the last film he ever made for Paramount, and they gave him a good one. <br /> <br /> Notice also Lon Cheney, Jr., who is the main henchman of George Cleveland, a rather disgusting man bully, and Gabby Hayes, who is simply Gabby Hayes. <br /> <br /> In 1948, Republicans from all over the country loved Albuquerque, and its main villain was the city boss, who drives from a wheelchair. A democrat from a wheelchair forged them in four presidential elections in a row, and he was gone. They also had high hopes for victory in the White House that same year, but everything went wrong, and they had to agree that the Ersatz boss would receive his visit to Albuquerque. Iâ€™m not sure why Cleveland was in a wheelchair because nothing really was done. I guess he got hurt and played his part that way because he had to. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Albuquerque must have been very attractive to the GOP market.
