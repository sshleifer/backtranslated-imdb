This is one of Jackie's best films, he has no opera mates Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, he has one of the best discoveries in any action movie, and it goes on like this when Jackie shows some high-quality stunts, the only criticism is that getting a little slow, but it shows up in the last 25 minutes in the film, and the end credits show what a crazy fool Jackie Chan is, just to make us happy movie fans
