“Dark Angel” is a cross between Huxley’s “Brave New World” and Percy’s “Love in the Ruins”. He portrays a not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order in the worst sense of the word. After someone has swallowed the premise that all modern technologies can be stopped by Impulse, it provides an interesting environment for exploring personalities and the relationship between the two main characters, Max (Dark Angel / Messenger on a bicycle) and Logan . It seems uneven, perhaps the result of many authors, but it is kept by an energetic, beautiful and charming Jessica Alba, who seems strong and calloused, but vulnerable and sensitive. I think Fox did it again.
