Holes was a great movie. Disney made the right choice. Every person I talked about with this said he LOVED it. All cast were worthy of the role they had, and Shea Labeuf really has a future in acting. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for the Guardian, she was exactly as I imagined her. to anyone who has not seen this, I recommend it, and I guarantee that you are “digging”.
