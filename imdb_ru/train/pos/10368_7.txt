Meryl Streep was incredible in this film. She has an amazing ability for accents, and she shows incredible mastery in this film as a whole. I really felt for her when Lindy was being chased. It was also played realistic. She became moody, upset and unpleasant when the media and the government continued their ruthless witch hunt. At first I did not expect much from the film, but I was really interested in it, and the film is based on a real person and real events. It turned out better than I expected. Sam Neill was also outstanding; this is the best work I have seen from him, and I really liked him in other films (for example, “Piano”). I gave film 7, but if I could only evaluate acting, I would give it 9.5, and a perfect 10 for the Strip
