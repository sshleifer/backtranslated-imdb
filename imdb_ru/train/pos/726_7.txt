A new director appeared in Vince Lombardi's high school â€” the evil Ms. Togar (Maria Voronova). She intends to ban rock and roll music all together. She butts her head with Riff Randall (PJ Soles), who loves the Ramones. Also, the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can not communicate with any girl - not even suspecting that cute Kate Rambo (Day Young) is in love with him. <br /> <br /> Instant midnight movie. It was released in general release and almost immediately exploded - but as a midnight film it was a huge hit and continued to play throughout the 1980s. I remember visiting more than a few when I was in college - it was like a party! People sang along with the songs, laughed loudly at every joke and, as a rule, just had fun. <br /> <br /> Seeing this as an adult now, I can't imagine why I liked it so much. The script is minor and full of groans, which I could not believe that I had heard. Characters change in random order, and the film starts jumping everywhere. It saves from some really funny lines and wonderful performances of Soles and Voronov (who REALLY enjoys). Also, everyone is full of energy and plays their roles WAY beyond (as they should). As for the Ramones ... I have never been a fan. I really like the title melody, but the rest of the songs never caught me. If you are a Ramones fan, you can get a higher rating. <br /> <br /> WARNING ABOUT SPOILER !!!! This is mainly for children (has a PG rating), who are likely to find it silly, but funny. I especially think that they will like the end when high school explodes! SPOILER END !!!! <br /> <br /> So if you are tuned to the silly midnight film of the 1980s, you might like it. Otherwise, stay away. I give him 7.
