The Night Listener is probably not one of William's best roles, but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat strange, but completely different film. I can guarantee you that you have never seen such a movie before. Some people may not like the slow pace of this film, but I think this is a big plus for the film. This is definitely one of the best films released in 2006. He has an intriguing performance in a film with great content, dramatic feeling. This is not an Americanized film. This is not a predictable movie. You just feel that this is a film that has secrets, and itâ€™s hard for you to determine what its outcome will be. This is not a great movie that has it all, but damn it, it's a damn good and very original movie.
