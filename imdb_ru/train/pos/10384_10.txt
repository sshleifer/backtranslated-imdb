After nearly 30 years, I remember this original PBS film as unbearably tender. Periodically, I check here on IMDb, hoping that someone has the good sense to buy rights and burn them to DVD. It is now September 2004, and I continue to hope - take a deep breath. <br /> <br /> One of the two main actors made a small career, mainly in evening soap in prime time; the other, Francis Lee McCain, has been seen in small roles here and there for several years. But nothing of what they did before or after did not coincide with this small film, which, as I remember, was filmed on the short PBS series, where original scripts of new and promising playwrights were shown. <br /> <br /> I watched it every time he showed up on PBS, perhaps 2 or 3 times. It was before the era of VCRs, so I have no record of this, except in my eyes. <br /> <br /> December 31, 2006 addition to the above: Happy New Year, ladies! This wonderful film is finally available on DVD on ladyslipper.org. As far as I understand, DVDs are recorded from a personal copy of the author.
