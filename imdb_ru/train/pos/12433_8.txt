This is a good film, although people who are not familiar with the comics and books about “Modesty Blaise” may find it a bit slow and devoid of action. For a modesty fan, the film will be very enjoyable, especially because he is very devoted in presenting the “story” of Modesty Blaise. Peter O'Donnell is listed in the credits as “Creative Consultant,” and the filmmakers must have really paid attention to it, since the plot follows the details pretty well, which were presented in comic books over the years {although the events should be redone in modern days). The only thing that can cause disappointment to a real fan is that there is no Willie Garvin in this story. This lack of Willie is again just true to the chronology of Modesty Blaise, since the film takes place in the very first days of the Modesty career. Alexandra Staden makes a very believable young Modesty, which in fact is very similar to Modesty. The welcome change from the parody of Monica Vitti in the depiction of modesty.
