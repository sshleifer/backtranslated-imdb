Drama Tillman Jr. about the first African-American scuba diving master (Gooding Jr.), who challenges all the odds and achieves his goals, despite the strict embittered coach. The script is not bad, sometimes a bit extreme, but the direction and the acting are excellent, and this film inspires and achieves what I have to do. I liked DeNiro in the lead role, although he is not on a par with his masterwork (taxi driver, godfather and all the others), he is as good as his other good performances, such as in King of Comedy or Angel Heart. Deniro here is always convincing and believable, very good performance, Gooding Jr. quite good, certainly one of his best performances. --- IMDb Rating: 6.6, my rating: 9/10
