Keep in mind that I am a fan of the genre, but only recently saw this film for the first time. The way I lost sight of all this time surprises me. For me, this is a better film than such a vaunted Noon This is a great western with great acting and a great story. DVD in beautiful black and white with outstanding cinematography. If you love Westerns or James Stewart, this movie should not be missed.
