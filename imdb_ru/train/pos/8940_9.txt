The autobiography on which this film is based remains one of the most heartbreaking books I have ever read. He tells amazing stories about two sisters who deserve loyalty and respect, working well in their 70 years as a teacher and dentist, and then lived another 30 years with dignity. Ruby Dee steals the film with her completely nuanced play in the role of the rebellious “black” Bessie, a dentist. She not only expresses well her anger, fear, and wisdom; it lets you know exactly where they came from, using word saving. Diann Carroll feels great older sister, a teacher, but I'm afraid that she never makes me believe that she is over 100. It doesn’t matter - the stories are worth telling. Amy Madigan is too extreme and intrusive in the fact that in the first half of the film, as a reporter for the Caucasian newspaper The New York Times, she was amazed and unsure of herself. This is also only a minor distraction. Stories, all truthful, attract attention, and although in translation two or three are slightly flawed, most of them do very well. <br /> <br /> I recommend this book as a basic reading to anyone I recommend any book I can’t, but this TV film is in this thin air, but it certainly captures enough flavor to be very valuable in itself .
