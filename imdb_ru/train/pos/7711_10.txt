So, Robbie looks a bit abnormal by today's standards, and some actions are rather unnatural, and most of the special effects can now be duplicated by a bright 12-year-old child with a decent computer editing program. And do not start me with a poster. <br /> <br /> This is a VERY great movie, 40 years after its release. I grew up on Sunday after watching "science fiction" in the local theater "Science Fiction / Adventure Theater", so I saw quite a lot of science fiction films from the 50s. At a time when most films were pleased to put on a rubber suit on someone and tear down a miniature model of the city, Forbidden Planet forever raised the bar and showed that you can make a science fiction film that really has a plot. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many SF films shot in the 90s will still be considered worth watching in 2030.
