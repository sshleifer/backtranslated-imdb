This is supposed to be one of my favorite movies, unlike the weak “Elven haunted houses” ... anyway, I like the way the movie tells the goth / wizard “The Wizard of Oz” ... <br /> <br /> Elvira - Goth Dorothy, who ended up in an unfamiliar city after the death of the good witch (Elvira's aunt Morgana) ... she inherited the ring "Ruby", which was an extremely powerful and sought after bad warlock (her uncle). She became friends with four characters, whom she unintentionally helps to grow throughout the film with the dog in tow. There is a show with her uncle (the evil witch of the West), where Elvira understands that she has power, and ultimately defeats him. In the end, residents of the city send her out after winning their hearts, and finally get to their destination in Las Vegas (Dorothy's house in Kansas). <br /> <br /> There are many references to the wizard of ounces everywhere. the film ... she and her uncle both quotes relate to their parallel characters. Elvira: “You must be Aunt Em, and you must be Uncle Remus ... There is no place better than home, there is no place better than home!” Bad Uncle Winnie: “I will give you my beautiful girl and your little dog!” <Br / > <br /> A sign that Elvira is passing for the first time on her trip, mentions the state of Kansas. <Br /> <br /> But aside from that, the fact that one of the sequences that she "ripped off, uh ... I mean, was inspired by FlashDance" is a pure genius ... and if you don't roll laughing at her tit spun at the end of her "very 80s" show in Las Vegas, then you have no bones in your body ... This film is a classic cult / camp
