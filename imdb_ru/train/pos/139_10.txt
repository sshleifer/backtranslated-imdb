First of all, Righet is wonderful. Good comedy and mysterious thriller at the same time. A good mix of the weird “dogma” style of storytelling along with good music and great actors. But, unfortunately, there is no end. For me, this is unacceptable. I thought ... how can you continue the story without Helmer and Drus? ... and I have an idea. I think Lars should make RIGET III a little different. I'm sure the third part without Helmer would not be the same. So, here is my suggestion. Mabel is a little stupid, maybe not. I know that Lars loves to experiment. So why not do a little experiment with Riget3? I think that the only solution here is to create a puppet animation (such as Trey Parker’s “Team America”) or even computer-generated 3D animation. I know that this is not the same as real actors, but in principle I think that this can work ... only this way the actors can be revived. For Riget fans, this should not be such a big difference - if the animation is done properly, the average “observer” will consider it normal only after the first few frames of the film. The most important thing now is the story. It is completely understandable that at present it is impossible to create Riget 3 with actors. So why not play with animation? And ... look for the opportunities he gives you! Even marketing one! The great director finishes his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation. Just a dream? <br /> <br /> I hope to someday see Riget 3 ... or even see only the script. I am curious about how the story ends ... and, as I expect, everyone is doing here. <br /> <br /> Greetings, Saj. <br /> <br /> ps: I'm not talking about Stephen King’s “kingdom” hospital ;-)
