Although there are some flaws in this film, it is worth seeing. I chose him because of the cast, and applauded Bonham Carter and Brana, who chose roles different from those they had in the past. Both depict very concerned people, complete with warts, but make them attractive because of their humanity. The story is touching, but these are performances that take off. Bonham Carter's “Jane” is a remarkable achievement, whose search for romance opened my eyes to aspects of disability that I hadn’t thought of before, but it was interesting for other reasons. I felt that the film ended too suddenly, but better than the lingering, emotionally manipulative finale (see Stepmother). A very real English atmosphere added pleasure to me - it was England in the 90s, both urban and rural, without being depressing,
