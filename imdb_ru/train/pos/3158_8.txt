There are too many new sitcom styles, but the one that works best is an old-fashioned way with an audience and an internal set. The 70s show is a great example. When the show went on the air, no one heard about Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rapp, especially since the teenagers who wonderfully played Topher Grace and Ashton Cushton (they both leave the show this year for other interests), I would like Topher stayed around because the show started about his character, Eric, and his close circle of friends. Ashton is already John Travolta of our time. Remember, when John was in love with Diana Highland from Eight Enough, remember Ashton and Demi Moore. The cast was never known to us, which is good, because the cast of a celebrity can spoil it. I miss Mo Gaffney, who played Don Joanne's girlfriend. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie, the replacement could not match her, and I regret it. I liked the role of Tommy Cheung as the lost but beloved figure of Stephen Hyde's father. I loved watching Tanya Roberts, except Charlie's Angels. I loved Brooke Shields, playing Jackie's mom. She really showed her acting talent before heading to Broadway. This show caused many surprises. I hope that this show will last longer, although two of their actors are leaving, but I hope that they will not stay too far. I wish the show creators, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created my other favorite show, The Third Rock from The Sun, were more successful on Fox than on NBC, who sabotaged their show. “Turners” are not mannequins, and I hope that in the future they will create more similar shows.
