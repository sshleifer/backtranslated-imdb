Well, here's the deal: if you get offended easily, you can stay far, far away. There are some painfully funny moments in the film, but I probably blushed as much as I laughed. In fact, I probably blushed MORE than laughed. And if I literally do not blush outside, then I blush inside. If in this film there is absolutely nothing that would confuse you, then you are simply not ashamed. I believe that this is a sign of honor or not - in the eye of the beholder. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that I laughed a little, but this is a film in which I simply cannot give a general recommendation. because of his subject. If I said: “This movie is hilarious, go check it out!” And some pretty old lady going to church goes to the theater and she has a heart attack during one of the obvious sexual situations, well, it's just what I don't need on my conscience. <br /> <br /> So how obscene is this? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Fair. My mother would leave during the first scene. I feel obligated to at least warn you about what to expect. <br /> <br /> There is some clever comedy here, but this is what I expect from a man (Judd Apatow) who has a hand in and freaks, idiots and undeclared ones. I am for mocking Michael Macdonald; the only person whose hair and beard is white enough to make Kenny Rogers run after his money. Paul Rudd proclaims: “If I once again hear how I will stay there, I, I will burn this place,” is fun, but this is one of those things that most viewers will not like. <br /> <br /> And when we see a quick 3-second memory of how Steve Carrell sings with Cameo's Word Up, I laughed for two minutes after the joke ended, while most laughed and forgot about it . <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, despite being rude, there is a great moral in this story. In the film, Carrell is not depicted as a strange loser just because he is a virgin. He is indeed depicted as a pleasant, admirable character. Of course, he is a little strange. In the end, he has a poster with the words "Asia" in the frame "more video games than an Asian child", as well as a collection of toys with a million dollar BOSS, but we never believed that something was really wrong with his virgin. Strange as it may seem, there is something like “everything is in order to wait”. <br /> <br /> But, oh God, please warn that this raises the R rating as far as possible. This was definitely Apatow's intent. According to him, he simply allowed some guys (in particular, Rogen and Malko) to improvise and speak as they usually say, trying to find a lot of new ways to get dirty. If you can handle it or say it yourself, then you will love the movie. <br /> <br /> I am not a big fan of profanity and sexual jokes. I find that thin, smart humor is much more interesting than about 200 using the f-word or fratboy sex talk. But it's me. As I said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself whether they should watch one of the most vulgar films you've ever seen in a theater. I just don’t know how much women will be interested in what men discuss while playing poker. Honestly, ladies, you don't want to know. If you have ever been curious about why some girls think that guys are rude, well, that gives you a good idea. <br /> <br /> Here you are my humble, honest opinion of what to expect. Be this your guide. This should definitely not be noticed with your Sunday School class, mom, grandmother, any family members of the opposite sex, children of any age, or anyone easily offended because of profanity or outright discussion of sex. If you see this with any of the above, then obviously you have no idea what it means to be uncomfortable.
