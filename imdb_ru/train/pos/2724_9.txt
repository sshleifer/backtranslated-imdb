Many of the classic films of the late 60s did not retain the ability to harass and confront viewers. "In cold blood" did not lose a single gram of his strength. It is exceptionally well done, but makes the viewer think. Some complained not only about the film, but also about the source of Truman Capote’s “science fiction novel” that the central message was unconvincing. This may be true, but this is definitely the case when the absence of ambiguity does not detract from the film. It is refreshing, especially considering today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas, to see a film with a strong political voice, not afraid to get the audience to consider their point of view. Frankly, I'm not sure if I agree with the main point of the film, but nevertheless, I admire his courage. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not agree with the message about the fight against capital punishment, there is something to admire the film. The game from the two leads is awesome. Scott Wilson (still one of the most underrated actors in history) is bullying himself as a nihilistic leader who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake is also frightening as the more submissive of the two and the one who has a conscience. His character obviously has a voice of reason, but he is afraid to go against Wilson (there is a good homoerotic implication from his character). The cinematography is awesome, smooth, but dark and really creates the impression that the viewer is watching a documentary. Add another classic score from Quincy Jones, and you’ll get a masterpiece. (9/10)
