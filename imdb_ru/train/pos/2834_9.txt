I have not seen a lot of German comedy, but if this film is something interesting, I’m forced to see more! A simple but effective storyline takes two very different people on a trip from Germany to Italy after Eva, the unemployed mother of two children, discovers that her husband, actor, has an affair with a rich lawyer’s wife. I will not reveal anything further, but which leads to a very funny series of events with a perfect ending. My interest in international cinema has expanded since I first saw this film. I recommend this to everyone (any adult ... do not let the inclusion of young children fool you into thinking that this is a family film) who loves comedy - even those who are not familiar with the language.
