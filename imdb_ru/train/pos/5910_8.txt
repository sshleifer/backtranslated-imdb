Okay, okay, don't bend it. I was joking. <br /> <br /> “Bustin 'Out” is actually the best and truest of all. <br /> <br /> Racist and criminal dramas derive satirical pleasure from our friend-animator rated X Ralfi Boy. And he does one of his best work here. <br /> <br /> On the crime front, it reveals the truth. They build it, protect it, then boredom and strong rivals make them (maybe) lose. See for yourself to see what is going down. <br /> <br /> Racist? I dont know. With Scatman (RIP) and the walrus of love (also RIP), being black, and the main point of view, I saw it as an attack on racism mostly. The fact that Richard Pryor liked this, says a lot. And the younger (before “Miami Vice”) Phil Mike Thomas was a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> This is an animated film "Blacksploitatsiya". This is a good thing. Done well and well done. This will lead to some cramping (for example, to the lynching scene), but unfortunately, this is based on facts. <br /> <br /> But Ralph REALLY had to rethink this title.
