I remember trying a few minutes of this film, I’m very surprised that I didn’t watch it all from director Steve Gordon, his only film shot to death from heart failure. Basically, Arthur Bach (winning the Golden Globe and nominated for the Academy Award Dudley Moore) is a happy drunk millionaire with everything he could wish for, the mansion Horeson (the Oscar and the Golden Globe nominated for BAFTA Sir John Gilgud) and a lot of booze, He must inherit $ 750,000,000 if he marries the daughter of his millionaire Bert Johnson (Stephen Elliott), at which they and his family chose Susan (Jill Eikenberry). But instead, Arthur turns out to be in love with Queens Linda Marolla, a waitress (Lisa Minnelli, nominated for Golden Globe), who, of course, threatens the inheritance, and 3/4 of the family of his father Stanford (Thomas Barbour) and Aunt Martha (Geraldine Fitzgerald ) After Hobson’s death, Arthur doesn’t obey the family’s wishes on her wedding day, but Aunt Martha still gives Arthur a legacy to live happily ever after with true love Linda. Also starring Ted Ross as Bitterman, Barney Martin as Ralph Marolla, Ann De Salvo as Gloria - Hooker, Maurice Copeland as Uncle Peter Bach, Justin Johnston as Aunt Pearl Bach, Florence Tarlow as Mrs Nesbitt, Marcellus Lowry as Harriet - Martha Marta John Bentley as Perry and Peter Evans as Preston Langley - guest of the party. Moore is amazingly funny and a little annoyed, like a drunken millionaire almost always, Minnelli is cute as the woman he loves, and Gilgud certainly makes an excellent impression on Oscar as Moore's humorous humble servant, a terrific humorous comedy. He received an Oscar for the best song “Theme of Arthur (“ The Best You Can Do ”)” (he also received the “Golden Globe”) (it was number 79 for 100 years, 100 songs), and he was nominated as “ The best script, the script is written directly. " for the screen she was nominated for the Anthony Asquith BAFTA Award for music for the film for Bert Bacharach and won the Golden Globe for the best film - comedy / musical. Sir John Gilgud was number 35 in "The 50 Greatest British Actors," and the film was number 53 in the film 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Fine!
