The evil boy, who has tragically lost his parents, is watched by a grandfather. Together, they find a common language in Gaelic folk tales, which are transmitted orally from generation to generation of the islanders. Although tragic episodes, such as Highland clearances, are featured in stories, they have an amazing amount of humor and fun. This is all filmed in Skye, so there is a double dose of beauty. The mountain landscape is breathtaking, and this is a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic. I am an Englishman, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of conversational Gaelic is nonetheless remarkable. Performances are exactly what you expect from carefully selected non-actors - in other words, you see the real thing - people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, did countless minor miracles to make this film. Anyone who has any interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multiculturalism, or social justice should watch this film.
