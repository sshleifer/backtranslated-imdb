Today's sci-fi thrillers are more like Rambo in space with monster special effects (often funny, such as the sounds of explosions in a vacuum of space). Tamed by today's standards, the special effects of the Forbidden Planet were striking for their time. Even today, they are still believable. However, the best part of the film is probably the reason why radio thrillers still have appeal. Much of what happened was up to the spectators. (What did Crellâ€™s creatures look like?) Since most of the story frame was never disclosed or only disclosed at the end, tension and tension remained throughout the film. The ending was also very thought-provoking and satisfying. In my opinion, this is still one of the best (if not the best) sci-fi movies ever made.
