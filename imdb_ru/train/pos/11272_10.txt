This is true. I got great pleasure from this movie. Johnny Weissmüller returns as an outstanding wild super hero swinging on vines, and Maureen O'Sullivan again plays the role of her absolutely fantastic lady in love with Jane (who for the first and last time wears a two-piece tracksuit). In my review of Monkey Man, I patted Jane, who is very good because of her obsession with clothes and her incessant screams, but she saved me here. Make no mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this film, and Jane is the most capable character in the entire film. She acts as an ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, she can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with animals, and she knows how to restrain the evil pride of lions when she has no bullets. Now she even has her own cry in the jungle. Chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. She fully trained him. Chita is also quite charming, removing cigarettes from Martin. The plot is basically an excuse for Tarzan to fight the most evil jungle animals, especially lions, crocodiles and rhinos. The effects, though always visible, are much more dynamic and classier, and perfectly complement the action. Oh, and you can't talk about this movie, let alone the nude swimming scene. All I can say is yes, she is naked. Very interesting stuff. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Wow. Just wow. When it comes to joyless action / adventure before coding, nothing holds a candle in front of "Tarzan and his mate." The inevitable sequel to the "Tarzan the Monkey" is a stunning, cruel and perilous epic in the jungle. I doubt that there will be another Tarzan film in the future that will not be made like this one. It will be difficult for you to find the full scene in this film, which will be approved by the Code or Animal Rights for that matter. Terrible violence does not even wait for a happy couple to appear in the jungle before it expands the boundaries of modern adventure films. And after T & J comes into the picture, there are a lot of morning hugs and full nude floats. Convince yourself if you don't believe me. I love Maureen O'Sullivan most in this film. In the first film, Jane looked like a walking contradiction, as the then writers simply did not know how to portray such a character. But here she is a great predecessor of the females of the subsequent movie. Although she still needs Tarzan’s help to get her out of most jams, she does much more than just wait for salvation. Her personality is plausible for a woman who (relatively) comfortably lives in the jungle for a year. I watched it with my mom, and I liked to tell her how much Jane was “learning,” as Jeff Foxworthy put it. She completely has a monkey-man on her every call. Despite the fact that there are many obsolete optical effects in the film, there are still many exciting battles between Tarzan and predators, which are being held (mostly) for real. This and men, dressed as monkeys, much more convincing this time. ** SPOILER ** The climax of the film - the jungle is spewed out in a shocking orgy of violence in the animal world, due to which Tarzan and Jane remain the only people who still breathe. Although the couple goes back to sunset reunited and victorious, I can not imagine how this story will seem to the next safari, which will hear about the previous group of people who went in search of Tarzan and Jane and which they never heard before, ** END OF SPOILER ** One of the things that still bothers me is the sleek, hairless body of Johnny Weissmuller and the overly styled hairstyle. In addition, this is an adventure adventure action that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> The last movie: “Once at Night” (1934). Next film: Twentieth Century (1934).
