I am glad that someone made a film about how difficult it is to risk your heart a second time. Or the third. This film is exactly what it promises to be - beautiful, funny, and it gives you that good feeling in your heart when it ends. The plot may not be very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell a story, and they have not yet been used. The cast is perfectly matched, although Scott Wolf doesn't look like his eight-year-old father, even when he is dressed in a suit. Thus, the sparks are in all the right places, the support of the cast is nicely supported, and although you can probably predict the entire movie, you donâ€™t want to switch the channel. This is exactly what you need for Sunday evening.
