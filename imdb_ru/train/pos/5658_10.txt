It was one of the best shows ever made for television. Full of secrets and intrigue and turns. Intrusive browsing. I was lucky I saw it in the UK. They may have misunderstood the order of the episodes, I donâ€™t remember, but at least it was included regularly. My girlfriend and I picked up a trailer, and none of us are usually a big fan of American TV shows. <br /> <br /> After the pilot, we knew that it was something special. We missed a couple of episodes, and it made you sad and angry for a week, missing these episodes. Lol. <br /> <br /> Great casting, great acting. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, even better than his role as Custer. Lucas Black performed in an amazing play for the child, and Paige Turco was also at her best since Party of Five. And, of course, Nick Searcy, as the long-suffering assistant of the sheriff. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were some confusing and confusing moments that I believe would be explained later, and, no doubt, would be in subsequent episodes. That made the end weak, and you could say they killed him. Made us go WHAT? Why did they do this with one of the best shows ever? Shoot the exec.
