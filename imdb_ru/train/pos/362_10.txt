In 1985 (my year of birth), Steven Spielberg filmed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story about a young African-American girl Selly (debut role for Whoopi Goldberg), whose life is accompanied by difficult times. The story begins in 1909, when Seli was only 14 years old. She gave birth to two children for her father. Seli has a younger sister, Nettie, with whom she is inseparable. The widower looks at Nettie, but their father gives him Sat. This is the beginning of an era of terrible abuse and constant monitoring. Women are inferior to men and, especially, being African American, their rights are less than zero. History Seli is a true story of survival. <br /> <br /> “The Purple Purple” is Spielberg's masterpiece and underrated film. He has to do more drama, which "Good Purple" and "Schindler's List" are a good concept. <br /> <br /> The cast is awesome. Whoopi Goldberg is known as an amusingly funny comedienne, but the role of Seli is a wonderful word that she can really take out from a heavy drama. Danny Glover turned out to be a surprisingly nasty "Mr." I have never seen him in such an evil role. The talk show icon Oprah Winfrey is gorgeous as a strong-willed Sophia. <br /> <br /> Warning! Get ready to have a few napkins with you when watching this movie. You can really tap into the story of a strong sisterhood. Especially if you have the same close relationship with your brothers and sisters, as I have with my sister. <br /> <br /> Big applause to Mr. Spielberg!
