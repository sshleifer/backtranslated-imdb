This film was a classic. I must say that this film caught the best of the working man, who learns from his mistakes. If we could all get along and find out how everything is in this film. It was an important part, showing how family is an important part of life and how pride can lead to the loss of something important in life if we cannot find "GREAT HAM", and the swallow is pride.
