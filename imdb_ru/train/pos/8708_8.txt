I watched it with subtitles, as it was in Russian, but I really liked it. The protagonist Sasha was born damned, with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. He lived his whole life miserable, because he was different and because anger made him do deadly things. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally found love in a young woman named Katya, everyone tried to take her away from him, ending a deadly battle. There was enough blood, but not too much for weak stomachs. <br /> <br /> Not for people who like the usual old Hollywood film, but for those who love independent films. Kinda got the feel of an Asian fantasy movie.
