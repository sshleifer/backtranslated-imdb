What a sweet heartwarming TV movie. The story tells about a little five-year-old girl who lost her dad and considers it impossible to cope with the situation. Her mother is also very upset ... only a miracle can alleviate their misfortune. What all viewers hope to come true. Samantha Mathis is gorgeous as the mother of a little girl, just as she was a nanny in the movie “Jack and Sarah”, worth seeing if you like Samantha Mathis and happy; Year Tear Movies! Ellen Burstyn has always been a delightful grandmother in this gentle and superbly played film. Jodelle Ferland (Little Five) is a charming and most convincing young actress. The film is based on a true story that makes it so touching. “Mermaid” is a tribute to the milk of human kindness, which is clearly illustrated and undoubtedly still surrounds us in this complex world in which we live. "Mermaid" gives us all hope, realizing that there are many beautiful people in the world with great love. James Robson Glasgow Scotland UK
