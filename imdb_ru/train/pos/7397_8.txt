Xizao is a story about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions and its influence on the family in China. Da Min (Quan Nu) - a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father Liu (Xu Zhu) has died. He found that his father was still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his old business, public bathroom. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the Da Ming family and how he should understand the importance of his father’s work, which he always considered an old tradition that was about to die. In addition, the film describes his relationship with Er Ming, the mentally retarded, the problems of a small community, and how the bathroom is a place that cleans not only their bodies, but also their souls. <br /> <br /> The two main themes of the film, the family and the problems of progress, are incredibly well developed, and the film never loses its meaning, which it is trying to make, both themes are very well developed, and we get an idea of ​​Chinese society and customs. . <br /> <br /> Director Yang Zhang tells his story in a simple way, allowing the characters to do their work. This is a very simple approach, but it is ideal for a film, and I very much doubt that a different style will suit the film so well. Zhang has great potential, as he can tell a story without the help of visual flashes or tricks with the camera. <br /> <br /> The game is outstanding in its naturalistic approach, everyone acts in a very natural way and looks almost as if they were real people being shot. The three main characters give great performances, and Wu Jiang as Er Ming will surely steal the show. <br /> <br /> Even when the film could have adhered to the patronizing message “the old days were much better,” instead, an equilibrium relationship is required, for example, saying that progress is good and we have to move on, but we must not forget where we come from and maintain a balance between modern life and the traditions of the past. <br /> <br /> An amazing and touching movie. 8/10
