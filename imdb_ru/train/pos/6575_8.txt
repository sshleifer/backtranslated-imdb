“Weapons and Man” is one of the most amusing plays of Shaw, if properly processed, and this performance does a fairly good job. Helena Bonham-Carter, a celebrity before the film, is Raina, the daughter of a military family who has a groom peacock (Patrick Raikart), and who protects a soldier from an enemy (Pip Torrens) during a city raid. <br /> <br /> Full of color and energy, this performance is moving at a good pace, and if Bonham-Carter and Patsy Kensit as the maid overshadowed the rest of the cast, they still hold their land. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen are wonderful parents, and the whole game is usually happy. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
