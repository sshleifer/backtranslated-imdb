Fortunately, I recently saw it on a plane to Singapore (I thought I missed it at the Cinemalaya Film Festival). Paris, je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 minutes each) from 20 directors who show love in different pockets of modern Paris. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite segments is Park Monceau by Alfonso Quarn (“Great Expectations, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban”), in which one continuous frame was shot with Nick Nolte. <br /> <br /> The Cohen Brothers “Tuileries” starring Steve Buscemi as a tourist in the Metro was fun! Juliette Binoche and Willem Defoe in the Place des Victoires were pursued. <br /> <br /> Maggie Gyllenhaal as an American actress / drug addict in the Quartier des Enfants Rouges portrayed anticipation and heartbreaking in such a short period of time was simply gorgeous. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood, the victim of a vampire in Quarter de la Madeleine, was rather surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a pretty couple in Wes Craven's Prelache. <br /> Natalie Portman was beautiful as usual, like the girlfriend of an actress of a visually impaired French boy in "Faubourg Saint-Denis". But despite the many images of young love, the more mature performance of Jena Rowlands in Quartier Latin was equally impressive. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for people with ADHD because each sequence is motivated and thought carefully. <br /> <br /> There are also a number of memorable quotes. In particular, one of them is deceiving her husband, who eventually leaves his mistress to stay with his dying wife in her last days: “Pretending to be a man in love, he became a man in love.”
