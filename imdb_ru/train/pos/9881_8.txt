In the West Hollywood, those hands of the track were a rough bunch, which, when they arrived in the city, very well pulled away. After all, driving over the tracks was a dismal matter on the day the railways reached all parts of the United States. <br /> <br /> Drover, who worked for the boss of Gil Favor in the role of Eric Fleming, was no different. But Fleming was the man of the business, he had a job, and he hired a top team to do it. <br /> <br /> Given the long Rawhide history and the fact that the regulars stayed with him for the most part, we at one point learned all the drivers. Some storylines were centered around them all, although most were with the character of Fleming and Clint Eastwood Rowdy Yeats, the number 2 guy with the herd. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwoodâ€™s Western image was formed by Rawhide, a shame that they do not appear more often. Probably because they were made in black and white. If it was an NBC show, it would be done in color, like Bonanza, and would be shown as often as these shows. We would have seen a lot more than the man who became the legend of the movement. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, it was Eric Fleming who left the show before it closed to make films. He made a few of them and hoped that the show would give him a suitable title for the film. Unfortunately, he was killed in the place where the action was filmed, and drowned in the river. If he lived, he could have become a name like Eastwood. <br /> <br /> Clint took the place of the main boss last season, and then the show completed its work. And he, of course, became an icon, which he is today, and not only in the Western genre. <br /> <br /> Rawhide was a tough westerner, in which there were some tough guys. There were no frills in this, these were working cowboys who simply did their work and fought with the elements and in any situations they encountered every year. <br /> <br /> They really don't do this kind of television series anymore. What a pity.
