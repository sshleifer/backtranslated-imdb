Wow, I loved this movie! It is about normal life in a small village. On hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Big! It's about the things that everyone faces in life. You have to do things with passion. But some people will not appreciate your passion and try to stop you. There are people who believe that the opinions of others and “what neighbors will think” are more important than following their heart. Do not let anything of your opinion prevent you from fulfilling your dreams and passion. I liked the fact that all the actors were really normal people, it could be my family. No big beauties, but all the people you fall in love with during the movie.
