This is my favorite movie ever. I watched it at least 10 times, and I cry every time. My family pleads with me not to watch it, so I will not cry. I think I like that this is a true story, written by Antwon himself, just as I love the movie. The acting is top notch and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie, which he shot so far. I took care of a little boy who was also born in prison. He was the most valuable little boy I ever met. Now he was adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years. I saw this film when the fight was still going on, and his future was uncertain, and I am so happy that he is safe and loved. And I am so happy that Antwon is happy and has found his family. <br /> <br /> I would like to know more about him and how it was after meeting with his family. I just can't say enough good words about it !!
