It could have been 10 if it were not for the quite predictable and Hollywood scenario. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms his position as one of the leading actors of our time (why not act as the lead, I can ask), and the other actors perform at a very high level. I was personally impressed with Hugh O'Connor, who played Christy Brown as a child. The very first scene I watched him was really strong. Wow.
