I remember stumbling on this special offer while watching channels in 1965. I have never heard of Barbre before. When the show ended, I thought, "This is probably the best thing on television I've ever seen in my life." 42 years later it was confirmed. There is nothing more surprising, so honest, as the talent shown here. You can talk about all the superstars you want, these are the most excellent of them! <br /> <br /> You name it, she can do it. Comedy, pathos, spiritual seduction, ballads, Barbra is truly a storyteller. Her ability to do everything she tries is legendary. But this special offer was made at the beginning and helped create the legend, which she quickly became. Despite such high growth in such a short time, she kept her promise, revealing more of her talents as she moved forward. But they are all here from the very beginning. You will not be disappointed in viewing this.
