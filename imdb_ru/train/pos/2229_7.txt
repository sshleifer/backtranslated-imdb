I read some horrible things about this movie, so I was prepared for the worst. "Confused. Confused. Terribly structured." Although some of these accusations may be a virtue, this film was far from as terrible as your regular DVD programmer. In fact, it really was a desire. He was trying to do something outside of the typical monster / slasher junk. And, hell, some interesting things happen. <br /> <br /> Ms. Barbeau is a wonder to behold. She carries the film right on her shoulders. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that it is a masterpiece. UNHOLY ultimately collapses under the weight of his own ambitions. There are too many (unexplainable) sites trying to coexist. And the plot loopholes created by time travel are never solved: for example, if Hope knows that her mother is evil and that she will eventually kill her brother, then why doesn't she kill Ma in the very first movie sequence? Looks like it would be terrible if I made a trip to the future. <br /> <br /> However, I give the Unholy points for trying. Small ambitions are not a bad thing.
