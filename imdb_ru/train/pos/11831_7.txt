Despite the great and breathtaking animation, this is probably one of the most boring Disney movies I've ever seen, and I don't often make Disney movies. The spirit is a wild stallion that is repeatedly captured by cavalry or Indians who are trying to "break" it. The spirit ends up forming a bond with an Indian, and this is, in a nutshell, a story. With the exception of beautiful horse animation, neither I nor my five year old child were very inspired by this film. The irony is that it is called “The Spirit”, because the spirit is that this film could use a little more. The extra score was given for the soundtrack, which was enjoyable, with songs by Brian Adams and Hans Zimmer. And although this movie is rated “G”, you will probably still have to end up explaining what it means to “break a horse” for your five year old child. I did. <br /> <br />
