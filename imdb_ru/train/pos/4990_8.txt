As other reviewers point out, this is an unfairly forgotten film of the depression era. Director Frank Borzaghe (two Oscars) and screenwriter Joe Sverling (“Leave Her in Paradise”, “Westerner”, “Lifeboat”, etc.) is a tough, well-structured and implemented decision about slum dwellers in New York, They - tramps, beggars and women who are forced into prostitution, but this is a community of people, both good and bad, with difficult relationships, like any other group. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is one of the many great qualities of this film that is the contrast between the character Spencer Tracy, Bill and Trina Loretta Young. He is tough, physically aggressive and clearly fearless, but Bill is not the character who gives this film a tough sense of survival. While he is raging, Trina actually hangs tight (if this term can be applied to a character so feminine). Her devotion to him is obvious and full. When she becomes pregnant, she says that she will raise her if he wants to leave, or "I will even give up the child if you are only happy." Such is the virtue of Loretta Young's performance (at the age of 20) as a rather simple character, that she seems neither weak nor dependent, but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds him and wants nothing more.
