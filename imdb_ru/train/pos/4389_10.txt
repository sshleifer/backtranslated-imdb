From superb acting skills to an extremely impressive cast, to a well-written (and very quoted) script, from generous cinema to Carter Burwell's excellent musical score, Rob Roy offers a rare cinematic experience: one that is almost impossible to find a mistake in any field. <br /> <br /> Several comparisons were made with Braveheart, which was released the same year. With due respect to Mel Gibson, Braveheart seemed too shy and preaching epic to compete with Rob Roy, like a film that I would like to see more than once. While Braveheart is working hard to become a serious epic, Rob Roy just grabs you and plunges you into a carefully edited story. Not a single scene was in vain. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy contains the perfect balance of dramatic tension, action, and even casual humor. The characters are well developed, perfectly convey native words and manners that reinforce them in their authentic setting of the period. <br /> <br /> In addition, they are not caricatures of good and evil, as we too often see even in a modern film. . <br /> <br /> For example, although we hope that heroic Rob Roy will win, we understand that his difficulties are the result of his own pride and sense of honor. Tim Roth plays one of the most hated bad guys in film history, but there are times when we can understand how the events of his life shaped him to become what he is. Rob Roy uses the level of character development that makes his story even more believable and exciting. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy is a delightful treasure featuring one of the greatest sword fights ever staged and a climatic ending worthy of all the suspense.
