This movie is one of the funniest stories I've ever seen. For me, this is what makes him so cool! Fred Gwynn and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series. While there was less farce, they still wonderfully worked together "in comedy." I would like Yvonne de Carlo, like Lily, to have more involvement in the conspiracy. She showed that she can act in a comedy in the original series, but mostly it was wasted. This film also starred the great Sid Caesar, but unfortunately, he does not interact with Gwynn and Lewis. I think this could make a better job.
