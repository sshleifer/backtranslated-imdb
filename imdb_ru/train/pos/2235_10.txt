I really liked this film because it’s a true story in Amazon, a part of the world that has always intrigued me. I believe that the compressed form of the book was published in the Reader's Digest shortly after the actual event occurred. <br /> <br /> Since I am a “baby boomer,” the character and actress are my contemporaries, and for this reason I am associated with the film. I also believe that the film is useful for learning survival skills if the viewer watches the character follow the streams that lead to the river and the coastal settlements where she can get help, as well as other survival methods. The most important was her desire to survive and maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope that viewers will learn something from this and also see it for fun. <br /> <br /> I would really like the film to be released on VHS and DVD as soon as I would like to add it to my video collection. This should also be shown more often on satellite movie channels.
