Christmas came together before my time, but I was raised on John Denver, and the songs of this special have always been my family's Christmas music. For years, we had a crispy tape made from a recording, which meant it was Christmas. A few years ago, I was finally able to track this video on Ebay, so after listening to all the music for about 21 years, I was able to see John and the Muppets in action for myself. If you ever have such an opportunity, it is a lot of fun - great music, emotional mood and tenderness. It is also interesting to see the versions of the dolls of the 70s and compare them with their new versions today. I believe that Denver actually took a bit of warmth to make such a show - I think that usually the performers do not jeopardize their images by performing a long song with dolls, but I'm glad he did. Even if you can't track the video, the soundtrack is also worth it. He has several traditional Muppified favorites, but also some of the original Denver tunes.
