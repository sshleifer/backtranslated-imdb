Well, I'm a fan of the Nightmare series, and everyone here says this is the worst! But it is not !!! Haven't you seen Freddie's Revenge ??? WTF! It was the worst of all !!! Now this film is pretty decent, and it sticks to the story of Freddie, and itâ€™s cool that he has a daughter, etc. And so on. <br /> <br /> And then I found out that it was in 3D ! I was so excited, I remember, when I saw it on the DVD box set, I immediately switched to 3-dimensional sequences. Quite a lot was in 3D, though, like Liza Zane's hand, Dream Demons, Freddie's Claw (more than once), Climbed Dean with a knife, Lisa Zane with a baseball bat, Doc's hand, Freddie's exploding head <br /> <I really loved this movie because it was in 3D, but I would like the whole movie to be in 3D, and not just in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> By the way, 15 minutes is NOT TEN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
