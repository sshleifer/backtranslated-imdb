At first it looked like a boring comedy like the “Strange Couple”, but when I got into it, it turned out to be a really funny movie. Willy Clark's forgetful former comedians (Golden Globe winner, Oscar-nominated BAFTA winner Walter Mattau) and Al Lewis (Oscar winner and Golden Glove nominated George Burns) were a great comedy duet and put together to to revive the sketch in the hospital for the television show. Willy's nephew, Ben Clark (winner of the Golden Globe Richard Benjamin) is confident that they can come together again, without feeling to each other how much he is wrong. They cannot live all the time, they are both forgetful, especially during a conversation, but they do in the end. Also starring Lee Meredith as Nurse in Sketch (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuis in the role of Mrs. Doris Green, daughter of Al, Rosetta Lenoir in the role of Odessa, nurse Willy and the doll from Cosmos F. Murray Abraham in the role of mechanic. I think that the best line of the film is Burns, who mentions that Mattau called him "the son of a bitch." He was nominated for an Oscars for best artistic decoration and better writing, the script was adapted from other materials, was nominated for a BAFTA award for best screenplay, and was awarded the “Best Film Film Golden Globe Musical / Comedy” and was nominated for Best Screenplay. Fine!
