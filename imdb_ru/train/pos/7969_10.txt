Homeward Bound is a beautiful film. You know the part where Shadow falls into a ditch ... something, I * cried *, considering that I was only six years old, I cried! it makes me cry! Dogs and cats are well trained. A good family movie, * not * for fully hardened, not fluffy people or animal haters, but maybe for people like me, like me. <br /> <br /> Good movie overall, 10/10!
