The story of Hare Rama Hare Krishna actually occurred to Dev Ananda when he saw the hippies and their fallen treasures in Kathmandu, where he visited after protests against his previous Prem Pujari in Calcutta. He was in a bad mood because his film was against it, and some burned Prem Pujari posters. But the hippie life made Deva think about turning it into a movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was the best directorial work of Dev Anand. The film was a super hit at the box office, and Zinat Haman, like Deva's sister, had a huge impact. <br /> <br /> This film was the call of the Virgin of Anand to the people to preserve moral values. <br /> <br /> This is about an Indian family in Montreal, and the role of a brother is very tender for his sister. But parents quarrel and part, leaving Prashanta (Deva) with their mother and Jasbir (Zinata) with their father. She is constantly told that her mother and brother are dead, and in the end she believes that she will never see Prashant again. <br /> <br /> Her mistress is mistreating and she runs away from home. Dev grows up to become a pilot, and he learns that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with some hippies. <br /> <br /> To reunite with his sister, Dev goes to Kathmandu and meets Shanti (Mumtaz), who was later to marry him, and also Janice, who is actually Jasbir with a new name and a new identity . She forgot her childhood and Deva too. <br /> <br /> Dev must return his sister to a number of other events, including his suspicion of theft in Kathmandu, and the people after his life. <br /> <br /> This was a story, well-played and played by Dev Anand. We see more Zinat Haman than Mumtaz. But the music of Rahul Dev Burman was well written. At first, Dev offered music to compose Sachin Dev Burman, but Burman Da didnâ€™t want Dev to make a film. He was very close to Virgo and his earlier film Premier Pujari, although he was good, but he was against Calcutta. Burman Da wanted Dev to try a lighter topic, because he thought that a hippie sect film could stir up people's anger against Virgo. But Dev continued to work on the film, encouraging Burman Yes, and the film was really successful. <br /> <br /> RD Burman asked Asha Bosch to sing the Lady Maro the Lady who received the award. Kanchi re Kanchi re was another good number. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a good movie.
