After the success of the second installment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have a third appearance. This time, instead of Tudor or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA-nominated Rowan Atkinson) lives during the French Revolution. Accompanied by the now stupid but attractive Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the “loyal” butler of George, Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). During this third series of the wonderfully written sitcom, Blackadder is doing everything possible to become rich and strong. He tries to choose a lord for the rotten area, tries to sell the book, tries to win a bet on the Scarlet Jump, tries to become a man on the highway, and finally pretends to be Prince. This is a very good article in a popular comedy. Includes speeches by Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerney, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. He won BAFTA for the best comedy series and was nominated for the best design and best makeup. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 in “The 50 Greatest British Actors,” he was number 24 in “Comedian Comedian,” and he was number 8 in “Favorite British Comedian,” Edmund Blackadder was number 3 in “100 Greatest TV Characters,” and was number 3 in “The Greatest Comedic Characters of the World” and “Blackadder” (all four series) took second place in the British “Sitcom”. Fine!
