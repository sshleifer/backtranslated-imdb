Colombo is top notch from start to finish. I especially like the interaction between Colombo and the killer, Ruth Gordon. <br /> <br /> As an avid Colombo fan, I cannot recall another, in which he does not set the killer at the end, as he does in other episodes. In this, since he is trying to determine the correct sequence of boxes and the “message” that his nephew left, he finally comes to him. <br /> <br /> The music in this episode is also very good as in many others.
