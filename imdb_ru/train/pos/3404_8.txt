The audience in 1936 must have been stunned by the fact that she was watching: the full-fledged, beautiful full-length film Technicolor. I can not say for sure, but it could be the first (3-way). In any case, it still looks beautiful after 70 years on DVD. In fact, how good it looks is amazing. <br /> <br /> Director Richard Boleslowski, director of photography Virgil Miller, Selznick International Pictures, and DVD - MGM Home Entertainment should receive prestige for this. They all united together to give us one of the most beautiful films of the era of the classics. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was so-so: excellent in the first half, stagnant in the second. In the end, it gave a good message, although many may not have been pleased with it. I can not say more without spoiling things. <br /> <br /> Marlene Dietrich never looked better, I do not believe, and, of course, never played such a carefree character (“Domini Enfilden”). Charles Boyer's heartbeat was Dominie's male star and love object, but some minor characters were most interesting to me. People like Joseph Schildkraut as Batush; John Carradine as "Sandstone"; The most memorable, at least for me, was the dancer "Irena" performed by Tilly Losh. Wow, there is a face and a dance that you will not soon forget! I have never seen anything like it in the thousands of films I watched. Just to see how it does its job is worth the price of a DVD. Looking at her summary of IMDb, she was only in four films, but they were all well-known films. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone, the actor who really became famous for playing Sherlock Holmes, is also here as S. Aubrey Smith, another famous British actor of his time. Shildkraut, by the way, will be recognized by fans of classic cinema as the person who played the arrogant seller in the big hit "The Shop Around The Corner" with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan. <br /> <br /> Great direction, photography and color, as well as Tilly's dance, is what I remember best in this film, which brings together many good and not so good things. If the last half hour were better - although I admire the finale - I would rate it even higher. This is definitely one movie collector wants to add to his collection.
