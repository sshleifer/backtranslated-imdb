Ossessione <br /> <br /> Luchino Visconti's debut film, this Italian noir, is usually credited with launching a neo-realistic movement — well, that is said right on the back of the box — and this is sometimes an insightful, sometimes grim portrait of single people in the moral flow. Set in Fascist Italy, a set of supporting characters — including an ingenious vagabond that supports communist virtues — embody the distant despair of a country seeking its identity from the outside, drifting fantasies, hungry for souls. Although Visconti's compassion for those deprived of civil rights and his ability to express their deplorable conditions were already well developed, the web of deception is insignificant - although the main element of noir is the position of the protagonist who is manipulated by fate and the fatal woman, Gino here starting from what you are afraid that he can deserve it - cosmic irony is too didactic, illegal relationships are strained on bachs. And yet, it is insightful and substantial, although its real impact on the history of cinema is certainly debatable.
