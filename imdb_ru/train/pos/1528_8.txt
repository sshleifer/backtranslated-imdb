I am a writer working at home and Diagnosis Murder, my companion during the lunch break, is good, pure fun, good mood and nostalgia for the days of the Dick Van Dyke show. How innocent we all were (and how innocent the diagnosis of murder). I especially liked the episodes with other nostalgia figures such as Joe Mannix. The bad guys are always caught, the good guys continue. The stars obviously enjoy and play ball without taking themselves too seriously. <br /> <br /> One beef: why were so many villains women or at least bitches? Amanda was dizzy. It is hard to imagine that she really does something as terrible as an autopsy. <br /> <br /> I hope we didnâ€™t see the last Dick Van Dyke and his family on our screens, especially. at lunchtime !!
