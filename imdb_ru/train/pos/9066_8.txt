~~ I was able to watch this movie yesterday morning on an early viewing pass. ~~ <br /> <br /> I am a mother of two children aged from 11 to 6. So I am sure that I have many parents. may be related to the need to see a lot of "children's" films. It was refreshing for me. I did not read this particular book, so I do not know whether it remained true to the book or not. But it certainly raised the rudeness factor to a high level. This is a story about a "new" child in the city, and it so happens that there is a group of boys who have created a kind of club and love to pick up children .... sounds familiar? Didn't we all suffer anyway? He has a little brother whom he cannot bear, and parents whom he embarrasses. Most of all I liked the fact that each character was completely different from the other, which they all singled out. A bully (why do they always make a bully with a red head? My daughter has red hair! And she's not a bully! .. laughs) - this is a great bully that his older brother screams at. It took turns, and you fell in love with all of them well and really understood all the characters! Even parents, excellent connection between father and son. Everything is pleasant, sweet, funny, rude, etc. ...... Take your children! You will enjoy it as much as they enjoy!
