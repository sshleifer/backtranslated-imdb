Heh, if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with some 18-year-old comic book-adapted movie with a rating of 5.9, will you call me crazy? This is just to get your attention. Every day I meet people complaining that there are no good films that seem to know only the latest blockbusters. It is never bad to search and explore old films, especially those that have good artistic values. Dick Tracy - one of those who can not easily be outdated in terms of technology. <br /> <br /> Negative reviews mostly complained about the “spoiled” story of DT. But it seems to me that the storyline is pretty clear, and I have not had any problems with this. I have not seen comics, but I am not a big American comic book fan, but I appreciate first-class filmmaking and performances. Perhaps most people's expectations were too high in relation to the story she tells. But if you see a movie in which Madonna and Warren Beattie get together, what would you expect? I had scratches on my head, and I can't help wondering, did we really watch the same movie? The title role, although not as competent as it seems, was still able to attract his attention and captivate the audience. Madonna was more expressive than “breathless” in her seductive role, but added a lot of fun to the game. Al Pacino was funny and a wunderkind to himself. Obviously, he was brave enough to be sarcastic about his previously successful roles. We can see the hybrid of Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro, who beat us in the stomach to make us laugh. And many thanks to the cosmetics. <br /> <br /> For me, this is not bad at all. Surreal feeling really got me.
