I really like Miikes' films about the yakuza, this one I saw about 2 years ago, and he really stunned my head. I've never seen such a sick and perverted thing before. The story is good, and the actors do their job very well. I have not seen the version in the UK or Japan, but I must say that I believe that the German DVD is a bit censored. If you have not seen the movie and live in Germany, you may be better off looking for a DVD from the Netherlands or Austria. I-ON DVD contains a lot of very difficult and unpleasant scenes, but at the autopsy, I felt that something was missing, about one or two very short scenes. <br /> <br /> In general, a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence, that's why I like Miike !!
