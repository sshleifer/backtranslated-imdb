With actors like Ralph Richardson, Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwick and Margaret Scott, how can you go wrong? Very unusual scenes, especially modern ones. The implementation of modern equipment is very effective. Here you have shots from a beam gun from construction vehicles, which help to clear the territory, so that you can create new designs. Although she is much younger in this film, it is not very difficult to understand who the future Mrs. Pamprey will be from the BBC All Creatures Great and Small series! A truly effective "appearance" of both Raymond Massey and Ralph Richardson. The piece of music is written by the famous Swiss composer Arthur Honegger, and it is also unusual. At that time (1936), it seems they really used, large sets or effects make it look that way. Finally, it is a really good story.
