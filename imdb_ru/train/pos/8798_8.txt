First of all, I am not going to praise Inarritu's short film, even I am Mexican and I am proud of his success in mainstream Hollywood. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I see that most of the reviews are about their favorite (and not so) short films; but we forget that there is a subtle essence that surrounds the entire collection, and perhaps this will not be so pleasant for the American people. (Even if this was not the main goal of the producers) <br /> <br /> I say that most short films do not show the suffering that the WASP people experienced because of the September 11th attack, but the suffering of other people. <br /> <br /> Do you need proof of what I am saying? Look in the short film about Bosnia: “You cry because of the people who died in the Towers, but we (others = Eastern Europeans) have long cried for crimes committed against our women, and no one pays attention to We, like the whole world, done to you. "<br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the story of Burkina Fasso is more comedic, there is the same thought:" You are angry because Osama bin Laden hit you with evil By the way, but we (others = Africans) must be more evil, because our people have long died from hunger, poverty and AIDS, and neither who pays no attention to us, as the whole world did. ” <br /> <br /> Now look at the short Sean Penn: the fall of the Twin Towers makes a lonely (and alienated) person happy. So the message is that Strength and Greed (symbolized by the Towers) should fall to allow people to see the sunrise and the blossoming of flowers? It is noteworthy that this terrible outcome was proposed by an American. There is so much irony in this short film that it is close to exploding. <br /> <br /> Well, Ken Loach (very famous, because his ideology of anti-capitalism) goes much clearer and shameless to the point: “You are angry, because your country has been attacked by evil forces, but we (others = Latin Americans ) suffered at the same time from something worse, and no one remembers our grief, as the whole world did to you. ” br /> <br /> It is as if the creative of this project wanted to say to the Americans: “Do you see America? You are not the only ones who fell victim to world violence, you are not alone in your pain ”and, by the way, we (others = not Americans) suffered much more than you did long ago, therefore we stand in solidarity with you in your pain ... and By the way, we regret because you had some taste of your own medicine. "Only Mexican and French short films showed sympathy and sympathy for the Americans; others — like a slap in the face to the American state, not equal to the American people.
