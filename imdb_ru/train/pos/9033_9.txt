I watched this movie without knowing anything about it, and found it similarly themed to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based on the problematic relationship of father and son. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father through the mines and dreams of a better life away from his native city. Both sons are ridiculed by their classmates, and both have a strong female role model who teaches them. <br /> <br /> The main difference that I found between the films was that the October Sky was infinitely more interesting and touching. Laura Dern plays very touching, and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well, as in The Beauty of America (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle directing, very different from other directorial functions, such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
