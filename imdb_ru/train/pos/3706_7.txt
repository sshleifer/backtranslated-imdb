The biggest surprise in this film was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Instead of playing the stereotypical, frivolous roles of the blonde, which she usually plays, she plays a street, intelligent, weary character in the world. She does not have a huge role, but she copes with the image of Lois Harlan as a woman who is tired of fatigue, although she is covering up the carelessness of her boss.
