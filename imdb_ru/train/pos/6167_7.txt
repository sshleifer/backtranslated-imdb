“Such a long journey” is a well-developed film, good shooting and demonstration of good performances. Nevertheless, the story is so mixed up with the plots and special characters that it becomes a kind of Jack of all the plots and not a master. In addition, the western audience is likely to find the esoteric of the rather incomprehensible Parsi culture to get around it in 1.7 hours. Recommended for those interested in India.
