I saw this film back in 1984, we first started watching “This Is Spinal Tap” and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. So we went instead to watch this movie. If you have some conspiracy theory in your head, you will want to see this one. <br /> <br /> When watching this movie you have to ask yourself the question: do you think the government can do this? (In my opinion, there is no doubt that they could do this). <br /> <br /> But I don’t want to give out too much information, as this will be a spoiler, and I think you should watch the movie yourself. <br /> <br /> But just to let you know, we are still talking about this film 20 years later, and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world.
