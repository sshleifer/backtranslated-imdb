This may be a remake of 1987 Autumn Tale after eleven years, as director Mabel Chung said. Mabel uses rock music as an intermediary in this film to express his personal attitude to life, in which love, desire, and subsequent disappointment play essential roles. Rock music may not be the best way to convey a deep feeling, and yet it is not too inappropriate to use it, because the life of underground rock musicians is much more intense than usual. The director focuses on the image of fine affection and absolute vanity of life, and not just rock music. The love between father and son, lovers and friends is delicately and touchingly conveyed through a beautiful performance. Mabel does not at all try to decorate rock musicians as artists, instead she tries to reproduce real life on the screen, making great efforts, working on this project for years and collecting information in Beijingâ€™s underground pubs. <br /> <br /> Daniel gave, probably, the best performance in all his films, shot so far. His innate despondency and restraint fit perfectly into the blue mood of the film.
