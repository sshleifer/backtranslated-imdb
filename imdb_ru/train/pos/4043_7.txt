“Live” <br /> <br /> “Live” is a very interesting film from Japan dedicated to SCI-FI. I noticed a lot of disappointed movie fans who loved the director’s debut film or his third film, Azumi. I heard that these are bloodied films with swords, zombies and all sorts of goodies. Honestly, I went to the video store to get Versus, but with Alive I'm fine. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a beginning from end to wall, then Alive is not your choice. There are many actions, but it pays for the whole hour of character creation. Personally, I think this is well done and worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the plot is stupid, as in many SCI-Fi action movies, and I think that subtitles using the term alien object could be replaced by a parasite. for more effect. This film is cruel when it should be so nervous that it does not need to be applied. <br /> <br /> They held back the budget, for the most part limiting all actions to one underground building (taking a cue from the cube). ) but the film does not suffer from this. Another bonus for this film is the intense Gothic images, which are made with great artistic talent during many memories and dream episodes. <br /> <br /> Rent it!
