The truly amazing heroine, who, in turn, surprised and frightened by giblets, struggling with mattresses, came across closed doors ... only a few moments that flash in my memory of "Naked Truth". I really liked what I caught in this show: pleasant crazy plots and a few good characters supporting the game provided the setting for the show's diamond - Tea Leoni as “Norah Wilde”; cute, clown and surprisingly predisposed to accidents - It's nice to see an actress who knows how to clown - no wonder Hollyad does not seem to know how to cast her. But where, oh-oh-oh, where are the DVD releases? The amount (beep) they release is incredible that this little gem continues to be buried. (Someone, please correct me if I am mistaken.)
