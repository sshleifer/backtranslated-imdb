This is a great adaptation and a great miniseries by itself. Story cuts may disappoint fans of the book (but in fact, how many modern readers have read Cold House without first seeing the film version? I know only a few). <br /> <br /> I think it is very awful to see critical reviews of the series that were clearly written by people who have no clue about the plot - did you really SEE the show or did you just take the BBC Production bag because Gillian Anderson was in a newer version? <br /> <br /> The series reflects the mood, pace, characters and plot movements (excluding Dickens’s unnecessary flourishing, and distracts from film screening, like the story of Terweidrop, the dynamics of the Small Algae family and additional lawyers - Tangle, Whhols, etc.) reduced). The only omission I would like to preserve is the Jellyby incident, but since the first episode is already a bit slow (the tempo is perfect after the first episode), I see that it had to go. <br /> <br /> The only other criticism I have is that Joe’s death could have been more true. I see that it would practically be canonizing Woodcourt, and he was a little more humane due to the lack of this scene, but in fact I think Joe's death is one of the hottest moments of the book, and I missed it, although it always forces me cry br /> <br /> Theowinthrop really saw the show? HOW did he think that Esther was brought up by her aunt and UNCLE ?? Who is this uncle? I believe that one who may mistakenly take the name DENHOLM Elliott for Desmond does not really appreciate English art (cinema or literature). <br /> <br /> I also think that he is mistaken in the interpretation of the law. YES, the law is very poorly drawn in the Gloomy House. It fails the descendants of Jarndyce, whose valuable inheritance is eaten by legal fees, it fails the late Tom Jarndyce and Rick Carstone and all who believe in the lawsuit. That fails Miss Flight. In a sense, this also fails Captain Houdon, who is led to his death by the monotony of the scribe's legitimate work. Yes, he feeds the scavengers of Vholes and Tangle. But it also allows people like Guppy and Kenge to go beyond their life. Although Dickens clearly disliked those who deal with social status, he would prefer that they were not tied to the station where they were born (unlike the Joe families and the brick builders Charlie Necette, who got out of poverty). <br /> <br /> In addition, the law, although it is used by the Tulkinghorn and the vultures of the Office, is in fact a source of security for the wards of the Court of Ada and Richard, as well as for Esther, who is simply Jarndais’s ward. Their safety was ensured by the law, which delivers them to Jarndays. <br /> <br /> I don’t understand how someone may have problems with history - remember that you don’t have to understand that Esther is the daughter of Lady Dedlock right at the beginning. Also, you should not immediately "receive" all connections. Instant gratification just doesn't happen in dickens. <br /> <br /> As for the “clear vision” through the fog - damn, Gillian Anderson had such poor editing that I discovered that IT could not be followed and I already knew the plot! <br /> <br /> I found Diana Rigg absolutely brilliant (replay and drama do not make good Lady Dedlock, but if you think they are really trying out the version of Gillian Anderson). <br /> <br /> This is ADA and Rick is not "Kate"! and you get everything you need from the Rouncewell site.
