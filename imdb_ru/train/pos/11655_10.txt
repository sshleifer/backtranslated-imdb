In the cinema, too many subjects are avoided, and eating disorders are one of them. This movie shows it as it is. This does not embellish the audience, but reveals the real truth, which makes it even more powerful. I saw it only once, and it was a few years ago, but I still remember everything about it and how I felt it. This is a very powerful film, and it helps everyone who suffers from an eating disorder to give them the will to stop. This is what films should be about - they should be there to help people, not to embellish what is wrong.
