It's nice to see such creativity again on TV. This show is poetic, artistic and fun. The characters are well connected, and the letter is not bad (I think it will improve when they get their feet). Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> Girls steal the show in this series. Chuck is as charming as Olive. Two aunts are a delight. I sincerely hope that they will write them in large pieces because they are magical. <br /> <br /> Well, this is all news that you can print. Make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun in the old fashioned way. It's like Dr. Seuss for adults.
