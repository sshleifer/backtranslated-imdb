I will start with a story about my first meeting with Prince’s music. It was at the bar, on my 39th birthday, and the girl danced with her bare breasts until "1999," playing on the columns. I asked people who is this singer? I was told that it was a prince. It was so good that it distracted me from the beautiful dancing topless. Later, I began to listen to other songs of the prince and really "dug" them. When Purple Rain came out, I still knew very little about this Minnesota guy. The film blew me away. I instantly became a fan of the Prince of the 1st generation "War Baby". Later, I learned that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary, and she led me and my nephew to W.I.P. The concert of the prince, where we sat next to my mother ... how cool it is! Returning to the topic under discussion, I agree with Siskel & Ebert, who called Purple Rain an instant classic. I have seen this more than 17 times and I love it very much. I thought Prince’s acting was fine, Apollonia struggled a little, but overall the game was good. John Gilgud was not available to play "The Kid", so the Prince assumed the role. The film is a visually stunning, brilliant pace (it never becomes slow) and amazingly directed. I rank him among the best movie musicals of all time. The last time I looked, it was after about a 7-year break, and it still delivered. I am so proud of my colleague Minnesota Prince Rogers Nelson and I would like to tell him personally. He walked right in front of me during the aforementioned concert and said “Hello” to my nephew, but not to me. He chatted with his mom. I was a little depressed, but he is still No. 1 with me.
