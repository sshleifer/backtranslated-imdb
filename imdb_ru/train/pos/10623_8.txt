Michael Kallio plays a strong and convincing role in the role of Eric Siver, a worried young man who was badly hurt when he was a little boy, because of his monstrous, offensive, alcoholic stepfather Barry (really frightening image of Gunnar Hansen). Erik has a sympathetic bridegroom (sweetly played by lovely Tracy Newberry) and a job of deciphering the autopsy reports at the local morgue. Pursued by his dark past, caused by a bald, radiant Jack-demon (really creepy Michael Robert Brandon), and sent over the edge by the recent death of his mother, Eric leaves the depths and begins a brutal murder fun. Cleverly directed by Kallio (who also wrote a difficult, insightful script), with a uniformly beautiful playing soundless cast (Jeff Steiger is especially good in the role of mimicking guardian angel Eric Michael), rather rough, but generally polished cinematography by George Liber, believable believable characters, stunning outbreaks of brutal, shocking and relentlessly violent violence, Dan Colton's sullen, eerie score, uncompromisingly sad ending, ugly Detroit, places in Michigan, darkly serious tone and a taut, thrilling storyline that is constantly moving, this extremely powerful and gritty psychological horror thriller makes it often thrilling and disturbing. The real sleeper.
