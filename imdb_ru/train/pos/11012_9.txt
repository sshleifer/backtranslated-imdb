At first, I wasnâ€™t sure if I was watching a documentary, a propaganda film or a dramatic presentation. I guess, given the production time, it was a combination of all three. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable. But you had the feeling that there would be interesting scenes in the course of the film. We were able to witness what seemed to be a realistic training regime and equipment. <br /> <br /> Where this film gathered for me was closer to the end. The scenes had realism (at least as I perceived it), which I had not often encountered before. You could take part in the battle and present the thoughts of young fighters. It was mixed with the usual problems of portraying tolerable Japanese soldiers at a time when one would think that real Japanese actors would be a bit missed. <br /> <br /> The film is excellent as a source of the state of American thinking. in 1943 as a war with Japan. There was also interest in the Japanese over the assistance that the United States has provided to Japan in recent years.
