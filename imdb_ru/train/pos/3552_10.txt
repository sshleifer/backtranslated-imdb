I just want to add my two cents and forgive me if I repeat what has already been published, but I feel that it is worth reminding people about the eternal genius of Damon Runyon. Without the marvelous street, the merry works of Damon Runyon, this film would never have been shot, as well as most other great classics who deal with players, etc. Until 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a newspaper worker, and he was from Colorado, but he was sure that he had gotten _ the east coast street scene. If you are not a fan of old Hollywood comedies, I would recommend several other films from Damon Runyonâ€™s works; "Baby Lemonrop" and "Little Miss Marker" - is Bob Hope, who, in addition to his policy, has always been a funny person. (As a West Coast liberal, I also find his policy quite amusing!) Damon Runion lives !!!!
