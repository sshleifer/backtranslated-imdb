This has just been broadcast on the BBC, and I am very happy to see it. As the credits rolled, one cast made sure I would try. After just five minutes, I was completely immersed in this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> Yes, he was patterned and predictable, but it somehow added to his charm. Memories of the forties were beautifully placed and reflected a feeling comparable to several productions. <br /> <br /> A real well-being film, accented everywhere with outstanding music. When it comes out, I'll buy it!
