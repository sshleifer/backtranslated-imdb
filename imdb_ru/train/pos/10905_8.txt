In September 2003, 36-year-old Johnny Kennedy died. He had a terrible genetic condition called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch, leaving his body covered with painful ulcers and leading to a final fight against skin cancer. In recent months, Johnny decided to work with director Patrick Collerton to capture his life and death, and the result was a film, first shown in March, which was an inspirational, challenging and defiantly humorous story about one person. The film, not shying away from the gloomy reality of EB, also became a celebration of a life full of life. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and first shown in March 2004, the film “The Boy, whose skin fell off” became the most discussed documentary film of that year. He drew nearly five million viewers, and after the show, the public donated over half a million pounds to Johnny's charity, DEBRA. The Johnny Kennedy Memorial Fund was created to raise another half a million to ensure that Johnny Kennedy leaves a legacy of one million pounds sterling.
