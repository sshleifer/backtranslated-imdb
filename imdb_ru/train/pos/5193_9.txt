Sword fighting was outside of this world, the battle scenes were impressive without the wire flying technique (to the end), which are too common today. The scene with Chan and Prayer was probably the highlight of the film. The characters in the attack on the mansion of the bad guys were cliche, but in the film it suits. Injection of humor from Wu. <br /> <br /> The plot with its turns was unpredictable and exciting, and you could not tell who was good or bad, or which side people were on. <br /> <br /> A good sense of expectation and timely surprises. The depth of the plot is quite intense for a frivolous film of this genre and comes to you in a way that most kung-fu films do not.
