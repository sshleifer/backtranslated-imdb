Jackie Chan's name is a synonym for tricks. This film will never let you down. The first best chase scene and the last folding scene are so risky than a single miracle if he knows the meaning of fear. This film is very close to the best of Jackie, who is PROJECT A. But the main difference is that PROJECT A contains three stars, where, like in this film, Jackie carries the film completely on his shoulders. This is perhaps the main reason why this film made Jackie the biggest martial arts star, followed by Bruce Lee. also. What makes this film work is Jake's ability to show his respectable side, which is his contract with the typical martial arts hero. This film was accompanied by a sequel that was good, but was rather tame compared to its predecessor.
