He glorified himself as a great supporting actor in Glory, he proved that he was not Malcolm in the middle, a mediocre actor in Malcolm X, he showed fraternal love for action in Philadelphia, he pulled a bold dunk in “He got the game,” he did not strike and swung us like a hurricane in “The Hurricane”, he provided us with an effective education in the “Training Day”, and now he has demonstrated that he can also lead! Denzel Washington's directorial debut "Antwone Fisher" is the most exciting film of the year. This fisherman story has nothing to do with the defeat that took place with the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike the tragedy of the Dolphin, Antwone Fisher has an emotional, joyful conclusion. The film is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has anger management problems due to the disgust he experienced as a foster child. Denzel plays a naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother. Derek Luke's debut performance in the role of Antwone is the best acting game I've ever seen lately. I actually saw some details of Luke’s eccentric behavior, as I saw in Washington’s past speeches. It was as if Washington was saying to Luke: “I’m la la la Luc, I’m your acting father.” Good! I will postpone the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a distant galaxy. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as a psychologist was a workshop. But what can you expect from the actual "Master D"? "Antwone Fisher" was written by none other than Antwone Fisher himself. Emotional pathos, which he inserted into the script of his fabulous life, was from the material of the "Fisher King". Greetings, Chief Washington, "catching the right bait in Antwone Fisher. ***** Excellent
