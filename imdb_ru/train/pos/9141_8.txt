You can discuss Prince’s acting talent or even his choice to parody his own life in this film. There is no debate about his musical talent either then or now. It seems to be dark - twenty years later, but the music remains relevant and fantastic. <br /> <br /> Having survived the excitement of this film (he graduated from high school in '85), I can say that at that time there was nothing more. From Tipper Gore (Al's wife) trying to censor Little Nikki and everything else under the sun through PMRC (Parent Music Resource Center) to each Air Group at the time she disguised herself as Prince, it was the hottest thing. For at least a few weeks, the Prince was more than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We all waited for the film and were soooo excited when it came out on the screens. It did not disappoint. ALL were captured. At the time, I was a drug addict from MTV (then they actually played music ... all the time), the Prince played at least once or twice an hour. I should clarify this comment, saying that at that time my favorites were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, A Flock of Gulls and others in the punk / new genre. ”The music of the Prince of that time was superior to all types and styles. One of the reasons that some of them now seem so trashy and contrite, in that then it was sooooooo big. All things that remind you of the 80s, were iconic then. It was mainstream and now it’s like a cliché. It became so popular that it became ridiculous. It's like Grandma's TV commercial for Wendy's Hamburger. <br /> <br /> Now it looks stupid, because EVERYONE was captured by it (unfortunately, something like a strange violet macaroni or something like that. In any case, I hope it gave you all a little understanding.
