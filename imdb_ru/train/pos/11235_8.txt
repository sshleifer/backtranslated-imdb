Perfectly done, and together with New Travel this is a great continuation! Amazing to see James Cowley in the latest episode of "Vigil" Check it out! <br /> <br /> I like the growing characterization, and I think we have good replacements for television actors in a piece created by fans. This show manages to catch the feeling quite well, as they claim that over the years it has improved with experience, and I hope that with even more experience, a strong script editor, as well as an increase in time and CGI, HF will become more wonderful than it really is! <br /> <br /> Good work for all interested parties! <br /> <br /> (I have a HUGE weak point for Lefler and MacFarland (great game), although I’m a little tired of the Lefler laws. WELL already! Shelby is great (although a bit excited), and it's cool that she got the ship. Commodore Yen is good (like Fred Flintstone), but he lacks the insight of the commanding officer, and he seems to be really pleased with himself. Doc, Counselor and Rawlins are right in my eyes, like WONDERFUL Nechaev (what a wonderful the accent is REAL Russian! (well, I think Rene hails from the Czech Republic.) <br /> <br /> This gets my voice, and CGI - kewl. Some of the green screen are obvious, but with a small budget? <br /> <br /> Really glad that I and that! <br /> <br /> (OK, some acting games are not very good, but they are made by fans and therefore may be variable - sorry, mmm. Cole) <br /> <br /> The fun stuff is too thick (Graham Norton will be confused). Trek doesn't pay so much attention to heterosexual couples, so pointers gay with all this? There is no need to show someone's sexuality to such an extent - I hope that they will reduce it and allow Aster & Zen to be people who are not tokens - I don’t treat my gay friends differently, they are just ordinary guys. <br /> Musically this is a mixed bag. I can say that all this is in Trek OST style and works most of the time, but time and time may not coincide (the end of “Worst Fears Part 2” skips difficulties and editing. I love the fact that they use “Galaxy” Quest ”music ! <br /> <br /> I, of course, cannot wait for more !! Dazza <br /> <br /> "Never give up, never force!" <br /> <br /> Viva les borders
