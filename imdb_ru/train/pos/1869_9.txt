The story of neglect and child abuse by Antwon Fisher inspires all of us who have witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children. Abandoned by a restless mother, Antwon never met his father. Growing up with offenders who go to church, who use the “n-word” not only to intimidate and hurt, but also as a term of affection, as a young man testifying how his best friend is killed in protracted , persistent racial insults and being teased while serving in the navy, Antwon's anger slowly turns into a positive force when advised by a navy psychiatrist, and love enters his life. <br /> <br /> The scene where Antwone meets with her own mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film. Stunned by the unexpected confrontation, a woman in silence listens as the young man tells her how he lived without crime, addicted to drugs, raised children left and right, and all this despite his extremely unfavorable circumstances. <br /> <br /> If this scene was not powerful enough, then the next one will take her home from there (and open the floodgate): Reception to greet Antwone at home; dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that he is part of this great family. <br /> <br /> One of the messages of this wonderful film is that there are many kind and sincere people who help orphans and unwanted children. Even if some of the houses and administrators do not seem to care and seem self-serving, many give it all up. The character who found Antwon's "dossier" after he revealed the circumstances of his birth is one of those "bright lights" in the darkness of the system. <br /> <br /> The DVD contains a track in French, with various subtitle options. , as well as additional functions and information about the adoptive parents. <br /> <br /> As a Clevelander, I appreciated the footage. No matter where you come from, you will be deeply touched by this autobiographical stone.
