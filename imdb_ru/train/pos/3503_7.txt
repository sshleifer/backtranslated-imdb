If you still remember that summer when you had your first kiss, the first boy / girlfriend or puppy's first love ... this film is for you! So, this film would win and never get an Oscar, BUT as a Dominican. I really liked it ... In this film there are some things that can just emerge from your head, if you are not part of the culture ... raised by a grandmother, who is both a mother and a father, the youngest son is born and bathes in a tin Cafe Bustelo (ooo, Dominican!), Judy is chased by the neighboring men, goes to church and lights a prayer candle ... the brilliance of the film was in those minor details. Of course, it wasn’t an extraction of all the cinematic extravaganza’s works, but it wasn’t meant to become NOR if it was intended to be an educational tool for those who want to learn about Latin culture (advice: make new friends instead ). This film was rather bitter-sweet and artificial, but it retained its reality, not taking itself too seriously. As in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien", it was just a story about the majority of a single boy. I recommend it (especially Dominican!) = O)
