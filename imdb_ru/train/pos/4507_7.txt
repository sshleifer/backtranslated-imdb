I was really stunned by how much a film that is over 60 years old can impress me. It is almost two hours, there are absolutely no stars in it, there are subtitles, but, nevertheless, it is interesting and interesting to watch. Most of all I was struck by the realism of the film. You could almost feel the cold of the ice, because you could see that the storms are real. This is a relief in the world of CGI, like today. I wondered how much work it should have been for Van Dyke. I read somewhere that it took 17 months. Now, who wants to talk more about the Titanic? This is a great movie with a great message, and I would recommend it to future directors to see how wonderful and realistic films can be if they are aimed only at realism, and not at visual effects.
