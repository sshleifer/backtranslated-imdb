What I like about you is one of those TV shows that you should see, but not sure what you will see, this is a great start, and it draws you into the series just for fun, the second part, I'm season 2-3, they are more stale come and go in what you want. what happens with many episodes is that they don’t end up with something special, because the second part of the series always goes down the drain, this one is also in some way, the third part is the one that spoils and destroys the whole series, usually but no, this finale is perfect for the show, it’s perfect, in fact, I was very angry with all these guys in Val’s life, in fact I wanted to end Jeff at the end, but this changed later, they decided to take Vika the series after almost 3 seasons without him, and this was the biggest surprise, and kzhe what made the show come out on top. <br /> <br /> to see him many times, the series is actually very cool, I just don’t expect the second part to be so good, but it’s not like that, but the third part does what was needed and made the series such which was worth all this, I am glad to say that I was happy and happy about the series, and now I will go to see two guys, a girl and a pizzeria, when I see the whole series, I will be back ...
