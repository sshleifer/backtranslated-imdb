Seeing Arthur on TV many times, I laughed so much at the role of Dudley Moore when Arthur was a happy drunk millionaire who was lucky and he was hysterical, but John Gilgud, like his servant / father figure, Hobson, was just as charming. I bought a DVD a few weeks ago and watched it, despite the fact that after almost 27 years, it is still as pleasant as the role of Liza Minnelli, because the love interest was fascinating, the chemistry between them was magical. <br /> <br /> Arthur Bach, (Moore) - a spoiled drunken millionaire who has a bill that says, like a national debt, he does not want to grow up and loves to act like a child. His actions are controlled by his dry English butler Hobson (Gilgud). It seems that no one cares about Arthur, except for him, Arthur's father (Barbour) sets an ultimatum if he does not marry the terrible blond socialite Susan Johnson (Eikenberry) in four weeks he will cut off the inheritance to his son by 750 million dollars. <br /> <br /> However, Arthur meets and falls in love with Linda Marolla (Minnelli), a young working class waitress and tie thief, he now faces a difficult decision to marry for love or money. When Hobson dies, Arthur finally grows up and breaks up with Susan before the wedding, leaving him to save both money and his true love. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a really charming romantic comedy for everyone.
