I swear I could watch this movie every weekend in my life and never bothered! Every aspect of human emotion is so magically captured by the actions, script, direction, and general feeling of this film. It has been a long time since I watched the movie, which actually made me gasp for breath, reflect on sadness and feel every intended feeling that penetrates this most wonderful work! We need more movies like this! Mike Binder: are you listening ???
