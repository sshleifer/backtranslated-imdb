"Gandhi as husband and father?" always discussed by people in india. “Gandhi ... my father” is a story that few would have known about such details. Of course, understanding the personal life of Gandhi. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked the film for history and cinematography. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna and Shefali Shah did a good job. Most of the scenes from the movie will be good wallpapers for your desktop ... a commendable work. Traditional Indian folk music as a background score during certain parts of the film gives a good feeling of what is happening. <br /> <br /> However, I didn’t really like the style of the story. In some moments, I discovered that this tone is too dramatized. <br /> <br /> Overall, good work by Anil Kapoor Productions. I would recommend this as "a must-see once." 8/10
