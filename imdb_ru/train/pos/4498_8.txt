Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and Robson Green !! Wow, what a trio ... Okay, this is not Anna Karenina, but this is a good love story, very well written and well played by all. Even a few moments of "laughing out loud" mixed up with some pretty serious observations of loyalty, bias towards age and aging parents / problems with Alzheimer's disease. <br /> <br /> Fancy guitar music was added to the story. <br /> Although I have been a fan of Mrs. Annis since "Lilly" (in the 70s) and Mr. Kitchen since the "Pirates" and "Enchanted April", I only recently discovered that Mr. Green (“I and Mrs. Jones”, “Touching Evil”, etc.) Makes me ask a question - why haven’t I seen the “Reckless” until recently ?? !! Admittedly, this is more of a “flick of a tiptoe” than what a person will sit through; this is ideal for watching lazy on a rainy day.
