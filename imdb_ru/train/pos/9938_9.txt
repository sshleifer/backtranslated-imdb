We bought the "Es war einmal das Leben" DVD set (German) / "Once ... life" (English) for our bilingual children, because everyone loved "Es war einmal der Mensch" (German) / "" Once. Man ”(English) (We, the parents, saw him as a child), and he exceeded even high expectations! The series is very well made, does not show its age, and our children at different ages love it to watch. At the same time they will find out what their parents didn’t know before, much later. The series covers everything related to the human body: organs, feelings, blood, infections, antibodies and much another in animated episodes of 20–25 minutes. Topics that some people may find “sensible”, such as digestion and reproduction, are covered with taste, care and convenience for children (the reproduction episode begins to be covered mainly where the child begins growing), at the same time (as usual) informative and fun. <br /> <br /> Children are usually fascinated by how their bodies work, and thanks to the episodes they get an idea of ​​this in the context of their surroundings. The episode format switches between the outside world (family with two children) and the inside of the body. For example, in the episode covering the infection, the boy accidentally cut himself, and the wound became infected, and the episode tells how the body reacts to it. In the same way, episodes of feelings, such as hearing, vision, link what is happening inside the body with the context of the outside world, and the episode of breathing and oxygen circulation in the blood covers the entire life cycle, including (briefly) where oxygen (plants) comes from. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best children's programs - I would say that every family with children definitely needs to see it!
