As a Colombo fan, I was very disappointed in Corky Romano. Although it is, of course, a funny movie, the character of Falk's boss was far from the sweet lieutenant, whom he had played for so many years, especially with the offensive language that he used. After Corky Romano, I was genuinely surprised and spoiled by Mr. Peter Falk. HOWEVER, having just seen “Finding John of Christmas” and his predecessor “City without Christmas”, for the first time in a week, I have to say that “Max”, the amazing character of Peter Falk in both films, is undoubtedly as memorable and cute "Colombo". While parts of the film are quite predictable, such scenes in no way take away the pleasure of viewing the story. I would also like me to record both of these heartbreaking Christmas films, and I highly recommend them, be it a Falk fan, a Christmas nut or just someone who enjoys the occasional pleasant movie of the week. This film may be lost among the many holiday films for television, so be sure to find “Finding John of Christmas” before it is too late.
