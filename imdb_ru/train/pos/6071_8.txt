I contend that no matter how hard I try, I will never find the best version of the film Othello. If you love Kenneth Bran’s magnificent masterpieces “Much Ado About Nothing” (1993) and “Hamlet” (1996) as much as I do, I am sure that you will also find Oliver Parker's Othello irresistible. Laurence Fishburn has been in various gorgeous roles throughout his career. He was quite awesome in the movie “Boys in the Hood” (1991) - I always considered his funny role of violent styles to be his greatest achievement. It was, of course, long before I saw it. <br /> <br /> He plays the role of Othello, and he probably plays the most difficult role in his career, but he does a brilliant, fantastic job. Irene Jacob is absolutely charming, Desdemona, and Kenneth Branagh is just phenomenal in the most exciting role of Iago’s crooked, manipulative plot. The wonderful "Othello" is part of the absolute elite among the brilliant works of Shakespeare. This concerns his favorite topics: crooked, envy, deceit and jealousy. This film adaptation is definitely one of the best films that I have seen in the plays of William Shakespeare.
