The narrative confirms the classic image of good against evil in the form of a brother’s fight against a brother. The protagonist, Lin McAdam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and righteousness. His brother, acting under the name of the Dutchman Henry Brown, played by Stephen McNally, is in favor of the classic stage coach who is robbing a western criminal who is being chased by his brother for the murder of his father. The world in which the story unfolds is the classic anti-utopian west, where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to remove their weapons as soon as they enter the city, and the person responsible for maintaining this rule of law is the classic westerner. Lawyer Vyat Earp. <br /> <br /> There are also such flat characters typical of western ones as the murderous Indian warrior, the besieged cavalryman and the unfortunate girl in the hood. <br /> <br /> Another important archetype in this film, which gives the film its name, is the Winchester custom rifle. Weapons can be considered as an allegory for the rewards that are received by those who do something decently. As soon as it is stolen from its rightful owner, it brings tragedy to anyone who comes in contact with it. In this sense, he recalls other such icons as the Holy Grail in the Raiders of the Lost Ark and the bloody letter in Salvation of Private Ryan. This gives the film an element of surrealism, which is usually absent in westerns, a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols. <br /> <br /> Being essentially a film about revenge, he shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as “Without a Name of Jack Arnold in The Pool” and Clint Eastwood’s The Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> In Winchester, the 73rd year, there is also an unspoken topic of rape. Waco Johnny Dean, one of the villains of the film, which Dan Durya played very effectively, kidnaps a woman after killing her husband. A flying cowboy plays with a gentle husband and sends him out like a caricature of a cat playing with an insect before biting off his head. Waco Johnny Dean eventually gets what comes to him after contacting Winchester's ominous rifle. <br /> <br /> Winchester’s 73-year-old main story resembles the mythological story of Jason and his search for the golden fleece, as told in Apollonius’s Argonautics. Both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object, which has some intangible quality. Like Jason, Stuart’s character jumps from one adventure to another in search of a one-of-a-kind prize. Another theme of Winchester, 73 years old, similar to a mythical tale - the struggle of the brothers. Several ancient stories deal with this problem, such as the Jewish biblical story of Cain and Abel and the vulgar story of Romulus and Remus. <br /> <br /> Regarding the topic of abduction and rape, which is present in the film Anthony Mann, it is present in many mythological works, such as rape in Europe, as described by Ovid in his Metamorphoses. <br /> <br /> Winchester '73 is an excellent example of Western genre and acts as an objective correlation for many classic American Western and ancient mythological themes.
