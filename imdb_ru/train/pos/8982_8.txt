Gosh, it was a lot to accept. I was pretty mesmerized everywhere. It was pretty nice, although I would say that editing is largely connected with it. I canâ€™t believe that this guy stayed on good terms with many of them (especially Anton) to get all these shots without any serious ... beef. The dandy worked well, the children from the middle class, who took advantage of their position (and rightly so!). I felt bad because of Johnstown, and especially because of Anton, who may not have been like many others. An excellent part of filmmaking and a large selection of items. I recommend this to any music / movie lover. You will probably learn something about filmmaking.
