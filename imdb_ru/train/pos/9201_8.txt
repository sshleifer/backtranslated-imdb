Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zinat Aman (Jasbir / Janis) are brothers and sisters raised in single-parent families. Jasbir (sister) is growing in a rich environment, but this is not enough to make her give up her life and eventually join the hippie movement, which ultimately leads her to drugs. Prashant (brother), on the other hand, grows up in a less affluent environment, but grows into a mature gentleman. History notes that Prashant is trying to save his younger sister (who is constantly in a trance) from the hostile hippie environment. This film stands the test of time, commenting that cults and hippie groups are a place for those who are disappointed in their lives, when they should stand up and be counted in the face of disaster. Magnificent musical compositions in this film mean different things in different situations and for different people, and the director evokes an eerie feeling in him.
