Barbara Stenvik as a real cool cookie, a waitress for the working classes (and a prostitute at the hands of her father), who flees to New York and uses her womanly trick to get a job, moving on to Ipoteka and Escrow, and then as assistant secretary second commander in the bank. A dramatic study of a female character who was not afraid of being obscene, has not lost its power over the years, and Barbara played the storm (portraying a woman who studies for a first-class actress herself). Having invested a small Nietzschean philosophy in her wicked life, this lady completely suppresses feelings, but she never loses our charm, our reverence. She is ingenuous, hard-boiled, wide, but she is not a bitch, and she is neither a cannibal nor a hater. This girl is all for herself, and while we wait for her to eventually learn about real values ​​in life, her journey up and down the ladder of success provides hot, sexual entertainment. John Wayne (with thick black hair and too many eyes) succeeds in the early role of a file service assistant, although all the supporting players are pretty good. *** from ****
