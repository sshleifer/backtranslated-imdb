I watched the first part two days ago, and today I saw the second part. Of course, the two parts are different worlds, so everything that I just saw shakes me a little. I felt absorbed in the knowledge that Che was inevitable; for me it clouded the whole movie. I believe that it was Soderberg who wanted us to feel the slowly evolving inevitability of his death. The second part was so sad compared to, again inevitable, but in Cuba it was positive, and in Bolivia it was so negative. The movement's policy in Bolivia was referred to only didactically, but rarely opposed it. For me, the most memorable scenes were at the end of the film: the confrontation with the jailer and softer conversations with a Bolivian official, where this official asks Che about the peasants' inability to support his revolution. I did not believe that national differences play such a big role as in the conflict, the Argentines against the Bolivians. I thought that Soderberg was excellent at coping with the inevitable supply problems in the revolutionary struggle; how do you get food without opposition to peasants who lack themselves. I was amazed at how difficult it would be to try, as Che tried. I suppose it is all in time; is there enough anger against the government to start the movement; in Bolivia was not. Che realized the terrible corundum of revolutionaries in his letter to Fidel, read at the beginning of the film: if not now, then after 50 years. A very provocative and well-made film; Do your best to see it.
