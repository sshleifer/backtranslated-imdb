I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses, and I also work in an emergency medical facility. Over the years, I have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions, attended numerous conferences on pathogens born in the blood, and saw several patients seriously ill from pathogens caused by blood transfusions. I also heard several Jehovah's Witnesses say that they would die if they refused blood, and after 26 years in the field I never saw this happen, leaving the question: “Is it really unwise to refuse blood transfusions or a community in a large win from the battle on this issue? The question for Jehovah's Witnesses is moral. “You must abstain from blood” is not an ambiguous statement. Thanks for this movie and for the opportunity to comment on it.
