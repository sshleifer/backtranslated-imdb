I have Ralph Bakshi's forgotten masterpiece Fire and Ice in the old PLO rental video. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, this is better than any other film about Conan that you have ever seen. Of course, this is stupid, but who cares? It stood the test of time, and the only way it began to look crappy was a comparison with modern fantasy epics, such as LOTR: FOTR (although I love this movie.) <br /> <br /> The plot is: between Fire and Ice, the daughter of kings is abducted by inhuman beings Jarols (Ice), while the only survivor from the affected village rescues her. <br /> <br /> Yes, it doesn’t sound as original as nurse Betty, but that’s not the point. It really brings to life an interesting idea about the world of two enemies: Fire and Ice. And it succeeds. <br /> <br /> As for the action scenes: excellent. They are well handled, have an amazing suspension and a lot of loud noises. Just check the climate battle, now it's over! <br /> <br /> Game and dialogue: competent. Indeed. They will not be nominated for an Oscar, but they are fine and do not get on your nerves. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty good. Filmed on 3D and rotoscoped (I think), it looks pretty good. Many backgrounds look really detailed and well-drawn, and although the designs of the characters seem a bit one-dimensional, everything is in order. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a beautiful abandoned little gem that will entertain you more than any of the supernatural "entertainment." 10/10
