Saw it as a young naive punk when he was first released. If I left the theater, I smelled like a child, trying not to see anyone. So, when I saw it again now, in 2007, I knew what to expect, and the sobs were ready and caught fire when their necessary moment approached. Fortunately, this time I was at home. <br /> <br /> What I didn’t remember from my youthful viewing - or couldn’t have noticed because of this, is the technical brilliance of this film. Use memories that tell so many stories without resorting to dialogue. The work of the camera, which seemed to put the viewer along with the characters in the scene. Think about opening up when Joe crosses the street to the diner, the camera turns behind the woman and child sitting on the bench in the foreground, framing the street scene. <br /> <br /> The story itself and the characters are poor, sad and cruel. It is very touching to be drawn into a human drama like this, with people whom most of us are likely to reject. On the other hand, Joe and Ratso can be any of us. It must have been the 70s when I saw this. I remember that after leaving the theater, I was forced to find a company of friends. All these years, I'm glad I'm not alone this evening. It's a damn good movie.
