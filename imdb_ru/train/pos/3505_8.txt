I have no idea how IMDb sorts reviews, but I know that, as often happens on Amazon.com, there are an astounding amount of very negative reviews for this film that repeat the same, somewhat obscure talking points, almost verbatim . Campaign? Only IMDb knows. <br /> <br /> Regarding this movie: this is normal. This is a funny, cute and very simple movie. <br /> <br /> More than ten years have passed since I worked in Brooklyn, lived in Queens and visited relatives in the South Bronx. But I did not find anything unreliable or exploitative in these children. Grandma - a strange character? Yeah. Dialogue and plot confirm this? Yes, fortunately, they do. Are other films available at LES with children from the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico? Still would. Does that make this movie a crime? How some of the (in my opinion, astroturf) comments will offer? Barely Let thousands of plastic flowers bloom. <br /> <br /> This is better than in any episode of Degrassi Jr. High or Degrassi High. Laugh at the comparison, but _ we never had this, and I am deeply moved by the humility of this film and the gentle spirit. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to know the background to all this slander! :-D
