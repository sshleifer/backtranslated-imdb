Ella was superb, Franchaux was inevitably excessive (but he played similar roles in other films, such as The Man on the Eiffel Tower), and Alan almost did not exist, but the film was definitely “delighted”. <Br /> <br /> * light front spoiler *: I wonder how many times Elisha Cook strangled in her films, but I seem to recall other examples. I will not call the murderer, but I think that this is necessarily obvious because of the demands of the “thriller” plot. <br /> <br /> A very well-made, but outdated film “Noir” (for example: everyone smoked like crazy, and the police were really serial characters. And there were no corpses, unlike today's blood festivals.) performed in the usual format of short scenes from that period. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
