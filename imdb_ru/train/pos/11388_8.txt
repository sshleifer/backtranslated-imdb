If I remember, Ira Gershwin, the writer and brother of George, offered the Gershwin catalog for this film, and it was sold out by producers. In many ways, it was a typical 50s musical from the Freed Unit at MGM, directed by Vincent Minelli with great help from Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> Gershwins were, of course, one of the greatest Broadway musical groups, but, in my opinion, George himself was one of the greatest American composers, and all that! Gene Kelly was, of course, one of the two greatest dancers of the movie musical (one assumption about the other?), And I don't think his casting ever was in doubt. But I think the rest of the cast needs some explanation: Oscar Levant was a famous person in his time and, like George Gershwin's real friend, he should have been in this film. He was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer, as well as a famous neurotic and hypochondriac, and here, as always, he plays himself. <br /> <br /> Leslie Caron was unknown at that time, and she was from the French type "Gamin". A talented dancer, she was never a real beauty. George Getari, who plays the role of Maurice Chavalier, oh, I mean Henri Baurel, was a Greek, not a Frenchman, but he certainly is more than good as a French boulevard, even if he is too young for this role. <br /> <br /> Gene Hoffer’s voice is sound, but Getari has a better vocal system. Although Gena is better to play elsewhere, as, obviously, in Singing in the Rain, where his character is much more calculating, even here he sometimes shows himself as something like a heel (He was, for good reason, cast as the original Joey heel in Pal Joey, a Broadway musical.) I was not as fascinated by his “I Got Rhythm” scene with children, which does not look as spontaneous as I thought. <br /> <br /> I Also the character of Mina Nina Foch was rather annoying. <br /> <br /> But the highlight of the film is obviously the long ballet at the end of the film, based on the title music with decorations and costumes in the styles of the great French impressionist artists. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to believe Gene and Oscar as struggling artists, and I don’t think the musical numbers are as good as they could be, but overall, Gershwin’s music is very good in this the movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD is well made with beautifully clear graphics (when this assumption is red) and the mono sound is good but small detail is small.
