I happened to borrow this film from a friend who knows nothing about it, and he turned out to be an outstanding documentary film about traveling on an ancient ship across the endless expanses of the ocean. Thor Heyerdahl developed the theory that the ancient Incas in Peru managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to Polynesia, based on certain relics found in both places, certain types of ancient ships of the sea, which, as we know, were available, analysis of ocean and wind currents, as well as the knowledge that the Incas really traveled to sea in an unspecified quantity. <br /> <br /> To test his hypothesis, Heyerdahl and his crew built a ship as close as possible to what the ancient Incas had, using only balsa wood and other materials available at the time, and set off from Lima, the capital of Peru to try to get to the islands of Polynesia, which are about 5,000 miles away. <br /> <His theory, like much about ancient history, cannot be proved with 100% certainty, but the coverage of their journey provides strong support that he is right. The film is really a bit more than the narration of the shots taken during the more than 100-day expedition, but this is a very detailed description of what it looked like and the trials and tribulations they faced. I often want Oscar-winning documentaries to be easier to find, and this one more than 50 years ago is still as interesting and informative as I am sure when it was first released.
