Nice to see Jorge Fox in a role where she often smiles. Also loved to hear her singing. A nice change to see her outside of her CSI / West Wing / ER roles. The film itself was interesting, but it seemed to miss some explanations in many parts. A few characters seemed miserable at one moment and happy the next, and you could only think about why. Although each character was strange, and in some cases I could not wait to see what they would do next, or hear what they would say next. This film was not full of insanely clean people, but was rather realistic people who could make mistakes, treat them badly, and then find a way to fix them.
