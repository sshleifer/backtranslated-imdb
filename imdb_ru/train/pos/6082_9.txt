I always liked the Shakespearean version of Kenneth Brann, because he always does a very good job, but in this film, the one who shoots the entire film is none other than “always a great actor” Laurence Fishburn. Of course, he made some bad choices in films, despite the fact that he is a wonderful actor, but in this they really give us the real Othello: passion, intensity of jealousy, as it intensifies with the well-portrayed paranoia of Fishburn and, moreover, we are finally given black Othello! <br /> <br /> I don’t think they could choose a better Othello. Who else could give him this mixture of sympathy / antipathy, love / hate and, not to mention, those fiery eyes ...? Brana is good as always, but not at the peak, Desdemona Irina Jacob is pretty good, but a bit gloomy, while Laurence Fishburn does raise her and makes her a very interesting and enjoyable film. Look at this.
