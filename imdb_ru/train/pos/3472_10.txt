Very light spoiler. <br /> <br /> This film (despite the fact that it is only on TV) is absolutely excellent. I really didn’t pay attention to differences in attitudes or accents, so I cannot comment on this. The acting was so good that I had to pinch myself and say: "Remember, this is just a film, this REALLY DID NOT HAPPEN." As I sat and listened to Harris and Quinn’s lectures, I knew that it was John and Paul who would be talking about this if they really held this meeting. Unceremonious comments and burns from John were right on his character (especially in the restaurant!), Like his depression, while Paul was very calm and relaxed. Both actors did a great job and I was glad to see this movie. This is an evil experience for any Beatles fan. And get ready for a few surprises!
