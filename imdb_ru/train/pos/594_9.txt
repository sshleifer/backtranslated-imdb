13 days of fame tells a traditional tale with sympathy for the Mexican point of view. The main problem in this film was that while cowboy actor James Arness played the role of Jim Bowie convincingly, the rest of the famous actors in the cast of Brian Keith (Davy Croquet) and Lorne Green (Sam Houston) were too old. > <br /> Raul Julia played General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna with grace and dignity thanks to a professional soldier who still won the battle. The scriptwriter, in which he reproaches his officers for failing to install guards and prevent attacks, was not understood by the writers. Inability to follow the situation is the main problem in the army. Santa Anna was within her powers to be angry. Raul Julia superbly carried a bad letter across the stage. <br /> <br /> Kathleen York was an impressive woman named Suzanne Dickinson, who should be remembered for her courage. However, Kathleen York may have been reminded that when the Dickins are from Pennsylvania, they probably don't sound very Sautron.
