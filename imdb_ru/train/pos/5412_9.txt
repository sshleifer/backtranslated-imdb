As a Pokemon fan, I really liked this movie. He introduces the new legendary Pokemon (like every movie) and adds depth to the relationship between his characters. However, I do not expect that those who are not Pokemon fans will enjoy it (including the most adults). Some lines were commonplace, but this may be somewhat inevitable when dubbing a movie into English. The animation was beautiful, although there were a couple of details that didnâ€™t look very good. And although the villain is a bit trivial, I think the films have done a good job driving past the different types of villains, and I guarantee you that they are not all like this. To those who did not like it, I tell each his own, but Pokemon fans will like it.
