This picture was banned in American cinemas in 1930 because of the nude nature of Hedy Lamarr (Eva Hermann), which caused all sorts of problems among women in the 1930s, but not so much for the male population. This story concerns a young woman named Eva Hermann, who marries an elderly man and is transported across the threshold on the wedding night, and the husband never marries and is worried about all sorts of small things, such as his shoes and killing beetles. Eve leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. On a hot summer day, Eve rides a horse and decides to swim in a lake in the forest. Her horse runs away and she runs after him, and a young man is watching her, who finds her clothes and returns them to Eve. These two people become very familiar, and the romance begins. There are still many interesting problems that arise when you watch this movie to the very end. Enjoy the great Classic film that was the Shocker Film in 1933. Enjoy.
