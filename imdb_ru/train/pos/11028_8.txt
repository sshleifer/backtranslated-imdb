Honestly, I didnâ€™t really like this movie when I first saw it. But I think the problem is that I did not see it in the theater. Big mistake ! Because the # 1 thing to see in Cliffhanger is the settings, and # 2 is the cinematography. Try watching this movie on the largest TV and great sound system. The music is good and puts the film on a higher level (and commercial potential). The more I see it, the more I like it. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best Renny Harlin movies. This guy knows about the action. Die Hard 2, A long kiss goodbye, etc. And this is especially good in this film. The special effect is great and effective. Stallone really needs this film to return with success. Another nice to see him!
