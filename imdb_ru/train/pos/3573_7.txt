This film was almost an excellent creative film. A mixture of Shakespearean, pop, jazz and fairy tales. This film was a creative twist on Cinderella. Featuring a strong cast, led by a great Kathleen Turner, this film had everything for it. Everything except manufacturing values. I almost never think the film needs special effects or big budgets, but with such unsurpassed production as this, it turned out with the same disgusting quality as any other film created for a television movie. In addition to the best cinematography, this film was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
