Cinderella is a film about a young girl whose mother passed away, and her father married again. When her father died, Cinderella's stepmother became very angry for her and forced her to do all the household chores, like cleaning after her two evil stepsisters. One day, the king sent a message to all the single women at the Royal Ball in honor of his son to find a wife. Of course, Cinderella did not go, but her stepsisters did. Cinderella was very upset and thought that she would not be able to attend the Royal Ball until her fairy appeared. So she did a little magic and turned Cinderella into a beautiful woman, but she had to return by midnight, because then the magic changed again. At the Royal Ball, Cinderella loses track of time, and the clock strikes midnight, so she runs out of the palace and loses her glass slipper. Then the king orders the duke to find the women who wore the slipper. The duke searched every house, but finally found the women to whom he belonged, Cinderella. <br /> <br /> Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske made one of Disney’s best animated films in the 1950s. This film is about a fairy tale. At the beginning of the film, Cinderella was a servant in her family, and she had no one to love her, but with a little magic her whole life changed and finally found love. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing about Cinderella is music. When Cinderella's magical daughter appeared, having created her magic, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a kid, it was one of my favorite songs to sing at my house, so I will never forget her. I also liked the role when Cinderella and the Prince sang the song “So this is love” when they danced, because they realized that they were in love. In general, this film was my favorite film when I was a small child, because every little girl wants to live a fabulous life.
