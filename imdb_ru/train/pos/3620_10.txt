I just saw this movie tonight, the premiere. That was great!! I am a big fan of sports films, and this was one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you read this ... my sister lives in Austin, where you live ... and she had to buy you a drink once ... well ... she seemed to raise you ... but she didnâ€™t want !: C) [not that someone would believe in it ...]) Anyway, this is a great movie. Anyone who loves a good sports movie should go out and watch it! : WITH)
