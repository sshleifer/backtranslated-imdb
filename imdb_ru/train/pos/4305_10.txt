Grand Canyon is a very strange bird. This is a completely unique urban play in which the connection of the whole plot cannot convey much. <br /> <br /> It seems that its central theme is internal uncertainty inherent in the lives of people of all races, origins and standard of living. But to declare that the theme of the film will terribly downplay its scale. Similarly, it is useless to show it in a certain genre. <br /> <br /> The film has volumes to say, although there are probably different volumes for each viewer, and it all speaks this way without preaching from many points of view. after all, I can't even define its central message for myself. <br /> <br /> However, he does his business with such laser precision; each pillar, line of dialogue and band of background music contribute to its all-pervading mood and powerful message, which pleasantly surprises me, and after each viewing I leave very thoughtful. However, it is not at all stuffy. Sparkling film with great cast and everything works.
