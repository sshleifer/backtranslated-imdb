Ten of the 11 short films in this film are masterpieces (only Egyptian disappointed me). Unfortunately, everyone except the Mexican director decided to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9-11: Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, widows of Srebrenica, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, the Pinochet coup and subsequent bloodshed suicide bombings in Israel, American Muslim-Americans affected by paranoia, and American persecution, older people living alone, and the consequences of World War II in the hearts of Asian soldiers. This may say something sad about the limits of empathy in both respects: directors may feel that Americans ignore the suffering of the rest of the world and care only about their own tragedies, while they actually do the same with their short films. br /> <br /> Surprising myself, I found the work of Sean Penn one of the best in the collection, and *** SPOILER AHEAD *** I also think that he portrays Ernest Borgnine as a half-crazy old man growing up in a New York apartment experiencing the happiest moment in the life of her widow, when the sun shines through his window after the WTC “fell out of the light”, I think this can also be one of the most annoying, as a wide American audience will see.
