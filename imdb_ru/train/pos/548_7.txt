This film was as good as some other Westerns made by Anthony Mann and James Stewart, such as Winchester 73 and Naked Spur, and much better than Thunder Bay and Bend River. This film begins as a run of the western mill, but becomes more and more difficult. It all starts with the fact that Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan arrive in Seattle, and Stewart is accused of murder. He is found innocent, but the cattle are stolen by a corrupt judge. Then Stewart agrees to lead something, but I forget what it is, but Stewart only cares about returning his cattle. In the course of the film, Stewart only cares about himself as his character in Naked Spur. It gets much better halfway after they arrive in Alaska. This is one of the best westerns of Stuart.
