* Firstly, although many say that this is the worst show, I donâ€™t think this is true, considering that this film perfectly reflects the mentality of 21st century adolescents. It provides excellent opportunities to make you laugh and remind you of a good teenager when you would like to have the same pleasure as the heroes. <br /> <br /> * I agree with the fact that this is a movie for teenagers, but comedy films are not intended for teenagers at the moment? ... cinemas are mostly a place for teenagers; In addition, watching such a movie during an overnight stay or something like that is very good for having a good time. <br /> <br /> * Many comment on the amount of nudity in this movie. Well ... let's really ... doesn't this reflect the thoughts of teenage guys like the ones in the film? what would you like to see ... smart books, romantic things? this is not at all what these adolescents would be in the mind ... <br /> <br /> * In conclusion, I think that if you are a teenager, you should definitely watch the movie, and even if you are really an adult man or woman , you should see this if you still have a teenage mind, or you often think about how he was a teenager, or the like. Thanks for reading!
