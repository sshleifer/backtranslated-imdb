After Dickens published it in 1837, OLIVER TWIST had contradictions as well as success. His picture of life in the urban ghettos was something shocking and new, and his creation of the central figures of the novel with the participation of criminals was another innovation. /> <br /> Once he walked around London and handed over a young woman with whom he was friends. He said hello, but she was pretty tough with him. He could not understand this. A few days later they met again, and he asked what he did to upset her. “Well, if you should know, I didn’t like your last novel,” she said. "Indeed, everyone else appreciates this." He was puzzled: "What's wrong with that?" “Oh, Charles,” she said, “I am Jewish. How could you come up with a character like Fagin ?! ”He did not expect this:“ Well ... you know that last year the trial of Aiki Solomon, the coach of thieves. He is a model for Fagin, and he was a Jew. " <br /> <br /> Dickens found himself not settling matters. “Yes,” she replied, “he got what he deserved. But Charles, they did not call him "Solomon the Jew," as you call Feigin a "Jew"! Moreover, Solomon did not plan a murder. Fagin knows. ” Dickens had to admit that he could get carried away. He stopped thinking about what she said. <br /> <br /> Oliver Twist has been published in several editions. Dickens tried to improve on Fagin a bit. Then he got an idea. He reworked a chapter titled “Feigin's Last Night Alive,” revealing the fears of a person standing in front of a hanging. He also added some additional details. <br /> <br /> He informed his girlfriend about his determination to change Fagina. About a day later he met her at a friend's house. She looked at him like he was crazy. “Didn't you like the changes?” He asked. "Charles, that is changing - he is still a vile villain called" Jew "!", She replied. "Yes, I kept them there, but didn't you see how scared he was on death row in prison." The young woman noticed this, but she felt that he was so nasty that she deserved to suffer from such fears. “Ah ... then I was right about that ... and did you see the small details that I added?” He asked. “What are the details?” She replied. “When you first see Fagin, and now he is preparing himself a dinner ... have you read this?”, Dickens looked at her, waiting for a sign of recognition. Instead, the lady looked confused. "I read that he was at the fireplace, but I must have looked through the passage." Dickens smiled as if he was great: "He is preparing pork sausage for dinner." “And what!” She exclaimed. "He eats pork, my dear ... you know, he is not a good Jew!" His girlfriend looked at him, shook her head, and to her horror left her friend's house. She has not spoken to him for years. <br /> <br /> Dickens never got rid of fanaticism, but the situation led to a partial attempt to repair the damage in his last completed novel. IN OUR MUTUAL FRIEND (1865) he has a minor character, Mr. Ria, who is used by an unscrupulous landlord to collect high rates from poor tenants. The owner believes that Mr. Ria will be accused because he is a Jew. <br /> <br /> But Mr. Ria is a good person. He is a very good man. He is a very, very, very, very good man - so good that it seems incredible. If Fagin sees Mr. Ria in action, he will probably chase him away with a stick. <br /> <br /> Anti-Semitic image of Fagin remains to this day. This is a measure of the genius of Dickens as a writer in the fact that the novel overcomes it. However, presenting the story in the cinema, it still causes problems for writers and directors: how after the Holocaust can you make a film about a worthy novel without fanning fanaticism? David Lin showed how when Alec Guinness appears in one or two scenes showing the human side, and in fighting the mob at the end with true dignity. Sir Carol Reed in his musical version of the novel made it even better thanks to the rewriting of the script of the original musical. <br /> <br /> OLIVER was turned into a West End musical hit in the mid-1960s, and then taken to Broadway, where it again became a hit. With a wonderful score of Lionel Bart, including “Food, glorious food”, “I analyze the situation”, “Consider yourself”, “Boy for sale”, “Who will buy”, “As long as I need it”, it deserved this success. Reed succeeded in playing his roles, including his nephew Oliver Reed as Sykes, Ron Moody as Feigin, Mark Lester as Oliver, Jack Wilde as Dodge, Shani Wallace as Nancy and Harry Sekomb as Mr. Bumble . For a decade in Hollywood there wasn’t much musical success - the last musical to win an Oscar for the best film was GIGI in 1958. OLIVER won it in 1968. <br /> <br /> And Fagin - how to deal with the eternal problem of caricature? Well, in the musical, Fagin is not caught, not judged, and not executed for the murder. In the end, even Lin showed that Fagin was trying to control his soul mate in his actions. But here Fagin realizes that he is too old to depend on such a random life. Although he loses his treasures (those stolen items that he kept, because he knew their value and admired their beauty), he decides that he can be reformed. He is allowed to do this in the company of his faithful assistant, the Sly Dodger. I don’t think Dickens would have appreciated the change (perhaps his girlfriend), but modern audiences definitely take it as appropriate.
