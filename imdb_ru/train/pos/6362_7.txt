Of course, I saw Speed ​​Racer, but I never watched it, and I also saw other shows that featured these characters, dressed like birds flying on a ship called Phoenix, and the other was spinning around a spaceship that looked like a giant ocean. the ship, and it sometimes flew back for some reason and was really dark and difficult to understand for those who were about five years old. This one, although I watched almost every episode, and what was surprising for me at that time was that this show had some kind of permission. It really ended, the bad guys made almost all American cartoons where nothing really ends, like the last episode of Transformers of the first generation, which ended with Gulvatron, and this new bad guy promised to get Autobots, dungeons and dragons with children never return home, Joe Joe with Cobra is still there, ready to try again, and so on and so forth. This one really ended and showed a pretty cool robot that got a new weapon during the show, it was a bit boring from the very beginning, since it couldn't fly and had only a few really cool weapons. As he continued, he got a cool rifle fist, similar to the one that Android 16 used against Cell in Dragonball Z, and then this weapon turned into discarded razors. Then the big robot even got wings so that it could fly, and even more weapons were included in the wings. He will also get a pair of allies in a female robot and a rather amusing named Bobo in America. The villains not only consisted of Dr. Hell, but a really strange man who was half male, half female and a flying head man. An interesting show, and it was nice to see the conclusion.
