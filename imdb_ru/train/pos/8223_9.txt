When I first saw this film in London in 1958, I was shocked. I have never seen such a movie before. He had a strange hypnotic effect, not at all like the films I had seen before, and he left an indelible effect. <br /> <br /> I think that Odile Versios and Marina Vlady are sisters, if not twins. Of course, the interaction is amazing in its ability to influence the viewer. <br /> <br /> If it was converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in original French, I would love to hear about it and where you can buy it.
