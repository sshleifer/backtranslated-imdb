This anime has been underestimated and is still there. It is unlikely, as I said, the film “Crazy Children”, I still come back to this 10 years after I first saw it. Released one of the best movies. <br /> <br /> Animation, although not perfect, is good, camera tricks give it a 3D feel, and the story remains as good today, even after I grew up and saw such innovative developments as Neon Genesis Evangelion and RaHephon. Obviously, he is far from the depths, but try to see him with a carefree look. This is a story to entertain, not ask questions. <br /> <br /> However, one of my favorites, I also come back when I want to laugh at the more carefree anime. Not to mention children's films, there are surprisingly sad moments, and you need a sense of humor to see it all.
