Yes, I sat there with a red face, remembering that I felt almost guilty, watching this a couple of weeks ago, while my wife decided to see something as inconsequential (in comparison) as "Dear Mom." <br /> <br /> How can you explain the attractiveness of “Batman and Robin” - I mean the only ones who have ever considered Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a terrible show with horrible stories and a terrible game - and, oh, yes, it was terribly funny! And the same goes for this film Reunion and Remembrance. Adam and Bert are invited to auction, where the old Batmobile will be sold to charity. But it is stolen, and our friends (like themselves) jump into the characters of their old characters (if not in their costumes) and leave to find out what happened. Along the way, they recall the series, and we see how it all came together in memories when Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden played the young Adam and Bert from the series. It was really interesting to look at the old series behind the scenes, and Adam and Burt just returned to the image (even if they weren’t in character - well, you’ll have to watch it to see what I mean.) It was also great to see Julia Newmar and Frank Gorshin. <br /> <br /> If you're not a fan of the old series, you hate it. If - God forbid - you really thought that Michael Keaton and George Clooney made acceptable "Batman", then you will hate it even more. But if you grew up with Adam and Bert and are still ready to admit that you never missed an episode - well, this one is for you. <br /> <br /> Yes it is true - 9/10
