This film was such a blast! He has such a pleasant feeling, but still in your face the mood attracts me to the movies. It has a good message (the party girl decides that she needs a real job), but she doesnâ€™t completely lose her sense of pleasure. I recommend this film to anyone who needs humor, but also a thinker! :)
