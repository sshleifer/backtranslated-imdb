The message of peace on the brink of war is ignored by the masses; The mythical city of Everytown in 1940 represents England as a whole, but it can also stand for any nation in the world. When war finally comes, its destructive actions continue not for another five years, but until 1966, when Every City will be completely destroyed. Adding to the devastation and death of mankind is a “roaming disease” that lasts another four years. <br /> <br /> “Forthcoming deeds” balance both the fatalistic and the futuristic worldview, in which science holds hope for a revived civilization.

This message is constantly enhanced throughout the film, convincingly brought to the end at the end of the film. Insatiable human need to test the limits of knowledge and achievements requires thinking "the whole universe or nothing." <br /> <br /> A film about automata and technology in the second half reminds of the great silent film “Metropolis”.

This is not a convenient question, since both options offer inevitable dangers and incomprehensible results. Those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control.
