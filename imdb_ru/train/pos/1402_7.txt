Contains spoilers <br /> <br /> “Hollow Man” is probably the weakest film Paul Verhoeven has ever made, directed by such great films as Total Recall, Star Troopers and RoboCop. <br /> <br /> This is probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven got stuck with a completely mediocre scenario, and he took advantage of it. <br /> <br /> The first part of this movie is pretty good, with lots of cynical jokes, great special effects and even Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, in the second part the film does not succeed, whether it degenerated into a standard slasher film or, perhaps, a very bad “alien” clone. The ending is particularly ridiculous <SPOILER>, since Kevin Bacon continues to come back to life after a series of incidents that should have (in a logical sense of the word) killed him. </ SPOILER>. And all this is actually quite superficial: the question of how to become invisible will never be fully explored. <br /> <br /> But in general, Verhoeven manages to stay well above average with this film. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of **** stars
