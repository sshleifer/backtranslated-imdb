In the early and mid-1970s, Clifford Irving offered to write the final biography of Howard Hughes, claiming that he spent months preparing the book, and participated in an interview with a reclusive millionaire. When all this turned out to be false, Irving was accused of perjury and spent several years behind bars (although he always admitted that his conclusions were accurate). Fast forward to the year 20001, a few months before September 11, a book called Forbidden Love (published in the United States under the title Lost Love: Love and Death in Modern Jordan) by a previously unknown author named Norma Khouri. a woman from Jordan, who reported the death of her best friend Dalia because of the mercy of killing because Dalia, being a devout Muslim woman, met with a Christian man. This, like Irving's biography of Hughes, was revealed as a potential deception. Australian director Anna Brunowski is trying to penetrate into the quagmire, which was Howry's attempt to cleanse herself of lying. For 104 minutes, the film is trying to reveal whether Norma Khouri is telling the truth, or is she just an obsessive liar with her own agenda / blood feud? Filming interviews with those who know / knew her (including her ex-husband, her publisher and others), tells her side of the story. This is a boring, well-prepared documentary in which you can point your finger at as many potential guilty parties. Not evaluated, but contains pervasive foul language and repetition of the scene of a horrendous murder played several times (but nothing more visual and alarming than what can be seen in the latest epic about torture, such as Saw: Part 84). Not a good choice for the little ones.
