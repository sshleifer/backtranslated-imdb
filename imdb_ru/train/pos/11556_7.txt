Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau began and ended a joint career. Best of all, remember how the Angry Old Woman, as well as the Strange Couple that ever made us laugh, Lemmon and Mattau have been one of Hollywood's most favorite comedy groups in the last 100 years. Not as “dirty” as Pryor and Wilder, they were a classic comedy team that reflected the more modern routine of the Marx brothers. Such as physical comedy, as well as a mixed mixture of chaos, which so famous for Marx, Chaplin and Keaton. In Odd Couple, Lemmon and Mattau play complete opposites that create chaos. Physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. A joke is usually assumed by itself, in contrast to the transfer of a joke to another. This is not an ordinary film about guys, it is a kind of comedy about coming of age with two old men, and not two young teens in their prime years. Chemistry between Lemmon and Mattau is fun. Although this film is not for everyone, this is a great comedy.
