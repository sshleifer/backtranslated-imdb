All dogs go to heaven. This is the cutest animated film in which there are dogs in 1989. Don Bluth's previous film, Earth to Time (1988), was successful. Dogs are as cute as little mice. Oh, I just want to hug them when they are cute. Where was I? Oh yeah. His animation is beautiful, the characters are gorgeous when they are perfectly voiced, and the songs are cute and touching. It opened on November 17, 1989, on the same day that the Little Mermaid appeared in Walt Disneyâ€™s animation art. <br /> <br /> The part where Charlie was killed by Curry was so unforgivable. Carface is so angry because he wanted to kill Charlie. Shame on him! The song Love Survive performed by Irene Cara and Freddie Jackson was so beautiful. All dogs go to heaven this is the best animated movie ever.
