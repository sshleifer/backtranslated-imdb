I made this movie last weekend, turned on the surround sound system and got a great sound from special effects. This film is a great movie rental, special effects where enough to scare my fianc√©, but I noticed that some of them looked amazingly computer-generated. I did not go to the cinema and did not see it, but it is a terrible late night, I do not want to go to the cinema. I would recommend it!
