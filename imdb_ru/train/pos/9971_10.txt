This film was excellent, I thought the original one was quiet mediocre. All components are included in the same kit - the factory Hemi Challenger in 1970 with a 4-speed gearbox, which really shows that Mother Mopar knew how to create the best muscular machines! I was in Chrysler heaven every time Kowalski built this big Chemie block, and he certainly did a lot of this :)
