If you, like me, have very close and long-lasting relationships with the world of Tintin ... do yourself a favor and watch this wonderful documentary about Herge and his life creating Tintin. I'm such a brilliant and very cool production. The whole background about Gerg and the people, as well as a lot of different situations, which he influenced, both for the better and for the worse, is amazing. There is a very subtle and obvious connection between comics and just that. I will definitely be in my basement, again digging Tintin albums. In addition, the film itself is very well narrated and has a great surrounding sound. I really hope that people will find it as intriguing as I am!
