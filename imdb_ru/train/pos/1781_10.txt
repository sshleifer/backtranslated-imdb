... here comes the Romeo division to change the paradigm. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that this short film struck me. I saw it by chance when I was in the Boston Film Festival, and since then I thank God every day for it. I truly, sincerely believe that I was part of the event, for example, read the Tarantino script before anyone else, or watched the first show of “Evil Streets”. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure which festival is coming next. or that the creative team is preparing for future products, but I really hope I can be there for that. <br /> <br /> Again, a truly incredible part of filmmaking.
