Born Again the Limerick: <br /> <br /> If a person could return from the dead <br /> <br /> and live in the head of a little girl <br /> <br /> Revenge, he will receive <br /> <br /> For the murder he met <br /> <br /> The guy who is now in his wife's bed. <br /> <br /> For me, Born Again is a classic game with a low rating episode, which is part of what the X-Files defined for me before I started watching it. I saw several episodes before when the show was just beginning, and I was too young to watch it, for example, in Jersey Devil episodes, but I remember very clearly how I watched this episode at the age of 11 and was absolutely scared scene. where their boyfriend is slaughtered to death by bus, and then a hypnosis scene with a little girl. I tell you that I could not sleep for weeks! For this reason, this episode now has a special aura of eeriness factor, which I have since loved. This is enough to allow me to look at some of the obvious shortcomings of the plot, for example, why the girl had to wait until she was 9 years old before her previous life spirit really began to demand his revenge. Or what she did, just randomly sitting in the bus in the middle of the night. You might think that her parents would be worried. And, perhaps, they were, we just do not see this part of the story. Was he with telekinesis? In addition to adding a really steep Carrie factor to an already creepy story, there was no sensible explanation for this. But even with its small flaws, in my opinion, this is a classic episode, and I have almost no reason to dislike it. 10 out of 10.
