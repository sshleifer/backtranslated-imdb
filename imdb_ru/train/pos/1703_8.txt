Being from a small town in Illinois, I can instantly tell about this film. Given the era in which this was done, the townspeople look awkward, like many people with whom I grew up. Yes, the plot is so-so. And yes, the acting will not be nominated for an Oscar anytime soon. But this is not the main thing. The point is to pause the reality and just have fun. And in this film a lot of fun. From a greedy, carefree banker to a well-meaning but stupid deputy, this film was created to ridicule the SciFi genre and the small city that lives in the best possible way. Who can not smile at the sight of Drone Enforcer or Vern Droid? and I loved FarmZoid. I wish I had it when I was growing up. In general, given the technology that they had at the time, this is a pleasant game as a child, when you can relax on Saturday afternoon with popcorn in your hands and laugh at the weaknesses of the life of a small town. This is a film that I would watch again and again, if not for any other reason, except to make fun of myself and my little urban ways.
