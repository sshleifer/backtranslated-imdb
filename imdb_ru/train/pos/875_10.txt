Well, what can I say, just seeing this fantastic film, when my nerves were still hanging out! Director Jacques Audiard must be making a name for himself in France, and rightly so. Vince Cassel is not Tom Cruise, but Emmanuel Devos is not Penelope Cruz, but these two are fantastic actors, and this is a tight and compelling thriller that starts slowly with clever character building and then begins to strain, creating a wonderful climax. Others wrote about the plot, so I will not say more than everyone in this film plays its role in perfection, the director, the actors, even the cameraman, and everything seems so real, without a foolish game with weapons, fighting, when it happens, it deserves trust, expression, emotion, it's almost like you are there, as a viewer. Do yourself a favor, take a DVD, a bottle of wine, turn off the light, remove the phone from the hook and immerse yourself in this Hitchcock thriller :)
