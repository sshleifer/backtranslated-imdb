Here's a favorite cartoon of Tom and Jerry, perfect for Halloween. I know that he has no particular eeriness, but there is a “trick”, as in “Trick or Treat”, as Jerry did with Tom with blinds on the window and a vacuum cleaner with a shirt with a collar hanging on it to make it look like ghost; but still would like to put this on my list of Halloween cartoons. In this short film, Tom listened to the radio broadcast of The Hour of the Witches, and was terrified by the horrible story being told. Halfway into the story, dramas (hair stand on end, heart jumps in the throat, ice cold on the spine) begin to happen to Tom. , , literally. And Jerry watched it all and laughed to himself, thinking that he was afraid of Tom, scaring him. <br /> <br /> I like the final, it was a bit funny. And you know, this short is the first of four cartoons in which Tom attacks Mammy Two Shoes; the others are the Lonely Mouse, the Mouse in the House, and the Nit-Witty Kitty. Also, this short film is the first of twenty-five cartoons in which Tom speaks. Others - "Lonely mouse", "Cat-zut", "Cat for a million dollars", "Bodyguard", "Mouse problems", "Mouse" comes to dinner, "Quiet, please! Above and Mouse Down is directed by Chuck Jones.
