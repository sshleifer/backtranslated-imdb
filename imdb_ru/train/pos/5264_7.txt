The film begins with the fact that he is sitting at the table of a street cafe, telling his friends about this beauty that is breathtaking. Suddenly he notices her a few meters away. he came in this way, his friends tease him and offer him to "just show her his bank book." But Hope claims he can win it in less than 30 days with no money! They put a polo pony on this issue and take all his money and identity cards. Hope follows her, and when they alone put forward a proposal, she does not believe that he is sincere until she sings to her: “You do something with me,” Cole Porter. But she must leave, and he tries to earn money as a guide so that he can pursue her. But when she sees how he shows another girl around the city, disappointed, she wants to leave him. He continues to pursue her and catches up with her and her family on the race track, where he expects his meager earnings at the last race, hoping to win enough to impress her. Through a series of events and large synchronized dance numbers, he loses the winning ticket and she decides to marry him rich or poor. So he wins the girl, the race and the bet and sings two more songs!
