This documentary was interesting, but it was also long (it lasts a total of 225 minutes), like Ben-Hur long. But if you are passionate about it, this is for you. But only if you have a passion for movies like me. The fact that Martin Scorsese is my favorite director (live and possibly even ever) is quite fascinating, especially if you know the style of Scorsese. Because then you can understand where he got his inspiration from for many of his films. Not the best documentary ever made, but this is a jump for Scorsese, which is always a pleasure to watch.
