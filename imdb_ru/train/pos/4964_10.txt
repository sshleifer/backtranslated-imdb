I really love this show! I always liked the 1990s Space Ghost show! This show was fun, and I can't believe why Cartoon Swim for adults on the Network took on a fun show like this. I hope they release this show on DVD or something like that. The show tells about Brack (from the cartoon "Space Ghost", SGCC and Cartoon Planet), who lives his daily life with his mom and dad and his best friend who loves to look a lot, Zorak! My favorite episode was the one where Zorak gets this really good singing voice, and then his voice does not give him the money that Zorak earned from singing at all. Another episode that I like is where Brack and Zorak didn't finish their homework, and then they come back from Sunday to Friday, and they just sit back and then go back to the day when the homework was invented, and then, when they returned to this homework was not! Another episode I like is where Brack's dad and their closest neighbor, Robot Thunderbolt, continue to penetrate this world, and then they are eaten by a giant worm. Another episode that I liked was the one where Zorak makes a rowdy, and then some new guy took his position. I also like a lot of other episodes! One thing that always makes me laugh is when Zorak is beaten, beaten and beaten!
