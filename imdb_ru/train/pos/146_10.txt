I reached the end, and I almost shouted, “No, no, no, no! It can't end here! Too many unanswered questions! Dishwasher participation? Mona's disappearance? Helmer's coming? Zombie? Little brother saved his father? What about the head ??????? "ARGH !! Then I read that at least two of the actors passed away, and I must say, I know that probably would not have been in line with Lars von Trier’s vision, but I would love to see past cast substitutes , just to see the end of it! Of course, it would be difficult to find someone to play Helmer as a character deserves. Helmer, the doctor you love to hate, I think I have yet to see a more absorbed, forgetful, smug character on the screen! But I could not notice the changes the actors ... I just have to know how this ends!
