I saw it a long time ago, when I was younger and could never remember the name, until one day I looked at John Candy’s captions on IMDb and did not notice the entry called “Once Upon a Crime ...”. Something rang the bell, and I clicked on it, and after reading the summary of the plot, he had a lot of memories. <br /> <br /> I discovered that he had grown pretty old, despite the fact that nobody has it. means "great" comedy. This, however, is rather pleasant and is a good riff of Hitchcock’s formula for erroneous identity and world-wide thrill. <br /> <br /> There are many characters in the film, including an American couple who finds a woman’s dog resting in Europe and deciding to return it to her for a fee - only to find her corpse on arrival. From there, the plot gets crazier and sillier, and they run after the police think they are murderers. <br /> <br /> Something like a mixture of “This is a crazy, insane, insane, insane world” and a lighter Hitchcock. It was directed by Eugene Levy, and he managed to get some of his good friends - such as John Candy - to star in this. The film is mainly attractive because of the cast, and in the final there is a funny little twist that is not completely unpredictable, but also kind of unexpected.
