If you think “Strange Al” Jankovic is hilarious, you will not be disappointed with COMPLEX AL. Not only does this rare layout show many of Jankovic’s more memorable videos (Like A Surgeon and I Love Rocky Road are among them), but they are also mixed with fun vignettes that supposedly underline the rising parodist’s popularity. Jankovic is not for every taste, but his humor is harmless and rather inventive, that even amateurs will at least be slightly surprised. Die-hard fans love him not only for its content, but also for its relatively early look now at nearly three decades of Yankovic's career. Suitable for all ages, kids will surely enjoy funny visual effects.
