The film was fine, quite interesting. The cast was pretty good, and I’ll stop by mentioning a comment in front of me - Glenn Quinn was outstanding, and he alone is reason enough to watch this movie. He brilliantly played a selfish "evil" friend and manager of the group! <br /> <br /> In this film “Beyond Gravity” many songs were performed, but this is not surprising, given the production VH1 film. However, if soft rock / pop music is not to someone’s taste, you might as well recall these scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot of the group trying to reach the top in Los Angeles, but forced to overcome the Many obstacles in the way is not too original, but quite exciting, with some unexpected plot twists.
