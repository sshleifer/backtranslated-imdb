Of course, by any normal standards film critics, Soldier is really a very bad movie. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super-soldier raised from birth to kill, but then he became outdated after his real super-soldier detachment switched to a hanging hoop that looked like a fight with gladiators without rugs. <br /> <br /> Abandoned on a garbage planet, he befriended a community of space hippies who teach him gardening, family life, and breast. Kurt says little. Finally, really super-soldiers appear and kill hippies, shooting them in the back while they run away. Kurt is angry and kills everyone. The planet is counted. The end. <br /> <br /> If the Academy does not create a new category “Best Explosion”, the Soldier will not receive any awards. However, no matter how ridiculous, it remains an enjoyable experience. Military equipment is the coolest since the time of the "Aliens" (especially the BTR), and for 90 minutes it does not exceed its hospitality. Please note that the mark below is only a guide. Shoot down five points if you intend to take it seriously, and throw off another one if you don’t like mini-guns. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
