This film is the most cult film about metal. Premise: The child receives the final recording of his favorite artist Sammy Kerr, who recently dies in a hotel fire. He plays him backwards and calls on him to return from the dead to take revenge on behalf of heavy metal for those dirty idiots who torture him. Any fan of real metal will love this film, and if you are tormented by a metal head, play Sammy Kerr's album backwards ......... don't expect it to be fictional, get this film well and watch it with your fist in the air, banging your head and volume at 11!
