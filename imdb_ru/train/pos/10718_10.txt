Spacecamp is my favorite movie. This is a great story that also inspires others. <br /> <br /> The acting was excellent, and my wife and I went to visit Leah Thompson at the cabaret a few years later because of her performance in the film. Unfortunately, the accident Challenger delayed and damaged the film. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger accident is nearing. I knew one of the astronauts Challenger from childhood on the Carnegie Mellon campus, where my father went to school; I also know the deceased pilot's close friend. <br /> <br /> Last year I participated in the technical review for the National BSA for the badge of astronomy in the boy scouts, and I still consider Spacecamp to be an excellent film that can be recommended to scouts who make Space Merit Badges , I `m teaching. <br /> <br /> I again encountered the late astronaut when I was an adult, and followed the engineering education schedule that we made when the Challenger exploded. In the end, I accidentally sat down with Willard Rockwell and his engineers, “invisibles,” accidentally thinking about the situation after the Accident at the Astrotech shareholders' meeting, so I'm much closer to the Accident and any similarities of films. I took care of being a good student, and after four years I graduated, oddly enough, on the recommendation of a Rockwell engineer who told them not to fly Challenger in 1986 and later built Endeavor.
