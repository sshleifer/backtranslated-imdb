I watched this movie in the preview and was amazed by it. This is not a typical romantic comedy. I can't remember laughed so hard at the movie and yet I was touched by it. Laughing here is not a slanderer — it is observation, laughter of recognition, small shocks, “Oh my God, I thought that I was the only one who felt that way!” ". The whole family plays an important role in the relationship here. Probably the best mixture of laughter and warmth since “While you were sleeping.” <br /> <br /> Steve Carell goes much deeper than before, and for the first time I really liked him. The cast is terrific, the list of veteran theater actors I loved in other roles, but they mixed up to create a convincing family. Dianne Uist is beautiful, like a mother. Juliette Binoche is bright and funny (who knew she was funny?), And even the offended Dane Cook gives a warm, quiet, touching presentation. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a great addition and I will buy this CD as soon as it is available. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this one.
