The film itself made me want to go and call someone so that they too could enjoy it. It was very funny. Angelina Jolie was beautiful like Juliet. Parents are funny. They are both visionaries and enemies. Children play the role of Romeo and Juliet in a church play. They fall in love, and their parents try to separate them. (Spoiler ahead. I think) They sneak after the party and do it. Surprisingly, they still want to marry at the end of the film. If you do not like the stereotypes and desecration of classical literature, do not look. If you do not mind them, you will have an explosion, watching it.
