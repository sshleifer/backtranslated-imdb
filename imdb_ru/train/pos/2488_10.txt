For me, the final scene in which Harris answers press questions is worthy of considering this intellectual and timeless piece of politics (especially the campaign phase). If only “real” polls would respond reasonably and clearly, as Mr. Harris did, then arrogant, self-serving media representatives would probably think twice before emerging irrelevant, confrontational “garbage” in which there was absolutely nothing . to do with the candidate's ability to effectively deal with the problems of the office for which he / she is pursuing.
