If there is something to recommend in this film, this is what it intrigues. The premise certainly attracts the audience because it is a mystery, and throughout the film there are hints that something dark is hidden in it. However, not so much stress, and Williams' gentle upbringing does not do much to make us treat his obsession with a boy. <br /> <br /> Collete lives much better than a woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear. Production was felt urgently, and the holes are obvious. It certainly looks like a preview for a fuller and better effort. The book is probably better. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: Topin must have written something really good to inspire at least one commendable effort.
