Well, the film is not really "funny." <br /> <br /> Okay, I admit, there are some funny lines, but definitely there is nothing funny. For example: Right in front of the sex scene between Eleniak and one of her male colleagues, Sh. Is handcuffed to the bedpost, and he cannot take off her shirt. Before leaving the room to pick up the key, he says to her: "Well, don't go anywhere." <br /> <br /> You see, with humor, but not funny. <br /> <br /> The plot and acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> But Erica Eleniak is definitely stealing the show. She is hot and sexy, and with her is really a steamy scene that cannot be rewound and rewound. <br /> <br /> There are other very sexy scenes with her, and she has very provocative lines. <br /> <br /> Only 5 stars. I would give only three if it were not for Erica Eleniak.
