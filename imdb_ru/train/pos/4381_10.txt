This stunning drama has it all: a first-class game, an incredible photo, a good story. It is often compared to Braveheart, because both films originate in historic Scotland. Despite the fact that I love Braveheart, I think that this is the best of two films. Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (should have been nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is great in the lead role. Tim Roth plays one of the most evil, meanest characters in film history (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is great as Lord Montrose, another unpleasant character. I am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that John Hurt can play. This is the story of the money dispute between Rob Roy and his clan and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self-made person who doesnâ€™t solve his problems with Montrose if it upsets his sense of honor. Montrose, who inherited his title, does not have a sense of honor. And this is basically what this story is about; the honor of the common man against the corruption of the nobility. This film is very interesting, everyone should like it. It has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and there is a fascinating plot. One of my favorite movies.
