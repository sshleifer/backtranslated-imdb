Well, this film was probably one of the funniest and scariest films I've ever seen. The effects are so bad that you just need to laugh, and acting is, well, let's say, this is not a petty Gibson. But Gary Browning, who plays the cop, is damn bad, he becomes good. I do not know how, but he himself makes this film the tenth. You should see him if your horror / slash films cause him to be bloody and funny at the same time. Movie killer
