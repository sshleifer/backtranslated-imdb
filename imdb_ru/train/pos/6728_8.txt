I came across this movie over cable and was fully connected. The story of a group of surfers who ride big waves, monstrously huge waves, waves that make any rational person run away in horror is one that manages to be impressive and helps to understand why people spend their lives chasing the waves. The film is nothing special, except that it brings together very interesting people who are in love with what they do and allows them to speak. Of course, there are scenes of their surfing, but what makes this film so special is the people. Here is a group of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they are doing, and it goes to the people who are watching. Halfway to this film, you will want to leave and learn to surf. Few documentaries have ever managed to convey the passion these people experience, and the ability of films to make us feel what makes this film great. See it.
