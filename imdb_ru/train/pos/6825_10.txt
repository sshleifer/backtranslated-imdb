I was just amazed at the discovery of the Night of John Cassavetes. This is his first film that I saw, which seems to be on a larger scale, so he seems to be more popular, but he still does not feel as if he had founded himself more than in his previous films. Perhaps this is what makes it so intense. In watching this movie, there is undoubtedly something cathartic. <br /> <br /> This is what Cassavetes actually made the foundation of his career, an ideal that he expressed off-screen throughout his career as a director. here expressing it in front. Rowlands character, middle-aged actress Myrtle Gordon, cannot bring herself to play her role in the upcoming play as it was written, so she accurately follows impulse after impulse, resulting in chaos on the scene until she finds it. This is a bold abstract background. <br /> <br /> This is a film that does not hide the innate steering that takes place during emotional cleansing. No one understands why Myrtle does a lot of things that she does, and this is seen and even portrayed as destructive, but it may be the best for her. It can be a cleansing, not a destruction. Removal, cocoon, rebellion, it all ends in a crash. Cassavetis lends her character a real, real touch, because at the very beginning she ardently claims that she has nothing in common with her character, but she is in a quiet but emotionally roving fear that the opposite is true. <br /> <br /> The last scene, the climate view that Myrtle shares with the character, painfully removed from her, who acts with her, is one of the most interesting, fun, hard, instructive and enjoyable moments I've ever seen seen in a movie.
