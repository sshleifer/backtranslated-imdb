My friend and I have something for robots. So I'm trying to find movies that have robots. And there are robots in this movie. Large. They beat each other clang and blows, the fate of the peoples hangs in the balance. It's really cool. You must forgive this film for its many flaws and just try to appreciate what the director and his team of technicians have shown on the screen, working with a clearly limited budget. I really don't like this movie. Because of these big robots. They looked like Transformers and fought like professional wrestlers! It made my girlfriend smile. And that's good enough for me. Particular mention should be made of veteran actor Paul Koslo: as a manic Russian villain, whether he ruthlessly stomps his helpless opponents after they have already surrendered or complained that their proximity to him at the bar made him taste like blood ( which he pronounces with the sub-Bela Lugosiâ€™s delightfully sharp accent), he clearly has a ball, and the film benefits greatly when it is on the screen. This is a great little movie that deserves its cult reputation.
