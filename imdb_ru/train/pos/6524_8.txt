<br /> <br /> If you are interested in pirates, pirated films, the history of New Orleans / America of the early 19th century or Yul Brynner, watch this movie for yourself and decide for yourself. Do not despair because of the various dim reviews. My reaction to this was that it is interesting, well-functioning (for the most part), has a very ingenious dialogue, and that it perfectly shows the charm, appeal and legendary appeal of the marque Jean Lafitta. Although not all the events in the film are historically accurate (can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this?), I feel that the film is accurate in interpreting the role of Lafitte in New Orleans history, as well as love. the hateful relationship between the “respectable” citizens of New Orleans and this criminal, who was one of the beloved sons of the city. Do not worry about what the film does not do, but see what it does, that is, it studies one of the most intriguing historical characters of New Orleans and America.
