Hello from the dark again. 18 directors out of 18 seemingly unrelated love vignettes in the city of lights. A very unusual format that takes a couple of segments to customize as a viewer. We are so used to character development during a 2-hour movie that it disarms a bit so that it happens in an 8-minute segment. <br /> <br /> The idea is in 18 love stories / relationships in 18 different districts of a magnificent city. Of course, some stand out better than others, and some go on comedy, while others focus on dramatic emotions. Some very famous directors are involved, including: The Cohen Brothers, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuaron, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha. Many familiar faces appear: Steve Buscemi, Barbet Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzara, Gena Rowlands, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafault, Nick Nolte, Maggie Dzhillenhol and Bob Hoskins. <br /> <br /> One of the best segments includes a pantomime, and then another pantomime and a know-it-all, but a happy young son of two pantomimes. Also the key roles are played by the red cape, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, the death of a child and many other topics. Do not miss Alexander Payne (director of "Side") in the role of Oscar Wilde. <br /> <br /> A variety of segments make this movie interesting to watch, but it cannot be called a great movie. However, this is a very watchable and enjoyable change of pace for a frequent viewer.
