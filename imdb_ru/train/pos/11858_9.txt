This movie is just great. if you have a chance to see it, then you need to run to see it. Although the film has almost nothing to do with his 1932 original, Pacino plays the role of Tony Montana to get around. <br /> <br /> Pacino says so about him that he can say anything anyway and make it sound just great. if you thought “Pulp Fiction” was good with abusive words (if you saw it), then you should also see Scarface to see a different look at how an actor can pronounce them. (it's pretty cute) <br /> <br /> Although the movie has a lot of action and the plot moves very quickly in time, not maintaining the correct aspect ratio in real time, it's still easy to follow, but you should always keep eyes clean to lose nothing. I personally discovered that watching this movie for three hours seems like a breeze, it's really so cool. <br /> <br /> This film is one of those films that were filmed and directed so well that not only do you forget that this film was shot in the wacky 80s, but in fact it makes you cheer for bad guy ... "So wish good night to the bad guy"
