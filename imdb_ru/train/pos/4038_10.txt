This may be the only film that is actually close to capturing on the film an almost incomprehensible world of the experience of an American college of the late 60s - early 70s. Come on, name another movie that even comes up to this: “Start”? "RPM"? These are cartoons. The Return of Seven Seconds has its moments, but this retrospective film about (possessed) personalities is more than a film about time and place, depicted * in * this time and place. “Drive, he said,” depicts - with subtlety and nuances where it should be, and a quick hit in shorts, where this is the only suitable way - movement against drafts, ambiguity of big college sports (especially when there is war), the sexual revolution of that period and the total unreality of the day. Believe it was so. <br /> <br /> The whole cast deserves praise (as well as the director), but Bruce Dern deserves special praise as a basketball coach and Karen Black, a very unusual hero - with the exception of that time - love is an interest. William Tepper, as the moderator, also appreciates the real applause for his perfect shooting of an athlete student from that period, and for playing real college basketball in the film (do you remember Anthony Perkins in “Tall Story”? Yikes!) . <br /> <br /> In general, a classic of its kind - and the last film that someone in the sixth grade currently has to write comments (“boring”, “repellent” - um, right, son, please go back to your arnold movies). Why is this movie not available from imdb?
