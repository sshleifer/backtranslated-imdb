Yesterday I went to the cinema alone, because here in Mexico, in most cases films from other countries are part of the so-called “alternative camera” (alternative camera). But after I saw this film, I realized that not all foreign films are an alternative. Fortunately, this is a good example. But I have to say that I liked this film so much ... that in the end I was happy ... this film is a little spoon of hope these days. And the main lesson for me ... is that at the end of the day ... love is the main force behind us. This is a good option to watch a good movie in Spanish ... and I have to mention good music ... especially the main song of the movie. !!
