Another reason to watch this amazing movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? This was my first reaction when the opening credits appeared on the screen. I soon found out who Florence Rice was. A real beauty that turns into just a wonderful performance. How they all do in this exciting ensemble. Since 1939, this is another time, but therein lies the charm. He takes you to another world. It begins as a light comedy, but then becomes very serious. Florence Rice runs the gamut from comedy to heroine. She is absolutely adorable and at the same time strong and vulnerable, turning from a girl into a woman. Watch her facial expression at the end of the film. She made more than forty films, and I'm going to find the other thirty-nine. Alan Marshall has Flynn / Gable mode and is perfect for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel give great comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of 30s / 40s movies, don't miss this one!
