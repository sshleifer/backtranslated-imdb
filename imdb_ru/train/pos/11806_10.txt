Everything was better in the past. Even children's television. And Fraggle Rock proves my point pretty easily. At the time of this writing, I was fourteen years old, but even as a teenager I cannot resist the charm of Fraggle Rock. For those of you who really lived under a rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock is a crowd of playful and stupid creatures called Fraggles who live — amazingly — in a rock. But they are not the only creatures. The rock is inhabited by many other species, such as the industrious Doozers and countless living plants. The inventor and scientist Doc and his dog Sproket (who later makes friends with Gobo Fraggl) live outside the cliff on the one hand, and on the other hand the family of the alleged rulers of the Gorgs Universe. The five main Fraggles Gobo (fearless leader), Mokey (cunning and peaceful), Wembley (indecisive and friend Gobo), Boober (pessimistic domestic god) and Red (loves everything related to sports and common courage), are caught in some strange situations each episode at the same time sings and dances its worries. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is definitely a family show - the scenes may contain complex details that babies might not like, but the song and dance routines will keep their attention. The characters are strong and pleasant, their conflicts are believable and their adventures worry. Gorgs scare, Doc and Sprocket enlighten, Uncle, traveling Matt, cheerful (postcard segments are very 80s!) And the final episode, Address change, genuinely touching. Let's go to Fraggle Rock again!
