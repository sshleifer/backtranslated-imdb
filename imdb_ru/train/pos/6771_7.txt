Yes, this is a rather nostalgic preview of the first episode, because this is the episode that I remember exactly. I like to watch the first season, and yes, compared to the action show that we have now, this show seems to suck. but, to be honest, I like the “less violent” part of the show, and the storyline is now more meaningful than the new ones. It seemed to me interesting that Airwolf and JAG Belisario have a similar theme - the lead actor (Hawk and Harm) are both looking for a relative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (brother, father). I wonder if Robert Belisario's imitation of personal life is the theme of these two shows? <br /> <br /> The question is - does anyone have any photos of the Hawk booth? I like this cabin (sort of like my dream cabin), and this is one of the scenes I remember about Airwolf.
