If you saw Dogtown and the Z-Boys, or were interested in seeing the real, non-cartoonish, “real American” side of America, then the Riding Giants will hit you deeper than you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> This film is an “unreal”, superficial term, if it ever existed, but it is very appropriate, if you can extract any form of a literal meaning from it - this is a 100% actual documentary, but with all a drama of the opera, and an absolutely obvious feeling of love, an expert and knowledge instilled by the guidance and narration of Stacy Peralta, this film skillfully leads you from excitement to a big wave, while keeping you completely in awe of everything that you can see. br /> This film is a symphony created in the same way as Beethoven on the 9th, starting beautifully with his prelude in Hawaii, deeply drawing human emotions in Santa Cruz and ending with noise, triumph and crescendo in the exploits of Laird Hamilton, again in Hawaii . br /> <br /> Like classical music; Like the 9th Beethoven, Ride of the Valkyries or Barbers Adagio for Strings, this may be the only piece you like, but it's worth it. Trust me.
