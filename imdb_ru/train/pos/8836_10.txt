One of the most beautiful films ever made in the film “Former Y. Story” is very well known to people in the former “Yule”, because after the war, generations lived the same way. People in the west cannot imagine how the political situation in our country affects people. in the 50s, when Josip Broz Tito said “no” to the USSR and the political party, and because of this, our borders became open to Western influence. But in a country where people did not have a lot of money, jeans were just perfect, and the friendship was all. The friendship between young people and the girl was so strong that after 40 years of emigration from Yu they are still alive. They are going after all these years at the funeral of Esther, and they begin to remember their childhood, before they left to emigrate and become successful people.
