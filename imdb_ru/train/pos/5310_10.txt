Pecker is another mainstream John Waters movie shot on serial mom. The title character Pecker has a hobby to photograph everything he sees. It doesn't matter if it is dirty or shocking when he takes pictures. Soon he uses the photos taken by him and shows them at his work. Pecker lives in a semi-normal middle-class family. His father works in a canteen with a claw machine, but does not make enough money on a lesbian stripper across the street. His mother runs a thrift store and loves to dress poor people. His older sister Tina works in a gay bar where she specializes in trade. His younger, Little Crissy, has a habit of eating sugar, sugar, and only sweet food. His grandmother, Mama, has a little statue of the Virgin Mary, and she plays with her ventriloquist. He also has 2 friends. One of his friends, Matt, is a chronic shoplifting, and his girlfriend, Shelley, is holding a laundry mat, as if she were a dictator. Soon a tourist from New York buys his paintings and exhibits them in an art gallery. Glory comes to the picture, but the pictures reveal the unusual lifestyle of his friends and the simple life of the family. In the R-rated film, Pekker is confident that he is more modest than most previous R-rated films from Waters and even Pink Flamingos. Another 10 out of 10!
