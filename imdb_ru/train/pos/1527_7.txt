When it came out, this movie looks beautiful and sounds great. The festival of intelligent thoughtful acting from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook, and a touching central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger does not jump or boast - his long slow strokes encourage you to listen and reflect, and Graham Greene's script squeezes Shaw without sacrificing complexity. This piece has the look created for a television movie, and is certainly intended for a studio, but not so much the worse for that. Too many modern films on "historical" themes can not resist. What would Mel Gibson do from the Maid? Probably a lot of slobbering her shots on a hanger, and then everything was on the grill, until the flame lit. Preminger does none of this. Burning is manifested mainly through the reaction, affected by guilt. There are some weak indicators, but they are not enough to cause serious damage. I caught this movie on TV and didnâ€™t expect to see it through, but I was caught up. In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has an unexpected resonance.
