The abode of the expecting woman of a large hospital, with all its joys and sorrows, is the place where LIFE begins. <br /> <br /> This almost forgotten drama is a beautiful little soap opera full of comedy and tragedy. All are related to the life of the maternity staff and their patients. The frankness with which the theme is worked out emphasizes the status of the film before coding. <br /> <br /> Wonderful Aline McMahon, like the pretty senior nurse, is the quiet center of the film, a stone around which all currents flow. Being able to cope with any crisis or emergency situation, it is the best, sometimes the last, friend of the mother. McMahon is surrounded by many great friends: Loretta Young as a convicted murderer, released from prison for a long enough time to give birth; Eric Linden as her frightened young husband; the cheeky Glenda Farrell as a lady who hates children; dear Clara Blandik as a very mature mother for her sixth birth; Preston Foster and Hale Hamilton - thoughtful, sympathetic doctors and Frank McHugh - comically insane future father. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers recognize Bobs Watson as a tiny woman who wants to see Stork; Paul Fix as a nervous husband who promises to behave like a “little soldier”; Gilbert Roland is a distraught Italian husband, and Elizabeth Patterson is a bullying medical wife interested in adopting Farrell's son — all without credit. <br /> <br /> There are several absurdities in the plot - some mothers are clearly too old; Farrell is clearly drunk in the ward, but none of the staff seems to notice; Obviously, a mentally ill patient may wander at will — but this only increases the bizarre entertainment value of the film and prevents things from becoming too serious.
