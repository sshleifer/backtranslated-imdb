“Fido” deserves praise for taking a weary, zombie genre and turning it into the most original film. The atmosphere of the early 50s is awesome, the acting is awesome, and the whole performance demonstrates careful planning. Suddenly, the viewer is immersed in the world of beautiful classic cars, dresses of the Eisenhower era, art deco furniture and zombie servants. It would be very easy to dismiss Fido as a cartoon fluff, similar to Tank Girl, but these two films are completely different. “Fido has a structure, a scenario that tells the story, and actions that transcend. Make no mistake, this is a bold black comedy that succeeds where many others have failed. Highly recommended. - MERK
