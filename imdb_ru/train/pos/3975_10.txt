If you survived the 60s, this film can be painful at times, and sometimes joyful. This is all but small print on the tabloids of the counterculture common at that time. These are the roots of the social revolution, which is still playing out: “do not speak too early, because the wheel is still spinning, because times change.” While the film is about the revolutionary nature of LSD and its distribution at that time, he himself played a huge role in the development of the intelligentsia, influencing engineers, scientists and helping in the development of computer activity. Salute to the creators of the film from who was there - you captured the era better than I had seen before.
