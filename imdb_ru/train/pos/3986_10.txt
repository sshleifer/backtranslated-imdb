I am a college student, studying levels and need help and comments from anyone who has any views on the topic of mothers in the film, in mother. Regardless of whether you have experienced something like this or just want to comment and help me learn more about this film, any comment will be very grateful. Comments will be used for examination purposes only and will be included in my written exam. So if you have any views, I'm sure I can use them, and you will help me get A! I am also studying “About the Boy” and “The Tadpole”, so if you saw these films, I would appreciate it if you could leave comments here on this page. Thank.
