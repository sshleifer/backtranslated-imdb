In fact, I think this film is an example of an easy goal, rather than a really bad film. In fact, the film is made very well in many ways and very interesting. <br /> <br /> Yes, the script is a bit confusing, but it is a genre. The film has a noirish atmosphere centered around a femme fatale. Like all old noir classic works, there is also a script that distorts you, so you do not always understand how to figure this out, and this can be strained if you think too deeply and try to put all the pieces together. In general, there are enough surprises and turns in the script so that the viewer guesses and, in turn, is surprised without leaving the viewer. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is also an easy target. The truth is that she looks great, and she speaks in her dual-purpose dialogue in such a way as to turn it into something mysterious, sexy and fun. <br /> <br /> The direction is more than bearable, because let's face it - you have to keep the audience interested in, "is it or not?" question for two hours. In addition to the tortuous scenario and the funny execution of Stone, this is effectively done through the direction of creating a dark, very dark and at the same time modern atmosphere, with straight industrial lines that should be combined with stone. sexual bends. The frame is always beautiful - press pause anywhere, and there is something interesting in it. <br /> <br /> The film is also effectively based on the things that were tricks in the first film, and turns them into something more real, especially the floor. "Katherine Tramell is bisexual ... how shocking!" here it is viewed more naturally, and, as a rule, the filmâ€™s sexuality is used for better effect. It still worries, but not so easily for shock value and noise, as in the first. I will not say that this is still not a trick, because, let's face it, this film should be fun. <br /> <br /> And this is a funny movie. This may be an easy target, but if you watch what is: reckless, effeminate, tortuous, sexy, someone who is not-she-not-someone, you will not like it, you will certainly like it .
