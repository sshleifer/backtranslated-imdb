Well, if you are open-minded enough to fall in love with a hair salon, then you will love this Canadian film. <br /> <br /> If your mind is as limited as Fort Knox, then you will give it a current rating of: 2.5. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for those who are willing to watch movies outside of their race. It's attractive, it's a fact of life, in two or three cases you lose the connection between the scenes, but many times, especially near the end, you find that tears or two appear in your eyes, and this is simply because it often reflects what life can be like. <br /> <br /> I like it, and I recommend it to anyone who is not limited to a traditional American film.
