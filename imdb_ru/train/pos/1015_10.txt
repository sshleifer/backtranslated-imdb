I'm waiting for each new episode, every repetition with waiting! The new kind of science fiction created by Stargate SG-1 is a miracle that I hope will never end. Combining the past with the future is a new twist that fascinates me. Season number 9 should be exciting in itself. I would like Richard Dean Anderson to appear more often in the new season, since I love his wit as much as the tantrums in his character, like Jack O'Neill. Other characters add their uniqueness to the show, making it a winner, season after season. You cancel this program for the next three years, and you are making a serious mistake. In addition, you need a big role for Asgard - they are just too cool.
