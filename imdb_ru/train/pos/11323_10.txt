Fate / Stay Night - an animated series inspired by an h-game. Somehow, the producers turned it over, making this series a success, without any x-hats. It could not be otherwise, because the development of the characters is great as it is depicted in this series, and any change in it can only spoil the perfection (you will understand as soon as you see all the episodes). <Br /> <br /> Despite a relatively slow start (the producer was not in a hurry with the character presentation), things quickly gained momentum, and soon after the middle of the series, the action becomes so intense that it sticks you to your spot. <br /> <br /> The theme of the series is devoted to the Holy Grail War, which took place in the city of Fukuki for the past 50 years. The pilot actually begins with the end of the previous war and develops from there. Shirou is the only survivor of the fire that began during the last battle and swept most of the city. He reluctantly watches the battle between the two Servants, which causes his Reiju (Sacred Sign) to summon one of the most powerful Servants on the battlefield. Saber. His first contact with Saber left him stunned. "Such immeasurable beauty ... I was at a loss for words." <br /> <br /> You should not compare this series with any other in order to fully understand its plot. FSN offers much more than just great sword fights, good animation, impressive lights, a great soundtrack, an excellent development of character and relationships. It presents the changes that occur in the characters of the characters as events occur. The action reveals plausible dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of individuals (not similar to the use of the linear type in other series), who constantly form their personalities in order to reveal defective characters from the perfection mask. <br /> <br /> Saber's character is associated with a medieval legend that has been modified to fit this series and should be adopted as such. You should not watch FSN think that this does not represent a historical fact to the viewer, just remember that this is a series of adventures / fantasy, not a documentary, and enjoy it as long as possible. The ending is sudden and unexpected, and if there were twice as many episodes, I would watch them in the same breath.
