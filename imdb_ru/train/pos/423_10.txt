I just read the plot summary, and this is the worst I've ever read. It does not do justice to this incredible film. For an example of a good resume, read the list in Turner's Classic Movies. In any case, it was one of my favorite films in childhood. My sister and I could not wait for each April until we saw him on TV. This is one of the best horse films of the time. This is one of those great classic things that the whole family can watch. Romance is pure and charming. The storyline is interesting, and the songs are great. They no longer make such films. Good game and not too much. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are at their best, along with many other outstanding actors.
