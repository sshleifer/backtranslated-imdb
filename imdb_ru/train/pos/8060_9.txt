**** SPOILERS **** Powerhouse is a film that shows how men in desperate situations can go so far as to sacrifice their best friends and family members and not understand what kind of monsters they are in doing this. So far, as in the case of the bull, like Gypo Noland, Victor McLaglen, it's too late. <br /> <br /> Now is the year 1922 and the greatness of the black and red Irish uprising against the powerful British Empire with dancing, the British occupation forces, searching for the wanted Irish Republican rebel Republican Frankie McFillip, Wallace Ford, for the murder of the British soldier. Gypo is a good, truly the best, friend of a runaway McFillip, who lost his luck, not having a job with his girlfriend Katie, Margot Graham, forced to do stunts in the Dublin red light district to pay for an apartment. /> <br /> After an offended gypsy working on a potential John, who wants to spend several hours with Katie on a couple of shillings, angry Katie tells the not-so-bright gyroscope that he is keeping her from supporting herself the only thing she has bank assets, her body. Kathy also tells Hypo that he must wake up to reality and understand what a desperate situation she is in. Telling the stunned Hypo that she would have cost only ten pounds to go to America and break out of the poverty of Ireland. , Gypo suddenly recalls the poster of his good friend Frankie McFillip, whom he just saw, announcing a reward of £ 20. That is enough for him and Kate to go to America. <br /> <br /> Hypo, going to the local flop house in Dublin to get free food, faces his friend Frankie McFillip in amazement. Frankie tells him that he made his way to Dublin to see his mother, Mrs. MacFillip and sister Mary, Una O'Connor and Heather Angel, and if he can make sure everything is safe for him to go home and later leave for his Irish Republican outside the city. <br /> <br /> All that hypo sees on Frankie’s face is a £ 20 reward for turning into the police! Without thinking, after he had assured Frankie that everything was in order, Hypo secretly went to the police and reported on his friend, who was later shot dead by the police and Tan's gunfight at his mom's house. <br /> <By doing this, the police chief presents a 20-pound sterling, almost like thirty pieces of silver, to an almost unemotional hypo, who takes it and sneaks through the back door of the police station so that it can be seen, You can see from the face and actions of the police chief that he has nothing but total contempt for Jeepo’s treachery towards his friend Frankie McFillip. Although he was wanted for the murder and the enemy of the British Empire. That is how low traitors or informers are kept even by those they secretly work for. <br /> <br /> Hypo turns out to be his own worst enemy after the betrayal of Frankie, because his conscience seizes his mind. Gypo sees and hears everyone, including his unsuspecting girlfriend Katie, pointing and engaging him in the treachery and death of Frankie at the hands of the British authorities. Jeepo's guilty mind makes him royally and gloriously get drunk on the reward, that by the time he is forced to admit his crime to his colleagues from the Irish Republican Army, who were almost dead drunk and slobbering Jeepy, the money almost went to parties, drinking and having fun. <br /> <br /> Whatever good feelings, if any, that you experienced towards a weak-minded and strong shoulder, Gypo was completely destroyed when he was in a state of complete despair, so as not to be shot, he falsely involves an innocent person Mulligan, Donald Mick, in his crime of informing about his friend Frankie MacPillipe. Which is quickly exposed as a complete production, not by someone other than Hypo himself. The paint is then discarded as straws are drawn for someone who would put a bullet in the head of the Hypo for the final chapter on spilling guts in this heartbreaking and unforgettable classic of Crime and Punishment.
