Stargate is the best show in history. All actors are perfect for their roles. I love the connection between the characters. If you have not seen this show, I highly recommend it. Although this program is often compared to Star Trek, in reality this cannot be because it is completely different. I'm a star trek fan, but I would definitely rate this show well beyond any star trek. Unfortunately, I live in New Zealand, and we don’t show Stargate on our TV, so if I want to watch it, I need to buy a DVD, and the 10th season isn’t yet, so I can't see it for quite a long time (which is very depressing). Nevertheless, this program is very good and you need to see it, but keep in mind that it causes a strong dependency. So in the summer I love Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
