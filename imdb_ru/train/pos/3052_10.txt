A strange but emotionally disturbing chiller about a middle-aged fed man (William H. Macy), who finally decides to leave the family business (homicide), run by his quietly demanding father (Donald Sutherland), after seeing a psychiatrist (John Ritter) and flirts with another patient (Neve Campbell). <br /> <br /> Talking about a serious dilemma, but Panic is a top-notch thriller that looks like American Beauty meets Professional. Macy and Sutherland stand out here. Wonderful debut for budding writer / director Henry Bromella. I am surprised that this film has not had the opportunity to stay in cinemas for more than a couple of weeks.
