That's why I still have nightmares. <br /> <br /> This terrifying film (musical) was considered suitable for children in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> The boy goes on a magical journey to the island. The mayor of the island of Pufnstuf, supposedly a dragon, looks more like a newt with conjunctivitis, and the magic talking flute is a target for witches (Billy Halliday, who at the time was considered “a little in order”). <br /> <br /> The flute was found at the “interesting” witch meeting, because the witches were old gays. The boy dresses in a drag, and then as a fairy, to restore the flute. <br /> <br /> Not suitable for children.
