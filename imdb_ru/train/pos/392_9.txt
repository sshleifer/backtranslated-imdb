The legend of Tsu, as I saw it, was a very interesting story. I think that many of those who did not like it did not see the main mythology of the film. They expected something similar to Star Wars, and this was not the case. Joseph Campbell, I think, would have liked this movie. There were several metaphors and hidden meanings that the average viewer might have overlooked. We all have a mountain of swords within us. We must all enter our own cave of blood sometime in our lives. We should all ever face our own insomnia. Of course, some of the narrations were a bit confusing, and some of the actions sometimes became a little deceiving, but I think that other moments of the film easily compensated for this. I would watch it again. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know if there is a difference between Legends of Zoo (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (duplicate version for the USA). Perhaps she was stunned by American viewers who would really distract from this film.
