Three Puppets has always been one of the many actors I loved. I love almost all the shorts they made. I love all six puppets (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are funny, and many other great actors and actresses have also been shot, many of whom were in many shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stooges - one of the greatest actors of all time and the funniest comedy team of all time! <br /> <br /> This is a good short three. It's fun, and includes Cristina McIntyre, Simone Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore Lorche, Linton Brent, Judy Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Tyrrell, Heiney Conklin and Bess Flowers. The Stooges performed very well in this short film! I recommend this one!
