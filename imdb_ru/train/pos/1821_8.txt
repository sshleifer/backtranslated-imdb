When I was a little girl (and my father had a video store), it was one of my favorite movies. Since then, I have heard little about it, and I did not remember anything about it, they forgot about it after the other, possibly the best Don Bluth films. However, I managed to track it a few weeks ago, and I was again pleasantly surprised. Set in New Orleans in the 1930s, the animation is amazing and the songs are unforgettable. There are some nonsense in continuity, if you look closely enough, but they usually do not distract from the storyline, which makes you smile (and maybe even a little hazy eyes, if you are an animal lover). Characters are believable (perhaps even too adult for younger viewers). Two paws up, and for those of you who have not seen him for some time, it is definitely worth reconsidering.
