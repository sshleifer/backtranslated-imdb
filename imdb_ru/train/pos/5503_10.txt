The material in this documentary is so strong that it made me cry. Yes, tears I tell you. This popular struggle of the traditionally exploited population should inspire all of us to assert our rights, to bring great benefits to society and to stop giving out cowardly excuses so as not to challenge the establishment. Chavez represents the weak and the unfortunate, just as Bush is the face of dirty corporations, and capitalism has flared up. Indeed, Latin America is undergoing change, and the marginalized majority finally has the right to vote for five centuries. Although, in the case of Mexico, the elections were clearly stolen by Calderon. Chavez is not perfect, far from it. He is trying to change the constitution to allow him to rule endlessly. This can not be tolerated. Enough with the politics and back to the film; The tempo is breathtaking in moments, and deeply philosophical in others. He portrays Ch√°vez as a popular hero who is not afraid to challenge the hegemony of the United States and domination of world resources. If you believe that the author is leaning in favor of Chavez, nothing prevents you from doing your homework. One of the important messages of the film is a survey of information sources, which was clearly demonstrated by the victims of snipers, who are shamefully accused by supporters of Chavez. Venezuela has disgraced American democracy. Hasta la revolucie siempre!
