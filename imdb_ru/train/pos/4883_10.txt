We, as a family, were so delighted with the “Last of the Blonde Bombs” that we bought a copy for our home video library. <br /> <br /> In the cast of A1 and many actors and singers. The theme is unusual and the script is well written. Music / songs are eternal and bring us back to our young time when we sang songs at the top of our voices. Narrative of the story here would spoil the "plot", as it is very pleasant to sit back and enjoy the story while it unfolds. <br /> <br /> A full evaluation of this most enjoyable and inspiring movie, and we sincerely recommend it to Anyone who is looking for enthusiastic laughter and a lot of music.
