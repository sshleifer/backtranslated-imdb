************** Possible spoilers ********** There is only one reason I watched this movie, namely because I am deeply in love with Richard Belzer. (I do not really understand humor) Some funny things were, like Barbie and Ken Spouf, dealers and the president have a parody. Keep in mind that this is sometimes obscene (I dare, do I speak rudely?) It was sometimes funny, but it could be better. Perhaps if they spent more time in humor and less stripped women, the film would be funnier. Some parodies just make you jerk, and others cringe, other parodies make you laugh and, oddly enough, think. Unfortunately, this film is dated. If you are madly in love with Richard Belzer (it's worth it), you should check it out and see how Chevy is being chased.
