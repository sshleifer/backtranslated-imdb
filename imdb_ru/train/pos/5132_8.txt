Jazz fans will cherish this classic short show that demonstrates that some of the best jazz men just do their thing. Itâ€™s like watching a no-frills music video. <br /> <br /> Jazz musicians give us additional pleasure in the person of Marie Bryant, who sings the classic version of "On the sunny side of the street." I had never heard her singing before, Bryant sounds wonderful, like Billie Holliday. This is a compliment, guys. <br /> <br /> Their instrumental work is also top. While the black cinema of its time fueled many white stereotypes, this film should be watched and appreciated. No big production values, just a lot of good music.
