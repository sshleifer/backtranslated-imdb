"The Sentinel" - one of the best horror films already filmed in the film industry! I think this is very scary, because there are really very few films. Alison Parker - a model with some fame. She meets with a lawyer named Michael Lerman and has another model named Jennifer as a best friend. In her life, everything was fine, until she decided to live alone and rent a beautiful and old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is that her neighbors are very, VERY strange. Suddenly, Alison starts having health problems, and they often faint; She also remembers some painful facts about her past that cause her nightmares or illusions. But everything has a reason, and this is connected with the new house in which she lives ... <br /> <br /> I personally find “Guardian” a very creepy movie, as well as “The Exorcist” which I have already watched. When we find out that Alison’s house is occupied only by a priest, she herself is frozen! It is also terrible to see that she needs to go blind at the end of the film to become a new guard, to keep the monsters away from our world.
