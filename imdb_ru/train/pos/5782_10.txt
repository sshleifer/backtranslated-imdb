The Internet database lists this as a TV show. And yes, it was a series on MTV, shown in the program “Weirdness”, after “Head” and before “Eon”, if I remember correctly. But the version that I looked at this time was a VHS tape in which all the episodes were merged into a movie without intermediate credits or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> You have the story of Max, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. Maxx is a superhero or a bum, Julie is a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah is a girl who should listen to the Smiths less, and Mr. Gone, a guy who seems unable to hold her head. And there are strange creatures ... <br /> <br /> I use "or" with Max and Julie, because part of the fun is figuring out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams. Maybe they are all real or dreams. Perhaps one of the characters does not exist. Maybe there is only one and dreams of others. You have to wait and find out. <br /> <br /> I had comics before the show, and it was one of my favorites. The decoration was impressive, and the story is original - unlike anything you find in Superman or Batman. It bends your mind, and has strong adult overtones, without being obscene or offensive. And in the show, the exact same artwork was used (only now it is moving) and the same story ... ensuring that the beauty found in the comic will be reproduced exactly. It was the best show for “Weirdness”, folded hands. <br /> <br /> If you like comics of a darker nature or you need a good trip, this is a show that is worth seeing. This is Donnie Darko, even before it happened. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing is that it has never become another film or television series, but I do not say this with disappointment. Keeping it simple, they sealed this film in gold and freed it from the stains caused by successive setbacks.
