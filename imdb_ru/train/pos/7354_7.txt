I first saw this film over 25 years ago on British television, and only last week saw it again on a DVD copy purchased on eBay. I remember the musical sequences, color and gorgeous poses and trendy plate and clothes, but the plot is weaker than in Anna Neagl / Michael Wilding's early film Spring on Park Lane, and Maytime does not stand the years very well, But Michael Wilding - this joy in the film, charming, funny, slutty, seems to be very funny and excellent. It is worth looking at him alone. Anna Neagl looks a bit obscene next to him, and too old for the role she plays, but by the end of the 1940s their cinematographic partnership was well established due to the fact that the cinema became public. Spring in Park Lane was a major hit in 1947 and made a lot of money. In his autobiography, Wilding wrote at length about his great respect for Herbert Wilcox, the director and inspirer of this London film series.
