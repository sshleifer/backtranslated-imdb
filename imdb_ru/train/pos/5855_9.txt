If you played Spider-Man on the PS version, then you all saw it. To truly experience this, you must get a DC version. Simply put, this is a graphically superior game; the textures are clear, the levels are easily oriented, and the sound is much better than cousin PS. I bought this game back in the late 00s, and it still lasts until now. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a strategically excellent game, but if you are a fan of ol Web Head, then you yourself should choose this for your gaming library. Swinging around the city, Spidey has never looked so good and worthless in a video game. If you have a dreamcast, catch it for cheap. The DC version is just incredible.
