Aardman does it again. Next to Pixar Aardman Animation proves again and again how to properly animate. <br /> <br /> I had a great time watching the first episode of Creature Comforts. I thought it was well translated for an American audience. The only thing that worries me is that most viewers will not get a subtle humor on this show. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of the BBC version and the short film, I knew why I was waiting. when I sat down to watch it. The animators did a great job picking up pre-recorded voices for a perfectly selected animal. Look at the first episode with the Goat, which sounds stoned, and the dogs on the street, who continue to call each other "dawg". <br /> <br /> Is it for everyone? Not at all. In fact, I would be glad to see that the show will last the whole season. But, as I said, viewers won't get it.
