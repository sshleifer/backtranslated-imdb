I saw this film as a teenager and immediately identified myself with the image of Reese Witherspoon Dani Trent, a 14-year-old tomboy in the countryside of Louisiana, around 1957. She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister Maureen (now rarely saw Emily Warfield) and felt ill at ease in terms of her conservative Baptist upbringing. Then seventeen-year-old Court Foster (Jason London), the son of a close friend of her mother (Gail Strickland), moves next door, Danny is experiencing her first passion, while Court enjoys her company and strong-willed spirit. Dani manages to get her first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls on her heels, leaving Dani behind. The close relationship of the sisters is badly damaged due to the emerging rivalry, which only intensifies when the Court dies as a result of the tragic accident. Then the girls are made to understand how much they need each other. <br /> <br /> Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect, like loving parents trying to balance the individuality of their daughters, while also trying to keep the family together. Wonderful cinematography and a wonderful soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley, The Platters and many others miraculously contribute to creating the atmosphere of a film of a simpler time. <br /> <br /> A touching film about coming of age with a timeless message.
