I have to say that this film is really amazing and soulful. Reese Witherspoon is so charming, and Jason London is not so bad either! It’s so nice to watch Dani fall in love, and it breaks my heart, and at the same time warms my heart at the same time that Court falls in love with Maureen. however, it is even more pleasant to watch how much he cares for Dani. I must admit, although I wanted him to eventually fall in love with Dani. it's just so nice to watch her fall in love with him, I didn't want her to break her heart so much. but the biggest tragedy I've ever seen happened in this movie. watching him die made me cry all day long. I just could not believe it. however, the film never had more love relationships than Maureen and Dani. they can really go through anything. I give this film 9 because I didn’t want Court to die, but it was still one of the most amazing films I’ve ever seen.
