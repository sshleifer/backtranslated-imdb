In the alternate 1950s, where an outbreak of undead (caused by the mysterious "cosmic dust") was held back with the help of special electronic collars, the young loner Timmy finds a friend in Fido (Billy Connelly), his recently domesticated family zombie. <br /> <br /> Fido quickly becomes a surrogate father, Timmy, whose real dad is not able to adequately express his love for his son (or his hot wife played by the Magnificent Carrie-Anne Moss) was psychologically traumatized in childhood (when he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to eat him!). <br /> <br /> However, Timmy faces a problem when the collar of his rotten friend blinks, he attacks and kills his elderly neighbor. With the authorities on Fido's trail, a problem brewing with a pair of local hooligans, and his mother connecting with their undead at home, will Timmy be able to keep his newfound friend? <br /> <br /> A refreshing look at zombie jokes, Fido is a very interesting, delightfully dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly distorted sense of humor. Taking Romero-Zombie Verse and transferring it to the small town of America in the 1950s is a brilliant blow, and as a result it's just one of the most original films on the whole theme of the “walking dead” I have seen. <br /> Conidley Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of being included in the Undeath Cinema Hall of Fame, along with Grandma's Day of the Dead and The Return of the Living Dead Tarman; I don’t often feel sympathy for the walking corpse, but Big Yin’s performance is so good that I was actually rooting for the big blue bag of pus! The rest of the cast also gives meritorious performances, with young K'San Ray (like Timmy) and Miss Moss deserve special mention of Ray, because, for one so young, he puts on a particularly confident turn, and Moss, because she is damn delicious! <br /> <br /> This is the third zombie film that I watched this week (the others are the somewhat disappointing Planetary Horror and the rather funny Flight of the Living Dead) and, to my surprise, this is also the best . Directed by Andrew Kerry gave the fans of the genre something really original to appreciate it, and this is a talent that is worth seeing in the future. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded to 9 for IMDb.
