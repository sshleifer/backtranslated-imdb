I liked the film, primarily because he told an interesting story, but the story told in the film seemed concise to me from a much longer story. Since the book contains more than 400 pages, it makes sense. It covers the time period from the 1920s to the 1970s in a fictional South American country, also very much in line with the time available. I think it would be much better, like a six-hour mini-series, than a 140-minute film. <br /> <br /> Despite the rush, the plot is not so missed that it confuses. What is said is said quite well. One mistake is that Clara’s supernatural abilities appear inconsistently; either they should have looked more evenly throughout the film, or they should have been left out. Two more mistakes (which may be spoilers): Esteban's possible return to the good happens too suddenly, and Ferula’s curse seems to be erased, although the tone of the story suggests that it should last forever. <br /> <br /> The game is great. Glenn Close, as the ferrule's exhausted maiden, is outstanding. Jeremy Irons, like a brutal improvised rich man, is also great. Meryl Streep, as the main character of Clara, is gorgeous, although she is often even better than she was in this film. There were also many well-executed small roles. The biggest mistake was that there was no dialect coach in the film; each actor seemed to speak with a different accent.
