For example, I really like this film, for some reason, I will come late, but I want to touch on why I think people do not like it. First, there are people who just love to hate Tom Cruise. I do not really understand this. Secondly, Cameron Crow, I think, successfully removes two groups of viewers from this film. The casual, relaxed, “not thinking to think too hard” group of viewers are confused when the plot takes as many as 180 at the end of the film. And deep, philosophical, secret admirers are devastated when Crowe forces one of his characters to fully explain the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. And Tom Cruise does a very good job on this. I think that this is probably his best performance of all that I have seen, although I have not seen all of his films, or even most of them, probably. The supporting cast is also good. Penelope Cruz demonstrates a solid game, and Jason Lee was pleasant. <br /> <br /> I like this story, and I think this is what Vanilla Sky has more than anything else. It's a mystery, an adventure and a romantic comedy, but basically it's just a good story. And it has many philosophical shades to it, and many similar ideas and stories like this occur in historical philosophy. David Ames (Cruise) - a man who had everything he wanted, more or less lost it, got a second chance with a ploy to bring it all back, and eventually ran into his demons and full swing of what is happening, chooses reality, simplicity and normality to see if he can finally find one thing that he can never grasp: happiness. <br /> <br /> Many were disappointed that Crow revealed a complete secret at the end. I think it is necessary. Then the audience knows without a shadow of a doubt that David knows about his circumstances, and this makes the choice even stronger at the end. <br /> <br /> And the music in the movie is great. This is probably what makes the film as enjoyable as it is. In particular, “Njosnavelin” by Sigur Ros, is an amazing song. <br /> <br /> In general, I would give her 3 out of 4 stars. This is a movie with content for those who like to think things through, and a great story for those who want to relax. This “moderate” approach is probably the reason why people do not like it that way because it is not a mystery revealed or a full-scale love story. It mixes and combines different elements and genres.
