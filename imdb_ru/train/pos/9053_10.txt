1.) This movie was awesome! I watched it when I was in the city next to where he grew up! I went and saw the buildings in which this story took place. Overall, I liked this movie, one of Jake Gyllenhaul's best !! In addition, my favorite roles are the science fair and all the time with his father. They seemed so sad. Homer wanted to follow his dream, and his dad didn't seem to care anyway. This tag line is true. "Sometimes One Dream is bright enough to light up the sky." 2.) The way this film was shot was impeccable, it was all so believable that it could be recorded in the 1950s. The dress was neat, and they also had slang. Would definitely recommend this movie!
