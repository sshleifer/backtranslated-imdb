This is the second film of Eitan Fox, which I saw. The fantastic actor Lior Ashkenazi, who played the main role in "Walk on the Water", also played a minor role in this film. <br /> <br /> But the real stars are the young Israelis who live together in a tiny apartment - Noam (Ohad Noller), Lulu (Daniel Wierzer) and Yelly (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian who joins them from time to time is Ashraf (Youssef 'Joe' Svid). Something like “Friends / Sex in the City” (mostly gay) happens, and they all just want the war to end so they can live peacefully. <br /> <br /> But this rub. No matter how many posters you lay out or how much you have an enthusiastic world, the war will not end. Many have tried over the years to bring both parties to the table, but they just want it to continue for any reason. Many on the Israeli side, both there and here in the US, just want all of this and will not think about peace. There are many people on the Palestinian side who will obviously be left without work if peace ever comes. No one is interested in putting an end to this war, and children are suffering. <br /> <br /> It's always on your mind when you watch this funny and attractive movie. It will not go away. You know that something tragic will happen, and, of course, it will happen. With strong feelings on both sides and revenge as a motivator, tragedy always happens, and this is exactly what makes this version of “Friends / Sex in the City” for adults. There is no superficiality. This is real life, and it was beautiful.
