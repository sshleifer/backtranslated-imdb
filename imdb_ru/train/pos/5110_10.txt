I was about 11 years old, I learned that I live 0.48 miles from my uncle's home. Uncle's house is located at Westway Dr, Deer Park, Texas they added at home since the film was made. I do not know the house number, but you can see it. I'm 21 now, and I like to watch this movie. The bar on Spencer is no longer theirs. Pasadena ISD wants to build a school of them. I drove past the house last week, the house still looks great. My dad and uncle went out to the street where the house is located, and watched the actors enter and exit the house, trying to make a film. where john crosses the railroad cracks, they made 225 above. when I hear that John lost his son, I start thinking about when he became a city cowboy, he was 26 or 25 years old.
