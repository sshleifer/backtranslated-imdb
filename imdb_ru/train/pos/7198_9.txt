This is a really good film that I liked to watch several times. Michael Caine is awesome as always. Michael Caine gained fame for playing any role in any film, regardless of quality or lack of it, but he plays the role of Sydney well. From the very beginning it is so well written. Who would have thought that Ira Levine, who wrote such terrible things as “Boys from Brazil” and “Rosemary Baby”, could have written something so witty. Let's face it - Michael Kane, Chris Reeve, Diane Cannon, Henry Jones ... how do you go wrong with the actors who played this production Sydney Lumet. <br /> <br /> I really don’t want to go because if someone gave anything about this film, it would be a crime. Just watch and adore it.
