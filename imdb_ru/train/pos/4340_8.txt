I liked this film, perhaps because I did not see reviews, etc. He was delightful and a bit "noisy." I don’t know why it didn’t make more splash than it did. As for the story, I could touch on certain aspects of Paul Reiser’s character, and I could “see my father” as Falk. I remembered many past times when I was a child and also listened to my grandparents. If you liked movies like Angry Old Men or On the Golden Pond, this is your movie. "Sleeping", in my opinion, and one of those stories that feel good. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many wonderful verbal quarrels, but nothing was exaggerated. I would say that this is at least 8 points, possibly higher.
