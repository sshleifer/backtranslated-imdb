Do not listen to a lot of harsh and mocking comments that leaned on this film ..... simply speaking, as regards ninja films, my friends are about as good as they get! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's stupid, yes, acting and screenwriting are admittedly absolutely brutal, but chewing gum is so damn fun! In fact, as is often the case with B-Movies, a terrible “game” (which in this film is really one of the worst I've ever had the pleasure to see!) And the ridiculous “plot” actually only serves to raise the level pleasure ten times. <br /> <br /> Obviously, wrestling scenes are the main attraction in this, and for the most part I am happy to say that they are very well placed, especially the final battle (during which we witness that the ninjas are not the normal laws of gravity ....) <br /> <br /> Believe me, if you're a fan of ninja films and haven't done it yet, if you saw Sakura Killers, then you really lose sight of what, in my opinion, is one of the real gems in the crown of the genre.
