Watch on the Rhine is one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films made during World War II. Paul Lucas certainly deserved his Oscar. Bette Davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was. I would recommend this film to those who are interested in this era, and, of course, to the incredible films of the late great Miss Bette Davis.
