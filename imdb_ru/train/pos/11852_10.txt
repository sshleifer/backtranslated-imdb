Spirit is a unique and original view of Western life from the point of view of the wild horse and Native Americans. The film tells about the friendships and dangers that the wild horse, the Spirit, faces in its life. <br /> <br /> Very well done in the presentation, using the technologies available today to create stunning visual effects, breathtaking in its depth. and realism. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic with the songs of Brian Adams and the music of Hans Zimmer, who was also responsible for the extremely popular Disney hit music of 1994, the Lion King. <br /> <br /> The story is not very deep, but the fact that it is not as deep as some films, in my opinion, does not detract from the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie that I really liked and which is suitable for the whole family. Not one not to be missed. (10/10)
