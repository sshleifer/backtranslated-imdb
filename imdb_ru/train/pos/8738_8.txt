The Bugs Life is a great movie that is designed not only for children but also for adults. The story unfolds around the ant colony and their struggle against the evil grasshoppers, who return each year and steal their food (The Magnificent Seven Mirror). There is some great computer animation, as well as great voices. You will love it!! 8 out of 10
