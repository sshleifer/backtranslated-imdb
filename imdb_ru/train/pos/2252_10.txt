Henry Hathaway was not only enthusiastic, but also enthusiastic about his love for people in the early days of US history. However, to criticize the historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and the Mormon people, it is not necessary or useless to comment on this film. In my opinion, Hathaway made an excellent direction that conveys what Mormons were in the early history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for a period of time starting with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith before the movieâ€™s release date. In many subtle shootings and dialogues, he covered Mormon philosophy and teachings in many segments and scenes. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this film on Saturdays in the morning in the early 1950s. It was a little more than 10 years after the release of the films and before the completion of the temple in Los Angeles, which I oversaw the construction and inspired an even more interesting question about who the Mormons are. I recently purchased this film, and I will like the following posts that Hathaway interpreted in his film. <br /> <br /> 1. Love for all people, regardless of their personal convictions, 2. Charity to those who need them or not, 3. Family is very important, 4. Listen with respect and attentiveness, because even There are important points in the opposite messages that should be taken into account and taken 5. Work diligently, both individually and in the community, 6. Prepare and store for future needs, 7. Hope is a link with the higher being and for our daily life, 8 And that every person has a unique quality group, and appreciate those who s defined as useful.
