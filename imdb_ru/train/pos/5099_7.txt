The only reason I stumbled upon this film was that it is on the LITTLE MISS MARKER DVD, and I recommend watching it, although you donâ€™t like it, or the more famous movie. <br /> <br /> We have Gary Cooper and Carol Lombard as a crook and his companion. The film begins quite easily, but becomes more dramatic, as Coop first plans to use his daughter to extort a significant amount of money from his son-in-law, but after meeting the girl and observing the discipline, which she will obey with her brother in law chooses to leave her . However, it is difficult for him to stay on the straight and narrow path, and therefore the drama develops. <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lombard are good, and Shirley still manages to steal the scenes she is in. In this little music, and Shirley, only one song However, it is interesting and worth seeing along with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
