The story of the vagabond, his boss of the sheep ranch and the daughter of the boss are not for every taste, but she is still very intriguing. It takes place in the beautiful country of New Zealand, among landscapes that we have learned so well from other films from this region. <br /> <br /> In this film I first saw the beautiful Mary Reagan, and since then I have been a fan of her. The cast also includes Bruno Lawrence, who was probably best remembered by American viewers from the Smash Palace movie. Terence Cooper in turn becomes the owner of a ranch who pays too much attention to his daughter (Regan). <br /> <br /> Sharply acted, with unforgettably amazing actions from all his leads. I first saw this film in a highly edited form on television late at night here in America, but believe me, this version should not be missed.
