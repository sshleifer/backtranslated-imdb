This film is not as bad as I heard. It was nice, funny, and I love it to revolve around the holiday season. It totally set me up for the Christmas shop and listen to festive music. When this film is released on DVD, it will take the place of the Christmas holidays in my collection. This will be a film that needs to be watched every year after Thanksgiving, in order to cheer me up for the best time of the year. I heard that Benâ€™s character was a little crazy, but I think it just adds to the film and why to be so serious all the time. Take it for what it is, a Christmas comedy with a love twist. I enjoyed it. No, this is not a Titanic, and it will not make your heart beat with anticipation, but it will cause a laugh or two. So go laugh and have fun :)
