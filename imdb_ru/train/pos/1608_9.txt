Watching "Moonstruck" after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this film was when it first appeared. Who knew that Cher could act? Has anyone heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicolas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedic talents, and Norman Juison was not a director. <br /> <br /> The only really flat note in this great work is “When the Moon hits your eyes like a big pizza pie, it's Amore”, a song that is sung in the film too many times (once too much) and which has long remained afterlife in popular music. <br /> <br /> Cher, forgive me, is a sensation, like Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to get married and should not fall in love with her groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) undertakes, offering her his little finger ring instead of a wedding ring, and then rushes to Sicily to be with his dying mother. He accuses Loretta of the fact that his estranged brother Ronnie attends a wedding. Loretta confronts Ronnie and quickly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, her father (Vincent Gardenia) is cheating on her mother (Olympia Dukakis), which Loretta accidentally discovers when Ronnie invites her to the Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> In the end, everything turns out, as is inevitable in the films of this genre. Meanwhile, all the actors have proven themselves well, and the audience is enjoying. In turn, Moonstruck is how Hollywood was at its best: noisy entertainment without any social significance. If they had just lost “This is Amore,” that would be wonderful.
