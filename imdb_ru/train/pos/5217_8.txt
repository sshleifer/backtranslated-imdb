I filmed this movie late on the cable and was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine the reason why this film was not better known, because the subject is very disturbing. But if you deal with the topic of sexual abuse, this is a good, intense and very interesting film. Both Richard Gere and Claire Danes are very good at it. And although the subject is not for the faint of heart, the film is not struggling to be cruel (for example, 8 mm). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the Serial Killer and the Unknown movies.
