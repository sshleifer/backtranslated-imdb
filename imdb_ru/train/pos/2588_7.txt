Brothers with psychokinetic abilities (yes, indeed) duels not only because of Debra Winger's affections, but also because of the secrets of their childhood, which left them at odds with their abilities. <br /> <br /> There are surrealistic touches (the fire brigade behaves like a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor and romance. The soundtrack is very similar to how an American werewolf in London used every great Wolf song they could get, but with fire, and I don't think I will ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid) by putting my own rock trailer 'to' She is a lady '~ priceless;) <br /> <br /> By the way, in the quotes section there is no best line ~' Once you have a clown, you will never come back! 'I love this movie (I ordered a DVD from the USA), and if comments written by people who were happier with Legally Blond 3 didnâ€™t push you away - try it :)
