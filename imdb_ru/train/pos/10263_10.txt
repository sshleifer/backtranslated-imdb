“House of Games” is a flawlessly crafted film, and one of the few films I saw made me wonderfully see the screen, how cleverly and unexpectedly it ended. I first saw him on video several years ago after reading the review of Roger Ebert, who declared him the best film of 1987. I had doubts, mainly because he is not as well known as the other films of that year. Boy, I was on a surprise. It was one of the smartest, most well-written films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A scenario is simply a work, not only from the point of view of the plot (which twists, turns and pulls the carpet out from under you, only when you think you understood everything), but also from the point of view of development character. During my second viewing, I began to realize that the script of Mameth was successful not only as a clever movie with uncertainty, but also that each plot process contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivation. The climax of the film is especially effective because it is absolutely inevitable. This naturally follows from what we know about the characters, and therefore it is much more than just an arbitrary ending of the turn. The performances by Lindsay Crose and Joe Mantegna also add significantly to the film. I can’t imagine another actor other than Mantegna playing the role of Mike, and Crouse plays his part with enough restraint to suggest repressed criminal thinking. Their work, plus Mamet’s unusual screenplay, is combined to create one of the greatest films of the 1980s. This is really a must see.
