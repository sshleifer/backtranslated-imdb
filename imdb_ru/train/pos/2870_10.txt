This film is wonderful. It has always been this way, it will always be this way. I mean, it's better than a housekeeper in love. Walt really did it himself here. And the music! A dream is a desire that your heart makes beautiful! What else can you say besides amazing! I can not wait for the release of a special edition, it will be so great! I can't wait to hear all deleted songs! This movie is made so beautiful and smart! It's cute. How about cute mice too! I know that I repeat the same thing over and over again, but hey, this is a great movie! Woods was awesome in this beautiful beautiful film.
