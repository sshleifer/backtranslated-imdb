The “sisters in law” were made by the same leaders of a rather curious and exciting “divorce in Iranian style”, which was exactly the same as it was stated, as we got an idea about the divorce court in Iran. Now they have turned their attention to the judicial system in Cameroon, Africa. What is good about this court is that the 2 magistrates are women, which is unusual for a country like this. In any case, they are dealing with a lot of men accustomed to bypassing women, but this film is remarkable in that it seems that women have made great strides in society, and the divorce is legal, and women's rights are recognized. Therefore, judges often punish men for primitive behavior in these times. This is not to say that women who appear in court receive a softer appeal. One of the main plots of the film is the case of child abuse committed by an aunt. Judges do not waste time pouncing on a woman with rage. And who said that justice no longer serves? With these 2 behind the bench. They often perform maximum fines! Ya You go, girl!
