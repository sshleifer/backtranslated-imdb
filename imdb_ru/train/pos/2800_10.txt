David Beckham is a British football star and husband of Victoria Beckham ("Spice Girls Posh Spice"). His trademark is a shot on goal, which bends through the field and into the net. The football equivalent of an indomitable bent ball in baseball. “Bend him like Beckham” means making such an impressive shot. In addition, a small sanctuary for him in the bedroom of the main character and an artificial cameo at the very end, the film has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The film is full of little football - jokes, such as a gift that one of the characters' parents gave her a T-shirt with the number 9 on it (the property of the great Mia Hamm, to all friends), links to "Posh 'n' Becks "video dedicated to WUSA, which one of the characters plays for an incredulous friend (" They have * what? "), Lesbians, jokes from a sports bra, etc. <br /> <br /> The story is about a girl- a teenager in England who idolized Beckham and wants to be a football star. She has a real gift, but two seemingly insurmountable obstacles that she must overcome are the lack of a professional women's league in the UK (hence their passion for our WUSA) and her parents, who are Indian immigrants who are set up in very old-fashioned ways. who do not allow daughters, by the way, to engage in contact sports. The girl's family is depicted as a figure of ironic fun, but with great love - remember my big fat Greek wedding. The girl loves and respects them enough to get through the comedic hell to hide her growing football glory from them.
