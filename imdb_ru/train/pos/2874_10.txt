Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is abused by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters. One day there will be a ball in honor of the prince, but Cinderella has no chance to leave, because her stepmother and stepsisters will not allow her. With the help of her fairy and her animal friends, she goes to the ball with a warning to return home by midnight. At the ball, she meets the beautiful Prince Charming. When the clock strikes midnight, she runs home, leaving behind one of her glass slippers. With the help of her animal friends, her true identity is revealed. Later, she and the prince got married and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Cinderella, released 56 years ago, was a huge box office success and continues to fascinate the audience to this day. He has a well-written script. Characters are memorable. Songs, including “Dream is the desire that makes your heart,” “So this is love,” and the great “Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo” help to tell a story. It was my favorite film about growing up, and he didn’t lose his charm. Disney's real masterpiece! Featured. 10/10 P.S. The recent DVD release is the best way to appreciate this film, including art compositions, deleted scenes, music videos, old-time radio programs and a restored film print!
