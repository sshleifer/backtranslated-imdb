Well, I think that I am emotionally attached to this film, since this is the first film that I visited more than 10 times in the cinema ... helping me in my master's thesis, or rather, preventing me from working on it! <Br /> <br /> But after seeing it again several years later (and many films) later, what a little pearl it is! I have never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more convincing performance, and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr. Knightley - where can you meet such a person ??? <<< sigh >>> Sophie Thompson's move in the role of Mrs. Bates is a virtuoso actor of the best (oh, napkins, sorry!), and the rest of the cast also doesn't disappoint - Tony Colette brings a lot of Muriel to her Harriet, and Ewan McGregor convincingly charming, and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson - the perfect pair of "impossible"! <br /> <br /> Of course, the scenery and costumes, as well as the beautiful soundtrack, contribute a lot to the overall mood, almost like Hobbiton. The atmosphere of the film - although in terms of cinematography and decoration, this is almost a case of visual overload. Very, very beautiful, but a little more rigor could convey a better feeling of the period. But the good news is that the film does not take itself too seriously, and there is a lot of fun — and pretty cool editing — that doesn’t allow it to plunge into the “Merry Old England” mode. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene of the ball is some great acting and directing here, and the final dance just perfectly describes the relationship between Emma and Mr. Knightley. It is a pity that the scene of the final sentence goes on too long - take two shots (I can think which ones!), And that would be much more in line with the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Damn it, I just realize (reading the lists in imdb) that I have seen Jeremy Northam in at least three films without even realizing that it was him - it seems he loves him much more actor than just being a gentleman of English heartbreaker! Hmm, I think I need to visit my video store ... <br /> <br /> A great movie. My favorite adaptation of Jane Austen is still - although perhaps Ang Lee's “Feeling and Sensitivity” is, strictly speaking, the best film that is closest to my heart - and I, of course, have seen it many more times! Look at it if you can, and do not be zealous in its small flaws. <br /> <br />
