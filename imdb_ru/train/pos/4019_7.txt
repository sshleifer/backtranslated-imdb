The fact that I am not a fan of Snoop Dogg as an actor made me even more anxious to watch this movie. I remember that he was given an interview on “Jay Leno”, and he said that he refused to take part in the high-budget comedy Adam Sandler “The Longest Yard”, which will be in this film. Obviously, Snoop had a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops. I am not going to overestimate Snoop for his performance in "Tenants". Of course, there are better rappers / actors, such as Mos Def, who could do more with his role. But the fact is that Snoop did a “good” job. It seems that he cannot shake off some of his signature body movements and vocal exaggerations, but even Jack Nicholson faces problems with this. The bottom line is that I found him convincing in the role, and the tension between him and the charming character Dylan McDermott. By the way, McDermott gives the best performance in the film, although his subtle play is likely to be overshadowed by Snoop's not so subtle play. Being a great reader and novice writer, I could not help but find the characters and the plot is somewhat exciting. It annoyed me that Snoop's character constantly asked McDermott to read his work and scolded him for criticism. But you know what? I am sure that many writers are like that. His character had to be vicious, like McDermott, in his own way. My only mild criticism of the film is its end. For some reason it seemed to me to be in too much of a hurry, although the resolution, of course, made sense and was motivated by the characters, not the plot.
