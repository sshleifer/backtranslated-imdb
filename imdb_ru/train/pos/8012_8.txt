As for the line of Muppet, this is not the best and not the second option. It was sold to the kids, but has some dark, and emotionally frustrating adult moments with which parents may not be willing to expose their children. One of them demonstrates that Miss Piggy becomes “postal” in a jealous rage that lasts mainly throughout this work. <br /> <br /> However, besides this, the story is progressive and very interesting. One scene in which Joan Rivers and Miss Piggy go crazy in a department store is just ridiculous! And there are other parts of this work that contain the same level of levity and fun. <br /> <br /> I like it a lot and I still enjoy it. <br /> <br /> He estimates 7.6 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
