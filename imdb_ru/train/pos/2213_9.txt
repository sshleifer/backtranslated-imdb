Wow, this film was completely fascinating, I could not believe that I woke up so late to watch it, but it came late, I started watching, I could not stop, it had a full set of very good actors, even Eartha Kitt and Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones, as well as many other famous actors and actresses - it was more than a glimpse of history, it was opening eyes to another part of society that people do not know and may even be embarrassed to talk about. I have never heard of this book or movie about it before, and this is what the black story never considers, only looks down on it, because they were a privileged and mixed race, I highly recommend this movie
