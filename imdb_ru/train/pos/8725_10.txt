I liked Antz, but I liked Life of the Beetle. The animation that was invested in it paid off. I will definitely get it on DVD. By the way, Disney should make a widescreen version of this film on tape. (I heard talk that all characters can appear on the screen in a standard video format). Most will have to accept that the final credits were the funniest! I only saw one of the two sets, but I can't see the other!
