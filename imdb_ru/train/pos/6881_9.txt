How can there be a movie in which Curtis Mayfield sings bad? It can not! Groove Tube is a series of screen sketches that make fun of everything from 2001 to the Olympics. The highs (Coco Clown, the easy recipe for lubrication) exceed the lows (Dealers are too long), but even the minimums are ridiculous. Best of all is Ken Shapiro's manic dance on the busy Manhattan sidewalk (this is Shapiro, not Nat King Cole, singing Just You, Just Me). Definitely dated now, but at the time The Groove Tube was disrespectful, brave, shameless and hysterically funny. Ken Shapiro made this minor cult strike, and then 7 years later he made the New Year bomb “Modern Problems” (although I liked it) and since then, unfortunately, nothing. (He may have played drums in a jazz band) The Groove Tube is left with an endless tide of positive energy, a film that 26 years after my initial viewing still brings me real joy!
