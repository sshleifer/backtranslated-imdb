If you “get it,” that's great. <br /> <br /> If you don’t, it’s decent. <br /> <br /> Please understand that “getting” does not necessarily mean that you left through school shooting. There are so many things in this film that sometimes school shots become insignificant. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a film about recognition, both outwardly, of a traumatic event, and of people who are different for different reasons. <br /> <br /> This is also a film about intolerable pain and how different people endure it. In this case, the contrast between Alicia’s rage and Dinna’s obsession creates an atmosphere of such tangible anxiety that in the middle of the film we wonder how the director could pull the happy ending out of his hat. Fortunately, audiences are given the honor of being people; our intelligence is not offended by a juicy, implausible moralistic ending. <br /> <br /> Among other things, I try not to think that films are fiction and all that. However, I must admit, I cried like a lost little child during this film. There were certain things that struck * very * close to home and opened up some old wounds that never healed. But this is not necessarily bad.
