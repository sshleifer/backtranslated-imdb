"Condemned" is a film of the third kind. All the dialogues and interaction of characters that occur within it, occur due to the long end of the late southern day. And, as a result, the life of its main character, Soll (Robert Duval). <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration of director Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foote. Six years ago, they worked together on the film "A trip to abundance," which seems almost an action saturated compared to this. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, it is just adequate from this side. The slow pace leaves plenty of room for cinematographer Toyomichi Kurita, who fills the film with just the right feeling of fragile light and heat. <br /> <br /> Because this is essentially a piece that was shot, with a bit of noise. Editing or managing the skill, it all comes down to acting. As far as I understand, there are no flaws. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, the two best American actors (both born in January 1931), create completely real characters who are not interested in anything but life. Lucas Haas, a young actor with whom I was familiar from the “Testament” and the “Witness”, plays a character very similar to his other early roles. He is quiet, withdrawn, slightly frightened and sad. These are qualities that seem natural to him. <br /> <br /> A title like "Condemned" may be a bad service for this film. This title, along with the intro scene, seems to create an image of a much more stretched picture of the Western type. If slow stage performances do not really interest you, you also want to skip this. Otherwise, it could be the movie that you would like to make more often. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
