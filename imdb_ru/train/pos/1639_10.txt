Fairy-tale actors, beautiful landscapes, harsh reality. I will not dwell on all the comments of other reviewers, because you get the picture! However, the film is not for squeamish. The reality is to kill pigs and other animals in order to survive. I also have the book of the manor Eleanor Randall Stewart. I read it a few years ago, I have to re-read it, since I just watched the recently released, updated DVD of the movie. <br /> <br /> I tried to buy a video for several years, finally bought it from a used video store that went out of business. But yippie! The DVD is now on sale, I bought it on amazon.com. Not cheap, but worth it for me. This is a film that I will watch until the end of my days!
