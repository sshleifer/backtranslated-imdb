Developing a critical look at cinema and the love of good cinema, I went to Antwone Fisher with symbolically held breath. Although I am a shameless fan of Denzel Washington - both his acting skills and his public identity; I'm an honest fan enough to admit (very little) time when he didn't quite reach the goal in a movie or two. And I could be wrong in this - after all, I'm not an actor. But everything was different - Denzel will invest his experience in his career and will direct a film dedicated to one of the most delicate topics known to man - child abuse. Like his directorial debut, no less. And develop a film to show that he will successfully present the triumph of man. I did not want to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I was not. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a film full of promises that connected various audiences and gave an inexperienced audience. He briefly but truthfully looks into the life of a young man whose childhood was a real hell, but won despite what. This film made it - and not a single inexperienced eye in the theater proved it. It is necessary that someone knows the themes in this film in order to know when the truth is presented. It takes a talented director to convincingly tell you this story when you have not experienced it. And if he can attract the audience even more and make the audience react emotionally without pity, the director has done his job. In any movie. Black, white, purple or polka dot. This is what makes a good movie. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and, above all, Antoine Fisher - you really won.
