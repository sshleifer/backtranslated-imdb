This film is in many ways reminiscent of the “Enemy of the State” with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, since we have an innocent (black) person who is haunted by the “government” with all the modern technologies known to man. Usually, when the storyline is copied in this way, the result is a disaster. It does not apply here. Of course, I like everything that David Morse does, so maybe my comments are unfair, but there were a lot of good things about this movie. The main character, played by Doug Hutchison, was brilliant, and the story poured with great additions, such as David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), however, annoyed most of the role. He is so out of place, jokes about bad jokes, does not cause sympathy with the public. Or, to begin with, it is strange that he seems to grow on you (and his followers!). I did not expect a lot when I rented it, but I was surprised by a good fighter with comedic beats. 7/10
