As a child I loved computer animation, although it was VERY limited, and the tools were almost absent. This film, when I watched with awesome images of amazing and almost hypnotic music, formed in me a desire to create moving objects in a computer. This is a whole agreement between music and video, in which there are really one or two hits. If you know a child who wants to participate in computer animation, it is MANDATORY. <br /> <br /> Almost 20 years later, I rate this film as one of my three favorites. Originality, I think, is still not surpassed by most modern McMovies, which Hollywood spits out. Currently, I want to see if I can do this on my own; if imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, then this film deserves a ton of imitation =)
