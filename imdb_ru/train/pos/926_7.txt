I don't know why some people criticize this show so much. <br /> <br /> This is a great, fun show - probably not the right material for the main prime time, but still ... <br /> <br /> Family dynamics are fun, and you’re generally the same see in most comedy shows. Auxiliary characters are absolutely funny. The plots of individual episodes and the frequent ridicule of Siegfried and Roy are slightly above average, but very often you have auxiliary stories or one-liners that make you laugh on the floor. <br /> <br /> This show cost £ 8, which I paid for. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
