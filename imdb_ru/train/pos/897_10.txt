What can I say, I grew up watching Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Pyar Kiya. Soraj has always been different. Films are part of our life in an era of evolution. Soraj creates something that is hard to find. I love and friendly family that love and great. Vivah is a journey for a couple who are arranging a wedding, which includes wedding and love. Shahid did a great job. Anupamji is gorgeous as always. Amrita Rao left differently, although I felt that she was not suitable for me in any other role. We saw her in Ishk Vishk and Ab Ke Baras, and Mein Ho Na Na. So leave another role that she does not count on. She was superb in Mine Ho Na Na and Ishk Vishk, but maybe she could add a little more in this role. In any case, a great job Baryat. This film rejuvenates the values ​​we forgot. Sweet film of the year. Great music and lyrics. I'm not sure if this is a remake, but in any case a brilliant story that is original. Soraj's films were great, so we always expect something different from him. Excellent work of all the actors and all. A wonderful family film to enjoy with parents, brothers and sisters, friends and loved ones. I give it 10 out of 10.
