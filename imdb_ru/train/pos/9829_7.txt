This film is awesome on many levels ... and none of them is the level at which he thought. <br /> <br /> Just remember this: when you watch Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movies ... they are good or bad ... this is the formula they use. This is what makes zombie movies so great. <br /> <br /> And what makes BETTER, not more beautiful, is the story of the film. A simple web search will give you everything you need to know. <br /> <br /> In general, it does not linger. There is never a point where you think to yourself “come on, come on with this” ... it moves quickly and nicely. This is a sporty little Italian zombie movie. <br /> <br /> So awful, that's great! If your tongue spends enough time in your cheek ... rent it, buy it, love it. <br /> <br /> Note: if you watch it on a DVD, you will notice that there are sound effects during the menu screen, under the score ... Well ... this is because the music was shot right from the trailer. .. which is probably the only working edition of this music, which is still long enough to loop.
