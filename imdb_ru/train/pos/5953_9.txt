I understand that Paramount wanted to make a film with Rogers and Hart points, but could not solve the copyright problems, so Burke and Van Heuzen, who wrote most of the songs for Bing Crosby between them, made a very good result. <Br /> <br /> I read Leonard Maltin, who said that this film "fits Crosby like a glove," and I would not say it better. No, this is not the satire of Mark Twain, this is the Bing Crosby film, and in 1949 Crosby was the most profitable star in Hollywood. This time Paramount used technicolor, and Rhonda Fleming was never more attractive on the screen. It was the woman for whom the technicol was invented. <br /> <br /> William Bendix’s Brooklyn lineage stands out somewhat, but it’s a good comic effect. The Crosby, Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwick trio have fun with Busy Doing Nothing. Bing has one of his patented optimistic philosophical numbers with "If you dampen your finger on the moon." <br /> <br /> He sings the third song “Once and For All” by himself and with Rhonda Fleming. This song was nominated for the best song, but lost to Baby It's Cold Outside. <br /> <br /> It is also nice that Bing managed to write down the score for Decca with Rhonda Fleming, Bendix and Hardwick. <br /> <br /> In this film I like the fact that Crosby’s comic talents without Bob Hope are shown in it. I like The Roads, but Bing himself was a comic talent, and this film shows it better than any other. <br /> <br /> This is Crosby on top of his game.
