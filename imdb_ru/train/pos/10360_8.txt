This is a documentary about the Lindy Chamberlain case and its impact on Australian society. Particular attention is paid to the problem of understatement, gossip and expectations when working with real dramas. <br /> <br /> One of the problems that history faces is that all people are expected to be equally emotional about these situations. Not everyone falls into a wild melodramatic tantrum before every serious crisis. Just because the characters in films and on television act in a certain way, there is no reason to expect that real people will do this. This is especially true for journalists and news editors, who seem to be looking for a big crying scene that will tighten the ratings. This is a problem that needs to be constantly addressed. <br /> <br /> The presenters play characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are skillfully supported by a large group of fact-based actors. Some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting actors in this story are people better known in Australia as comic actors. This confirms my idea that comic actors provide better support in dramas, because with the help of comedy they know how to create quick impressions about people. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning!) <br /> <br /> I have to say something very personal here; because Iâ€™m actually a former Adventist who was a practicing member in Australia at the time the incident occurred; so I have a slightly different impression of the story than most. I think this happens with amazing creativity, personality and emotional heart. I think that the best scene is the one where the pair are being pursued by new helicopters. It brilliantly reflected in the plot of the plot. <br /> <br /> I once heard Fred Shepsi say in an interview that he told the actors "to play the best possible for his character." Although this is particularly appropriate for this story, I think it is also a general principle that should apply to all actors.
