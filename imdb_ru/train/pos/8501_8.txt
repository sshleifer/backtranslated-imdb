I think this is a great example of the differences between the two cultures. It would be a great film to show in a sociology class. I thought it was pretty funny, and I must say that I am a sucker for “allowing the group to unite and do the work” as a plot device. It seems most people do not understand that this film is not just a comedy. It also has several dramatic elements, and I think they fit perfectly. Overall, I give him a solid 8.
