I was a fan of books from the third class, so, of course, I watched a movie, read the sequel, and then watched a television show. In itself, it was a good show, and now, as an adult, I still enjoy this show. My only real problem with this was that it did not follow the book. When I first saw it, I was so disappointed that I turned it off. But it comes from the girl who owns the first addition of the book. But after a while I decided to try again and ignored the book (sort of what you should do with the Harry Potter movies). I found the show wonderful! It was a clean cut and something that everyone could enjoy, just the right amount of comedy for everyone to work. This is really nice! Clean and wonderful!
