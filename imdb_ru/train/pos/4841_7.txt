In the colonies, we are not so familiar with Arthur Asuka, so I almost missed this film (which recently had a preview of TCM) because of the negative comments about his appearance in “Ghost Train” - which I expected to see completely annoying. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing out loud. The physical aspects of Aska’s comedy and his time at the line suggest that you get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen have a child. It cannot be compared with Bad Abbott or other regular comic book providers who appear in films of this genre. Moreover, one senses a thread connecting Asuka with a British comedy 30 years later; at least from the American point of view, it is clear that he has more in common with the Monty Python troupe than with any of his colleagues. As for the rest of the film - the more films you watch, the more likely you are to guess the final, but it is still quite interesting and atmospheric, and you should wait for its next appearance.
