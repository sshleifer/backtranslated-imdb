Lyn McAdam (James Stewart) wins the Winchester rifle in shooting competitions. Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) is a loser and steals a weapon. Lin takes his horse and follows the Dutchman, his men and a rifle with his friend. High Spade (Millard Mitchell). The gun falls into different hands on the way. Will he return to the right owner? Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and came up with this masterpiece, Winchester '73 (1950). Stewart is the right person to star. He was always the right person to do anything. Shelley Winters's awesome game is the role of Lola Manners, and she is great as ever. Dan Durya is awesome as Waco Johnny Dean. Charles Drake is great, like Lola's cowardly boyfriend Steve Miller. Also in the film are Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson performed by Will Jeer and Steve Darrell. Young Rock Hudson plays Young Bull, and young Anthony (Tony) Curtis plays Doan. There are a lot of classic moments in this movie. In one place the group is surrounded by Indians, as it is a western city. It's nice to watch this survival game in which the fastest box and the sharpest shooter won. All real western fans will love this movie.
