I really liked this movie. I am a single father with a 17-year-old daughter who is smart, athletic and talented. I WISH my girlfriend to use herself so well for solving crimes and helping others! So for me, maybe this is PG level Fantasyland. I read a lot of Nancy Drew books in my teenage years, a long time ago. Of course, this character was skillfully played by Emma Roberts, but did NOT resemble Nancy Drew, which I remember from books. This is due to the script, and not with the art of acting. <br /> <br /> Emma is a charming teenager, playing a confident, hardworking and proud character with good manners and good taste. She is not captured by fashionable competitiveness around her. There are some weaknesses in the plot, besides the fact that they are not like Nancy Drew from the Book and are trying to figure out what decade we are in. (For example, what is this CAR, anyway?) I read the IMDb review before watching the movie as I explored Rachel Lee Cook from other films. This is not one of her best roles, but I will continue to look for her other films. Rachel was too adult to play this role, but she does an excellent job with her work, being an adult orphan, who is central to this mystery. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the other reviews written here. Some expect a perfect connection with books, some expect more reliable situations or an action movie for adults. I got what I expected! Good entertainment is aimed at young teenage girls and their fathers who want good children with high standards of behavior and achievement. This is the movie "Teen PG", not James Bond! What would you like for a role model for your teenage daughter?
