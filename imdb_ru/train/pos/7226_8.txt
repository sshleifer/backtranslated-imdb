Somewhat typical moment of filmmaking of this era. Obviously, it was first conceived in the world for the stage, but, nevertheless, a very good film from start to finish. Peter O'Toole and Suzanne York arrange a stage performance for a silver screen, and both do it effectively. There are very few ways of the story, and anyone who is not familiar with this type of learning non-standard characters may be a little removed. In general, a good film in which Peter O'Toole and Suzanne York replay.
