When I was 8 years old, I always watched movies and television, which I should not have, and this was one of them. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and it should be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life, the acting is great, these days they no longer make comedies like that (movies which are actually funny and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or some other vomiting-causing body fluid, as in those backward films of Judd Apatov, in which unfamiliar non-actors, such as Seth Rogen and Barf, were shot. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic with actors who can really play and deserve all praise.
