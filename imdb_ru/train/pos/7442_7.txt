I rented a movie (I don't think it got a theatrical release here), expecting the worst. The preview made the movie look terrible. Actually, I was very surprised, it was worth seeing; it was loosely written, almost like a film ensemble. There were some very funny moments in it, and although the drawback is an effective satire on the show and the people on the show are not too picky. He is mistaken, mainly because of the awful soundtrack for the batons of “comedy” effects, but on the whole he looks fair and generally true for the form of the show in the Altman manner or in the style of Larry Sanders. At that moment, when it became fashionable to criticize Jerry Springer, he was also an easy target. Springer could have become Citizen Kane, and he would have been declared "the worst movie ever made." I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the show. A disadvantage, but innovative and interesting piece of the film.
