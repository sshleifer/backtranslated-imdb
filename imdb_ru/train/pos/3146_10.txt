If television were a baseball league, this show would have a great record! With a great cast and a perfect storyline, this show gave 8 amazing seasons and great joy after dinner on television. With the constant change in attitudes and finding out who Hydeâ€™s real father was, this show became a hit when it began in August 1998, although it was established in 1976. And hanging out in the basement of Formans was always something to do then, and it is still today, along with circles. This show gave a great laugh in the premieres, and it still does during reruns. If you watch several episodes of this show, you will get everything and you want to get more. Now only this show is one of the best ever created, it is clever and funny.
