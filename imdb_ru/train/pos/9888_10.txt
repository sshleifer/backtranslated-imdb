Although this beautiful work of art uses some cinematic vocabulary of surrealism, in reality it is nothing of the kind. This is a political and cultural allegory of the Mexican post-Colombian odyssey, as evidenced by even a passing glance at the history of Mexico. <br /> <br /> In contrast to “Like Water for Chocolate”, “Erendir” expects the viewer to meet with it at least halfway through, so that it requires a little work to understand it. (A good starting point is to see the grandmother as Spain: proud, alienated, sad and, above all, burdened by history.) <br /> <br /> The final actions of the heroine are unclear because the “result” of the story (that is, the present) is always unclear since we are too close to him for an honest evaluation. Failure to neatly tie loose ends is the only real choice available to the director, given the film's ambitions. <br /> <br /> Erendir is gorgeous. A big screen experience would be perfect if you can see it at your local art house or university. But if not, then VHS is better than not seeing it at all.
