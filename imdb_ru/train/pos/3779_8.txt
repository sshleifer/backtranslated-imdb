I got the first Bill and Ted movie for Christmas, and I needed to get the second one when I saw it in the store. This one was (I think) just as funny as the first, but much stranger story. It was funny how they had their own personal hell and how they had to play death. The funny thing is that they played it in silly little games, like clues. The only thing I would change was that Station and Death were in the band, but other than that it was great.
