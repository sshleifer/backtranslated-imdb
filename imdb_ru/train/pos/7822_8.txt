It's sad to watch this movie now, when we know how the ANC was influenced by international capitalism. Biko died for nothing. Woods has achieved little. Yes, direct apartheid was canceled, but the entire apparatus of power was reserved by white minorities, which left the ANC government more or less powerless. As Naomi Klein writes in “The Doctrine of Shock,” de Klerk’s government had a dual strategy in negotiations between black and white leadership. At first, relying on the ascending Washington consensus that there was no single way to manage the economy, it portrayed key sectors of economic decision-making — such as trade policy and the central bank — as “technical” or “administrative.” He then used a wide range of new policy instruments — international trade agreements, innovations in constitutional law and structural adjustment programs — to transfer control of these centers of power to allegedly impartial experts, economists and officials from the IMF, the World Bank, the GATT and the National Party — except to fighters for liberation from the ANC ". Statistical results are terrifying, with minor changes and prosperity of AIDS. Watching “Cry for Freedom” in this light is deeply ironic - in fact, tragic. ANC has evolved from a solution to a major problem.
