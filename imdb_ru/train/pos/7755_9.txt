“Written in the Wind” is an irresistible, surprisingly strange film, since only the director Sirk could do it. The film is immersed in a bucket full of Freudian characters, strange melodrama and colorful contrasts. The link between financial success and moral decay is the main theme of the film. Sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. Nevertheless, I prefer to watch the movie as a vivid example of what Sirk can do with kitsch material. The color palette is especially impressive. The acting in the film is also great. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance, but the film belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (she deservedly won the best supporting actress Oscar) who manage to keep the film at boiling point. The prestige of Frank Skinner’s score, Russell Metty’s brilliant cinematography (each image is a masterpiece in itself), as well as the production design department. Also the title melody is beauty. This is an unforgettable film.
