**A warning! Ahead soft spoilers! ** <br /> <br /> (Yes, I understand that it is difficult to spoil a historical documentary, but I reveal some background and methods.) <br /> <br /> This is an exceptional documentary film, not only because of its remarkable footage, but also because of the story behind it. Since Naudets did not intend to tell the story of 9/11, but rather talked about a fire novice, the emotions of men and the viewer’s connection with them are more real and strong than in standard retrospective. <br /> <br /> In terms of filmmaking, “9/11” is a textbook. If events were a real scenario, they would be great because the characters are set, and then cast a curve to which they should respond. This is all the more surprising given the pain and emotions of the raw cadres that directors had to go through to make up the story. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film gives an idea of ​​life inside the fire station; in particular, how a novice assimilates himself into a team of veterans. This piece is pretty good in itself, and if the documentary was allowed to follow the intended path, it would probably be reliable. The brothers seem to really depict the process of becoming a New York City firefighter. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, all hell breaks up. The chaos that followed the WTC attacks is clearly visible, as the various characters we learned fall into terrifying situations. Seeing not only attacks, but also first-hand reactions is a very touching picture of extreme human emotions. <br /> <br /> The consequences that lead to the discovery that firefighters were lost and found are human drama at its peak. Life and death hang in the balance. Unlike many films, the viewer not only does not know who will live and die, but also genuinely cares about them. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say about this is that Robert De Niro's notes (which I like) were uninformative, unnecessary and did not promote the story at all. They were probably added just to attract more viewers. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: the best documentary I've ever seen. Nonpareil images of gross human emotions and drama. 9.5 out of 10.
