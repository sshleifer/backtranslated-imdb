Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film, which is a traditional translation of gospel stories. The music is great, you really feel how the world of Jesus looked (I was there too), and June enthusiastically enters the role of Mary Magdalene. Cash narration is also good. <br /> <br /> But .... <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who played Jesus was wrong. 2. There is no limit to the story that Cash invests in his faith-based music. 3. Since it is not very impressive, I doubt that it will be widespread again. <br /> <br /> I would like to buy a CD. <br /> <br /> Tom Paine, Texas, USA
