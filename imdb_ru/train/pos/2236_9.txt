What I remember most about this film is that it was shown on local television KTLA (ch. 5) during each Christmas season from mid to late 70s, mainly because of the truth The story took place on or near Christmas Eve. It was always a bit disturbing to see hell go through this girl, being the only survivor of the plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. The graphic scene of this young girl pulling a leech from her infected leg made quite an impression on this young spectator. Not exactly the Christmas that I used to see at that time. Definitely not a Rankin-Bass production.
