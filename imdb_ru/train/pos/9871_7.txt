“Return to the Lost World” was filmed along with the 1992 version of the “Lost World”. <br /> <br /> In this continuation, the same five people led by the Challenger return to the plateau, where the group began drilling for oil, which threatens to destroy the land. Gomez is somehow related to this. They manage to defeat drillers, and the plateau is saved, much to the delight of the locals. <br /> <br /> As in The Lost World, the few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and include T-Rex and Ankylosaurus. <br /> <br /> John Rihs-Davies and David Warner again play the roles of Challenger and Summerly, and the other three actors also returned. <br /> <br /> Despite reading some bad reviews about this and these cheap rubber dinosaurs, I liked the return to the lost world. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
