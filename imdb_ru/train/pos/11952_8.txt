Scoop *** from **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director, but I liked "Match Point". It was a great dark romantic thriller, which, fortunately, was not filmed in Woody Allen. It really was a beautiful Scarlett Johansson. <br /> <br /> “Scoop” is the last Woody Allen film, and although it appears in it, everything is fine. This also shows Scarlett Johansson, and they both work beautifully together. <br /> <br /> Johansson plays Sondru Pransky, a young college journalist who gets the sensation of life from Joe Strombel’s ghost (Ian McShane) Joe heard a scoop on a boat with a grim reaper and a bunch of other souls that the Reaper had captured. One of those souls is Peter Lyman’s secretary (Hugh Jackman). She tells Joe that Peter may be a serial killer, roaming the streets of England. Joe returns to the living with a scoop of lifetime and transmits this information to Sondre during the magic act. Sondra on the magic show with Wizard Sid Waterman (Woody Allen). She becomes a volunteer to enter the disappearing box, and while she is in the box, she receives a visit from Joe. Not knowing what to do, she enlists the help of Sid Waterman to help her figure out the matter. <br /> <br /> This film has a pleasant, carefree feeling compared to Match Point, and yet everything works, Johansson and Allen work beautifully together. Allen's humor is perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is amazing, like Peter Layman, the "suspect" serial killer. <br /> <br /> This is a funny little movie to see if you ever looked for it to see. The acting ensemble works well together, and the story unfolds, and you sometimes forget that you are watching Woody Allen yourself. I say, give him a chance, because you might like it.
