This is a very complex film and it is almost impossible to understand what is happening. At first, this seems to be a rather pedestrian film about a guy (Trelkovsky) who needs an apartment and quite foolishly invites himself into it when the current tenant (woman) commits suicide. Then begin the turns. Are the neighbors trying to kill him? And why the clothes of the dead tenant appear in the apartment? It is interesting, finally, if Trelkovsky _is_ a previous tenant. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> One of the methods Polanski is drawing to us is lying to us. When we see things from the point of view of a character, we assume that we see things the way a character does, and that there may be distortions of reality. We assume that when the camera shows us things from its all-knowing point of view, we see the reality, but Polanski has a camera that lies to us.
