Seven young people go to the forest in search of a bear. Soon all of them are persecuted and viciously killed by a crazy Vietnam veteran. "Trampa Infernal" is a pretty interesting Mexican slasher that reminds me a lot of The Zero Boys. They are rapidly developing and there are several good death scenes, such as cutting the throat or an ax in the neck. Unfortunately, there is not much blood, so Gran Guignol fans will be disappointed. However, if you're a fan of slasher movies, take a look at this rarity. Mexican horror films are rather unclear (I have only seen Alucarda and Don't Panic), so this should be another reason to see this nice slasher. My rating: 7 out of 10. Highly recommended.
