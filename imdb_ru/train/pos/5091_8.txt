I watched both parts twice. She enjoyed the story and was glad that Patrick Swayze had become a hero. He was very believable as a hunter Alan Quartermain and certainly surpassed Richard Chamberlain's performance. I admit that I would prefer to see someone else as "Lady in Trouble." Alison Dudi must adhere to modern and non-historical works. She was not like a woman of the 1800s. The rest of the cast were awesome and followed the plot lines very well. I am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid that they will be seen as they grow up. Age is inevitable, but we will not hide from it. A man older than 50 can be much sexier (and Patrick is really sexy) than green, no matter how beautiful he is. Cheers for character lines to go along with a big smile.
