Blob is a classic science fiction film about B-movies from the 1950s. You probably know the story: two teenagers (Steve McQueen and Aneta Corso) see a meteorite falling to the ground, and when they go in search of him, they encounter an old man with some strange ... ball on his hand. They take him to the doctor's office, and then go to find out what happened. From there, a drop spreads, eating everyone in its path. Special effects - fun fun, like history. There are many excellent touches, for example, a policeman who plays chess on the radio with a policeman in another district. This is not a masterpiece, but it occupies a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.
