This is really a great unknown movie. Perfect dialogue without typical cliches. This film was based on the talent of the actor, and it was shot. There was even a small comedy in him, but he was not exaggerated. Once in life, this is what a crime drama should be, and not the typical special affects of garbage when adding sex. I especially liked the interracial aspects of all this. <br /> <br /> Now about the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburn was an excellent player in the petty offender. It is a pity that he is allowed to show his talent only in his own film. Titus Welliver was incredible as Fishburn's younger stepbrother. Imon Walker added a taste for already perfectly spicy films. Paul Calderon was flawless as a low-fat monkey / drug lord. I liked his game since the time of the “King of New York”. But the best part in this film came from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who ideally combined in the role of two minions of Calderon. <br /> <br /> Once in life, of course, the keeper. **** 1/2 * of *****.
