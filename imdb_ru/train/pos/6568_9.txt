I enjoyed this film as a child when it came out, to this day so far. A simple story related to finding a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally right from a paperback book. He has actors who were more recognizable in those times. This should not keep the viewer from moving. Star Wayne Crawford as the main character Jake Speed. Sure, it might bite on certain elements of the Romance Stone and Indiana Jones. But this film is made well enough to keep it out of the cellar. I'm surprised that not many people know about this. It must have been overshadowed by other movies in cinemas back in '86. I watched it then on cable TV. This can be hard to find, as it is not on VHS and DVD. I managed to get a DVD from Ebay for less than $ 8! Cool movie
