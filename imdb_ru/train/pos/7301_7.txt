When I heard about the release of "Hammerhead" on DVD and finally found it at my local DVD store, I thought, "Well, just another cheap movie about monsters from Nu Image". Over the past few months, these guys from Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner have produced cheap, but very entertaining B-Pictures, as well as some very disappointing films. So I didn’t expect much, especially after seeing the rather disappointing Shark Zone just a few days ago. But Hammerhead was a great rebirth of the monster films of the 1950s. We have a mad scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and girls in distress, plants-cannibals, and, of course, we have a creature, a great mix of mutants between a man and a hammerhead shark. Everything you need for an entertainment monster movie. The only thing missing is graphic sex scenes and naked bodies that you expect in films of this kind, but since the film is made for television, it’s understandable why these scenes are missing. And in any case, it does not matter, because Hammerhead is an action movie and horror at its best. However, there are two reasons why I gave him seven out of ten points: first, the monster is not very common, and an autopsy with the destruction of the creature is too fast and poorly done, and secondly, William Forsyth simply does not suit the guy for the heroes and for falling in love with the gorgeous Hunter Tylo. In addition, I highly recommend this movie to any monster fans. Take a cool drink and some popcorn, watch this movie and have some fun. Jasper P. Morgan
