The undoubted highlight of this film is the performance of Peter O'Toole. In turn, wildly comical and terribly terrible tragic. Does anyone do this better than O'Tool? I do not think so. What a wonderful face this man has! <br /> <br /> The story is strange, rather disturbing and emotionally rich in parts (especially towards the end), but it is also strangely touching and has been successful on many levels. Nevertheless, I felt that the film basically revolved around Peter O'Toole’s brilliant speech, and I’m sure that I wouldn’t have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn’t been in it.
