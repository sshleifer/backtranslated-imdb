Like the film and effective Confucian crime drama, the old order is experiencing the threat posed by a bold young greedy man, no doubt representing modern society. I thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we believed that big D was punished for being greedy, or it was part of the plan for a long time. I liked the scene, and this time in the Chinese film the violence was not a martial arts festival. What always surprises me in films about HK is that the British seem to have a major influence on the local language: “Yes, sir” and “Sorry”, and it’s funny that long after we left , they are still there.
