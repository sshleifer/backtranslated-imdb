Very wonderful movie. You fall into a death grip as soon as you allow yourself to plunge into history. A successful dentist, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), breaks into a life crisis, balancing his career with his family. He notices his former roommate at college Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) and wants to touch the base. He finds that Charlie, who lost his wife and family in the attack on America 9-11, is no longer tied to reality ... deciding to engage his mind with his favorite music from the past and video games. Former roommates inflame their friendship and strengthen their former connection. Johnson has a psychiatrist girlfriend, Angela Oakharts (Liv Tyler), who is trying to get Charlie out of her grief ... but it is Alan who manages to get his friend out of his deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. Writer and director Mike Binder plays the role of a lawyer / guardian Charlie. Also in the cast: Saffron Burroughs, Donald Sutherland, Adell Modell and Robert Klein. Outstanding soundtrack featuring Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I've never been a Sandler fan; but I found him outstanding in this role. In some scenes, I thought out loud ... why they never approached him to play singer / songwriter Bob Dylan in a biopic.
