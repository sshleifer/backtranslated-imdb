This film is awesome and I would recommend both children and adults. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is fascinating; much better than American studios ever produced. However, there are a few cautions in this statement. It's a shame that Disney bought the Studio Ghibli back catalog, and then proceeded to destroy it. My main point is that Disney renamed the movie, despite the fact that the original English version was very impressive. A new cast with Van Der Beek and others. Destroyed him and deprived much of the attractiveness of the characters, for example. Pazu and Sheeta turned from adventurous companions into tearful teenagers. The original music is also much better than the Disney remix. This begs the question, why did Disney make such changes? It seems to me that due to the fact that Van Der Beek and others will be played, Disney will be able to attract more money, which is fair, but in the process they spoiled the film. It is still a beautiful film, and I still recommend it to everyone. My main problem is that Disney ruined a movie from childhood that I loved and still love. I am lucky that I have the original Japanese import with the original English dub, which I am now going to protect my life!
