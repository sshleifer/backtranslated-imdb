Do not think that these films are just another children's film - the whole family can enjoy it. This is a strange combination of the film, as it seems that there is a film in it, but at least in the end it makes sense (unlike modern films!). It gives you all the elements of the film (a decent plot, good characters). - well, this is really the star of the Muppets, a list of younger celebrities * that films will demand) What is surprising is that this can be a "pile of emotions", a little sad, emotional, funny and serious - this is what they all make family film that everyone can watch together. <br /> <br /> * Celebrities in the film are in fact the main stars of the day, but there is only one real star of the movie, and no one dares to outshine Miss Piggy !!!!
