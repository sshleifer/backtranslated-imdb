This film was incredible. I would recommend it to anyone, much better than I expected. It was definitely a heartbreaking exciting movie. This is an amazing story with amazing actors and creators. Definitely another great movie with Denzel Washington. (shouldn't surprise anyone) Derek Luke also did a wonderful job.
