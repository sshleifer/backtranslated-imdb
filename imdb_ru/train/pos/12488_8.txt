I’m not really picky about horror movies, and I’m ready to watch almost any of them. This does not mean that I want to revise many of them or that I will not have criticism for them. This movie is creepy and very well made. In fact, I think this film could be a great double count from the 9th session. <br /> <br /> Before turning to the comments, I must clarify that I only watched this. I started watching it before bed and got about 15 minutes before I realized that it was too effective, so I left the rest for the morning. Even when viewing in broad daylight, it was still creepy. However, I cannot vouch for how effective this will be when viewed in a large group. <br /> <br /> After the death of their daughter, the couple moves to a remote cabin, trying to come to terms with this death. Let me mention this death - this is one of the rare films that does not shy away from the death of a child. This is much more important, as it sets the tone, and also explains most of the action that permeates the film. <br /> <br /> The couple is not all right. The wife has distanced herself from the relationship, and the husband does everything possible to get her back. While some comments complained about their actions - one indicated that they act more like a father and daughter than a husband and wife, and this is legal. He is trying to give her more directions. This role is sometimes played by men. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of panic in the film, and most of them are quite non-violent, albeit in a sense, grotesque. The story itself seems very simple for most of the film and takes a strange turn towards the end. Although the turn is not absurd, this, of course, is not what you expected from how the events developed. <br /> <br /> Sad, atmospheric and very well done for what seems to have been videotaped.
