What an amazing pleasure to meet on the late television. If I had just read the plot summary in the television list before watching the movie, I would have passed. The idea of ​​the film about how a hired killer sees how he wants to leave the business and falls in love ... sounds trite. But the film works. From the very beginning of the film, it is clear that the person carries the weight on his shoulders before he even says the word. The appearance of the film is perfect. Dark, but not disgusting. <br /> <br /> In addition to the family aspect of an assassin who creates a sense of surrealism, Macy’s character fights with his marriage and father’s control. Macy demonstrates a depressed sadness, and his bedtime conversations with his young son are amazing. The boy demonstrates his acting skills much longer than his years, and the interaction between father and son is very natural, personal and loving. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best films I have seen lately. And I can't believe that I accidentally stumbled upon it on TV late at night.
