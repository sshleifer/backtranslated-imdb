I must have seen this a dozen times over the years. I was about fifteen years old when I first saw him in black and white at the local PBS station. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD for kids and get them to watch it. They do not teach history in school, and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century. This expands their critical thinking. <br /> <br /> Impartially, participants from all sides explain in their own words what they did and why, it describes in detail what led to war and real war. <br /> <br /> Buy it for your children, along with Alistair Cook's America. Look with them, and make them understand. You will be so glad you did.
