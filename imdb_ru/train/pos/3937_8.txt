Abe Lincoln's early career is beautifully represented by Ford. It’s not that anyone saw the live shots with a real Lincoln, but Fonda, wearing a fake nose, is supernatural, like Lincoln, with voice, delivery, walking and other manners - just as Lincoln could have imagined. Ford is at the top of his form in the first of three consecutive films made by him with Fonda, perfectly reminding America of the beginning of the 19th century. The story focuses on a pair of murder defendants that Lincoln defends, and the scenes in the courtroom are pretty well done. Auxiliary staff includes many loyal customers Ford. This was Alice Brady’s last film since she died a few months after it was released.
