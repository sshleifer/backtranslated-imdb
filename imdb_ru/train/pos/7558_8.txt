This episode from the first season is slightly bent towards contradictions with the entire angle of the bend of the floor. I think there would have been a significant amount of editing before it was completed to appease the censors. <br /> <br /> The story itself is original, well-written and the direction is complemented by a beautiful game. (Nicholas Lee makes her debut in The X-Files, though not as an agent Krycek, but as a victim named Michael). br /> This is different but enjoyable. Do not pay attention to the bad reviews that you can hear.
