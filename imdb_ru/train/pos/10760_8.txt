"9/11", organized by Robert De Niro, presents footage outside and inside the Twin Towers in New York on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> Never too scary and terrible, but powerful and exciting. "9/11" is a real pleasure. Anyone whom this television show has not touched, is not immune from anything. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
