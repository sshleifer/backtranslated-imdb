Surprisingly good movie! There are a lot of good jokes around the movie. The only negative is that some scenes go to the extreme to show how stupid the two main characters are. We get it, stupid blondes, keep it up! <br /> <br /> The plot hardly shies away from what is called "banal." And boobs are always a plus, although for some strange reason the film does not play with this card too much, even though the storyline represents two black-haired women who act like the wicked opposite of our two blondes. <br /> /> In general, a good movie to watch. I almost gave 8/10, but let's not go crazy.
