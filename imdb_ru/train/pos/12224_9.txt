I watched the whole movie last night and I found it very exciting. At least, not like the films of a teenage slasher that appear from time to time. The search for the killer and the relationship of the "partner" between the hero and I liked the so-called bad guys in the film. In addition, I remember once I was on the edge of my place during a certain scene in a film. I mean, this is exciting. Maybe after a while I could watch the movie again. ..
