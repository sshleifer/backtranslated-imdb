Surprisingly, but not terribly and well animated for one of the Disney films, shot directly on video. As in the previous sequel (The Lion King 2), I was glad that Disney returned most of the original actors to voice, which is important, and they have maintained a good level of traditional animation. The plot wanders for a while, but we are distracted by an endless series of jokes from funny to boring. To break up the storyline and the jokes, they gave us some silly musical episodes that, like the jokes, range from entertaining to a quick trip to the fridge. For the most part, MST3K-like moments are soft and full of untapped potential and do not really add anything special to the film, except to act as a vehicle for hourly memory. New characters, at least, are cute, and old characters do their thing, so I can't blame them there. In general, this film is not bad, and it makes a good frivolous filler between the more serious Lion King titles.
