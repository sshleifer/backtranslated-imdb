I saw this film in the theater when it first came out a few years ago, and I really liked it. But I still wanted to see him again this year to make sure that he is still good compared to the films that are coming out now, and I want to say that this is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life !!! !!!!!! !!!! <br /> <br /> What you need to know is that you don’t need to miss a single minute of this film, if you don’t fully follow the action, you will be lost and you will not understand the end. <br /> <br /> The end is what makes this film so good you cannot expect. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the producer!
