This Dolph Lundgren car is a fun movie with a hard return, it wonâ€™t receive any awards and is not very original, but it delivers the products you would like to see in the movie Dolph Lundgren. Our man Delph is a former soldier who is now a teacher in a tough high school in the city, and when the terrorists take possession of him, he will save the day. I am sure that the script will not win a single Oscar, this is good entertainment, and it has its share of eloquent action. Dolph Lundgren gives a pretty good performance, but he comes to life in battle scenes more, and the rest of the actors are not the best actors, but they hold up well. In general, detention is a pleasant fighter, but you have already seen it a million times.
