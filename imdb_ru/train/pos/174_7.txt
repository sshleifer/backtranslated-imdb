Sunny, a cocktail waitress in the District of Columbia, to put it mildly, is a little dull. She drives an old nail and removes a tiny room from a gay couple. However, she saves the life of an eminent Arab by taking a bullet in the back meant for an official. She charms the national press with her insane remarks and cute looks. Sniffing such an opportunity, presidential aides set it in the protocol department of the US government. Even then, she sometimes spoils everything, but she tries and learns a lot. She even captures the romantic attention of a State Department official. But is there another sinister conspiracy involving an Arab man who wants to take another wife? Blonde? Lol lol lol In this film, Goldie is as beautiful as a picture, and as silly as a fox, as they say. Sunny is a very, very good at studying the jungle of the US government. She even has important things to say about honesty and her absence in her protocol environment. Perhaps the Arab community would be less excited about this job, but for those who like to laugh, rent it today.
