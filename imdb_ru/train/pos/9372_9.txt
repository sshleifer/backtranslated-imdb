Red Rock West is one of those rare films that makes you constantly guess what comes next. Nicolas Cage is mistaken for a contract killer when he enters a small town, trying to find work. Dennis Hopper is a bad guy and nobody plays them better. Look at a short performance by country star singer Dwight Joacam. In most cases, this is a serious drama, but there are lighter moments. It is important that you enjoy this low-budget but high-quality project!
