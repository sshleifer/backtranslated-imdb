Man about the house - this is the real situation of comedy in every sense of the word. The comedy concerns a character named Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O'Sullivan), who finds himself after a wild party that ends up in the house of two ladies named Joe and Chrissy. Ironically, the party took place to say goodbye to its old neighbor. The obvious eventually happens when he approaches. <br /> <br /> The man near the house was a preliminary cursor for the showing of the film “George and Mildred” by Cook and Mortimer, in which 2 characters participated, who were landowners for Joe, Chrissy and Robin. These two characters would actually be the foothold of a person in the house in which Mildred (the late and very bored Yuta Joyce), in particular, received some of the best lines in the series. The semi-regular character was Larry (Doug Fisher), a useless man who was always on horseback and came to his senses only when he wanted to borrow something (and never returned). <br /> <br /> American made this version, called the company of three, but it has no chance compared to this much more ridiculous original. Thames took the risk of making a comedy about a man living in a flat with two women at a very conservative time, but they should be worried because the ratings of the time suggest that about 20 million people just wanted to see a good old-fashioned comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script. What a miserable modern comedy that cannot reach such a high level. <br /> <br /> This program is available on network DVD.
