This is the best Chinese film I have ever seen, and, in my opinion, it is much better than “Hero” or “Charming Tiger”, “Hidden Dragon”. The film is a unique combination of several genres: a beautiful love story, an action movie, a comedy and horrors at the same time. And the most amazing thing is that he really excelled in all this! <br /> <br /> This film is definitely among the top five and should be enjoyed by every movie lover. There are traditional unreal jumps and even flights in the action sequences, but the shooting method is very different from the Hero style, and the flight always looks great and usually even makes sense (ghosts can fly) <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, you will not regret about it. 10/10
