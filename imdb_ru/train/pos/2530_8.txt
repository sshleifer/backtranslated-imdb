One of the joys associated with the recent Bela Lugosi collection is watching amazing films such as Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi came together in a film that delves into meteorites and radiation, and although science is completely absurd (especially the camera technique Karloff uses, like Janos Ruch, to determine the location of a certain meteorite) and, ridiculously did not care about renting, the film is totally enjoyable. The effects are well done at the time, the acting is great and the final is especially strong. It reminds me of science fiction comic books and novels of the 1940s and 50s, full of a ray-rifle and ridiculous science. You should watch this movie!
