There are movies, and there are movies. Movies are more often than just a cinematic "sweetie", and movies are real works of art. Fraulein Doktor is definitely good at last. Like most viewers, I was very impressed with the battle scenes, but the sharpness of the image of the main character is what I consider the purest quality of the film. Having done everything possible to serve his country as the true daughter of Germany, all the while in the throes of morphine addiction, the German high command, despite all her efforts, is very cruel to the German command. The scene in which Doctors are transported in the back seat of a Mercedes-Benz team car, lonely, deserted and sobbing, is perhaps one of the saddest, but at the same time truthful, images of spy life. Only the emotional pain presented by Richard Burton in "The Spy Who Came from the Cold" comes close. “Fraulein Doktor” is a much deeper film than can be imagined when viewed in the singular. I would just like his producers to find it worthwhile to release it on DVD so that those who have never experienced it can, and those who have seen it again, can (perhaps again and again) enjoy this exceptional film.
