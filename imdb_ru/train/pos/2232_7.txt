I saw it when I was 17 years old and have not seen since. The Late CBS Film used to show it regularly. I remember how sad and distressing it was, I really felt bad with the stomach. The effects then were not the same as they are today, but, nevertheless, they conveyed a feeling of loneliness in Amazon, after losing both parents and finding a way out, very well. Most of all I remember the beetles and larvae, so realistic they were when they ate her meat. This is a dark film that was a controversial subject at the time, although it was probably heavily edited for television. I wish I had more details to remember, and if I ever get the opportunity to see it again, I can comment more. I've been looking for this for years. I believe this could have been shown on CBS under another name. I have no idea if he has ever been released on video.
