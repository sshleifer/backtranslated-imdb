There is an inexhaustible hunger for films of "basic training," so it is surprising that this film received so little attention when it was first released. Most likely, there will be a deserved second life on DVD / VHS. <br /> <br /> Tigerland is not always equally good, there are some horribly battered characters (especially the image of sergeants, forcing you to return Ermi to 'Full Metal Jacket'), but Colin Farrellâ€™s leading appearances are an instant glory thing. Charisma to burn and the role that any actor would kill to get.
