In this issue of the series, Edmund Blackadder was stuck during the Regency period in Great Britain (during the later part of the reign of George III). This time, Blackadderâ€™s chances are much worse - because instead of royalty, he is a servant of very, very fat George IV (price agent). Unlike the historical descriptions of George IV, this example is about as bright as a tomato, and as a result, Blackadder can use it to his advantage and plan his soul. The only significant difference in style between this and the earlier ones is that the series ends on a very, very, very different note - you just have to see it to believe it. In addition, all the usual elements of the story is, and the show is fun. The only thing I booked (as always) is that this show is not suitable for children because of its rude language and situations for adults.
