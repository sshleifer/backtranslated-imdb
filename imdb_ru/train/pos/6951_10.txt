I have never been a big fan of television until I watched 24 for the first time. I got to the show very late. The fifth season ended before I saw my first episode. It was episode of episode 3, which was on the box with my DVR (digital video recorder) of my parents when I was sitting at home on the weekend. I needed one episode to become a trap and plunge into the world of Jack Bauer. And the boy was, I got hooked !! I watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited monthly ticket for twenty and a half dollars, and, of course, it was the biggest money for a blockbuster that I had ever spent. I watched the first three seasons for three weeks. This is 72 forty minute episodes !!! I’ll say that finding out what’s next is easier on a DVD than waiting a whole week. I can only imagine the anticipation of viewing the season 6 week after week !! I find it a bit painful and cruel, but I'm going to try and watch it, like the rest of America! The DVR is installed, and you can bet that I will twitter!
