Radiofrehcheniya is a film about all of us, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessive ideas, our passions, our fears. This is a brilliant film in which a group of friends, like all of us, is experiencing the difficulties associated with growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades of the last century. In the film, there is no joyful or sad approach to things, it just tells us a story that we all could survive. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and grief. The strength of this story is that we love the characters, this is one of those films that you will watch again and again, feeling closer to the small town in Emilia-Romagna where it happens. I hope that someday I can finally walk through its streets near Freccia and his friends, listening to music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio, playing Radio Raptus International, playing their dreams, our dreams. Radiofrehcheniya make you laugh, sometimes make you cry, shake and comfort you, give and take you. Personally, I believe that this has played an important role in my life and the lives of my friends, and I invite all of you to look and let it become part of yours.
