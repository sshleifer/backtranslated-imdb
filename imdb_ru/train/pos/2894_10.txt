As a little boy, I always hated Cinderella, since my two sisters gave me a voice when my parents thought which Disney movie to buy. I wanted Dumbo, but my sisters won, and we got Cinderella. They really liked the movie while I was sulked in the back of the room, playing with my Star Wars figures. <br /> <br /> Much has changed since then. My love for Disney theme parks led me to an internship at Walt Disney World, and now I have two young nieces. I like to show Disney to them as much as I can, and we recently watched Cinderella together. With my new appreciation for everything that is Disney, I watched Cinderella from a new point of view and was impressed by what I saw. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning of the film, however, I did not quite understand why Cinderella fell into such a terrible situation. Why was she such a slave to her foster family, and why could she not just escape? I didnâ€™t like Cinderella too much, but as the story progressed, I plunged into the story. Maybe I was attracted by attractive animation or funny characters, or maybe it was eternal songs. Listening to songs like "Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo" and "A Dream is the desire that your heart does" as if it brought me back to theme parks. I can imagine myself in this carefree and fun atmosphere, looking at the awe-inspiring Cinderella castle. <br /> <br /> Something in this film just triggers Disney magic. This may make many people laugh, but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like Cinderella who are happy to be in this fantasy world, and you will understand what I'm talking about. Images of Cinderella and glass slippers, as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and Tinkerbell - the epitome of why Disney is one of the most beloved companies in the world. <br /> <br /> Although Cinderella may not be the strongest story, it is a kind of landmark in the history of Disney and film. He represents the funny, idealistic and fantasy miracle that we held as a child. I think this film has a lot of sense for many, many people. This may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it reflects everything I love and admire the company. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating is 10/10. My Yahoo! Rating: A (Outstanding)
