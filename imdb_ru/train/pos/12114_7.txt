This film is clearly low-budget and filmed in British Columbia, Canada. The obstacles that had to be overcome to make this film compelling (installed in California and in the late 60s-80s) were well thought out. I believe that this is the best and most accurate version of the killings of the Zodiac, which pursued the city of Vallejo and the Bay area from 1968-19? (he was never caught). Edward James Olmos (det. Dave Toski) and George Dzundza (Zodiac - at the time considered by Arthur Lee Allen, as he is cleared by DNA and fingerprints), play cat and mouse, revisiting crime scenes together, each of which tries another has an emotional revelation. Olmos, dying of some kind of incurable disease and knowing that Dzundza did it, is still completely obsessed with the idea of ​​losing his family and becoming a complete alcoholic along the way. Junduza is completely forgetful and completely absorbed (like all serial killers) by the bloodshed left after him. The only disappointment is the ending "from above", otherwise it’s pretty accurate. If you are tired of the typical Hollywood fluff or are interested in the work of the Zodiac. Check it out.
