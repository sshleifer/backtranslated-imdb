I will not claim to be a Ralph Bakshi fan because I am not. So far, I've only watched 5 of his animated films: Coonskin, Wizards, Fritz the Cat and The Lord of the Rings, and finally Fire and Ice. What I can say is that “Fire and Ice” I think is the most pleasant of all. This is a straightforward fantastic story about swords and witchcraft modeled after Conan the Barbarian, but the beautiful artwork, realistic animation, and live filming actually give this film a very classic charm. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that the first mention is the animation itself. I don't care what people say about rotoscopy, but in my opinion, Ralph Bakshi used this technique very effectively here. I was amazed at how realistic the movements of the characters were. The style of directing and photo-realistic character design made Fire and Ice look more like a great budget blockbuster than a cartoon. Unfortunately, the level of artistic detail becomes a bit controversial, especially towards the end of the film. Some scenes look very flat, with almost no body contour details or cloth folds and shadows on the characters. <br /> <br /> With realistic moving characters, naturally, realistic actions will follow. Not only was the action well delivered, but it was really cruel. I would be so brave as to compare the cruelty of an action with live action films such as the Zack Snyder 300. However, I noticed that, despite the shedding of blood, blood splashes were minimized. Again, an excellent choice for a creative team, which only enhances the viewing experience, not perceiving things too "over the head." <br /> <br /> Although I do not recognize any "big names" in the cast, the voice of the actors can achieve a satisfactory performance; keeping the delivery of each line realistically depressed and only suppressing it in the case of the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Did I say bad guys ?? Yes I did. Because this is exactly what the standard is about, against the evil story. Nothing really original in this story, which seems to be just a mixture of pre-existing clichés of fantasy films in which poorly dressed warriors and virgins participate. Anyone who seeks "depth" will be greatly disappointed. Characters do not get much development, and some of them, such as Nekron and Darkwolf, are at best one-dimensional (however, I heard a rumor about some remote scenes that explain Darkwolf’s obsession with killing Necron and his mother. Such scenes deserve full restoration and should have been included in the final version to add the level of depth of the show). In fact, I won’t be surprised if I find out that the whole film was just a “technological demonstration” demonstrating amazing animation and art, with a story put together and added as an afterthought to give it off as a real “film”. <br /> <br /> “Fire and Ice” - a real classic of a bygone era - truly captures the burning spirit of adventure and mysticism thanks to its beautiful images of fantastic creatures and charming characters. This is a unique vision of the world created by Ralph Bakshi and the artist Frank Frazetta, with a good measure of action and expectation. <br /> <br /> Will it meet modern animation standards? Definitely not. But I urge fans of the animation as a whole to “get off the horse” and give this simple, but beautiful film a chance to climb you. This is really the pearl of the 80s, worth seeing.
