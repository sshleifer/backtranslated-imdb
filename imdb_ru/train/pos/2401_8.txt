Kibbee guy gives the viewer a lot of laughter. Like most candidates, he knows almost nothing. Warren William, a very underrated actor, gives Kibby excellent instructions; that is, he teaches him to say something that means nothing to the voting public. A campaign without comment: “I’ll take this note” and “Maybe yes, but on the other hand, maybe not” - this is almost the perfect way to win an election. In short, the dumber the candidate, the greater his chances of winning. After all, the public can identify with such a person. As for the film, it makes a lot of comedy.
