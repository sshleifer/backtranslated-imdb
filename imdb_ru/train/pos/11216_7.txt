This story is extremely unique. We are talking about these two pilots, saving the Earth from alien beings, but they have to use a special speed, which causes everything around to age quickly. The whole series is about pilots involved in the loss of time, friends and mentors. <br /> <br /> The final CAN be fantastic. It began with a full note and left a real mark, but instead ended on a super happy Disney note and annoyed me VERY badly. <br /> The animation is decent for 89, but cannot compare with today's 2, where there was an excess. <br /> <br /> In general, this deserves attention, but the ending does not allow it to be a classic.
