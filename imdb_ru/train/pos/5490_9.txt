This is really an incredible movie. He not only documents the eternal struggle of the indigenous and disenfranchised people to get their legitimate voice, but also shows that the United States supports their dishonesty, ploy and blatant disregard for human rights and self-determination. Chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader, fighting against what can only be described as a contemptible elite, devoid of a sense of proportion or justice. These filmmakers recorded a coup, unlike all that was before. <br /> <br /> And in the cross, we see the United States, again pulling the strings and erasing all sensations of reality. It is very sad to observe the initial stages of the uprising, knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we are seeing is a tool that has been used for a long time by successive American governments and their seemingly stupid citizens. The footage clearly shows that this is not a manipulation of television or ordinary personnel, but the active documentation of the people and their government fighting for their future. A truly touching experience for all who have a conscience. These Irish directors deserve our thanks. Long live Chavez. <br /> <br /> We need to consolidate the idea that every country should be allowed to choose its government and develop as the majority believes. The first stage of this process is the need to find out what the realities of the situation are, and this documentary copes with this task perfectly.
