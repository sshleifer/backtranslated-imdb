This film is a journey in the head of a screenwriter, fascinated by his own paradoxical philosophy. He considers the ghostly question of “who am I” and “who am I?” This is a bold and thought-provoking enterprise. There are many beautiful images inspired by dreams, like Escher's paradoxes, reminiscent of the hand drawing itself, or rather erasing itself. More and more we follow the writer in his agony for what to say and what to shoot, we see him calling his wife, who left for Peru, leaving him to take care of her child, and he performs less and less attention so immersed in his dilemma that he hardly looks at the child. His wife returns and arranges the scene, destroys his records and helps him overcome the last threshold, until he destroys himself. This story, which is mostly interspersed with pleasing to the eye and destructive images, is of a philosophical nature. This is about the veils of Maya, the world of illusions. The paradox of the film, however, is that you need to talk a lot and think in order to prove that thinking should stop. For more than two hours of provocative beauty and quick philosophical thought, the film made me dream of silence or a short film. If this was the creator's goal, he succeeded quite well.
