This film is one of those nostalgic things with me, and I never REALLY expect anyone else to “get it”, but I am pleased when I recommend it and someone likes it. My late father hated Arthur Asuka, but this film was one that he really liked, and his constant enthusiasm for The Ghost Train and Olmes Old Ted passed on to me as a child. Years later, I watch it from time to time, enjoying the acquaintance. I always wonder if this will be completely wrong, but I never give up on it. There is something to enjoy. The train sequence is truly inspired when Asuka and Murdoch continue to annoy the arrogant male passenger. Then the whole station at the station is simply amazing, so you need to keep up with the times. Yes, he’s dated and full of British wartime in accents and plot (based on Arnold Ridley’s original play about father’s glory!), But full of wonderful characters - including Kathleen Harrison as Dotti Spinster. The atmosphere is really as ominous as possible for Arthur Askey's car. It's available cheap, like chips in the UK on DVD, so treat yourself. This is the perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or any lazy day for fun. I thank you .... <br /> <br /> OLD FILMS CAN BE GOOD FILMS!
