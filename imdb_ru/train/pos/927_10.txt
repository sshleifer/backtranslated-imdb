“Father of Pride” was another one of those good shows that, unfortunately, do not live very long. And it's rather sad, especially considering that almost all the time the worst shows are still on the air (think in “Simple Life”). I admit that this show and the Simpsons have a lot in common, but despite the similarities, the show has its merits. The animation is just adequate, not incredible, but good. The best characters. All animals are very pleasant and funny, and even Siegfried and Roy had their moments. The music was good, I liked many songs. <br /> <br /> Even if the show is not very original, I think it had a lot of potential. Like the Mission Hill show, which is not very famous, but I really liked it, it didn’t have the appreciation it deserved. What a disgrace.
