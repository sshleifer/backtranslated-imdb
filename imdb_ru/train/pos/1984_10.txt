One of the best musicals, created out of time, which is worth seeing again and again. Delicious! The game, especially Ron Moody as Fagin, is great. The costumes are elegant .... even shabby. <br /> <br /> Two young guys who play Oliver and Sly Dodger are amazingly talented. Oliver Reid did an excellent job portraying Bill Sykes where you can't help, but hoping that he will come to a terrible end ... which he does. <br /> <br /> The dance is skillfully staged and mesmerizing. Oliver can stay away from such as "My Fair Lady", "The Sound of Music", "Oklahoma", etc. Film for the whole family.
