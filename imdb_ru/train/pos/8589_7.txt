Honestly, I finally checked this film not because of the stars - although they were quite watchable and convincing, especially with three heroes - or even with a convincing history of violations in the secret service of the president (something, I Were informed about this there is no addition to the DVD, but this has not happened yet. Assuming that this is true, this is wonderful!). I received it because it was directed and has a cameo of choice by none other than detective Meldrick Lewis !! Well, okay, Clark Johnson, one of my favorites from Murder: Living Outside and a veteran (mostly) television director. I would say that he is doing everything he can with the same success as the project, which can be observed, but rather average, despite all the possibilities. <br /> <br /> Veteran and ace Secret Agent Pete Harrison (Michael Douglas) must find out, and who blackmails him And who killed his friend, aimed and blew up an Air Force-1 helicopter and shoots a prez. (David Rush. Does anyone remember the Sledgehammer?). His love affair with the first lady (Kim Basinger, obviously one of the first, hottest ladies we ever had, fictional or real) certainly does not help his position. He should look for a real mole in the service and avoid beagle dogs, how to hunt his former best friend, colleague and chef (Kiefer Sutherland, almost still fully in the "24" mode). Add some other key agents of the Service (Martina Donovan and Fox, which are quite difficult to buy as a concert of Eva Longoria) and shady foreign characters, and you will have a fairly standard political thriller that does not set goals, achieve the desired, and achieve the desired not happy with the results. <br /> <br /> Summary line on how best to describe how this show goes without spoilers. The additions to the DVDs seemed more insightful and interesting to me than the film, although the film itself was interesting enough to interest most (including me).
