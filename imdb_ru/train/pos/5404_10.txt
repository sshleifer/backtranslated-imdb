Anyone who says that a pokemon is stupid can die. This film is excellent. I even cried when Celebay died. I do not cry a lot! This film is a touching animated thriller. <br /> <br /> In this fourth installment of Pokemon, Ash and his friends must prevent an evil dash from turning Celebay into a perfect evil weapon with his dark ball. Over time, Sam and Selebay travel through time and constantly hunt hunters. I like the role in the double battle, and Sam has a poker ball with an apricot (if you played pokemon gold, silver or crystal, you know what it is.) <br /> <br /> I also liked that There is the main miramaks instead of the Warner brothers. Putting a mini-movie at the end was a great idea. Pokemon in this film comes to life more than ever.
