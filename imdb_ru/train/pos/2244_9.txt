The only explanation for why this film is not widely spread is that it is shown too close to home. This film was a real happy surprise, the satire is brilliant. This film turns on the light in the dark, which is organized by religion and the big media, and cockroaches flee behind cover. Rent a DVD and watch it yourself, if you havenâ€™t done so yet, this film will be successful when many people fail (Dogma comes to mind) put their nose under a tent, using both humor and very clever analogies in combination with specifying backgrounds and locations , I can not comment in detail, without revealing some significant spoilers, there are some surprises in this film that even long-time film fans will be caught off guard.
