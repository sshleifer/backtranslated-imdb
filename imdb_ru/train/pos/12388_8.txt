I read the book, and I must say that this film remains true to form. I think this is the beginning of psychological thrillers in the same genre of psycho. Cristina Raines plays an excellent leadership role, and Burgess Meredith plays an excellent acting role in the role of the nearest neighbor. I have seen this film at least twice, and I think I will buy both a book and a film for my collection. The wait just keeps growing until the climatic end, a turn that you will never see. If you like movies such as Signs and Village, Guardian will be a classic prelude. In addition, what is interesting is the actors in the film - you would not have recognized them if you had not read the titles. The late Jerry Orbach is great as a commercial director, and Jeff Goldblum is great as a photographer. There is also Beverly D'Angelo, which is undervalued but gorgeous.
