A number of factors allow me to say that I still believe that this is the most important sci-fi film ever made, despite some acting, outdated dialogues, and so on. <br /> <br /> Firstly , there is a scale of imagination describing Krell, a humanoid race, originally from the planet, now all are dead, who were 1 million years older than the people of Earth (we), and their technology, especially a machine of 8000 cubic miles. <br /> <br Secondly, there are music and sound effects that are inseparable from each other. He creates an eerie, unearthly feeling, unlike “2001,” in which traditional classical music sounded. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, his “monster” is not only the most powerful and deadly, but also based on real science. and does not violate the laws of physics and biology. <br /> <br /> Finally, and most importantly, the Forbidden Planet is the only film ever made of films that tries and, even more incredibly, makes honest, clever and ruthless. Logical statement about limits or ceiling of development human (or any other biological object), no matter how long we survive as a species. <br /> <br /> In other words, it predicts our inevitable fate.
