I watch Cold Case because of real life events. This one was very close to me and deeply touched me, so beautiful, thank you, Merideth. All characters are well developed in 3D, especially Coop. It is still difficult to approach the material, the United States lags far behind the developed countries of the world. only this kind of honest actual empirical image and treatment affects the population. Of course, not everyone sees things the same way, but I am glad that 3/4 of the men surveyed in the group under 30 years old voted the same way as I did. place for this episode. Please continue to take risks and accept my heartfelt thanks.
