A great film that shows how people are connected with self-evident ordinary beads that are exchanged during Mardi Gras. The film is much more than a comment on globalization. In fact, it humanizes the workers in China, the factory owner, the bead distributor in New Orleans, and even the revelers in New Orleans. What stands out most is the directorâ€™s ability to tell complex stories with complex details in such a simple and seductive way. His amazing access to the factory is another aspect that intrigues, and I would just like to know how it got inside. This is a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it, and this conclusion gives hope, not leaving people to feel alienated.
