I was really looking forward to seeing this film, as it was advertised as a must-see film for people who love nature films. The film shows the different climatic conditions and animals associated with them, starting from the North Pole and going down to the south as the film progresses. The shots from this film are often amazingly beautiful, and I was surprised many times how on earth they could take some pictures under water or in the sky. No matter how beautiful she was, I already saw most of the footage in the TV series "Planet Earth", filmed by David Attenborough. I discovered that Attenborough’s story about Planet Earth is much better than the story of Earth. “Earth” is a lighter movie. He misses most of the scientific details that Attenborough covers in his Planet Earth series. For example, the Earth will tell you that the tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale because there are few predators. Planet Earth will tell you that the tropical sea is a good children's room, because there is little oxygen in the water, and there are not enough nutrients in it to contain very large animals, such as large sharks, etc. For me, this is an important difference. This, together with Atanborough’s far superior voice, makes Planet Earth a much better documentary than Earth. Nevertheless, I think that the Earth is worth seeing beautiful shots, and the fact that it is easier to understand makes it interesting for children.
