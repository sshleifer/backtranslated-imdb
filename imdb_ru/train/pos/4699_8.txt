It did for crime what “Not Another Teen Movie” did for school. I laughed all the way until 2 inept gangs fought with each other and among themselves. Indecent comedy using blatant jokes and jokes that made me ride all the way. I believe that the biggest problem in the whole film was that time never seemed to go ahead, leaving the characters trapped in the 30s.
