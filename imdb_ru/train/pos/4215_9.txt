In this excellent Twentieth Century Fox film, the metropolis is a maze of despair in which scavengers and predators survive by living with each other. Pensive cityscapes descend over little humanity in grim expressionist symbolism. <br /> <br /> A purse was torn from a prostitute in the metro. It contains microfilm, and the communist spy ring will go to great lengths to restore it. Two parallel investigations are unfolding when both spies and policemen track down valuable information. <br /> <br /> Pocket in the pocket of antihero Skip McCoy plays with the disparaging confidence of Richard Widmark. He knows that the cops are his moral peers and intellectual subordinates, so he scoffs at them: “Go on,” he says to captain Dan Tiger (Mourwin Wai), “toss the charge. Hand over me. You have done this before. ” ". In this ruthless world, police are just another gang on the streets. Just as Candy, a hooker, is captivated by Lightning Louis, in order to get guidance, the police are busy with toll pigeons for information. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to believe that when Widmark made this film, he was already at an early middle age. , The 39-year-old star, ending his contract with Fox, plays Skip McCoy's upstart with the disrespectful boldness of a teenager. Today, for a romantic hero, it may be unacceptable to pierce his love interest in an unconscious state, and then revive her by splashing beer on her face, but judging by those periods, this meant steadiness - and Candy, after all, is a fallen woman. br /> <br /> Gene Peters shines like Candy. Here, right in the middle of her five-year surge of B-movie glory, she is as beautiful and attractive as a whore with a heart of gold. She is a victim of history, a martyr of her beauty, like everything else. She means well, but she is constantly manipulated by cynical people - Joey, Skip and the police. <br /> <br /> The real star of this film is New York. Phantom urban panoramas and subway stations for snipers offer a claustrophobic incarnation of the city as a living, evil force. Like rotting cheese larvae, human figures scurried along city roads. Elevators, metro turnstiles, sidewalks - even a stupid waiter serve as guides to the flow of corrupt humanity. People cling to any niche that provides security: Moe removes a filthy filthy room, Skips his gloomy shack on the Hudson River. When characters move and interact, they are framed by a bridge architecture or lattice girders or are separated by hanging winches. The identity of the city is constantly being imposed. The corners and crossbars of the moorage of the berth reflect the layout of Griridon Street, and the filing cabinets in the compartment imitate the skyline of Manhattan. When Joey’s exit from the subway is forbidden, it’s as if he is surrounded by the steel tendons of a city. <br /> <br /> The amazing part of this film is a close-up shot. The character controls the plot, as it should be, and close-ups are used to strengthen the character. When Skip interrogates Candy, close-up captures the sexual energy between them, refuting the hostility of Skip's words. The beauty of Jean Peters is colored in the light, in refined soft foci close-ups. The device is also used to increase the voltage. The opening sequence, the wallet, does not contain any dialogue: the drama fully relies on its powerful effect. <br /> <br /> Sniffing and hanging over the levers inhabit the film. Mo (Thelma Ritter) makes a living as an informant, and her place in the hierarchy is accepted even by its victims. When Skip remarks: “She must eat,” he repeats the repeated refrain. In the same way as "direct" New Yorkers sell lamb or wood, supposedly they trade information from the underworld. <br /> <br /> Yet even the stool pigeons are superior to Joey and his communist friends. Joey's feet on Mo’s bed symbolize a violation of the most basic moral code. Joey goes beyond Mo won't trade with Joey, even to save her life: "... even in our dirty business you have to draw a line somewhere." <br /> <br /> The pickup was made in the depths of the Cold War. Richard Nixon was just chosen as a Republican vice presidential candidate, making his name his strange demonstration of Algeria Hiss - a fictitious communist microfilm and all that. Shaw McCarthy was a daily reality. In the film, we see police officers against "traitors who gave Stalin an atomic bomb." <br /> <br /> New York can be seen as a giant vessel in which human by-products are cheating, squealing and killing. Containers are the leitmotif of the film. Moe carries his trademark necktie box, and a candy wallet, a microfilm container, is a conspiracy mover. Skip keeps his only property in a flooded box, symbolizing his secretive street wisdom. The coffins of the poor, going down the Hudson on a barge, are containers with another cargo moving through the ruthless megalopolis. <br /> <br /> The film is a masterpiece of composition. Candy is shown above a hidden pass on the shacky walkway of the shack, which indicates her moral superiority. When the gun is put on the table, the extreme perspective makes it look more than Candy - violence begins to oppress compassion. The lovers are eclipsed by the shadow of the stevedore's hook, reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute, but depends on the whims of the sinister city. Around the communist - a shadow on the wall or a bodiless rush of cigarette smoke. He looks like a lonely alley among the debris - a predatory ghost of the night. Shooting from the cameras from under the hood of a taxi, inside the newsstands and through the bars of hospital beds, we are constantly reinforced by the understanding that we all are trapped in the megalopolis. We are a mulch of civilization.
