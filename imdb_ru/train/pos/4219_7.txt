In fact, Abigail is convinced that he killed her, and it looked like a tragic accident. <br /> <br /> Knowing that there is no evidence that Edmund was arrested for the death of Phyllis, and decided to take the law into his own hands, Abigail prepares this complex plan to make him and make him look like the death of Phyllis, the tragic an accident. Having forced Edmund to secretly come to her mansion to give him a combination to her safe when she is about to go on vacation to New York, Abigail forces him to go inside, locking the frightened and surprised Edmund. With a safe In this mansion, no one heard the butler's maid and personal secretary of Abigail Veronica Marietta Hartley hear him scream for help, and the next day, Edmund is strangled to death. Veronica discovered the body of Edmund when she was going to remove Abigail's last mysterious manuscript for preservation. <br /> <br /> Lt. Colombo, Peter Falk, is called on Edmund Garvin’s strange death case to determine if this is a murder or a tragic accident. Passing through Edmund’s apartment, Colombo is puzzled to learn that he doesn’t have a single photograph of his late wife, who has been missing for just a month! This is due to the fact that Abigail has always experienced him in Edmund, who does not like Phyllis and is suspected of her, according to Abigail, murder. <br /> <br /> Colombo, a big fan of Abigail’s wife of romance about the mysterious murders, hardly understands that she’s actually responsible for the death of Edmund. All evidence points to Abigil, including a pair of missing car keys that was Edmunds. All this proved that Abgail was actually in the house, and not on the way to the airport, when Edmund was locked up in a safe. <br /> <br /> Studying all the evidence, Columbo arrives with this strange conclusion that Edmund must have left some evidence in the safe in writing to the person who is his killer. This conclusion is quickly checked when it turns out that Edmund had neither a pen, nor a pencil, nor a light, when a safe light bulb burned on it to write it. There is also something very strange that is inside the safe that has been in Lieutenant Colombo’s head since he came to work. This is due to the remnants of black paint that were found under the nails of the dead Edmund and on his buckle! <br /> <br /> Evidence that in combination with a number of other items in the safe proved that in the end the murder of Edmund hung over the cunning and very cunning mystical writer Abigail Mitchell. Edmund allowed Abigail to unwittingly unmask himself in his last attempt, as the air in the safe exhausted his breath to use the burned matches to write the last manuscript of Abigail that killed him: Abigail Mitchell!
