“Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey” is one of those wonderful old pet movies. Deserves place among the great films of its genre, and even the cinematic world in general, along with other films about animals, such as "Old Yeller", "Napoleon", "Fluke" and "Air Bad". This means that it is more than just a pet film. <br /> <br /> Could this just be a "remake"? This is too good to be a remake! I know it by heart from an early age (when I was 12). <br /> <br /> This is a family movie to keep. It is emotional, exciting, adventurous, exciting, interesting, humorous, charming, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, warming and sometimes dramatic. This is one of those films that brings a smile to the faces of those who appreciate films of this kind. <br /> <br /> This film lacks quality. It has a well thought out story, nice characters, an excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack, dazzling landscapes / landscapes of the magnificent Sierra Mountains (in Oregon). Speaking of perspectives, these are not all mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets ... in conclusion, all the wonders of pure nature are truly a complete panorama. <br /> <br /> The main human characters are good, well developed and well depicted by the respective actors. Robert Hayes is great like good dad Bob Siver. Kim Greyst is as good as Laura Burnford. Veronica Lauren is equally as good as Hope. Kevin Chevalia is the ordinary, youngest and cutest brother of Jamie (his appearance reminds me very much of Kevin Corcoran in Old Yeller). Benj Tall is great as Peter Burnford. <br /> <br /> When it comes to our four-legged friends, Shadow is my favorite. Shadow is a loyal, wise, mature, beautiful, caring and loving old golden retriever (brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche). Chance, the American Bulldog, is the opposite of Shadow. He is carefree, stupid, impatient, excited, clumsy, cheerful and loves to play (voiced by the talented Michael J. Fox). Chance just can't stand still. Sassy - the embodiment of the image of cats: elegant, independent, very confident and proud, with a typical attitude to the cat, but with a certain cat's charm. Sassy is the Himalayan cat Seal Point, one of the most beautiful breeds of cats. Sassy is voiced by Sally Field, who also does a good job. <br /> <br /> Our four-legged friends are great “actors” by themselves: Ben as Shadow, Rattler as Chance, and Tiki as Sassy. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated film, but a classic in itself. Its continuation is clearly inferior. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be in the top 250.
