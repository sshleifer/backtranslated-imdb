As I understand it, after the Chinese seized Hong Kong, the infamous cat. 3 Hong Kong movies are kind of gone. At least so far, and what an amazing movie it is. I knew that it was a rough crime drama, but I was the first cat. 3 I purchased, it was done recently, I was not sure what to expect. <br /> <br /> A Cambodian killer travels to Hong Kong to kill the judgeâ€™s wife, who is also a lawyer. All this is known for the first ten minutes, so nothing is distributed. After the strike, the police quickly find the killer, but when they try to arrest him, several policemen and civilians are killed. He eludes the police, and now the race begins to catch the guy before he escapes back to Cambodia. This is a film that never stops and hardly gives the viewer a chance to take a breath. Yes, it is very cruel and intense, many policemen are killed, because the hired killer is very very difficult to track down and kill when they find him. On the way, the assassin, trying to hide in a landfill, found that some man had raped and abused women. He helps her and rescues her from a boyfriend, and she convinces the assassin to take her with him to her escape. I liked this movie, it looks like a roller coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed, because one incident leads to another, and the police are at times just as bad or worse as the hired killer. The acting is exceptionally good, and on-site shooting and photography are amazing. There is nothing wrong with this film, even with a very unbelievable ending. The end is largely unbelievable, and also the appropriate end to all action and violence. Yes, violence is sometimes cruel, but it is a very meaningless crime drama that will knock out your socks. "Dog Eat Dog" definitely needs a wider release, including the release of R1. Great movie, highly recommended.
