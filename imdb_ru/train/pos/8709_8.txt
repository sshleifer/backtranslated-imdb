I recently (May 2008) discovered that this favorite childhood movie was available as a DVD. Although I have seen a lot of high quality films since then (at the end of the 70s (I was 10 in 1978)), this episode of three episodes with a low budget is still strong. <br /> <br /> What is funny is that now I watched it with my 10-year-old daughter, and she is experiencing the same thing that I remember from that time: terrible music (she had to keep me hand, although she was raised with watching LotR and Resident Evil), to ever change theories about who was really the culprit, and also to complain about theatrical voices of the era before Norway discovered the difference between acting and cinema. <br /> <br /> This is the one and only good sci-fi film (or series) ever made in Norway. And it is still worth seeing.
