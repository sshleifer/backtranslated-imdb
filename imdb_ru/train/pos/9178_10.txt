I really have to say that it was always my favorite when I went to my grandmother. And it still is. This is very, very close to the book. So it is removed, and the players are just fine! I have to recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it. Almost everyone I talk to hates television films, but it was really great! I gave it a 10/10.
