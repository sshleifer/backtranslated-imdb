First of all, let me say that Before Sunrise, like all movies, is NOT a movie for every taste. It seems that some people are not so smart as to admit this fact, but it is wonderful to contemplate the kind of dislike that this little harmless film causes in some people. For me, as for most people here, before Sunrise instilled a deep response in me, I was truly stunned, touched, inspired by it. This is a movie that ultimately benefits from multiple views. It creates some of the most amazing unforgettable feelings and emotions that you can imagine. It is impossible to imagine this world without thinking about the inspirational feelings that I received from it. <br /> <br /> The film is a conversation between two fragile souls who begin to recognize each other. This is very reasonable and inspiring, not so much in how one conversation is necessarily related to another, not in the meaning of the discussions of Jesse and Celine, but rather in small nuances, in completely distinct answers that they cause each other. It reflects an honest, romantic, but fleeting human emotion that begins to bloom in a wonderfully elevated Viennese environment; this convinces us that their fleeting relationship can be the greatest compliment in the world. And what happens after this night is open to discussion, but I never doubt that they will no longer be with each other. <br /> <br /> Light comments by RockytheBear and the user below are hopeless examples of dissenting doctrinaires who do not want to accept and respect those who love this film. <br /> <br /> Look it up and it can change your lifestyle.
