Begins between Edgar Pou and a journalist ... Poe counts on the fact that a man cannot spend the whole night in a terrible castle. Well, of course, he can, but he will come out unscathed? It's hard to say with all these strange people who shouldn't be around, including the icy Barbara Steele. This is a rather strange film, because the presentation is in French and English and switches back and forth several times. Perhaps this was done because the bits of the dialogue were lost? It is also quite dark and claustrophobic, because behind the small circle of light that candles generate and the like, there is little to be seen, plus a sense of horror and impending doom almost always. This version (in Synapse) was also not censored, and I was wondering what could have been censored in the film from 1964, until I saw the topless scene, I think it could be. In general, it is pretty good in gloomy black and white. Barbara Steele is definitely making the film too. 8 out of 10.
