When I was a kid, I loved both the Bill and Ted films. Last night, Bogus Journey was turned on, and since at least 5 years have passed since I last saw him, I decided to tune in to him. And I AM AGAIN AGAIN! This film is still funny after all these years. “Excellent adventure” is better, but it’s the same thing. Of course, some performances are a bit silly, but, hey, this whole movie is awesome. In addition, the film depicts the coolest personality of Death! Conclusion: totally like a non fake movie dude! The path is great! STATION !!!
