Gene Rowlands plays an actress who loses control of reality when she witnesses the death of her fan. She is increasingly mistaken from reality, and as a result her emotional turmoil intrudes into her work as an actress. In the sense that it violates all the rules of acting and improvises everything, but still manages to attract its audience, which makes the film interesting (although slightly self-sufficient) as a parallel to Cassavettâ€™s own struggle as a director. There are so many ideas around, and as a result, they become a bit confusing (I'm still thinking about the relationship between a dead fan and Rowlands, among many other things), but how they are presented in their most raw form makes them always interesting and thought-provoking film. It would be great to double count with Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
