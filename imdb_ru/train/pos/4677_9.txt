I understand that this film is a debut film, and therefore it is impressive. He has the sensation and rhythm of “real indie”, but director Todd Yellin clearly has a photographic and editorial vision, command and judgment of a mature and experienced professional. Frames are well decorated and thought out and serve to advance the story. He and screenwriter Ivan Solomon tell a story that is much deeper and more lyrical than typical “draw in numbers” scenarios. This is a story that needs Judd Hirsch talent to be able to work. Judd is fantastic as usual; like Scott Cohen and the lovely Susan Floyd. The real surprise is Elliot Court, who plays Adam Grodin Yellin was able to extract a nuance from a young actor in a role that could easily be discounted by stereotype or overstrain. Anyway, I found the film refreshing and interesting.
