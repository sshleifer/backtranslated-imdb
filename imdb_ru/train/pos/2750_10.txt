This is a movie that the US does not do. That is why people make foreign films. This is a great story about how one person, even if he is retarded, can make a person find the cause in an empty life. Everyone can learn from Georges. It also shows how people with mental disorders suffer in their lives, and shows them very realistically (I think). Like its classics in foreign films, this film has a bittersweet ending, but that only makes it a better film.
