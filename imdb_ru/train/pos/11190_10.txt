One of the best (if not the best) show of Stephen King. Dark as dark, awesome non-Hollywood finale, terrifying atmosphere, amazing book adaptation, outstanding cast, educational (don't play with the afterlife), in short - everything that should be a great horror ... <br /> <br / > My favorite horror movie, right 10+.
