One reviewer notes that it does not seem to matter what Wells actually says or does, he moves you. I agree. He was and remains a unique force in the movie. More than a triple threat that could act, write, and direct, he had a genius uniquely suited to the cinema. You might think he would have been an artist at an earlier age. This film certainly reinforces this impression. A musician, theater actor, heir to Shakespeare? It is hard to say, but I am very grateful that his time was filmed, and he filmed it. I like the accent. I like the face, size, style, mind and games. I love all his films and I would like them to be more. I especially like the way other actors interact with him in the film. Many have never been better, or at least somehow different with him, because he was firmly there. Even towards the end, when his beauty was destroyed, perhaps by his own intention, it was impossible to ignore him, and he did every scene he was in. Rita was a gorgeous blonde - Lana Turner looked alike, but perhaps even prettier, and even then Eyes rush at Wells, and one wants another minute, another movie, one more hour in his company. That is why we all want us to come across the lost notes cut from his films, because we know that we all know that thereâ€™s no part in it that is not worthy of our time. Watch this and be grateful for the chance.
