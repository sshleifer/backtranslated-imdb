I watched it several times, because I thought it was some kind of silly, juicy, outdated romantic comedy. Well, this is a romantic comedy, and perhaps a bit dated. Nevertheless, he is not too sentimental, he touches on the topics of office politics, adultery and loneliness. You think you know exactly what everything is headed for, but there is an element of unpredictability that supports your interest, and not everything works the way you expected. But enough of intelligence and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. If you meet someone who does not like this film, seriously consider how well you want to know him.
