"The Grudge" is a remake of Shimizu's own series of popular Japanese horror films. Shimizu knows that he is not dealing with something new, so he does what any intelligent person would do in his place: he forgets logic and concentrates on giving the audience a fun trip. He uses well-known clich√©s related to ghost stories, but Shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative manner. Nonlinear narration is not just a trick, but an interesting way to present sequences from different points of view. In the end, all I can say is that if the only purpose of a horror film is to scare the audience (just like a comedy is to make people laugh), this film was a success. I watched it in the theater with the audience, and it was fun to watch the audience going crazy about it. It probably does not play so well in your living room.
