Probably the best Jackie Chan movie in the 1980s, and the one that put it at stake. The extent of this independent police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes, during which the squatter village and the shopping center are destroyed. Obviously, there are differences between the original Chinese and the duplicated English versions, and many jokes cannot penetrate the latter. The latter also interfere with the stars, which have nothing to do with their Chinese originals. In fact, the only thing that corrected the dubbing was a lawsuit at a time when lawsuits in colonial Hong Kong were conducted in English, while in the original this scene was in Cantonese! <br /> <br /> However, Chan’s martial arts style and martial arts choreography bring humor wherever possible, so the Cantonese audience isn’t much bored. After all, it is not a dialogue that makes Chan a click, but an action and painful results. It is easy to follow this story: Chan plays an incorruptible Hong Kong detective who pursues the godfather of gangsters (Cho Yun) and is assigned to protect a star witness (Bridget Lin). The action is excellent from start to finish, and there is not much time between them to breathe. It will never make you think, but what an interesting and well-bound film. Perhaps this is one of the best martial arts movies.
