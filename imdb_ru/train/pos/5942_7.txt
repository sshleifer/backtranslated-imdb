I really liked BATMAN: DEAD END, I thought it was a theatrical character, and it gives Colloret a chance to make a good film. This trailer did not make the same impression on me. The storyline, or the potential storyline, was pretty good, but because of the action and the special effects, I had the feeling that it would make a good television movie or television show. <br /> <br /> Firstly, Michael O'Hearn isn’t good Superman. I really thought that he, in his brief appearance, made a decent Clark Kent. Sorry, I just don’t think of SuperMan as a buff. Kent's costume was disguised as his size. Batman may have a bodybuilder body, but not Superman. Supes is configured without a doubt, but not in bulk. Anyway, I didn’t care what he posed for, and his transformation from Kent to Superman seemed lousy. Now, perhaps, it’s not just O'Hirn’s fault, Collora might have to take on some of the merit due to poor scripting and referral. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the special effects for flying were just crazy. Superman flies through the sky. It was obvious that this Superman had flown close to the ground, and above it were visible telephone cables and buildings. I don't think there were any full shots of Superman's body. Obviously, the harness supporting O'Hirna and rigging should have been located on its lower torso. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a good trailer. I probably would have paid for watching the film if it were filmed, and I would surely catch it on TV. The storyline, the alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman, jealous of the loyalty of Lois to Wayne, Lex and Twoface, joining together to defeat Superman, and combining forces between Batman and Superman are a good example. I'm sure, with a big budget and approval for the full movie of Collor and the company, even O'Hearn could deliver a decent film. Of course, better than most comics that have recently appeared in Hollywood.
