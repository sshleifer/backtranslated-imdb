This film is not great, but it is good and pleasant. It looks like an indie movie made from a game script. Morgan Freeman basically plays himself, although the director swears that the script was not written for him. And there is a slight irony of the actor who goes to the supermarket to explore the film, which he has not yet dedicated. I mean, he actually shot the film, and we watch it :) <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue too positive for my taste, but, nevertheless, refreshing. This is a film that inspires the viewer to look at their lives and choose the direction in which to go. Too much emphasis on appearance, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: a cute little film made in two weeks, with two actors and several additions, driven by dialogue, makes Morgan Freeman look good :)
