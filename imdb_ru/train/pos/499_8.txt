The pilot of the Enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the days of the original Star Trek: a dose of realistic, flawed personalities. The next-generation utopian characters were tired, they were so noble that they seemed incredible. I also like the subplot that people are bitter towards Vulcans. It's funny to see them as pretentious snobs. It makes me look forward to having people become the dominant race between the two, although I don’t think it will work within the time frame of the show. The only negatives that jumped out at me were the “quick turn-off at 2 o'clock”, which is commonplace for many of the track shows. The second was a shameless search for ratings of a couple of meaningless sex scenes. It was inappropriate, a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own, not trying to stick a skin to a preschool audience. But my job is not to make the show profitable, but oh well. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the next episode goes.
