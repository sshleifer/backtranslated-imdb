I waited until July 4th to write this because. , , Well . because it feels good this day. <br /> <br /> In 1924, D.V. Griffith needed to strike, he did not have a big blow since “Orphan of the Storm” (1921). Since then, he has worked steadily, but his films were smaller and could not win the audience. He was planning a movie about Patrick Henry when members of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) contacted him, who asked if he could expand his ideas to embrace more of the American revolution. This film is the result. By the time he finished, he had a 14-drum history lesson, and there was no Patrick Henry anywhere. <br /> <br /> We all know the history of the War of Independence, but Griffith has added a love story with Patriot farmer Nathan (Neil Hamilton) falls in love with Tory Nancy Montague (Carol Dempster, leading Lady Griffith for many years). Complicating matters is that Nancy's father hates Nathan. Well, not only Nathan, he hates all rebels. This does not help when, during a skirmish on the streets of Lexington, someone pushes Nathan by the hand, forcing him to unload the gun and accidentally injure his father Nancy! <br /> <br /> A love story repetition is (mostly true, but partially embellished, the story of Captain Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore), a British renegade officer who believes that no one should be faithful to him. Thousands of Indians make up the Six Nations, he hopes to crush the colonialists and become the monarch of his own empire. <br /> <br /> Comparison with the BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) is inevitable. while Nathan could be part of the Stoneme family new. The sequence of the battle at Bunker Hill is very similar to the scene in “BIRTH OF NATION” with the attacking army, in this case with the Redcoats, storming a trench filled with patriots. The only thing missing is that Henry Walthall runs across Undead the ground to shove a flag in the barrel of a gun. Surprisingly, the scenes of battles in America seem to lack the energy of the scenes of battles in BIRTH and cannot attract an audience. Something is clearly not enough. This is not a sphere, G.V. The filming work of Billy Bitzer is pretty good. Maybe what is missing? I dare say that. sincerity? <br /> <br /> The brutality of Captain Butler and his men is well underlined, although much of this happens in the background or behind-the-scenes. Do not expect any heads to be cut close-up, as we saw in INTOLERANCE (1916). In one of the scenes, Captain Hare (Louis Wolham), the second in Butler’s team, knocks out the eyes of a captive colonist. We see only the beginning of the case, otherwise the camera focuses on Hare’s face, as he obviously has a good time. Lionel has worked with Griffith since 1912. The story says that he turned to Griffith for work, and D. W., knowing the reputation of his famous family, said: "I don’t hire stage actors." to which Lionel replied: "And I am nothing of the kind, sir!" He is doing a very good and quite believable villain. Louis Volhim appeared with his elder brother Lionel John three times; in SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR. Jekyll and mr. HYDE (both 1920) and later in TEMPERAM (1927). As Captain Hare, his wild, keen eyes and wild hair not only mark him as a villain, but also make him think that he is insane too. <br /> <br /> Neil Hamilton later remarked that America was his first horse ride and I was scared to death. "Although he hides his displeasure very well, and we can believe that he was quite a horseman by that time when the shooting was over. Mr. Griffith loved Carol Dempster very much and once asked her to marry him. She refused and soon left his company, after which her star status gradually decreased. <br /> <br /> Speaking of horses, one random funny moment that should have been unfinished drank while describing Paul Revere's ride. He rides his horse right on the front porch of the family to declare: "To arms! Regular approaching!" earth! I'm amazed that Griffith did not take another double. <br /> <br /> So America is a classic? YES! Don't wait for July 4 to see it, it's nice any time.
