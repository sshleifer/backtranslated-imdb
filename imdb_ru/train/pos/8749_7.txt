I liked the film, but, as everyone said, there were some moments that were underdeveloped. I personally thought that the girls were very stupid before they were in prison; Of course, they were supposed to be innocent American girls, but still ... I felt that they lacked the bond that best friends should have. For example, when mounted, where they inspect the sights, the way they held each other in the photo was very awkward. <br /> <br /> Then there are some details that were very ambiguous. I think it’s pretty much understood that the character of the Danes didn’t do that, but I can see how this could be confusing. Also, why did the camera stop at Manate with a grim look on his face after he put the bags in the trunk of their taxi? I thought it suggested something, but nothing happened. <br /> <br /> Also, the movie was great. I cried when Claire Danes took the blame; she is a great actress. <br /> <br /> Also, I wanted to see how this Thai prisoner bitch gets a blow on the ass. Talk about no closing ...
