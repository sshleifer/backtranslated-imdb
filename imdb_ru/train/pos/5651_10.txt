It was a bit strange and angry, and I really liked it, the characters in the series were also great and complemented each other well. I wished it had broken. I would really like to see where it could go. You found yourself leaning towards Lucas Baku, the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone. Lucas was frightening and alluring. And I would like to know more about him and how his character became. I, however, would buy the show just for fun, it was great for something else on TV. And Paige Turrko, who was Caleb's cousin, was a big mystery as to where and what she meant to Lucas. It is a pity that it is not there so far ... or it has never been completed, I would love to see what would have happened.
