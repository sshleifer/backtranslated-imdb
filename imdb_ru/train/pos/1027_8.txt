I’m not very good at writing reviews, so I’ll just give my opinion ... <br /> <br /> At first I liked this show. Adventure, action, comedy, drama ... I thought it was all brilliant. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I loved them all. It seemed that Davis was the fifth most important person in the cast. Not so important. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of the seventh season, and the character of Anderson (Colonel O'Neill) moved from the field to the office, the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff. I don’t know if it was because Hammond was more important than what I understood, or what, but for some reason after the seventh season, the series turned into ****. <br /> <br /> The first seven seasons, although they were amazing. The Stargate movie seemed mediocre the first time I saw it, but it turned out, even if it was not the original plan, a brilliant installation for the series. I recommend first watching the movie, and then watching the first season of the series, and then watching the movie again (trust me, the second time you really appreciate it), and then watch the rest of the series. <br /> <br /> The last three seasons of the series are not as good as the first seven, but this does not mean that they are bad. It simply means that they are disappointed if you are spoiled for the first seven seasons. <br /> <br /> After you have completed this series, be sure to watch the Stargate: Atlantis series. This is a worthy successor to this brilliant series. <br /> <br /> EDIT 7-18-08: I just found out that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. This is a big loss.
