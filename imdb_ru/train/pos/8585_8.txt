An exciting, exciting story about a captured defector of the US Army, who must prove his innocence in order to avoid the executioner. Paul Riker shies away from a friendly fire in a seemingly doomed attempt to convince the military court that he really was an American spy on a secret mission in Korea. <br /> <br /> In the spirit of the classic dramas in the courtroom, “Sergeant Riker” is an extremely well-crafted secret, skillfully managed by an outstanding cast, the constant impulse of director Kulik and effective plot twists. <br /> <br /> This film was originally shot as a television film in 1964, and then expanded for this revision with the presence of many "named" actors and some action sequences. Dillman, repeating his role, unconditionally plays the role of a doubting attorney, whose attention sometimes distracts the personal situation of Riker's supportive, but somewhat distant wife, which Vera Miles played with aplomb. Peter Graves completes the front line for the prosecution and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in key support roles. <br /> <br /> Marvin’s interpretation of Paul Riker's character is a balanced image of a simple but devoted person, whose usual back behavior is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he is located. Marvin shifts perfectly from indifferent indifference to passionate determination, giving convincing, often intense ideas that are a highlight of this otherwise small-scale drama. It is this presentation that should raise the film to the platform, where it occupies a place in the best list of drama court sessions. <br /> <br /> However, despite the apparent vagueness, “Sergeant Riker” is still tense and compelling exam, like a book that you simply can not postpone. Highly recommended.
