This movie was absolutely brilliant !! Each performance in this film is excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. Looks like Mr. Gyllenhaal will have a HUGE movie career if this happens. I thought that Joe Johnston was a strange choice as a director, as he is usually associated with large budget blockbusters (Jumanji, dear, I cut the children). He pulls every scene with a clean class. My favorite scene was when Homer went down the shaft and looked at the sky, going down, like all his dreams, it was beautiful. Joe Johnston should direct more of these brilliant, acting films, as well as his Big Budget blockbuster, which is also excellent. KUDOS !! all involved in this masterpiece!
