The Beaver Trilogy is without a doubt one of the most exciting films ever made. I was fortunate enough to catch this with the Q & A session with director Trent Harris at the New York Video Festival a few years ago, and then bought a copy from the Trent website. This film MUST be seen to be believed! I sincerely recommend looking for Trent's name on the Internet and then buying a movie from his website. He is an incredibly good guy to boot. Do not get confused: the operator in the fictional sections of the trilogy "Beaver" - this is not Trent! <br /> <br /> After I looked at the trilogy several times, I have to admit that I could probably do without the Shaun Penn version. It’s like a trial version of Crispin Glover’s Orkly Kid section, and it’s more interesting as a curiosity if you are a Penn fan than a good video. Penn is pretty funny though, and you can see the creations of a big star in this gorgeous black and white video. <br /> <br /> This is probably also one of Crispin Glover’s best roles, and I just wanted to see an updated documentary about the original Groovin 'Gary. When you watch this movie, you will never get Gary’s nervous laugh out of his head.
