Fantastic movie. One to excite all 5 senses. This is not a true historical record, and not all information should be taken as factual information. Real Hollywood agreements such as The List and VERY attractive actors are used as “heroes,” such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's mistress), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's right arm) , and unattractive (sorry, Jeffrey Rush) actors play in drunken and corrupt Victorian police forces. It also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to seduce all romantics, and women are especially sensitive. Even from the first scene, when Ned saves a fat young man from drowning, and his dad calls him "sunshine" and he has "a gleam in his eyes, when he looks down at me with his hand on my shoulder," this is very romantic and convincing The audience is on the side of Ned Kelly, the loser. Besides, don't all Australians love wimps?
