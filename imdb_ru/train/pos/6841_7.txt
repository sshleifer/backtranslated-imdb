This is probably one of the most famous films of Brian De Palma, but he is not the best. Body Double, The Fury and Carrie are the best films, but this film is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is heavily influenced by Hitchcock, and this film is the film Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a bored housewife who thinks about the novel, and after her psychiatrist, played by Michael Kane, rejects the offer, Dickinson meets a man in an art gallery and she sleeps with him. After this point, it's best not to know what is happening, but the murder is happening, and Nancy Allen is a call girl who looks at the killer. Dennis Franz is a detective in a case that really doesn't trust Allen, and she herself has to find the killer. This is a pretty good movie, but not one of the best.
