Pretty soulful little movie and not only for children. John Ottep, as always, is magnificent (without a hint of him of Inspector Morse). The boy who plays William also did a good job, although I did not find him convincing in every scene. I really liked the feeling of a small village and the slower pace of life at that time. I also felt scenes in London where historically accurate, as far as I can tell. <br /> <br /> This strongly reminded me of a Scandinavian film that I saw a couple of years ago called My Mother. In this film, during the Second World War, the boy was evacuated from Finland to Sweden. The wife of his host family asked the girl because (as it turned out) she lost her daughter. Buying a boy, she completely ignores him. The fact that the boy speaks Finnish complicates the situation even more. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes "Good night, Mr. Tom."
