I saw the perfect son about three times. I don’t see how this movie is a gay movie, I’m not even gay, but I don’t see it as a gay movie. This is a movie with a gay character, I don’t understand why every movie with a gay character should be strictly a movie about being gay. I believe that the film sympathizes with the study of death, the death of someone who is your kind. I think Theo turns his life around pretty quickly after rehab, because he wants, and watching his brother die before him makes him overestimate his life. I found a dialogue in the scene when Theo tells Ryan that he will become a father, to be very touching, Ryan states that he does not want to know about things that he will never see or tell anyone. Isn't it terrible and sad? I highly recommend the movie.
