I remember watching this movie on Saturday afternoon television in the 1950s or 60s. It was well-represented, but I remember that there was a message of hope from transmitters hidden in lampostas during one of the last manic executions for the upcoming release. I am not sure that this is consistent with the facts. <br /> <br /> However, the film is well made. The German High Command crookedly and without emotion says: “Russians are attacking Fredrich Strasse” as if everything is going according to plan. <br /> <br /> I got the impression that this film, and then the American, was made for television. Off was based on the story of the British historian Trevor-Roper under the same name "The Last Days of Hitler." I was surprised not to see the thanks of Trevor Roper. <br /> <br /> I agree that the newest German film on the theme DOWNFALL was made as well as the classic one. The American fake was a bit flat. <br /> <br /> Few figures attracted as much cinema attention as Adolf. However, it is interesting to me that not one of the many films and books that came out ever mentioned the double Hitler, which was accidentally mentioned in the magnificent historical work of John Toland. <br /> <br /> Were they djibits?
