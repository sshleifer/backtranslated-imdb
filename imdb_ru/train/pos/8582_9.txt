I love characters and storyline. Very funny with a lot of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer give excellent performances. I enjoyed the dynamic and comedic interaction of Griffith and Career. Donald Southerland plays a very handsome and surprisingly sympathetic, burned killer. All three actors are one of my favorites, and their participation in this film is made for special pleasure. A good addition to my extensive DVD collection. I highly recommend this movie. If you like ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, the "Killer for the replacement", "Confidential", "Long Kiss for the Night", "The Abyss" and "Total Nine Yards" ... you will like this movie.
