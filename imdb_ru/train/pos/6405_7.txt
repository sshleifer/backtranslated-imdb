I thought racism and prejudice against Karl Brashir were overly dramatized due to the Hollywood effect. I do not believe that the US Navy has ever been such a frank racist. I canâ€™t imagine a full-fledged captain, a commander, who has ever told his boss to deliberately fuck somebody. Of course, not risking your life. And there has never been a senior senior officer, such a prejudiced prejudice against all but ALS, like the character of De Niro. No leader, so untidy and drunk as he was played, would have ever risen to the main leader. Cuba Gooding saved a poorly made film.
