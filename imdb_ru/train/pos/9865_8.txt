I saw a movie with two older children. Although it was not as clever as Shrek, I thought it was pretty good. In the cinema, surrounded by children who were on spring break, there was no sound, so I know that all the children enjoyed it. There, the parents also seemed engaged. The death and apparent death of the characters caused appropriate sighs and comments. I hope people understand that this film is made for children. So it was successful, although I also liked it. Personally, I liked Scrat !!
