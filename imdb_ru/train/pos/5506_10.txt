I can not understand why someone from the "reviewers" gave this documentary "0", except for political reasons. No, the film did not explore both "sides" of the story, but then surely one film in favor of Ch√°vez against the tides of propaganda against him should be viewed as an attempt to balance the narrative as a whole (especially considering A.'s story about the involvement of the CIA in Latin America in stirring up civil unrest - Google Archive of National Security and B. coverage in this country and in other places of clearly fake scenes in which supporters of Chavez shot non-existent opponents). What is most surprising in this film is the fact that the filmmakers stayed in the presidential palace all the time, although the coup, of course, is the first in the documentary film - images of a coup on both sides !!!
