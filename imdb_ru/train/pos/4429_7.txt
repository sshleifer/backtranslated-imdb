I personally thought that the film was a pretty good, very good actor Tadanobu Asano from Ichi the Killer. I really can't tell a lot about this story, but some moments were too embarrassing for me, and on the whole I thought that the film was too long. However, besides that, the movie had great fighting, and many locations were beautifully shot, great effects and a lot of sword playing. Another solid effort Tadanobu Asano, in my opinion. Well, I really can't talk about the movie anymore, but if you only look at Asian cinema, this is the Crouching Hidden Tiger or House of Flying Daggers, I would advise you to rent it, but if you die. I would say that there must be a very good Japanese film in your collection.
