I agree with the comment above, I like realism in this, and in many films (not only in films about eating disorders) producers seem to forget about it. They take on the daily problem and create an incredibly dramatic scene, and then at the end of the film, everything is perfect again, which I don’t like because it’s not a reality. I don’t want to say that things can’t get better, and I don’t want to say that things are not in this film, but he doesn’t spend most of the film on creating all these problems, and at the end of the film everything is perfect again, When people suffer from eating disorders , people do not just recognize it and want to get better, and then life becomes beautiful, it takes time, and I like the way we grow in this film with the characters, we go through difficulties with them, better and worse, because this is a very important part the movie. It penetrates the minds of people with eating disorders, and very realistically shows complications and pain, and I liked it. I also like the way secrecy and betrayal that people feel when they suffer from eating disorders show how scary it is to see how people react when they find out, especially if they approve of it. I thought this film was very touching, beautiful, well-told and defiantly one of my favorites.
