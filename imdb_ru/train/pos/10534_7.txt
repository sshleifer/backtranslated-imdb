I think you need to make films of this type, whether it is a good film or not. He remembers me about “I love Huckabee,” a stunningly mysterious film from Isabel Happert, which the young American sodomizes in a dirty pond in a cheerful sadistic-masochistic way (?? !!!!). I hope that the director will continue to cross the border, as if I felt that the choice made by Vincenzo Natalie was not always subtle (some scenes were, unfortunately, a kind of "tarte-à-la-crème", like a child's farce) Speaking of scripts and cinematography ?? The color of "Cuba" was black, "Nothing" is not white, more fun, surprisingly, than the former films of Natalie.
