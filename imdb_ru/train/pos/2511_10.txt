I went to look for this movie in the typical obsession of fans. I just wanted to check it out. I did not expect much from anything. In the end, a musician, actor and screenwriter? It is impossible for so many talents to live in one person. Right?? <br /> <br /> Wrong! In addition to obsession, she quickly became one of my favorites! The storyline and characters are not lost in the typical promoted Hollywood special effects. The story disrupts your emotions and pulls you forward. As the credits advance, you suddenly realize that you have been glued to the end. <br /> <br /> At times, the game seems a bit excessive. I, however, believe that this is done with a comedic intent and a very suitable character. Otherwise, I would not have expected to witness acting skills. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing more than once. I laugh hysterically or unexpectedly suffocating from what I missed or forgot about the first or two meetings. <br /> <br /> I fully recommend this movie. Feel free to express your doubts, but I am sure that he will find a place on your shelf.
