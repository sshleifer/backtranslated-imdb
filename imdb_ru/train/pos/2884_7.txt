Of all the stories about the Princess that Disney presented, Cinderella is probably the most in demand. I cannot say why, but for some reason, generation after generation, puts it first in its lists. Being a little girl, I wanted nothing more than to be a Cinderella with her glass slipper — this was my favorite costume. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I don’t think there is any story that would more understand the desires of the human heart than Cinderella. Who never wanted to run away from everyday worries and find someone who sees you like no other? The story is older than the English language and for some reason rings true. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, Disney can be a great villain. Lady Tremayne is evil for T, in a wonderful, calculated, not explicitly physical way. Her cutting tongue and eyes do all the work for her — she doesn’t need lightning-fast staffs to instill fear in your heart. Animal friends tend to rub, especially this idiotic Gus. I would be glad if he met his fate in the jaws of Lucifer. Cinderella herself was not frivolous - from time to time she made some fair, funny remarks. However, she simply did not have enough traction to make her fully sympathize. Of course, she was cute and fed the animals, but what kept her in this place? We will never know. Even if she becomes a maid only in another house, at least she will be paid, and she will have a chance of respect. It seems that the only reason why Cindy eventually succeeds is because everything is on her lap. She never works for her dreams, about which she so gently sings. <br /> <br /> This brings me to music that is as beautiful as ever. Eileen Woods has a beautiful, rich voice, probably my favorite Disney character. Some great standards have arisen here: “The dream is the desire that your heart makes, so it is love,” Bibbidi Bobbidi Bu ... <br /> <br /> “Cinderella” is a great spiritual story with many musical moments. Although he lacks the development of some characters, he provides classic villains and excellent voice acting. If you feel nauseous in the shower, insert it - it will warm you and make you sing Mmm Mmm Good! <br /> <br /> Quote from the movie: <br /> <br /> Surprise! Surprise! - Spirit-spirit-happy birthday!
