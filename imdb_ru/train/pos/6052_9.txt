Highly recommended !! <br /> <br /> A well-written, funny movie that everyone will enjoy with a sense of humor !!!. Try it, it's nice to see independent British cinema more than just stand up against major reputable studios !! Definitely worth adding to any movie collection. There are scenes in this film that I am sure many people will be able to meet. You will laugh out loud at the antics and enjoy the great soundtrack. I especially liked the Orb version of "Vietnam Jimmy Cliff" and the "Tower of London" about Freebird. <br /> <br /> Go on, try ............ you will not be disappointed.
