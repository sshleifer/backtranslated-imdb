I watched this movie yesterday and I must say that this is the best $ 36,000 horror movie I have ever seen (sorry, Shtekler). The film is definitely worth looking for if you are a zombie fan. This film smells of soul and atmosphere. Some of the zombie shots are the best shots ever made. VERY terribly looking dusty webbed corpses slowly nestling against their screaming victims. Brrrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Hot, drooping Canadian women with sexy accents will force you to do it, until HORROR lifts its dead head eating a corpse. This film was entertained from start to finish. I could not ask for more than that. My only complaint is that it was too short.
