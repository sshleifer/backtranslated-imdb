I found this show very late at night and tried it. This is a refreshing change from other things shown late in the evening if you understand my drift. His simplicity of values ​​and the sweetness of hearts helps me remind you of how friendship was in childhood. This is what I indulge in when I find it (which is rare, maybe I should check the lists! Haha) ..... and the tension between Joe and Nick is so sweet. Like any good movie about tiptoe, you are really emotionally involved in the characters. Good afternoon, Louise, Mae Alcott still inspires good stories :) So obviously I have to complete 10 lines of text for my opinion to be valid, so I think I will tell you a little more. Children are played by talented actors and actresses, and the setting is beautiful and full of nature — another thing you don’t see on TV. I hope everyone gives him a chance. I recognize and fully realize that it is juicy, but it is a kind heart. As I said, it is refreshing.
