This very funny British comedy shows what could have happened if a part of London, in this case Pimlico, declared itself independent of the rest of Britain and its laws, taxes and post-war restrictions. Here is what can happen: cheerful mess. <br /> <br /> The bombing of wartime leads to the discovery of ancient documents indicating that Pimlico was handed over to the Duchy of Burgundy many centuries ago, a small historical footnote long forgotten. For the new Burgundians, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please, without the intervention of Whitehall. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway is excellent as an urban politician who suddenly turns out to be the world's leading smallest nation. Dame Margaret Rutherford - admiration for a professor of history, who sided with Pimlico. Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford and Sir Michael Hordern are among the others who stand out. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Burgundy!
