My Tutor Friend is a well-written romantic comedy film that has something like My Sassy Girl ... there are no kissing / sex scenes. Hollywood should learn more from Korean productions. Sex is not always required in a good romantic film. <br /> <br /> The film is frivolous, with episodic animated scenes mixed with the film. I like the role when Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. The funniest moment is when Ji-Hoon hit Su-Wan's first love, because he left Su-Wan for another girl, and he will soon become a father. How he became a father, it became known in the next scene, which causes the audience to smile. <br /> <br /> Mao Ball: 8/10
