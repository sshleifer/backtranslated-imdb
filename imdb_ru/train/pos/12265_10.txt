“Tintin and I” first of all seemed to me a masterpiece of documentary films. Photography and editing are truly exciting (almost anti-dogma). <br /> <br /> We trace the life of Tintin Herge in an open 1971 interview. The Tintin series was painted in the background. from the great ideological battles of the twentieth century. In the midst of these, Gerge has his own demons to fight with, and most of his drawing activity looks like an attempt to tame them and go into the world of perfection. <br /> <br /> Even though there are fascinating photographic panoramas of pictures from Tintin's albums, as well as some reconstructions and reading excerpts from albums, Erzhe's story is told entirely through interviews and archival materials, and not through reconstructions. <br /> <br /> Gerge lived a tumultuous real life artist. But the fantasy world that has appeared in his imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again.
