This is not the same as other dance films. Several normal people were from dancing. Unlike dance films in Hollywood, the heroes of this film are not cute or hot young people. These are the ones you can see every day in their offices. They are a little upset with their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams from dancing. This concerns me very deeply.
