Another detailed work of Dr. Dwivedi on this issue brings us back to the previously prepared Punjab. Dr. Dwivedi chose a difficult topic for his movie debut. He worked on all the meticulous details to liven up the story. The treatment of the subject is very delicate. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that at that time we were not in the region, the scenery and costumes look real. Unlike most of the films shot on sections, this film focuses not on the grim details of violence to attract an audience, but its consequences. Characters come to life. Priyansu Chatterjee gave an impressive presentation. Manoj Bajpayi acted with all his might, showing the plight of the person who was feeling guilty. The rest of the cast did a good job too.
