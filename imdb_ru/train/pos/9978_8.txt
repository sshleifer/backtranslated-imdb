I must say, I loved Vanishing Point. I saw the original, and this is a pretty good remake. Even though it did not follow the original storyline (which is why I gave it 8 out of 10), it was still pretty good, and it was probably the best storyline. <br /> <br /> As for the car, it's good. A DJ comment at the end that the Challenger drives 185 miles per hour to the bulldozers is rather unlikely (and if you look, the speedometer shook at a speed of 145-150), but even if I didn’t see one on the engine in one of the In the initial scenes where they show the engine, the original storyline had a supercharged Hemi, so this is possible. For those of you who say that aerodynamics will not allow this, today's atmospheric Chrysler 300C can accelerate to 168 miles per hour, and if you look at this thing while driving along the highway, it’s like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph. In addition, when tested in a wind tunnel, if you put an air dam on the Challenger, it is likely to be more aerodynamic.
