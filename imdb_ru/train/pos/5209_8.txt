I saw this important intense film tonight. This is the most important and best work of Richard Gere and Claire Dane. Gere deserves an Oscar for his beautiful image of a man who is forced to retire early as administrator of the registrar of sex offenders. Claire Danes is chaining to himself as the woman Gere chooses to replace him - the woman he tries to teach everything he can, investigating one last case in which Gereâ€™s character is convinced that keep the young girl hostage. The themes of the shocking, sex offenders and those who control them, but this film will not be soon forgotten. I know that I will chase Gere for a very long time. Since the image of the serial killer Anthony Hopkins did not scare the image of the screen, and it interested me so much. The film begins with shocking statistics, so do not miss the opening credits. Intense and memorable. The best role of Richard Gere, proving that a person can act. The Danes, too, can, and both have succeeded in this often complex film. <br /> <br /> This is a bold film, and Gere gives a multi-layered, deeply tangible performance. Just give him an Oscar now ... he deserves it!
