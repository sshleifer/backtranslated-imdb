“Match Point” and now “Scoop” convinced me that Woody Allen not only does a neat job of making films in England (and that Scarlett Johansson is the right cast), but also confirmed what I have known for years: he didn’t should focus on the neurotic rich New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson plays journalism student Sondru Pransky, who the magician Sid Waterman (Allen) puts in his vanishing box, where she meets the ghost of murdered reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), who tells her that the serial murders that are chasing London have been committed by a millionaire Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). So she recognizes him, and ... well, I do not know how much I can tell you without giving him away. But I can say that this is probably the funniest film of Allen in recent years. This is his omnipresent unique style of humor (especially the line about his religion). <br /> <br /> You will surely enjoy this movie. If nothing else, it will make you fall in love with London. But basically, it's so damn fun. Even if you don't like Woody Allen, you will definitely like this one.
