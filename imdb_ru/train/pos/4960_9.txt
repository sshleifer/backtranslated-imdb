This film is a little ray of sunshine in the dark season. It celebrates the quality best described as simple old friendliness. Morgan Freeman plays a character very similar to Freeman himself - a successful actor who is over 70. He went to a small, rather dirty grocery store, intending to explore the role he could play while managing this place. Soon, he seduces the staff and customers, especially the sweet, though capricious, young woman (Paz Vega), who controls the “10 items or less” checkout area. <br /> <br /> “10 items or less” does not make a big statement and not pretend that it does. It follows Freeman and Vega when they become friendly, and as an elderly man offers his advice, in exchange for a trip home, a film company gopher who must pick him up never shows, and Freeman forgot his own phone number so he cannot call for help. I had a little bluesy on a gray Sunday afternoon in New York, and this click cured what bothered me.
