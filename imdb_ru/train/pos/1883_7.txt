A great comedy featuring Dudley Moore with the support of Lisa Minnelli and the benevolent John Gilgud. Moore is Arthur, a man belonging to a multimillionaire family, who was supposed to get $ 750 million, provided he marries a woman (Susan) from another multimillionaire family. In principle, Arthur accepted the conditions, but eventually refused when he met sweet and poor Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he didnâ€™t work, he only liked to drink and have fun with prostitutes. After several serious thoughts in his life, and for the first time, Arthur decided not to marry Susan just a few minutes before their wedding. The end was happy for Linda and Arthur, although he knew that his life would change in the future. This comedy is a good life lesson for everyone. Rich people are usually not happy with their lifestyle.
