I was so entertained throughout this insightful documentary, and I waited a long time for it to go through the pipes (my local video chain), and it was worth the wait. I like a good documentary / special interest, but it was definitely a sincere, honest and nostalgic, if you like, perspective on the lives of teenagers. The imagination of the child is fascinating, and here begins a great story. Rent it or buy it if you like a good, humorous and entertaining documentary. Mr. Stein and his company, of course, have come a long way from the neighbor's video cameras, which produce banking charms and gay rings, which at a glance turn people into gays. They all seem quite successful in their respectful areas, and it was nice to know that they are still good friends. There are several additional clips on the DVD for other good documentaries, as well as some of Darrenâ€™s most notable pieces, including Crazy News.
