I would not call â€œWe are back! The story of the dinosaur "just a children's version of the" Jurassic Park. " I found it more interesting than that. Like the first, it casts doubt on the safety of attracting creatures from one era to ours. But it really opens my eyes when I see who has provided voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Erdley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase this: this actor, the woman of "Greetings", the lead "Tonight Show", "The most trusted name in the news," the famous chef, police chief of "Young Frankenstein", Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos and CNN guy. <br /> <br /> But I think that I should not focus only on the cast. I thought that in this film there is something for children (purely funny) and for adults (natural science). True, it is escapism, but an insightful look. I would actually say that John Goodman, who makes Rex's voice here, is a kind of forerunner of his voice work in Monsters Inc. Worth seeing.
