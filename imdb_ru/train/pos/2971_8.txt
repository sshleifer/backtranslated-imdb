I found this film very funny, I liked how it was made from the politics of modern sports. This film is not as funny as South Park, but rather funny. And since I'm a sports fan, I liked how they made fun of some of the funniest things in sports. This film is great and sports fans are probably better for them because they have to go through life, wondering why people are so into sports when there are so many crazy rules and tricks in sports and the fact that he has absolutely nothing means I also found an interesting game in which they came up, it looks like a horse with basics and psychos (for a shooting person). Overall, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie and believe that you will end up enjoying this movie. However, if this style of comedy is not your favorite, you probably will not like it. (but this is with any comedy film)
