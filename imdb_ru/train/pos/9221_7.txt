I looked through the discount video again and took this movie for $ 4.88. Fifty percent of the time, the films that I find in the trash can are just rubbish (I mean terribly, disbelieving), but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good. This film is much better than I expected. It seemed to me very fascinating, although an amateur obviously made it. <br /> <br /> There is nothing special in this direction, but the story is intrigued by some pleasant sensations. I expected it to be more comedy, but I was not too disappointed. <br /> <br /> For a thriller this film is surprisingly good-natured. There is no bloody violence, no profanity, no nudity, no sex. Usually these films require all four elements. The PG rating is well deserved - not the same as “Sixteen Candles”, where the word “f” is used twice, and there is a short free nude scene. <br /> <br /> I simply wish for romance between Corey Chaim and his love interest could be developed more. The film tends to be a heavy conspiracy, and potentially good supporting plots are pushed aside. Instead of developing chemistry between them, we end up watching their careless three-minute montage of their romantic beginnings. They end up kissing at the end, but the chemistry is so small that it seems forced. <br /> <br /> The Dream Machine is not a jewel, but good, pure entertainment. It's pretty easy to forget — especially with a bunch of unknowns other than Chaim — but it's also much better than you expect. <br /> <br /> My account: 7 (out of 10)
