Gandhi, my father, is like looking through a book, chapter by chapter, you read it (with your own eyes) and learn more about Harilale Gandhi and, in this respect, Kasturba Gandhi. About them, little is known, and this film describes them unequivocally. The name, however, is misleading, the film about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son is a film about Harilale and his mother. And Akshaye Hannah and Shefali Chaiya fully pay homage to their roles. <br /> <br /> These films are similar to leap years. They come after a lot of time. <br /> <br /> Gandhi, my father, also speaks of an internal struggle, which is sometimes more difficult than any struggle for freedom ever undertaken. <br /> <br /> See if you like high-quality movies.
