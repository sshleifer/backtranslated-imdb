The harder the drama, the better the film about the rivalry of sisters! This little gem was mostly advertised as a comedy after its release in Sweden, so I am glad that this is not all. Undoubtedly, there are funny stories about quarrels in a small town, but drama is central to the development of the plot. And not only the family drama, it also raises sharp questions about respect for differences in people's lifestyle choices. <br /> <br /> A magnificent ensemble of characters with many superb and touching dramatic scenes that earn points of trust; and they are not just a shot, but they keep everything in place. It just makes me assume that if Ingmar Bergman did it (the drama would suit him!), International attention would probably be immediate. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 from Ozeppe.
