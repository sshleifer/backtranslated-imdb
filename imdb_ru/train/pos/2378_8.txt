This film is much better than the asylum version, mainly about the war of the worlds. Tripods look pretty cool, but walking and dying could be better. The action scenes were really cool. Walking ... walking ... walking ... walking !!! God, stop walking, please, or I'll kill myself. Thunder Scene was my favorite scene, mainly because I rammed a bunch of tripods on the ship. Good movie, I recommend it to people who read the book. The music is cool, the directors look pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Pros. A good soundtrack 99% of the book Cool Cruelty Tripods and loading machines are cool to look at the minuses. some bad acting stupid london
