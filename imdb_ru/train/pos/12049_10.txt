I gave this film 10/10 with some reluctance, because it is difficult to praise what has been so haunting and horrified me for years. The menacing threat to a black-faced woman is just horror, and the accompanying music only aggravates fear. <br /> <br /> I saw it on TV when I was 10 years old, and it really bothered me for years. I am fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too. There are a lot of movie reviews going on about how disturbing or intimidating a movie can be, but you can believe all those who posted on this forum, this is really incredibly powerful material. I mean, I really like horror movies, and I find them rather funny more often than not, but this is really dangerous and most people will probably be disturbed. I have not seen him since 10 years, and I feel a desire to see him again, but I am afraid that I may have sleepless nights. I cannot understand what it is, but I think it is somehow related to the fact that fear is the greatest weapon of a woman and that we, the viewers, are as susceptible as we are, feeling fear so much. It is noteworthy that the feelings of other viewers are so unanimous. <br /> <br /> I also saw a theatrical production that was a great production ... but nothing compares to this.
