I saw this movie some time ago after I ordered it for my friend, who is a big fan of Dominic Monaghan. The film itself was very interesting, although there were some positive moments in it, which for me was something like Donnie Darko "wtf?" factor after the movie ended. <br /> <br /> Of course, with positive points there are also negative points. For me, the young girl in the film was incredibly good, and Dominic Monaghan did a good job too. Unfortunately, I donâ€™t have that opinion about Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. It can only be me, and I do not pretend to be a serious critic, since I do not find myself experienced enough, but he just did not seem convincing as an actor. But perhaps this is even more striking because, although I am not a critic, it attracts my attention. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I think this film is definitely worth seeing. This is interesting, confusing, and you just had to see it.
