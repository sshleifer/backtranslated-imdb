This is the film you want to watch with a glass of wine, with a burning fire and legs raised. It does not require so much mental abilities, which is very good after a long day. I would say that this is very unreal - if you expect something serious, do not worry, but it is very funny. Just the thought that a businessman would go so far as to agree to live in slums for a while, and then really enjoy ... I would definitely recommend it.
