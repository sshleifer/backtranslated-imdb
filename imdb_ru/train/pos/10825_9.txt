Dick Clement and Yen La Frenice have a solid popularity rating in terms of their television work. However, their work on the film became much more complex (for example, in 2008, in The Bank Job, everything was in order, for example, Through the Universe is clearly weaker). <br /> <br /> However, Crazy, fortunately, is a solid success. He has a great story, great performances, a lot of humor, amazing music and, most importantly, a real heart. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the “moments”, and in this film there is one of them - only when everything becomes pear-shaped at the festival reunion ... <br /> <br /> Very nice.
