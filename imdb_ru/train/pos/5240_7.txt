Some of the actors were a bit suspicious. I remember that the killer of Alexander Walker (a critic of “The Evening Standard”, oh well, he is now dead) began to rant about this film, saying that it was a shame depicting the Protestants of N.I. the killers. Now, as for all NI Protestants, this film was loosely based on the Shankill butchers (who were loyalists) and who roamed Belfast in the 1970s. Believe me, they are not called butchers. My main moan about this film is that there are no rays of light or hope in it, it’s all dark and gloomy, I mean that the little girl had to die at the end. Maybe it sounds trite, but it could take such a step that not all Prods & tiags are either bad or completely good.
