Some movies that you just know you will love from the first seconds. This is one of those movies. Tracing his roots to “Double Compensation” and “Postman always calls twice” in the 40s - this was a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 90s. Nick Cage plays the protagonist "for good luck", which is entangled in the plot of the murder of a husband and wife - and his luck gets worse and worse, and even worse when he tries and tries to escape from people, the city, the violence of Red Rock West. A lot of twists and turns, magnificent performances of Cage, Hopper and Walsh, hypnotic musical background with a slide guitar and smooth guidance make this a real joy. Favorite line: when Cage looks at an empty gas manometer in a driving car, shakes his head and says: “Damn it,“ the story of my life ”.
