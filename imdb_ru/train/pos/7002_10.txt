Will Smith again starred in a film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to correct his mistakes in such a way as to affect even the most hardened hearts !!! Writer Grant Niport and Italian director Gabriele Muccino got together and created a masterpiece, which I strongly recommend to buy and keep in your movie collection, since you will never get tired of watching / feeling this movie !!! I have the highest respect for Will Smith, as he is not only a brilliant actor, but you can also say that he truly loves people and life, which undoubtedly made him ideal for the character (IRS agent Ben Thomas) he played in the movie. You will find that you feel his pain and anger, disappointment about his love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, who, by the way, was Fantastic, as usual. I fell in love with the fact that their heroes fell in love. Woody Harrelson also plays a major role in this top quality movie. It is very difficult for me to write this review without giving out the key points of the plot ... All I can say is to watch it, and when you make sure that you have nothing to interfere with, pick up the phone, sit back and get ready to start trying Unravel the mysterious life and past of IRS agent Ben Thomas ... I thank you Will Smith for another great movie !!!
