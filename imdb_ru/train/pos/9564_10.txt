It should be the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Combine exciting cinematography with a stunning acting game and an exciting plot, and you have a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dog Bite Dog I held me by the edge of my seat during some scenes, recoiling from horror during others, and left me sinking in my own tears after the tragic finale. <br /> <br /> The film made a deep impression on me. This shockingly violent scene contrasts sharply with the sharp and tender "love" scenes. The film does not deserve a Cat III rating (nude); there are no nude scenes whatsoever, and the “love” scenes do not even include kisses or “showdowns”. <br /> <br /> What message did this film give me? All people, no matter how cruel or cruel they may seem, have a gentle side. Edison Chen copes well with the role of the murderous Pan. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 10/10. This is a must see.
