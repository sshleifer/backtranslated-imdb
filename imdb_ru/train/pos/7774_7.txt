“Written in the wind” was an extremely successful universal picture. This could only be done by Douglas Sirk, a man who saw the possibilities in the material he was given. Based on Robert Wilder's popular novel and George Zuckerman's adaptation, it contained all the elements that make up an excellent melodrama: nymphomania, a great oil condition, alcoholism, incest, and a slight touch of homosexuality. Mr. Sirk paved the way for what will follow later in the TV series genre, mainly Dallas and Dynasty, only to mention two. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this film was shot entirely inside the studio. Most of the decor is fake. Like many of those paintings of the 1950s, "Written in the Wind" was filmed entirely in the studio. Just look at the scenes that should take place in Manhattan, Miami, or even on the lake, and you can see how the landscape is painted with a background. Mr. Sirk doesn't care about realism if he can tell the story in his own way. <br /> <br /> We recently filmed a show that is part of the revival of Mr. Sirk’s work, where people were laughing. in some of the most dramatic moments, especially in the scenes where Rock Hudson appears, who plays good Mitch Wayne. There is also something visual in the way Robert Keith, who plays the patriarch Jasper Hadley, and then his own daughter, the evil Marily, caresses the oil rig that adorns the older man’s table, a kind of phallic object of art. . <br /> <br /> Douglas Sirk probably wanted his cast to perform better, which makes sense in the way Dorothy Malone portrays the nymphomaniac Marily, and to a certain extent Robert Stack, who replays as Kyle is a weary heir to the story . This would probably be a simple explanation of what appears on the screen. The only one who seems normal is Lauren Bacall, who was not asked to make her character Lucy Moore anything other than a down-to-earth person caught at a party with the wrong crowd. <br /> <br /> Together with his other Hollywood, the film “Written in the Wind” shows the genius of a talented director who gave the public exactly what they wanted to see: stories are longer than life, which could only be seen on the big screen.
