For a film that received little publicity and that few people had heard, it was pretty good. This is another one of these bizarre British crime films (Scrap, Sexual Beast, etc.). It is not wild, like "Snatch", but it is interesting and has some coarse characters. <br /> <br /> He also has a trite and somewhat predictable ending, but at the beginning of the show - not too late - there are some neat turns to make it very interesting for the beginning viewer. In fact, we are talking about a modest British man who goes to the Russian "mail bride", which turns out to be with the help of two Russian male friends, presenting a couple of big surprises. <br /> <br /> Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman play one of the main roles, and they are very good, like Vincent Cassel and Mathieu Cassowitz, like Russian cohorts of Kidman. This is a different kind of movie and is well played. Kidman once again proves that she is much more than just a pretty face.
