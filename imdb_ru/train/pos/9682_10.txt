I really loved this movie! It was so good! This film tells the parrot, from the point of view of Paulie. Paulie is given to a little girl Marie, as a gift. Pauley helps Marie learn to speak, and they become best friends. But when Paulie orders Marie to fly, she falls and the bird is sent away. That's when the adventure begins. Paulie goes through a lot to find her way back to Marie. This film is so cute, funny, touching, sad and more. When I first watched this movie, he made me cry. The bird, the courage and desire to find her Mary for all this time, was so touching. I have to say that the ending is so sweet and sad, but you have to watch it to find out how it goes. In the end, the janitor tries to help him by hearing his story. Can he find his long-lost Marie or not? Find out when you watch this sweet, heart-warming movie. It will touch your heart. Rating: 10
