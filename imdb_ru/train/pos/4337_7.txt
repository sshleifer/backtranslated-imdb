I am disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the film) felt the need to use so much profanity for no reason. Maybe this is his idea of ​​"adult" films, a lot of unpleasant words with humor in the bathroom? I thought about him better and less thought about him in this film. <br /> <br /> Falk's acting and some moments of humor, as well as some possibly important topics, made me give him such a high rating. <Br /> <br /> It can be a good movie for grown-up children to watch and laugh at their own people and their weaknesses. But the lack of attention to the audience of the family seriously harms what could be a family film, but fails. Of course, you should not spend money on it, although it may be worth watching for free on TV.
