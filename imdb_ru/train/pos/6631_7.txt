I have no idea how to describe this film, and also would like to give others the same opportunity as mine, to see it, not knowing what to expect. I liked it very much, but I can also say that I hardly understood what was going on, although in fact there was generally something to be understood. Fans of David Lynch (essentially) or especially Guy Maddinâ€™s films should especially like this, and any fans of the EIGHTBALL comic will probably be overjoyed and surprised (it was as close as any movie that I saw in the tone and mood of Dan Close creates so effectively). <br /> <br /> One small note to warn anyone who is easily offended - this film, if you evaluate it, will surely be NC-17. Fans of male full-naked nudity, however ... hm, well ... yes. These are weird wild things.
