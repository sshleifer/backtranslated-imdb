Like most other reviewers, I first saw this film (on TV, not on the big screen) when I was a teenager. My dad always appreciated this film and recommended it to me then, and I must say that he was not only right, but this film has remained with me forever for more than two decades since I saw him for the first time. Since then, I have seen him two or three times (just a few days ago I gave him one more watch), and over time he did not lose his influence. This is still a great and worthy movie! Manr regards Pekingpa's High Country Tour as one of the first and best later Westerners, in which he realistically looked at life in the old west, but LAST HUNT is hardly the best movie and was even half a dozen years ago. In fact, it was probably 3 decades before its time, or maybe it is still ... <br /> <br /> Although I thought hard and probably saw hundreds of westerners (I like this genre), I can not remember a single Western, as dark and depressive, like this. The two men are tied together, partly because of hate, partly because they seem to have no other choice, surrounded by the beautiful Miss Paget, the crippled old man and the young Indian leading the life of the buffalo murderers until fate reaches to one of them. <br /> <br /> No one who has ever seen this film can forget its ending and the last shots of this gem. When the camera moves further and further away from Mr. Taylor, a white buffalo skin (on a tree) appears, and the echo of the past, when all the hatred has begun, is present again. Mr. Taylor got his buffalo, but in the end he got it. <br /> <br /> In addition to the best performances of all the participants, a clever script and a great dialogue, it should also be mentioned that the “LAST HUNTING” is superbly photographed, I rarely saw a well-shot western (except from those shot by director Anthony Mann who also superbly photographed) that all places were chosen well and that even the soundtrack fits very well into the picture. <br /> <br /> And the director brux is a really great storyteller, Mastery! He made a lot of really great films and achieved success in almost every conceivable genre, but even in such a fruitful career as this one, THE LAST HUNT is still considered one of the best, if not the best. <br /> Of course, deserves a higher rating, compared with the 7 races enjoyed by HIGH COUNTRY.
