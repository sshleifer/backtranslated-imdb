Just watched it on sky TV, missed the first half hour. I really wondered if this was a true story, so I watched it to the end. at the end there was no brief description of what happened to everyone. it reminded me of speed, but at the end of the day I donâ€™t think it was released to the cinema, as we did see the following error. we saw them take off the hood (hood), and then make two shots from the car when the police car in front tries to slow it down when the hood is turned on again. I really sat on the edge of my seat, especially when I thought that the child was going to hit the bridge, and, of course, when the bridge was not going to lower, and then it was. I'm afraid I burst into tears, so everything was not so bad !!!!
