(spoilers ??) <br /> <br /> I wasn't sure what to think about the movie. Not too much kid movie. Definitely should be observed with the parent, because this includes death and death. But I was surprised that I was a little entertained. <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed that we spent 81 minutes of time. (even less without credits) And the trailer makes you think that the rodent is the main creature. But alas, they torture him. Right until the end of the movie. These two colic docked the movie 2 stars. But I recommend the movie. Even to continue. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Repeat playback: 7/10
