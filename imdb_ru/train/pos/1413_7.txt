In 2006, AMPAS awarded one of the most innovative wildlife documentaries in the coldest place on earth. This film was "March of the Penguins", narrated by an Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> Walt Disney Studios is a monopoly on animation for decades. They took their punches to create a live action movie, and it fell in all directions. Then Disney created a division called Disneynature and released his first feature film called Earth. This is absolutely one of the most touching and informative documentaries I have seen for quite some time. <br /> <br /> The Earth, narrated by the great James Earl Jones, does not offer anything new for those who have watched the Discovery Channel for the past five years or are very closely following the Global Warming crisis. The land touches this issue very deeply and uses a very liberal approach to this issue. <br /> <br /> This gives an emotional connection with nature, which I had never experienced before. It also shows not only the beauty and mysterious parts of our magnificent planet, but also the coarse and disturbing aspects that this often entails. It’s one thing to watch the Mufas fall from a cliff to a crush, or Bambi’s mother will be shot dead by a hunter in the middle of the forest. This is all good, because at the end of the film we know that this is just a film. It features penguins, polar bears, elephants, all types of families, from all walks of life living and dying in their natural habitat. These real things create a real impression of the film. <br /> <br /> Despite the slight gravity of the film’s graphic nature (which many would disagree with), the Earth is a touching experience. Here is an amazing cinematic work from a great camera crew and a terrific account of George Fenton. Compared to the Penguins or the Grizzly Man March, he actually has no measure, but is great in himself. In the end, you begin to appreciate our planet and a little sadness, since many of us will probably never be able to visit these places that we will see in the film. We live here, but we never had the opportunity to explore the planet for one reason or another. The earth is beautiful. <br /> <br /> *** / ****
