"Against all flags" - all this is a classic crook. It has all the elements that a fan of adventure might hope for, and even more so, the girl is in trouble, well, in fact, not in trouble. Like Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara in his best sporting qualities, overcoming his enemies despite the social norms of that period. Anthony Quinn completes the top three actors in the role of the ruthless captain Roc Brasiliano and turns out to be a cunning and capable sworn enemy for Brian Hawk (Flynn). For a fan of the classic adventure, you must see “Against all flags”. Although he may not be in the same league as some of Errol Flynn’s early works (for example, “Captain Blood” and “Sea Hawk”), he is still very fascinating.
