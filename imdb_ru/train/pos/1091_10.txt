I like this movie. I first saw it when I was 20 (which was only four years ago), and I liked it so much that I brought my copy the next day. The comedy is well played by all participants. I always need to rewind and revisit the scene where Mr. Zanders explains why he found water at a distance of 6 feet in one area and 227 feet in another area. Also look for father Jason Robards, who plays Mr. Retch. Talent ran in this family.
