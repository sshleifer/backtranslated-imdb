Shortly before the introduction of the moral code darkened the mood of writers, directors and actors, the first film adaptation of the film by V. Somerset Maugham “On Human Slavery” stunned countless viewers. Today he has no shock value, just a good game. <br /> <br /> Although the cast is great, this is the first great role played by Betty Davis and one of the best performances of Leslie Howard. Howard is an English imitator of Parisian artist Philippe Carey, who is softly and firmly told that he lacks talent and that his devotion does not replace true genius. Taking the lesson by heart, he returns to London and enters the medical college (by the way, it seems there are no students in it - at that time there would be at least a few. Perhaps the author / doctor Maugham did not do this). care for medicines. <br /> <br /> Once over a cup of tea, Carey is fascinated by the waitress Mildred Rogers and Bette Davis in the role of a morally dissolved and mostly evil Farrago. Her Cockney accent is as keen as Eliza Dolittle. His repeated attempts to meet her meet with a not-too-enthusiastic answer: “I don’t mind,” which is a sure sign for any person who has a head on his head, that he dives into the depths. Mildred of Maugham supplemented her waitress advice with a bit of old-fashioned street walking, something unclear revealed here. <br /> <br /> Crazy's stingy strike serves Rogers' meager need for financial support. He is desperately in love with her - she plays him, as the Sunday church organist easily plays on his instrument. There is no sex here. Recognizing that he is not going anywhere, he begins a chaste relationship with Nora, a woman who adores him. Re-enter Mildred, replete with a child, and usually need to take care of her. Come out with a broken heart. Nora. <br /> <br /> Another parting with Mildred and Carey begins a long-standing friendship with Sally, who is enthusiastically supported by her father, who seems to consider a possible marriage to be both a good thing for two young people and a chance for relief. one of his nine children. <br /> <br /> The movie is reasonably, but not completely, followed by Maugham's magnificent novel. Carey Howard is naive and vulnerable, and for most of the film, his sad eyes resemble the doe standing in front of a double-barreled gun. Mildred is unrestrained and angry, the user of the worst kind, her only concern about her own needs is barely disguised when she tries to curb Carey with a thin patina of tender words (and offers - at some point she promises that she will do - a bold statement for those times, and I am sure that the audience fully understood it. <br /> <br /> A preliminary code may be, but the rapid dissolution of Mildred could satisfy the League of Catholic Decency. The ending is conditional sins, triumphant principled behavior . <br /> <br /> Directed by John Cromwell achieved excellent results from his two main stars, one of which is well known, and the other largely due to this film. The atmosphere of the 1930s is London and the time travel is worth it. br /> <br /> Available on DVD. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (for appearances by Davis and Howard)
