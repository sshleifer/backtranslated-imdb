in terms of NASCAR Maniac, like me, the film is interesting. You can see a lot of racing cars since 1983. Even so, the racing scenes are not that realistic. But I have to admit that I didn’t see a single race until 1995, because until that time they hadn’t shown any NASCAR races in Germany) <br /> <br /> from the perspective of Bert Reynolds fan, like Yes, the film in Mostly this is what we used to see in Reynolds in the 80s: Bert driving a fast car, as in his films "The Bandit." <br /> <br /> If you love NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this film is a must see. If you love only one of these two things, I also recommend watching it. If you don’t like NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, you still have to give it a shot, but remember, this film is far from receiving the Academy Award. <br /> <br /> This is a typical 80s humor. If you like movies like Cannon Film and Police Academy, you will also like this movie.
