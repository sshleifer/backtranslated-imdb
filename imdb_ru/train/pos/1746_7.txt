Bela Lugosi plays one of his rare roles as good guys in the series, based on a long radio hit (which was also the source of the feature film where Lugosi played the villain.) Lugoshi removes a beautiful figure and he is sad that he could be a good guy on the team. Here, Chandu is returning from the East to help the princess Naji, who is hunted by the leaders of the Ucash cult who need her to return the high priestess of their cult from the dead. This is a good looking serial series that delivers a lot of fun. To be sure that the tempo sags a little, it looks more like one of the main roles (studios-producers) than a hectic adventure, but it's still nice. It plays better than two movies that were cut out of it, because it allows things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling hurried or having the feeling that “hey, I missed something.” One of the trilogy of the three good series made by Lugosi, the rest - SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
