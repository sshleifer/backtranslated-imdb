I voted for it 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story I could see in a long time. The animation is awesome. The artwork behind each landscape was beautiful. From colors to lighting and non-standard fees for artistry. I was surprised. Going beyond the limits of beauty on the screen, you immerse yourself in the storyline, which is both eternal and fresh at the same time. Character development is short, but these test points are exactly what you need to make the viewer understand what, why, and how the character came to where he stands. I am impressed with this whole affair and I think that the whole family should see it.
