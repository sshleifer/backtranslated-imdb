The film seemed quite expressive to me, since the main character was lost, but at the same time much clearer about some things in life than the people who mocked him (for example, his roommate). <br /> <br /> He was tortured and you loved to watch him torture! he had this perverted side that was frightening, but we were all glad to see him come out of his suffering again. <br /> <br /> It looked like a game character or a pan-man through a minefield or enemy and we love to watch him under a sniper attack or fire, but in the end we are happy to see him survived ... <br /> <br />
