This movie hit me. I am 29 years old, I remember the 80s and my father worked in a factory. I thought that if I worked too much, if I had pride and I never gave up, I would also have an American dream, a house, a few children, a car that I could call my own. However, I noticed that without any degree (unlike my father, who left school in ninth grade) and an acute sense of greed and laziness, you are not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> I would like to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. This is made for television, and I just saw it an hour ago. I can't find it anywhere! I would like to show this to my friends, my pseudo-friends, family and other relatives, to see what they think and remind them that once Americans WERE working for a sense of honor and that we were proud to be done !! I think the feeling is still here, but in a heavy downward spiral with many things done abroad ...
