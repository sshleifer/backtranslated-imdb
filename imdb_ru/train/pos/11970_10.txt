Full House came to me when I was about 9 years old. I remember watching the funniest homemade videos in America with Bob Saget, and one day my mom told me that he, too, was on a show called Full House. Once I was lucky enough to catch an episode while visiting a family. At first, it didn’t look too interesting, but as I watched more and more, every night at 9:00, I’d be just fascinated by it. <br /> <br /> This show really makes you want to be there yourself, hang out with girls, walk with them to different places, and maybe even join their little family "followers". <br /> <br /> What I like most about Full House is that it’s a great show for kids and adults of all ages. There will be some parts that are more intended for adults than parts intended for children so that the whole family can enjoy it. No matter how stupid it may be, this is a great show anyway, and I definitely recommend it to everyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10
