this film was just great, the actors, the stage, the stage, the direction, everything was really suitable for the role they played, and you can imagine that there, Robert Redford is a terrific actor, and now the same director, Norman's father the same Scottish island, like me, so I really liked the fact that there was a real connection with this film, the witty remarks throughout the film were great, it was just great, so much so that I bought the film as soon as it was released for retail and will be recommended You saw, and fly fishing was amazing, really cried at the end, it was so sad, and you know what they say, if you cry in the film, it should be good, and it definitely was, also congratulations for two little boys, who played the role of Norman and Paul, they were just great, I think that children are often excluded from the list of praise, because the stars who play them all grew up, such a great profile for the entire film, but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they did you don't think ? the whole story was so beautiful because it was true and it was someone's life after all that was told to all of us.
