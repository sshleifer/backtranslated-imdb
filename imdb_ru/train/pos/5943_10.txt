This movie is really cool. every thing looks like it came out of a comic book. The scenery, costumes and plot are gorgeous. Clark Bartram is our favorite batman again. at a dead end, he looked a little better, but he still copes. Superman is great too. flying effects are fine. but it's a fan movie, so we can't expect them to be the greatest. the shot with the superman catching the car was VERY believable. it was cool. This is a film that I would definitely see if it were real. it has everything you would like in a Batman / Superman movie. one exception, though, I would have thrown a prankster instead of 2 faces ..... in general, I give this movie 10, because this is a great movie
