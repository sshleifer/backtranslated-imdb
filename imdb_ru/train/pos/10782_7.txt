Michael Sterns plays Mike, a sexually upset man with an interesting moral attitude toward sexuality. He has no problem staring at naked dancers, but when women start having sex with men, he loses them. He believes that when women do have sex, they lose their sense of “innocence” and / or “beauty.” Therefore, he strolls through the Hollywood hills, chasing couples in the distance, eventually shooting at the men from a powerful rifle with a sight. <br /> <br /> The apparent main reason for the existence of this film is to engage in sexual relations. activity over and over. "History" looks like an afterthought. This should make many happy heterosexual men very happy, because we are being considered for quite long scenes of nude (the ladies look very good without clothes) and sex to serve as the main dose of titylation. Of course, if you look at it with a reasonable degree of probability, this greatly increases the eerie factor and illustrates the desire for voyeurism. (First, Mike looks at the pair through the scope for a few minutes before finally pulling the trigger.) All this is emphasized by terribly obtrusive but slightly atmospheric music on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Those with a penchant for sinister trash will definitely enjoy to one degree or another. It even includes one lesbian date, which confuses Mike and makes him insecure * how * to respond. He turns around at a very slow pace, but ends with a funny ironic twist. It is a strange and perverse rarity that if nothing more definitely keeps some viewers glued to the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
