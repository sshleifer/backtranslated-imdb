Saw it on SBS television here in Australia, in another week where it was called “Laputa: Castle in the Sky”. I included the subtitles, and I think that SBS provided them for this, which, as usual, was of very good quality. <br /> <br /> I just looked at “Laputa” on Wikipedia, and this confirms what I suspected ... The floating island of this tale is taken from Jonathan Swift's classic novel Gulliver's Travels 1700s. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a fascinating Japanese fairy tale that has an English speaking voice. I think that it is suitable for small children, but it lasts a little over two hours, so for some it may be too long, but not for an adult like me. <br /> <br /> The story concerns two children who are eager to find the legendary floating island on which there is a castle. Children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have pirates, an army and spies who are also looking for an island and want to catch children (Sheeta, the girl voiced by Anna Paquin, and Paz, the boy voiced by James Van Der Beck) to help them find it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are gorgeous ... sometimes photorealistic, especially scenes from stonework, lit with torches, or beautiful scenes of bright, sunny days with white clouds, or fog. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
