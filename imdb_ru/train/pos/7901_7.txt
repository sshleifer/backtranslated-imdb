Worst movie ever? Wow, wow now. You can not be serious. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the whole point is what you expect from the movie. I live in Oregon, so I got the opportunity to enjoy great shots of familiar, but still amazingly beautiful Smith Stones and other parts of Central Oregon (as well as the sweet cameo of our own Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs looking at the little Sissy's cradle at the beginning of the film) . Some of them were enough to encourage me to put the film better than the "average" score. <br /> <br /> Or ... Maybe it all depends on your expectations. After reading the book “AGE” back and thinking to myself: “God, no one can ever make a film out of this interesting, bizarre, strange book ... especially 20 years later, when manners (MORAISS - can not put in a sign of emphasis in the network) changed "- I was very pleasantly surprised when I first watched the film, when it was released in 1994, and even more liked it today, watching it again. <br /> <br /> Sissy was delicately thrown, and I don’t care You all say, I was also pleasantly surprised by the performances of Rain Phoenix and John Hurt. I am not a lesbian, nor bi, nor trans but I met a lot of people similar to those whom they were supposed to portray - and these “real” people acted the same way as these actors acted. I walked a little, the stage was always a little “on.” Gus Van Sant is one strange a native of Oregon, but hell, he did a good job adapting this crazy book, IMHO.
