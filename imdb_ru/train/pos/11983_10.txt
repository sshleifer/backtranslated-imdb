This show has a great storyline! This is very believable! The husband’s wife is dying and he cannot take care of his children alone, so he calls his son-in-law, his best friend, and many others come later in the series. Such as Rebecca Donaldson, the cute but strong dog Comet, Nikki and Alex, whom you can find out for yourself (I don’t want to spoil it for you) and forcing Kimmy Gibler! (DJ DJ), but the kids are great too. This is the first time Mary Kate and Ashley shot! And also, perhaps, you know Candace Cameron Bure from such shows as St.Elsewere Punky Brewster, and this is so raven! Jody Sweeten plays Stefa, capable of loving the average child who feels deprived. In fact, this is a very good show!
