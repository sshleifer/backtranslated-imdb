I saw this film at least fifty times, and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time, I still felt it. <br /> <br /> The story itself was incredible, but it came to life thanks to the experience of Spielberg and the fairytale cast, including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Avery. Akoshua Boucia deserved an Oscar nomination for her short but powerful image of Nettie. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie you will experience all human emotions. I laughed, cried and was angry. Like most great films, it was viewed by the Academy with many nominations, but no victories. But this film is, without a doubt, definitely one of the best films of all time.
