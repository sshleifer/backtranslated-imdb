I really liked this movie. I'm not even sure what specifically about this, but I think it was wonderful and should be available for DVD. The women were strangers and still got along well to spend time in a villa in Italy. The actors, in my opinion, did a great job. All the characters were so different, but still a smart story that made him work. There are problems of humor, drama and relationships, all on time. This requires 10 lines, but I just can't figure out what else to say, so Iâ€™ll just continue until I get 10 lines. So sorry for that. What more can I say, it has been a long time since I last saw it. I look forward to look again, but it is not available.
