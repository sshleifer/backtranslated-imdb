Freedom to have your own sea motorboat, the excitement of traveling underwater adventures — rude, adventurer and wonderful (and so well endowed!) Good bikini helpers — all of this was a definite advantage for SEA HUNT (1958-61). <br /> <br /> That is why a series of "for hire" naval guns was launched *. Let's look carefully. There must be some clues. <br /> <br /> If we look back a little, we’ll see that RKO Radio Pictures shot UNDERWATER! (1955). It starred Jane Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet of very attractive scuba diving adventurers in the Caribbean, including the Cup to Fidel. The film was moderately successful and was not remembered for its history, as the appearance of managers in bathing suits. Beautiful, slender Women Folk in some really sharp two-piece swimsuits (Woo, Woo, Woo, Woo!) Are always a plus for guys; and the presence of rude, athletic men who demonstrate their best "poses" for steaks is equally pleasant for Gals. <br /> <br /> And there is one element that is the true legacy of this old RKO function. He is on the soundtrack between the music lines and themes. This is “This is a cherry-pink and apple-white color,” written by Luigue and Jacques LaRue performed by Damazo Perez Prado and his orchestra. <br /> <br /> Anyone who hears this instrument or song (with lyrics) will not soon forget it. His Carribbean Beat is very lively, and its rich use of the brass section of the orchestra makes an instant and powerful impression and memory. The recording of this song at 45 revolutions per minute was among the ten most popular songs of the week during many Saturday evenings on NBC TV channel “YOUR HIT PARADE”. We cannot remember how many weeks and how high it has risen. (Maybe someone can fill us in on this one item, please!) So, we went back to "SEA HUNT" and his own odyssey to get into "Tube". The public has gone to the SUBDLEMENT! it's okay, but will they go to the show? <br /> <br /> ZIV TV Productions has gained a reputation as a product manufacturer, which for the most part has not been signed by networks. for multipoint treatment But they have made great strides with television syndication. ** By this we mean offering a series for stations to be shown one per television station per market area. (Just as various newspaper syndicates "sell" comics to various newspapers across the country and even around the world. <br /> <br /> So we got Mike Nelson himself in the physical presence of Lloyd Bridges. Mr. Bridges worked for about 15 years or thereafter, he played several very memorable performances, in which he mainly supported and greatly changed roles in several films about Boston Blacks (along with Chester Morris) in the film THE STOOGE TO CONGA., SAHARA (also 1943), HOME OF BRAVE (1949) and WHISTLE AT EATON FALLS (1951). <br /> <br /> Lloyd very convincingly described his character An excellent, convincingly athletic body, with a view of a guy who makes a living by his physical abilities, he took it very well as a Diver Diver, regardless of whether he performs duties on board a ship or deep in the sea. <br / > <br /> And Lloyd quickly took on the role, but despite a lot of misinformation, he was not familiar with scuba diving. *** before landing this Mike Nelson concert. But "Sports Mr. Bridges" was quickly trained, as many close-up shots under water showed that there was no doubt that this was Lloyd with a mask, a bubbler (air reservoir) and flipper fins. . <br /> <br /> In the story almost always it was about helping a client, like a private detective. So if the client was a beautiful lady who looked good in a bathing suit, so much the better. <br /> <br /> Like many other TV shows ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS, MORE HUNT had a fine, often visited the topic of opening and closing, as well as some original music and queues. <br /> <br /> At one time I believe that “SEA HUNTING” was the best syndicated television series, a success that the ZIV series had known before with such as “SCIENTIFIC THEATER OF FICTION” and “HIGHWAY”. As for the location of this submarine saga, here in Chicago, it was shown late at night (after 22:30) on channel 5 of WNBQ TV (our branch office of NBC, now known as WMAQ TV). <br /> <br /> And I remember who was the first sponsor in this particular market. And there were even commercials made by Star! How well we can remember and visualize Lloyd as Mike Nelson riding his Power Boat. And since we were invited to come back next week and see "..... another adventure" SEA HUNT ", sponsored by brewer G. Heileman from LaCrosse, Wisconsin, which produces Lager Old Style beer!", All the while Mike drinks us, picks up a bottle of old style. (Shame on you, Mike! Have a beer on your moving boat! We tell the coast guard!) Then the boat leaves the dock, followed by the theme “Sea Hunting” and rolls the credits. <br /> <br /> NOTE: * More figuratively than literally, Mike was hired, and everything was very similar to Detective Story. <br /> <br /> NOTE: ** ZIV's syndicated successes included "THE SCIENCE FICTION THEATER", "WEST POINT" (and its clone "MEN OF ANNAPOLIS"), "SEA HUNT" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". <br /> <br /> NOTE *** And, of course, SCUBA is an abbreviation of an autonomous underwater breathing apparatus.
