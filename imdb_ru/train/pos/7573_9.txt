One of the worst gameplay that makes you keep the light next to your bed. Excellent storyline with a romantic, terrifying and ironic storyline. Fans of the original Resident Evil waiting for a surprise returning character! Not to mention the fact that the voice has improved dramatically compared with the previous series. Do not miss the best of the series.
