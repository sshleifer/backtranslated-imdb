Girlfight is a story about a problem teenager named Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). Diana is burdened with suicide mothers and a sexist father living in a sexist community. Short character and a lot of things to make a fire, she is going to be kicked out of school for fighting. Her brother Tini (Ray Santiago) is training with Hector (Jaime Tirelli) in boxing. Her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), tells Diana to pay for these weeks for teaching Tini. While Diana is walking through the gym, she realizes that this is exactly what she wants to do. She wants to box. Diana asks her father for money to study, but he refuses, because she is a girl and should do more "girlish" things. All Diana wants is to be treated like any other guy. They don't look down on her because she is a woman. She steals money from her father to start training. <br /> <br /> Great movie. A genius, a pure "genius" genius. I recommend to everyone who needs to watch a good clean film without the “monkey business”.
