Probably the best fantasy movie ever made. Magnificent color, breathtaking scenery, incredible musical notes of Miklos Rossa, which are ideal for every scene and mood. Acting is also excellent in what could be tough and pretentious in smaller hands, but here the poetic dialogue is clever, sensitively speaking (humor is also subtle and delightful). <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, Spielberg and Lucas were delighted with this. Along with "The Four Feathers" (1939), one of the two best films released by Alexander Korda and London Films, and one of the best films ever made. <br /> <br /> A real, convincing classic!
