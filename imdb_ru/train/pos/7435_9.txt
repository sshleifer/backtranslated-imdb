I first saw this video 15 years ago. I thought it was excellent then, and I still do. I am a former English teacher (high school and college) and a lover of English romantic poetry, so Coleridge highly appreciates me. Anything that could diminish the beauty of the poem or the power of the story would not have received my voice of excellence. In this case, everything works well to attract the viewer, especially high school students. The story is well illustrated for the generation that grew up on television. In addition, the voice of Michael Redgrave adds a sense of authenticity and credibility. Okay, there was no big budget for the project. So it wasn’t Star Wars, and they don’t have computer graphics. But who can reject the illustrations of Gustave Dore as part of the presentation? The above comment, in which only four lines rejects the video as a piece of garbage, is extremely unfair and unacceptable. I'm a producer friend, but that's not my reason for this comment. Rather, I defend a work of art that I think has value at all levels. This is well suited to bring Coleridge's poem to the disciples in such a way as to arouse their understanding and arouse their sympathy for the lesson taught by the ancient sailor.
