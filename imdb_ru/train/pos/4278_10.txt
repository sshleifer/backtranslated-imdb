This is a film that I saw more than any other (I think I saw it on average once a year since its release). And every time I see it, itâ€™s equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me. The cast is most likely a combination of the best ex Yu ever to have been in cinema. This film is a must for any self-respecting movie lover. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocasni krug, Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu. These are poker films that everyone should have in their private video collection.
