I love the Farrelli brothers and admire them! Why was I able to see this wonderful film only 3 years after its release? It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it warmed my heart. For a long time. It's hard to describe it in my rotten English, but I still have to try: <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent in everything - from the main roles to the supporting roles, the acting is great, the dialogue is great and the film is perfectly filmed and edited. <br /> <br /> I think that Farrelli Brothers films are often underestimated - they are not easy comedies - they are also liars! They talk about what life is (I will not tell YOU!). <br /> <br /> In my case, this film confirmed to me what a relationship is: <br /> <br /> If you love someone: free him, let him be - try to share passion and pain and always be faithful to each other. <br /> <br /> I'm not a hater in sports, but definitely sporty ignorant, But in this film - the vibes get you. I could smell the baseball atmosphere. Finally, this film explained to me what it could mean for you to be a sports fan and what kind of cool fan families there should be. <br /> <br /> Thanks a lot, Pete and Bob! <br /> PS: If you have not yet seen - check KINGPIN!
