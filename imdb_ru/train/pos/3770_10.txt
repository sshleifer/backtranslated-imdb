When will people find out that some films are made for fun and not necessarily change the world? If you understand this, then expect to get a lot of fun while watching Bill and Ted's Fake Journey. This is a film that is very interesting to watch, and Keanu and Alex make an excellent on-screen team, repeating their characters from “Great Adventures of Bill and Ted” with an even greater “style” than in the first film. This is not rocket science, but it's great to laugh, the characters are incredibly cute, and the storyline is so radical that you have to laugh. Do not expect that “deep and meaningful attacks” just expect pure pleasure!
