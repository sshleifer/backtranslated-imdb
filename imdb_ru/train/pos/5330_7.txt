I thought it was quite interesting, my social science teacher / linguistics was the police chief who kept the microphone on the water barrel = D I was excited, my teacher was shooting an advertisement where he played gas, coffee, a telephone, itâ€™s nice TV, he was also at all, hates Chris, except that he always gets a small role, a la why we have to fix 10 lines, it's so stupid, not done what kind of joke is this? why do we have to go all the way to the tenth line ... is it true what's the point ?? !! I'll just pick random words now. -_- Maple Story is fun, I love my friends.
