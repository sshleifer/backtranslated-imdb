I came to Nancy Drew, expecting the worst ... because of the bad reviews of everyone else. I thought: even if I don’t read books, it’s not like Nancy Drew I’ve heard about. But I was wrong. Of course, it was not an exact copy of books, but when you make a movie out of something, you have to change it to become entertainment on the big screen. The plot was enjoyable and exciting with a lot of real funk, and I thought that Emma Roberts is really believable in her own way of portraying this classic character. There were some funny moments and, contrary to many assertions, in none of the moments of this film Nancy looked like a nutlet. She was smart, conservative, polite and sincere. One thing that this film also succeeded in was to balance it all with a mixture of comedy, romance, expectation and emotional moments. I like this movie. What a click, what a click! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and go look at it, be ready for some terrible moments, because I, as it were, go crazy! Watch it or become a bum and just let other people decide what you think about this movie for you ... a mistake I almost made. I love it, I want to have this movie! I love Emma Roberts too. She's like mini-brie van de kamp from DH. Love it, love it.
