Kenny Doughty, like Jed Willis, is sexier in this role than any male porn star, despite the fact that he keeps his pants. <br /> <br /> The movie tore my heart reminding me of the intensity of the great explosive love of my life. I donâ€™t think I can remember another film, except perhaps Romeo and Juliet, Zeffirelli, who so well convey this dizzying joy. <br /> <br /> Another draw of the film is very English eccentric characters enjoying the scandal. In this sense, it is almost the same as Murder of the Midsomers or Mystery of Miss Marple, without chaos. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent antidote to the mocking horror that is currently popular in the US, and any relationships between people of different ages.
