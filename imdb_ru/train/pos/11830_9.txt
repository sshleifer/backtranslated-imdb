This is a terrific movie in which everything is made in six or seven colors. When he came out more than 15 years ago, he stunned the audience with his color scheme, so different from everything that had ever been filmed. These colors, at least for me, make this film absolutely exciting. There are literally thousands of scenes that I would like to freeze and somehow transform into a picture in order to study their works. <br /> <br /> Characters and history do not correspond to the greatness of the photo, but they are all excessive, especially villains. Famous actors who played them here were to have fun on the set, playing "Flatop", "Pruneface", "Lips", "Mumbles", etc. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Glynn Headley is as good as Dick Tracy and her friend Tess Trueheart, and she is as sweet and tender as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo, whom offender Dick and Tess take under his wing. Other colorful characters are Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Foriste, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona, and other names you know, but too many to list here. Check out the full list on the main page and you will be amazed. <br /> <br /> The only minus that I discovered was the voice of Pacino, which tormented you after a while, the unspoken singing voice of Madonna and the fact that the film would have been cut better for about 10 minutes. These "flaws" are all insignificant, because in general it is a funny movie ... a cartoon band that comes to life in an incredibly colorful way ... as if you have never seen it.
