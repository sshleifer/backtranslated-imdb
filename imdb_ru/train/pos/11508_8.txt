I would like to give Kolchak a higher rating, but the show quickly moved from scary / tense to stupid. Wines ABC. They moved the show on Friday night at 8:00 pm, then known as "family hour." It should never have been on Fridays. I was a sophomore in high school and loved the early episodes! It was first against the Police Woman on NBC. ABC had huge problems with Friday nights. A bad season for them overall, until Barney Miller, Barrett and SWAT made their debut in January '75. Kolchak was supposed to be a hit. Darren McGavin begged to withdraw from his contract to complete the show. It is a pity that in the original television films, Richard Matheson had no time for writing. However, McGavin made Kolchak his, as actors can do. Jackie Gleason as Ralph Crumden and Carol O'Connor as Archie Bunker come to mind. That INS, mounted with hand-held typewriters and clicking teletypes, seems strange and ancient today, but it was part of the attraction. They are very fortunate that Simon Oakland repeated Vincenzo from television films.
