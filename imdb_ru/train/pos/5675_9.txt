Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series, about which people least heard - it has the same principles as in the second and fourth, and there is nothing revolutionary in it. But it's still great â€” the fiery duke of Wellington and the fat, stupid doctor Johnson (the author of the first dictionary in England) make this show one of the most popular. In this series, there are even more fun odnosstrochnikov, and it reveals humor in a less known era - in historically accurate and pleasant episodes. Blackadder's third exit is not the most famous and famous of all, but the role of Rowan Atkinson as the butler of the foolish prince is funny and effectively made, and Hugh Laurie is at his best in this series. Fine! 9/10
