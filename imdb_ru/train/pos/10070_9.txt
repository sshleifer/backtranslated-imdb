When I watched this movie on the video last night, I kept getting these tingles that told me it would take it. I have a feeling that I will watch it again and again for many years. <br /> <br /> It has all those qualities that can not be captured in the history / film. And although some cultural references for me, the Western viewer, are unclear, in fact, this is a universal story.
