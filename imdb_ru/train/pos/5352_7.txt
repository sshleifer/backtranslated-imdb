This is Arnold's movie. Now that you know this, I have saved many of you time spent reading this review. If you don't like Arnold, then you won't like this movie. If it’s different, you’ll probably like it. It is so simple. <br /> <br /> Now, if you're still reading this, I expect you like Arnold. Lucky you! He's not bad, is he? The running man is a very typical feature of Arnold. He has the usual retro future that we know so well from the 80s B-Sci Fi, he has a bunch of horrible single rows, a lot of violence and explosions, a beautiful heroine and a happy ending. <br /> <In this case, the popular government of 1984, which uses television as effective crowd control in game shows like gladiators, is an evil adversary. Arnold, of course, finds himself in one of these shows and turns everything upside down, with a little help from his two allies and the pretty Amber. <br /> <br /> This is not a big budget movie, but he still managed to create a pretty good future atmosphere, with some beautiful matte pictures and sets to help him. This is hopeless 80s, but I find it charming. Acting in different ways, Arnold makes his usual grunts and screams with the help of single row unidirectional stones. The heroine Amber, to put it mildly, is a bit stereotypical, and the child named Damen Killian is a typical evil TV man. <br /> <br /> Despite all its flaws, the film shows its message very clearly; TV is opium for the masses, a good way to control people. It also features some futuristic digital video editing at the time, allowing the bad guys to change the faces in the video to deceive their audience. Today it does not look futuristic at all, which is a bit disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you've already seen Arnold's films, then you know when to watch this movie. Enjoy.
