Over the past few days, after reading many reviews of The Scoop, I entered the theater, prepared to leave Woody. Fortunately, I could not be more wrong. Of course, Woody, the performer, slows down the touch or two, but Woody, the writer / director, is in great shape - and he has found a reliable way to integrate his 70-year-old self into the story. Judging by the laughter and laughter, the audience ate one line and the dialogue of Allen, as I have not seen for several years. <br /> <br /> In the cinematic landscape, dominated by software-approved scenes, the tastes of twenty years old and the formula of the assembly line for children, this is a source of both satisfaction and inspiration, when Allen continues to pursue his personal and still useful track.
