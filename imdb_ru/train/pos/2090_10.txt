Hence the term "classic film." This is a wonderful story of womanly courage, courage and utmost devotion. Poor Olan was sold to her indifferent husband, who over the years has learned to appreciate her. (Yeah, right, PEARL !!) <br /> <br /> Louise Reiner was a great star who won Oscar's best female role a year earlier for her small role (and what a waste of Oscar time) in “The Great Zigfield”. It really did not show what talent she had, except for her exotic beauty. But in Good Land, she shows that she really can act! Her beauty was erased, and she also did not have large suits. People say that she showed no real emotions in this film. Like hell. Her character Olan is a shy and timid woman with inner strength. She is silent during the filming of the film, only her eyes and body convey her emotions. Example: these scenes during the fall of the city and during the execution of marauders. If you people say that she does not play well in this film, you are NOT watching! <br /> <br /> Paul Muni shows that he can act too. His character is not to my liking. He never sees her as she is until the very end of the story. Sweet, loving and devoted wife and mother with her special beauty. The greatest of all beauty from within is like a pearl. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, watch it. You will see one of the best films created by the golden age of Hollywood.
