For this film by the director Vincenzo Natalie, a stylish approach was applied with interesting angles and spectacular close-ups. It was also nice to see that Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu played leading roles and expanded their range as performers. This film also included one of the most creative scenes of “escape” in recent years. The efforts of the director and actors united in an effective thriller. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the plot of the film was confusing, the plot developed very clearly, as layers of corporate greed and foul language were discovered. <Br /> <br /> In 1949, George Orwell in his famous novel “1984” suggested that the future would be ruled by a totalitarian state that would control the minds and reduce human freedom. It was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film it was not the state, but the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker.
