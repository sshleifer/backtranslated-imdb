Basically, I like Verhoeven’s film, because in his film I like the brilliant psychosexual story that I saw before in Basic Instinct. This is really a wonderful thriller, which I really liked. So I obviously watch this other Verhoeven film. <br /> <br /> Well, this is his former direction before his blockbuster got into Basic Instinct, and I was very curious to watch this film, and yes, the film met my hopes and expectations. <br /> <br /> This film “The Fourth Man” is a brilliant psychosexual drama, which for some viewers is a slightly complex scene. the story of this film is about a gay writer named Rebe (Crabbe), an alcoholic who lives by her moral values ​​and sees many visions that can prevent him from an accident in the future. after the end of the lecture, he imagines a seductive woman named "Christina", who has a mysterious past that she does not want to reveal. Take sex with her at her house, as she is a boy. The next morning, he watches a picture of her sexy macho guy on her desk. The man he met at the station. He is curious to meet him and tell Christine to invite him to her home. <br /> <br /> That's it. I do not want to reveal the whole story, because this is Verhoeven’s film, and the end of the film is really amazing! <br /> <br /> I especially like the character “Roar”, who brilliantly played “Krabbe." . <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Mr. Verhoeven for creating such a black comedy. <I rate this movie: 10 out of 10.
