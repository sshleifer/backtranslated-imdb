Working on a script written in part by Nicholas Pileggi, best known for writing the book Wiseguy, which he adapted in the Goodfellas film, and writing the book and the script for Casino, director Harold Becker shows how connected circles scratch each other's backs, even in a team relatively an honorary mayor, such as Pappas, who is considered president. As Cusack follows the paper trail of the probation report of the dead thug, his skepticism is agitated. How did this cruel young man receive a suspended sentence, not a prison sentence? We meet other players in the conspiracy, not least of whom is Danny Aiello, the political boss of Brooklyn, and Tony Franzioza, the mafia boss whose nephew was shot. How and why these people are connected, I go to the film to disclose, although there is never any fear that they exist. <br /> <br /> Narration is usually told through the eyes of a character from Cusack, a Louisiana seer who admires his boss and hopes to learn from him. Everyone does a lot of bureaucratic knowledge passed down from generation to generation. Some dialogues are gracefully erudite, but given that I have just described the building blocks of history as bureaucratic knowledge, one cannot say that it does not work. The shooting case is based on the seasoning of two other issues on the mayor’s table: Aiello’s charge for the subway stop and the stop in Brooklyn to help the new banking center, and the city’s bid for the next Democratic Convention. Also studied are the individual characteristics, including Aiello's emotional connection with the music of Rogers and Hammerstein. <br /> <br /> Much of the Manshkeit, expressions in Yiddish, which, as Pappas explains to his deputy, are connected with the bond of honor between two men, about what happens between two hands in a handshake. This connection is of little importance to Bridget Fonda, the lawyer of the police association who defends the honor of a dead policeman and fights for the retirement of his widow, even when incriminating evidence appears. Little by little, the deputy mayor comes to the conclusion that menschkeit is such an influential concept that it exceeds its law. <br /> <br /> There are various scenes with a heavy impact, including the scene when the Brooklyn boss comes home for dinner at mid-day his wife expresses her interest through the dish she prepared and then the mafia boss unexpectedly walks in. . There is also a convincing and obviously presumptive late scene between the mayor and his deputy. <br /> <br /> One scene, treated delicately, consists of the mayor’s decision to speak at the funeral of the murdered child in the Harlem church. His advisors tell him that they will not be looking for him there. But he still goes and cheers up to see the merciless hyperbole, Pacino and his character. <br /> <br /> This causes an impressive reaction in the assembly, but the mayor knows, and his deputy knows that it was artificial, and how they scrupulously shy away from discussing this, in a limousine that picks them up, is a subtle exercise of composure and insinuations. This is a scenario that knows that he must give Pacino the reason why most of his fans visit him, and immediately follows his quota, realizing that silence is much more important than speech. <br /> <br /> Pacino and Cusack are convincing together throughout the film: the elderly person is inviolable and conscious, the youngest seeks to learn, but with ideals that do not influence. Pacino is innate with his practical ability to combine common sense and inventive imagination, inspired talent and realism. Cusack moves very freely, despite its gloomy defense. <br /> <br /> The development of the plot by Bridget Fonda is not needed, but it is the result of screenwriter Paul Schrader’s witty insightful faith in the value of each character and each of them. embodied in a serious incarnation. Aiello, for example, is a bright event, because he evokes the joy of his character and sensitivity to his environment.
