I enjoy watching break dancers, especially if they do it, as well as in the best scenes of this film that leads you to a disco club called "Roxy". Especially at Christmas, because there is also an “MC Santa Claus”. <br /> <br /> Even if this is an old film, and even if I shot it from television, when the Finnish State Film Archive showed it in the summer of 2004 on my own big screen I went there to check it out. On the big screen it is much nicer than on television. <br /> <br /> Even if many people here think that watching this on the big screen is a waste of money on a ticket, I disagree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket, I received money worth seeing it, as it is on the big screen, especially in the first row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience and much better than just the video.
