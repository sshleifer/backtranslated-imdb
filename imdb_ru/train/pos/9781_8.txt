I originally heard about TEARS OF KALI some time ago, and it sounded like I was in it, but with all the films I regularly shoot, it’s as if I’ve fallen off my radar. When roaming around the local WonderBook ... I noticed a box for this one and grabbed it. I have to say that I am very glad that I did. TEARS OF KALI is a strange, bloody, sometimes downright creepy movie, which is to some extent limited by its obviously low budget, but still is an interesting and worthwhile hour. <br /> <br /> TEARS OF KALI centers around the fictitious Indian company The Taylor-Erikkson Cult Group, which practices meditation and other rituals, seeking to resist and drive out the "inner demons" of the individual - but obviously these techniques work too well or not good enough (depending on your point of view ...) as the Dark Forces are not only driven out, but also fall on the unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> The film is told in an “anthological style”, with a short, but memorable and “frank” introductory sequence, and then goes into three stories that make up the main part of the film. <br /> <br /> The first one (SHAKTI) tells about a journalist who visits a cult member who is kept in a psychiatric hospital. An undercover journalist wants to explore the Taylor-Ericson cult, but we find that her true motives may strike a bit closer to home. When the interview takes a violent turn, the journalist discovers that she may have gotten over her head ... <br /> <br /> The second part (Devi) concerns a violent young man who was sentenced to psychological rehabilitation instead of imprisonment for beating a young man in a coma. We find that the attending physician is actually a “graduate” of Taylor-Erickson, and his rehabilitation methods are far from the norm ... <br /> <br /> The final story (KALI) revolves around the quackery “faith” healer " and his assistant, who perform "miracles" for a fee. When the healer unwittingly helps one of his clients and actually expels the power he had, the demon can now freely roam and look for a new host ... <br /> <br /> I must say that I really liked the tears of Kali. There are some shortages ki in the film, which prevent him from being really excellent - but this is an original and ambitious film as it is. My biggest trouble with production is a bad and boring overworked dialogue. Rewriting is a subpar, and I would prefer to have the option with subtitles from the original language Some reviewers say that the game is bad, which I do not necessarily agree with. I think that dubbing is so inconclusive that it makes speeches seem stunted, which is actually not the case. In fact, some of the speeches are damn scary (“doctor” in the second segment and “client” in the third easily come to mind ...) and noteworthy. Gore FX is very well made for a low-budget movie, with some graphic scenes called “scissors for removing the eyelid through the cuticle”, suicide with a pencil in the throat, some decent (but annoyingly “shaky”) composure and some more goodies. Not as rude as some of the more “extreme” movies, but definitely stronger than your average horror movie. I also found that the story of the cult group was an intriguing and long-awaited change to the typical horror stuff. There are many scenes of genuine atmosphere and tension, the like of which I have not encountered for a long time. Despite shortcomings in some fundamental aspects, I still think that TEARS OF KALI will appeal to most “underground” horror viewers - some scenes may turn out to be too big for a more massive audience. Definitely recommended - 8.5 / 10
