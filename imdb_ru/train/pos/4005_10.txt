Although at some point I thought it would turn into a Graduate, I must say that Mother does an excellent job with explaining the elderly womanâ€™s sexual desires. <br /> <br /> I am so glad that this is a British film, because Hollywood would never have done it, and even if he did, they would have spoiled it without spending time on character development. <br /> <br /> History unfolds slowly and realistically. The game is gorgeous, the characters are believable, and the dialogue is sensitive. Many times I tried to predict what was going to happen, and I was always wrong, so I was very intrigued by this story. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. And I must admit, I will always look at my mother in a different light!
