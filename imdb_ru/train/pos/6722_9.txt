Everyone has already commented on cinematography (from good to great), personality (more than life), structure (chronological, with many references to the culture of surfing in time). What is missing is a big issue of sociological importance: to throw mainstream American culture into something more useful and useful. <br /> <br /> I was a surfer in the 1970s. We used to watch 16 mm films in local schools in Zocal. I remember a wonderful feeling of surfing all day long, until my skin radiated warmth, put on a Hawaiian shirt and shorts and was going to watch the latest surf movie at night. Often the narrator was the director himself, who read the script from the sheets of paper. Sometimes a surf band or a proto-punk band would add music. I have never been happier. With the exception of screams and screams, the viewing of “The Riding Giants” took me back in time. <br /> <br /> It also reinforced the feeling that life is on the verge of life, not worrying about money and climbing social and corporate Stairs, keeping up with the Jonesses, pushing yourself physically and mentally to a fleeting moment of joy and exultation - maybe the answer to the question: “What is the purpose of life?” At least for people like Greg Knoll, Laird Hamilton and the like, they seem to have found that few of us are brave enough or honest with ourselves to strive for to live only on our own terms. Maybe society will fall apart if we all do exactly what we wanted in life, but it's great to see people who actually fulfill their dreams. <br /> <br /> This message really struck me.
