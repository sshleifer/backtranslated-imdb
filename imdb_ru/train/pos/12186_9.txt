This film is not as good as many believe (including my late aunt, who said that this is her favorite film). But thanks to the best roles in this film "Noir", in particular the fact that the finale of the Merry House is rightfully known, "The Lady from Shanghai" has become important, in addition to being the key to the saga of Orson Welles' failure to conquer Hollywood. <br /> <br /> By 1946, the position of Wells as a Hollywood figure was mixed. "CITIZENS KEYN" was not recognized as a great film, which he has since seen because he was attacked by the Hearst press and Hollywood insiders themselves. Wells’s attempt at total control (directing, producing and performing) of his films seemed to threaten the entire system. His best work during this period was Edward Rochester in Jane Eyre, allegedly shot by Robert Stevenson, but in fact to a large extent (with Stevenson's blessing) Wells. But the merit went to Stevenson. Only Stranger, a film that benefits from post-war interest in escaping Nazi war criminals, made a profit. For five years spent in Hollywood, it was almost a big record. <br /> <br /> Wells returned to Broadway in 1946, hoping to regain his critical abilities by shooting the film “WORLDWIDE” in 80 days. But, despite the help of Mike Todd and Cole Porter in writing the score, the musical was unsuccessful. His failure occurred just when his wife Rita Hayworth was on the rise with her image of Gilda. So the wedding went hand in hand. <br /> <br /> Wells had to earn money - his Broadway production led to his personal bankruptcy. He sold his interest in Todd’s “Around the World” potential rights (which he eventually regretted), and he also sold the idea of ​​a film about Henri Desire’s Landre Charlie’s career to Charlie Chaplin, which should have been sent to that (and who turned it into Monsieur Verdu). <br /> <br /> The story says that Wells, with a tax invoice of $ 10,000.00, called Kohn and offered to make a film with Rita for an initial payment. Kohn was ready to do it, but naturally he asked what kind of film it was. It was a wise question. Wells talked on a pay phone in a New York pharmacy with a book department. He grabbed a book with the title “Lady from Shanghai” and said it was a great thriller. Somehow, Wells convinced the usually shrewd Kohn that Wells knows what he is talking about. Cohn said he would consider getting rights, and sent Wells his advance payment of $ 10,000. After Cohn hung up, Wells bought the book and read it - and found that it was really very bad. He spent a lot of time rewriting the script and the script that would have allowed Elsa Bannister to form Rita’s character. <br /> <br /> Of course, she has a curious story. Michael O'Hara is a sailor / loader. He rescues Elsa Bannister when she is attacked by gangsters in a park in San Francisco. Elsa is married to Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloan), a criminal criminal with a disability. She convinces him to hire Michael as a skipper for their yacht. The cruise also contains the ominous partner of Bannister George Grisbee (Glenn Anders) and one Sydney Broome (Ted De Corsius), who turns out to be a detective hired by Bannister to observe Elsa. When they can, Michael and Elsa are trying to find time together, but Broome or Grisbee continue to appear. <br /> <br /> Grisbee makes a proposal to Michael - he wants (for reasons related to his so-called fatalistic view of modern society). fall out of it, pretending to be dead. According to Grisbee (here the plot becomes grim), he can still collect his life insurance (albeit dead?) And use it to escape to the southern seas. He will pay Michael 10,000 dollars if he pretends to shoot Grisbee. This includes the actual signing of the murder confession document (Michael does not understand that such confession will eliminate the need to produce a corpse if all other evidence suggests that Grisbee is probably dead). <br /> <br /> Of course, Grisbee was killed, and Michael was arrested for this and for the murder of Broome (shot from Michael's gun). Michael is tried with Bannister, defending him, and discovers that the latter is doing secondary work because he wants Michael to be convicted. Michael is convinced that Bannister is a real killer, and he manages to escape just before the jury sentence. He is knocked out and sent to the desert carnival, and this leads to the famous “fun house” sequence and the end of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a terribly confusing movie (as I have already commented on), This does not mean that you should not watch - it is visually amazing. Witness the fight between Michael and the police in the quarters of the judge, where he knocks out the bailiff in the judge's bookcase, breaking the glass. Or clever use of photography to capture Hayworth’s diving from a cliff reflected in the slutty Grisbee’s binoculars. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good, in particular, Sloane (perhaps the best part of this great actor in the movie). Glenn Anders was the lead singer on Broadway. He rarely starred in films before The Lady from Shanghai, and his slimy Grisbee is memorable. Ted De Corsia also does a very good job with Broome, a detective who is really looking for his own interests, for his price. <br /> <br /> As for Hayworth, she turns into a performance that was not like most of what she did before (BLOOD AND SAND, TALES OF MANHATTAN and CLUB BLOND are exceptions), and this is an unforgettable siren. Wells O'Hara is a very unusual character for an actor - a pleasant, but naive person who learns hard not to believe what he secretly wants to believe. It's not KANE, AMBERSOMS, OTHELLO, TOUCH OF EVIL or CHIMES at midnight, but it's a good movie for all this.
