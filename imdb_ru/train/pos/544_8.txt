I like this movie. He was almost the same as the first (lake house), but instead of just killing women, he kills men as well. And the scenes are much more interesting, firstly, my two favorite scenes, when Stanley and Allison are in a dance club, and he describes the last moments of Kimberly before being thrown into the water, and, secondly, when Stanley visits Allison in his basement, just before they head to the set when she kisses him. Those scenes, for me, were very intense and exciting. I gave the film a rating of 8/10, not because the film was bad, but because the shooting was bad, I mean, there were times when you noticed that nothing happened, for example, it was shot as usual films. a snapshot, you will not see a “live” shooting from the camera, but then, very little, you will notice mistakes when shooting. something went wrong??
