“An album of such old songs that everyone thinks they are new.” This film has an elusive combination of tempo and mood, which distinguishes some of the films from the initial moments. And why not? The towering talent from Lady Judith Dench as a widow who plays saxophone with a street musician to help him understand the songs, for Olympia Dukakis as a cheerful widow living in a Scottish castle for the alimony of her many marriages, for Ian Holm as a drummer who loved all the participants World War II all girls (more or less) swing groups. But wait, that's not all. Add Leslie Caron on bass and finally the incomparable Clea Lane on vocals, and Blonde Bombshells has been the most popular band in England since the Beatles. Well, well, not really, but this film is a winner. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth (Dench) conducts the entire film, trying to reunite Blonde with bombs to play in her granddaughter's school dance. And before you roll your eyes, imagine how difficult and brave it would be for many women immigrants to take the stage before the generation of Britney Spears after the act called “Open Wound”. <br /> <br /> At an age when the careers of actresses end by the age of 30, the second album of most groups is a compilation of the best hits, and music older than a month has almost no chance of being broadcast, it’s great to see real talent, real music and Truly good movie came from bbc. <br /> <br /> I like this film, and I know that I will watch it many times, and every time I get even more pleasure.
