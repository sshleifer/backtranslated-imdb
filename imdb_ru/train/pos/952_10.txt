So, this made for television films only 7.6 points on this site? Bah! Nonsense! Without a doubt, this classic 1984 Dickens fairy tale is the best ever made. And yes, the hound saw the 1951 version, which was also good, but not good enough. The lack of color is perhaps the biggest drawback of this version, although the game was wonderful. <br /> <br /> George S. Scott is just as incredible as Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of this miserly businessman who is haunted by the ghosts of his dead partner, and then three other spirits later that evening. Scott is really rude like Scrooge. Too coarse for some critics who claim that he cannot project the newfound jubilation that he awakens on Christmas morning after the spirits taught him a valuable lesson. But hey, this is George S. Scott. He is never going to dance down the street in a fit of joy. He has too much dignity, and his Scrooge realistically conveys his emotions. <br /> <br /> Supporting performances are equally as excellent as the costumes, music and scenery. 19th century London comes to life in the visionary style of Clive Donner. The film even borders on frightening several scenes with the participation of spirits However, the important moral story shines through every frame. <br /> <br /> This version will no longer be televised frequently, and this is disappointing. The version of the Christmas carol of 1984 should become an indispensable part of the celebration of the holiday in every family. When decorations come out of the basement, this film should get into the DVD player at least once per season. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Dog.
