Film / documentary about different people in Austria on the hottest weekend of the year. It follows what they do, and perhaps more than they do. The pace is very quiet ...... so you should relax ....... inhale ... exhale before you see it ... <br /> <br /> At first you think ... but nothing it doesn’t happen and you’re a bit angry at that .. and that’s the problem, because this is the mood of the film and really good socially realistic pictures that are good in this movie ...... ..... many people will say it's disgusting ...... but it's not so bad ... I think it is more used for marketing .... and there are some really funny moments ... 60 old woman is undressing ..... I guarantee this is the most obscene striptease in the history of the movie ...... his movie, which is real .. I think that word is ...... right in the face ... .... and it makes it a bit intimidating. no computer manipulations here ..... his real life ... and, as we all know, movies can beat reality when it comes to sick cases ...... .... so much worse in the real world ....... <br /> <br /> If you survive in a movie, you can start looking at your neighbors and think ... maybe they are like a man in a movie. He’s a film ... I bet they there are many ... sick ... crazy people living with a beautiful facade ........ after watching the film, I feel that it is more interesting to watch it at my neighbors ........ <br /> < br /> But maybe you shouldn't look b this film on the first date .........
