This movie is just ridiculous. mindless but funny. to fully enjoy this movie, you can’t have an idea of ​​how this movie is going, and just enjoy all the side jokes and puns that are associated with the movie. I still find a little funny at the beginning when he says "I want a beer ........ rooster." funny things. but what makes a film decent is the fact that it does not try to make a serious spin on the film, too many comedies try to have serious aspects that you simply do not believe. But it is different and just focuses on being funny. I have to say that Yasmin Blet is terrible in the film and does not add anything, but the 3 main guys, the chicken coop, the timer and the hacks, are very funny to watch and make the film wonderful
