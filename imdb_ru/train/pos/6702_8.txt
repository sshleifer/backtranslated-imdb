Although there are no new episodes, and this is rarely shown. I loved Sabrina's magic and the young witch. I've never seen the latest episodes, but I want to know what happened to Miles or Josh? And why should aunts disappear from the show forever? I am sure that the final was perfect. But there are many unanswered questions. And I want to see the last episode of S.T.T.W! Because I heard that she decides between Erin and Harvey on her wedding day! I really hope she chooses Harvey! And can I say that Neith Richart is HOT !! It is a pity that he is too old for me. Melissa Joan Hart has her own sense of attraction, which she adds to the show, but there are many little “stupid” things for the show, such as how famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs, and the whole cast is listening, its kind of stupid. Plus, the cat is starting to really become lame, as the show went on, the jokes became just silly, and at the things that the audited “audience” was laughing at, I think it was so stupid. Don't get me wrong, in some places it was funny, but I think the show just lost its “magic”, so to speak, in the course of the show. I pay tribute to all the actors, although for trying, although this girl from “Soleil Moon Fry” had no taste, and she was a terrible actress. I wonder what Melissa or some of the actors are doing now on this issue, now that the show is over?
