I know, I know: this is childish. But I just love this type of movie. The bird, which suffered a lot of "failures" and still has not lost faith in humanity and sense of humor. What is special about this film is that the main character is Paulie - the parrot - and he is not used as an incentive for some kind of hot man-actor. In addition, I like the storyline: Pauly talks about her life as a cleaning lady at the very moment when he reached the bottom. (By the way: Jay Moraâ€™s voice almost sounds like Joe Sands!). And Cheech Marin, of course, a man for me Humor. Since I saw "Up in Smoke", I appreciated his naive way of speaking, turning a simple situation into a fun one ... I can't help myself.
