I love Monte Carlo and really enjoyed this movie. I thought everyone was very good. I was not familiar with Richard Lewis, I thought he made his character (Julian Peters) very personable, funny and attractive. Sean Young was very good, because a bewildered rejected girl with a heart of gold. George Hamilton was a charming and perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has a field day as a friend. James Belushi is hysterical like a complete moron. Cybill Shepard played a very sweet, vulnerable, ignored housewife. Delightful cast. A lot of talent, smart script, a lot of what is happening and beautiful locations. Just nice to pick me up on a dreary day. Especially in winter, when a trip to Europe is not going anywhere.
