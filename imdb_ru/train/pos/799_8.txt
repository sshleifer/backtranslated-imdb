he is the most significant daffodil and manipulator; in this case, depicts a lawyer (and murderer) Tom Kapano. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Morris sympathizes with her victim, Anne Marie Fahey, but in the beginning it is too much a victim. We regret the current situation, but we are simultaneously disgusted after seeing that he was the victim of several other women (including Rachel Ward). <br /> <br /> The sad part is where she actually gets help with the self-esteem of the problem, and Capano actually killed her psychologist. It is hard to believe, but it was based on real events. <br /> <br /> Olympia Dukakis plays the role of Kapano's mother (excellent). In general, an interesting story, because it is based on a real murder, and you want to read the book of Anne Rule, to get the exact details. 8/10.
