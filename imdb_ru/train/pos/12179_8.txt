I accidentally watched this movie a few days ago, switching channels. My expectations were not very high, but it was an interesting film. In The Guy, Jason Lee plays Paul, a straight-haired guy from Seattle, who is going to marry his bride Karen (Selma Blair) and get settled into a life in a middle-class family. We first meet with Paul at his bachelor party, where he does not state his desire to participate in any ordinary bachelor party activity that his (surprisingly few) friends encourage him, in case he is a little naughty and starts to worry about his emergency trouble and contention. Of course, the next thing Paul knows is that morning after night, he lies in bed with a naked hula dancer and calls her mother-in-law to tell him that Karen is on the way. Oh, and the hula dancer is cousin Karen Becky (Julia Stiles). <br /> <br /> From this small acorn of a potential problem, a mighty oak of violent unhappiness springs up, as Paul moves from an accident to an unhappy adventure, trying to hide what he did while maintaining the look of an obedient, family-oriented good guy, who is very excited about his upcoming weddings. His efforts to keep Karen ignorant of any possible wrongdoing on his part, ironically, makes Paul closer and closer to funny Becky, forcing him to wonder if he really wants a life that seems was scheduled for him, the film contains the right combination of comedy and romance. Definitely worth a look.
