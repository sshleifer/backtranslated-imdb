Big bad swimming has a small budget, indie feeling about it. So many times I start watching independent films that have received really good reviews, only to find out that they are ambitious, people voted for them, so blinded by the idea of ​​the film and its potential to be provocative, that they forget that the film is primarily entertainment. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if the big bad swim has any message or a higher meaning or metaphor, if so, I missed it. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, the BBS felt good, it was light, warm and humane, there were no serious dramas or meaningful ideas, I just immediately contacted the characters. And when, like in all good films, the end came, I felt sad because of the loss of this connection. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something big, fast or insightful, look for a movie that is trying to deliver more than it can. BBS provides a solid, enjoyable, real experience, and I felt rewarded and satisfied when I saw it.
