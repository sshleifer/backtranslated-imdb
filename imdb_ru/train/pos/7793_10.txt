My brother brought this film home from hire, and I remember that I expected it to be boring. I think the name especially alienated me. I can't remember when I started the film with such low expectations and when I was completely won. I watched the movie twice before letting my brother take him back to the store. Very rarely does a film tell me like this. I was completely caught up in Ruby's situation as she tries to make her way through her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly. I could watch for hours. Another disadvantage is that I was unhappy with everything Ashley Judd has done since then. She is so beautiful in this movie. This film is easily included in the top ten of my favorite.
