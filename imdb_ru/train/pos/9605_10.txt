well, I wasn't sure what the movie would look like, since I only saw a small clip, but I thought it would be good, and I was right, I watched it twice a day when I received it, and this is my favorite film. <br /> <br /> I think Alison Lohan played the role of Beth really well, she is such a wonderful actress, and the writer must have done a lot of research to learn about bulimia, although the end when Beth in the hospital has 2 observations Horus after eating, because I was told that 1 house was okay, and that hospitals did not help with bulimia, because I was told that it was probably why I was still at home, although my sister and mother would like me to I was hospitalized just like me to get bulimia, but this is a good film that I recommend Sun people who suffer from eating disorders or not, or people who know someone with eating disorders, as he can allow them to penetrate the bulimia person and see the world as they do throughout the whole lattice film, and I recommend it to anyone and any type of person
