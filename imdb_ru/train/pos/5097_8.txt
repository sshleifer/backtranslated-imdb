This is a very rare film and probably the least known of the Shirley Temple, because it is not in any of its collections. The reason is probably that he has no happy ending, unlike all her other films. musical, although she shouts out one song called “The world owes me life”. The film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white, I have a color version on VHS, I would say that they did an excellent job, because the color looks realistic, unlike what I would say, color Laurel and Hardy films, which are terrible. The film is good for its age, and the story is not dated at all, I'm surprised that no one tried to do a remake. At times, the film is a bit talkative, as some scenes with Gary Cooper and Carol Lombard seem really protracted, in some scenes it seems to take fifteen minutes to say what they could say in five. Although you should not put it off because there are really good moments in this film, especially when {Jerry} Ga ry Cooper steals the necklace and hides it in Shirley's teddy bear. Tension and slowness accumulate in his actions, (although at the same time his daughter sings in front of an audience in another room) very well directed. facial expressions, when they are under scrutiny, are also very good. In all this, a good movie from the early 30s, accept it for your age.
