I think that if there is magic in a movie, I donâ€™t need it to be smooth or flowing. He can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slowly in others, and so on. Magic in this film: a scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley and Iris, but they do not detract from the overall positive effect of observing people who help each other in those areas of life that seem most incomprehensible are the hardest to fix. Both characters are smart. Yet Stanley cannot understand enough to function, because he cannot read; he cannot read, because he had too many adventures in his childhood. Iris, though well-educated, did not have enough adventure, and therefore she could not figure out how to go through the reversal that happened in her life. The characters complement each other both weaknesses and strengths. It may be quite difficult to admit that the iris will work in a factory year after year or that Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work on a construction site or other better-paid job. And although these "riddles" are explained in the course of history, their disclosure seems somewhat contrived. I guess no one took the time to rethink the script. Despite this, this is a good movie - just imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would do on the screen if someone did it!
