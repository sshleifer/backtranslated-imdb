The performance of “Lily Mars” is a really nice little film that demonstrates the comedic abilities of actress Judy Garland, as well as her standard moments of singing. The plot consists of how Lily Mars followed producer John Thornway for her big break. I think that comedy is light and not too heavy. I really recommend this film for everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role!
