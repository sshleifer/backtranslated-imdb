H.G. Wells Classic was a few incarnations. Version 05 Speilburg and the classic version 53 But only this one remains completely true to the book. Nothing has changed, nothing has been deleted. <br /> <br /> Originally released as a 3-hour film. The director cut the film to 2 hours of pure skill. He received a visualization of the pages of the novels, chapter by chapter, that “Wells will be proud of.” History, as we all remember. Martians invade Earth with capsules containing an army of combat vehicles on tripods. The people of the 19th century are poorly prepared to repel alien forces and to repel canons and cannons, whose shells are connected directly to Walkers, and when humanity is no longer a universal force, they are saved by the smallest organism on earth. <br /> <br /> The film is a great achievement for director Timothy Haynes, who has great potential because he brought this vision to life with a meager budget of 5 million. B-Movies today have large budgets.
