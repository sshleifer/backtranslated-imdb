This is undoubtedly the scariest game I've ever played. This is not the usual type of "fps" everything that moves "(which I usually don't care about), but an acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, great surround effects (" Scryeeee, scryeeee .. ") and above all the incredible atmosphere. I like Scrye , which allows you to see or hear events that happened in the past in certain places of the games. The only game in which I had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of the game only because of the intensity of the atmosphere. I am a big fan of horror, especially in stories and movies Clive Barker, and participation in such a terrible story makes me crave for new games that emphasize the atmosphere and a more exciting story. 9/10 (-1 because I'm not a fan of FPS, or maybe the game was a bit short?)
