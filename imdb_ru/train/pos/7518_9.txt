Beautifully made with a great performance from the Gretchen Mall, which captures such impeccable happiness in her work, and the re-creation of small films and photos is beautifully done and often funny. According to Harron, they used film, which is no longer produced, and studio lighting in the style of the fifties, even for outdoor spaces, to give the colored pieces their own special look. Betty Page saw the film in Hugh Heffner's house (she is now eighty-three) with the producers, but not with the director, in case it is embarrassing if she doesn't like it. Apparently, she liked it before the official investigation, which she found disturbing. Some great costumes too. The idea for the film began in 1993, but it was worth the wait. Her portrait never seems to be false in relation to all those images and fragments of (terrible) films that many of us have already seen. This would be an interesting addition to Goodnight and Goodluck, but much more enjoyable!
