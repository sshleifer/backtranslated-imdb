one of the best ensemble films I've ever seen. The plot is not so much, but the game is incredible. You see that the characters change very subtly, they affect the rented villa in Italy and they love it. And happiness. The film will cast a spellbound spell on you, as well as the villa of all women. Truly "enchanted."
