* It contains spoilers due to the fact that I had to describe some of the techniques of the film, so read at your own risk! * <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. The use of toning in some scenes creates the impression that the old photograph comes to life. I also liked projecting people onto the rear screen. For example, in one scene, Leopold calls his wife, and she projects behind him, rather than on a typical split screen. She has a huge face in the back, and Leo has it in the foreground. <br /> <br /> One of the best uses is when the boys kill Ravenstein ravens - a scene shot in the almost political style of a poster. with a close up of the face. It reminded me of the Battleship Potyomkin, of that intense constant style, coupled with splashes of red, to convey tons of horror without much blood. It’s the same with the scene when Katharina finds her father dead in the bathroom ... you can only see red water from the side. This is one of the things I like about Von Trier, his understated horror, which ultimately makes him even more creepy. <br /> <br /> The use of the text in the film was unique, for example, when the character Leo pushed the word werewolf. I have never seen anything like it in a movie. <br /> <br /> The use of black comedy in this film was well done. Ernst-Hugo Yaregord is as great as Uncle Leo. This raises the laughter I got from his role in the Kingdom (Righet). This humor makes the plot of the absurd anal restraint of train conductors against the terrible background of World War II and all the chaos easier to comprehend. It reminds me of Righet about how the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normal state at the end of the first part, when everything goes crazy. This shows that some people really do not notice the terrible things happening around them. However, some people, such as Leo, are determined, but do not do anything positive about it. <br /> <br /> The voice over, skillfully made by Max von Sidov, is also fun. It draws you into the story and makes you jump into Leo’s head, which is sometimes scary. <br /> <br /> In the film, the thought rises that a man is a coward, if they don’t choose the side. I see the same idea as in “The Dancer in the Dark”, where the character Bjork does not speak for himself and ultimately becomes her own destruction. Actually, at one time, von Trier seemed to me an anti-woman, playing the role of “Breaking the Waves” and “Dancer”, but now I know that his male characters also feel bad! I ended up at the same place during the end of Dancer, when you seriously want the main character to rethink his actions, but, of course, they never do!
