I read countless reports that this game is so similar to Max Payne, when I first played it, I thought it was a slightly strange arcade game with a desire to thwart Max Payne’s style (not just bullet time). So, having played a couple of hours, I realized how much fun it is! and how different it is from Max Payne, yes, bullet time is a bit like, but I think it fits the game differently. This game is a non-stop action game - a mixture of shooting and fighting, as funny as Max Payne’s big fan, I must say that the DTR storyline is not close to the greatness of Max. Payne, the graphics are a bit average, and some levels look the same, but if you want a little more time, you should definitely own this game.
