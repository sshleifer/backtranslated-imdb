I only wish that the Return of the Jedi was directed by someone else, I mean that there are too many scenes that are completely unnecessary. In addition, this time our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo, Luke looks bored, Darth Vader is not as angry as before, and Yoda just dies. <br /> <br /> But there are a lot of unusual things that continue this episode, which I just can not hate. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba's Hut 2- Sailing Barge attack sequence. 3-Emperor (now it's evil) 4-Speeders are pursuing an endor in the forest. 5-Last battle. 6 - The dark side of seduction. 7 - Anakin's return to the good side of power. 8. And the last holiday. <br /> <br /> Some of them are so good that they can cause tears in their eyes. If some scenes were cut out and another director was hired, it would be as beautiful as episodes 4 and 5, but still unusual. 9 out of 10
