I thought the film could have been a bit more complex, perhaps psychologically, but the action and the sound were top notch. The animation was hard computer graphics in many scenes, but very good. This is one of the films of “The Return of Batman / Forever”, which tells about the novels, Wayne's conflicts and dating motives. 007 fans will love this, and women will have a great song! In this film, Wayne was portrayed very well, and Penkin returned to his true form, this time there were no mutant genes in it! I liked the fact that Robin was not used too often, Tim Drake was just a good computer nerd, a kind of Indigo child or the mind of the future. <br /> <br /> Auxiliary cast was composed of some soap opera. Stars, decent talents and characters were drawn to look like voice actors. Kelly Ripa was fun in this movie. <br /> <br /> I rate this lower than Phantasm, The Return of the Joker and Batman against Dracula, but I liked the smarter scenario than I liked Sabzero. 7/10
