Awesome high quality movie. <br /> <br /> Apparently, based on real events, about which, as stated, there is a clear sound of truth, this film is very emotional and deeply touching. <br /> <br /> An offended and neglected child often becomes disobedient in adulthood, as one of the failures of life, be it a gangster, a drug addict, or a burden to society. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher, being a young adult in the navy, is restless. He is on the verge of a loser. He consults a psychotherapist in psychotherapy, and it is these relationships that are central to the play. <br /> <br /> Retrospective shots and therapies disclose the source and cure for Antwones longing. <br /> Outstanding performances from the entire composition. In fact, this story is a family tragedy with emotional and physical torment. All actors give full-blooded performances with confidence and realism. <br /> <br /> One of the messages from the film is the importance of raising children. <br /> <br /> This Antwone deserves success. The fact that he experienced evil in childhood, but rises above it, shows a magnificent character. <br /> <br /> And to all those who experienced such torment, but survived and succeeded: you are all winners. 10 out of 10.
