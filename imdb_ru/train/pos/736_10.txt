A must for any punk rocker, this is the film that made The Ramones a household name in the early 1980s (when it first appeared on premium cable stations). It was one of the first and best American punk rock films, with iconic classic status there on The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Initially, the producers wanted Cheap Trick to act as stars, but the release of the album “Live At Budakon” had just made them superstars and too hot to shoot in a low-budget film. Very good luck for the Ramones, who wanted to escape from the underground world of punk rock and enter the mainstream market (which, unfortunately, never happened until the groups died). The group, especially Dee Dee, always disliked the film in the 80s, but fans always loved and could tell most of the film while waiting for the Ramones show. This film, like most classics, is stupidly funny with some classic Ramones frames in their heyday. Do not expect more, you will not find it. It's a lot of fun, so enjoy. Another classic Allan Arkush film in the same vein is Get Crazy featuring Lee Wing from the legendary hardcore punk band Fear.
