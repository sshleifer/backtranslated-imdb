I like Peter Sellers most of the time. I have never seen him portray a high-class British before this film. He does a good job, although in the mix you see pieces of Inspector Kluzau. It does not get interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives. <br /> <br /> I never expected young Hawn to give such a solid job. Her time was great, and her expressions were priceless. The way she alternately knocks down the dissolute character of Sellers and seduces him is great to watch. Verbal sparring, as I have rarely seen in films of that era. <br /> <br /> The last thirty minutes of the film do not work. It is worth taking just to see the first sixty. Hawn is naked for a few glorious seconds early. Enjoy it...
