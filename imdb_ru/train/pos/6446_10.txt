"SÃ¥ som in himmelen" was probably one of the 3 most beautiful films I've ever seen in my life. That he did not win an Oscar, I will not cry. This film is of its kind, that a victory at the Oscars might have distracted him from this !!! My dear friend Anders (Nyberg), you have made real magnificence with your pen here! Kay Pollak, with your creation and with all who contributed, you all presented a gift of love to our world. Between the points of entry into our world, and then exit from it - you can really say you made it better! Special personal thanks from the bottom of my heart to all of you for bringing back some precious memories from the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden, and my young mind and present Being were shaped and shaped by many beautiful Swedish influences, people, traditions, music and nature. My blessings with gratitude to you all. With love and light, George Gabriel Berkovits Soulhiller, Johannesburg, South Africa
