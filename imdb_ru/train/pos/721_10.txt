ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the Ramones. I was too young during the heyday of the group in the mid-70s to know very well about them, although I had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time. I finally saw RNRHS on TV once in the mid-80s, when I was about fifteen years old, and laughed until the end. (Isn't every high school student's dream of breaking up his school and blowing it up, everything is ready for a rock soundtrack?) I recorded a follow-up movie a year or two later and continued to watch the Ramones live parts again and again and again, thinking ass! I have to check out some of their albums! " The rest is history. For twenty years, a lot of Ramones records / cassettes / CDs and three Ramones concerts later, they are still one of my favorite bands, and RNRHS still turns me on every time I watch them. Now that Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny have left us (R.I.P. all), at least we have this film and a lot of great music to remember.
