The books of James Michener, carrying readers to distant places with strangely sounding names, were probably the most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. His Tales of the South Pacific became the main hit of Broadway for Rogers and Hammerstein. The director of the film "The South Pacific" was directed by Joshua Logan, and he was a natural person to make a film adaptation of another success of Michener, Sayonara. <br /> <br /> It was only a decade before American films during World War II did not portray the Japanese kindly. I am sure that the people who fought in the Pacific War were not easy to change their views overnight. This general policy of not fraternizing with the occupied peoples as a whole lies at the heart of this story of an interracial romance. <br /> <br /> “Sayonara” is a current film today. The military has always interfered in the personal life of its personnel in such a way that no civilian employer could manage legally. In America, at the time of the creation of Sayonara, many states still had mixing laws. Today, gays in the army is a big problem. Someone might one day make a film similar to Sayonaru on this issue. <br /> <br /> Joshua Logan was on familiar ground. In the South Pacific, there was also racism as part of his plot. With confidence, Logan gathered a great cast and created a beautiful story. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner, Kent Smith - some of the Western players do an excellent job. But the picture is stolen here by Orientalists. Miko Taka perfectly hits the target as Brando's love interest. But the real stars are the two that both support the Oscars, the Red Button and the Miyoshi Umeks. <br /> <br /> Button - your ordinary member of the Air Force. He passionately falls in love with Katsumi, played by Miyoshi Umeki. They marry, and the military ruthlessly do everything possible to part with them. They can KNOW what is best for buttons and umeks. The buttons were a television comedian and a fair talent, but he never got a role as good as this in the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> And Oscar Miyoshi Umeki was the first to receive an Oriental one. It got a lot of attention because during the Academy Awards the Miyoshi played a major role on Broadway in the Flower Drum Song. I was lucky to see him on Broadway, it was the first Broadway show I ever saw. I still keep the memory of this. <br /> <br /> This Oscar also symbolized something else. Our war with Japan really ended, and we saw in Sayonar a great nation with proud traditions and culture. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Montalban plays Nakamura, Kabuki theater actor. If Sayonara were done today, Logan would never get away with it. But Montalban is fine. <br /> <br /> Good photography and a great story. This film needs to be reanimated more often, it has great morality.
