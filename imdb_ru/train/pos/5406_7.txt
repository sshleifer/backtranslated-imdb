The 4th Pokémon film made me cry when Selebi died. Do not dare say that pokemon sucks! I don’t like it when people say that ... I like Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should like Pokemon, including this film and other Pokemon movies. So, without further ado, please say that the Pokemon is great and should appeal to people of all ages And also, why do Pokemon haters give low marks for all or most Pokemon films? I do not understand .... They should not do this .... There is absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving that Pokemon sucks, except for the fact that: 1) Pokemon is ONLY for small children 2) pokemon stupid. and 3) people should not love Pokemon. I think this is why people do not like Pokemon.
