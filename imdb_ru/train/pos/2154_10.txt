I have seen this movie many times, and I never get tired of it. This is a classic in every sense of the word. The film is hysterically funny, but at the same time quite touching. For those of you who are not a fan of “subtitles” or a foreign film in general, open your mind. This is a great movie for a "newbie", because the story is very interesting. Don't get me wrong, this is 100% Japanese (and this is what makes it work), but everyone will get something from it (even if it is just a big laugh at one of the main characters named Mr. Aoki - one of the most fun characters I've ever seen!) <br /> <br /> I can't even remember this movie without a smile !! I love it ... and I think most people do too.
