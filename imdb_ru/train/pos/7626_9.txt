I have loved this film since I first saw it in 1979. I'm still amazed at how accurately Kurt Russell portrays Elvis, right up to how he moves and his facial expressions. Sometimes it's scary how he looks, acts and talks like a real Elvis. Fortunately, it comes out on DVD, so that all of us who waited can finally get an excellent quality version of the full-length movie. I heard detractors who say that there are some inaccuracies, or some things are not taken into account, but I think that, bearing in mind that John Carpenter had only about 2.5 hours to work, and it was shown on television (after only two years after the death of Elvis!) that he did an excellent job with this. In fact, I have not seen a single Elvis film that even came close to this. Highly recommended.
