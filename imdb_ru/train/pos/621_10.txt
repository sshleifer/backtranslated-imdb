As a big fan of fantasy in general and the work of Neil Guyman * in particular *, I was looking forward to this film so greedily, so greedily and with such a bitter-sweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that I can hardly believe that it is finally here. And you know what? I didn’t have to be afraid, the movie version is just awful. It differs from the book, but in a good sense it is less capricious, more comical, still deeply sweet and charming. <br /> <br /> The special effects are absolutely accurate and make magic feel like a natural and correct part of the world of the Wall, without being frankly entertaining and intrusive. <br /> <br /> The proper attention was paid to storytelling and pacing, and the main role was triumph with the ghostly princes (whose roll call is almost like “Who is who” in cool British comedy - Rupert Everett, David Walliams from Little Britain ”, Two guys from Green Wing, etc.), stealing most of the best lines and almost all the funniest moments of films that exist in abundance. <br /> <br /> In fact, one small criticism I have about the whole film is that sometimes comedic elements become a bit OTT, the subtlety goes to the window to the detriment of the main story .... For example, Ricky Gervais cameo was too big for me, just “Ricky Gervais makes his usual David Brent from the Office comedy character” and, in my opinion, created an unwelcome and stunning break in the magical spell of the progressing story. (although, to be honest, from memory, I believe that Ferdy’s character in the original book was quite “Ricky Gervais” - a question when I recall this) .... <br /> <br /> But this is a small mistake in another immaculately executed and scripted tale with a good mix of action and romance. Charlie Cox, as the protagonist of Tristan, captured the right mix of naivety, subtle comedy and self-realization necessary for such a story as “a modest young man goes to a life-changing quest”; Claire Danes, like Ivaina, is beautiful, furious and just a little alien or unearthly, the perfect interpretation of her stellar role; Robert De Niro, in the cameo, about which every reviewer speaks, really deserves praise, having fun with pleasure (he seems to have a ball too) ... and Michelle Pfeiffer is triumphantly nasty and disgusting, like the wicked witch Lamia, my favorite movie performance in whole If you liked her amazingly beautiful performance in the recent “Hairspray”, then you will like it too. <br /> <br /> So conclude this review: you will laugh, for sure, you will smile, and you may even cry - Stardust is a beautiful heart-warming fairy tale for the whole family, with a heart of gold and a lot of cheeky minds than immediately striking. One of my all-time favorite movies is Absolutely Fantastic Princess Bride, and Stardust is easily compared to this, because it’s a very similar movie that explores similar themes and territory ... and just like Princess Bride “I remain fresh, smart and funny twenty years after their first release, I believe that the delightful mocking sweetness of Stardust will appear as a family favorite on our televisions (or an equivalent future device!) For many years.
