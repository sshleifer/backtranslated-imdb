In this film there is a very clever humor, which is at the same time a parody of the actors and a tribute to them. However, after a while it seems just an exercise in style (despite the great jokes, such as Balasco, who continues the role of Dussolier, and the very good play of all the participants), and I wondered why Blier did this movie. Everything is revealed in the final when Bli√®re, directing Claude Brasseur, receives a phone call from his father (Bernard Blier) - from heaven and is able to tell how much he misses him. Effective emotional restraint and, obviously, sincere. But in fact, there is not enough dramatic tension or emotional involvement for the rest of the film to be interesting throughout the entire duration of its work. However, there are some really good scenes and episodes, and anyone who likes these "holy places" of French cinema should get a lot of pleasure from this film.
