For me personally, this film is in my top four for all time. With no exceptions. James Cameron argued again and again that he was a master narrator. Thanks to films like Aliens, The Abyss and Terminators, it is clear that he was a brilliant and trusted director of action and science fiction. He sees the story and adds a strange quality to the film. But the Titanic is so different from its other brilliance. The film is extremely touching and gives a place for surprises, plot development and interesting events in the story that everyone knows. The story of the famous journey, sunk in her first journey, is a legend, so Cameron had the task of making a truthful, interesting and interesting film about it. The game is great because Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Jack and Kate Winslet, who plays Rose, became a superstar with the release of this film, and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters are not given much work, but in this film itâ€™s more purposeful because as the story of an elderly Rose (Gloria Stewart) tells her, it quickly becomes apparent that this is the story of Rose and Jack, and no one else. Emotionally it fully satisfies and cannot leave dry eyes in a theater or at home. Music has become iconic and legendary. This is the best soundtrack composer James Horner in the entire history, and he is so much like the movie and the audience. The song after so long has become annoying, but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon that is this film. The only problem, the usual problem of James Cameron, is a dialogue that is remembered, but in a bad sense, as in how foolish it is in some points, but in general. James Cameron presented a masterpiece and a romantic epic that will entice you on a journey of a lifetime. My heart will not continue from this.
