The Grand Canyon falls under a very meager category: it is a very smart film, with very clever dialogues and food for thought from beginning to end. I got the impression that he never got into a well-deserved rating (and never will be) because of its simplicity. This type of flick requires sensitive observers. It is a pity that IMDb makes me write ten lines, because it is by no means necessary in this particular case. In any case, to fulfill this request, I will tell you that the weak point of the film, if there is one, is in the acting: not that it is bad, but it could have been done much better. An exception was made for Kevin Klein, who was perfect. Go and watch it.
