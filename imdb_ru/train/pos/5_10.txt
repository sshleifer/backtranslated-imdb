I entered the middle of this film, so I had no idea about the credits or even about its title, until I watched it here, where I see that your commentators received a mixed reception. I have a positive attitude to this film, but one thing really caught my attention when I watched: a beautiful and sensitive score written in the style of Copland America. My surprise was great when I discovered that the score was written by none other than John Williams himself. True, he wrote sensitive and sharp assessments, such as the Schindler's List, but usually his name is associated with such pompous names like Star Wars. But, in my opinion, what Williams wrote for this film is superior to everything I've ever heard about him, for tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, fully in line with the film’s tender and beautiful plot. And one more of his recent assessment, “Catch Me If You Can”, shows even more wit and sophistication. As for Stanley and Iris, I like educational films such as “How Green Was My Valley” and “Conrac”, this film with John Voigt and his young African Americans accused of South Carolina, and “Renaissance Man” Danny de Vito and t D. A spiritual awakening, a story that cannot be told often enough. This is a great addition to this genre.
