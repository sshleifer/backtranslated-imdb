When this film was first released back in 1984, Prince was one of the most popular actors. Everyone wanted to see this movie, which was nothing more than an extended music video. The acting game was pretty bad, but what can we expect from musicians performing on the big screen for the first time? Despite this, it was still a very interesting film! Morris Day and Jerome Benton offer the classic comedy of all time, especially their performance of The Password, which makes you think that Abbott and Costello are performing their first-person baseball routine. <br /> <br /> Appolina (which then bore one name) provided a beautiful chest, so you covered a brief nudity. Plus she is very attractive. And, of course, the soundtrack of this album is one of the best Prince's ever recorded. Later, Prince fell out with Warner Bros. and changed his name, but at that particular moment in his career he was at the top of his game. <br /> <br /> This film is not rated Time is a great category, but it is quite entertaining.
