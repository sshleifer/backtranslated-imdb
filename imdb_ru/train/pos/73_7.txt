In fact, this is a variation of the House of Wax, both in plot and in the type of role played by the star of both films, Vincent Price. In both paintings, he plays a talented artist, who is sent, overturning, into madness, when his creations are usurped by other, less talented and less scrupulous people. In this film, he plays the illusion designer for stage magicians who seek to start their careers only to become disillusioned when another illusionist, the Great Rinaldo (John Emery) insists that he keeps his contract and gives him the first choice of any illusions he creates . The price is already poorly tuned to Rinaldi, since his ex-wife is now Rinaldi's lover. He uses his talents as an illusionist and a brilliant wannabe to avenge Rinaldi and others who interfere with his plans to gain recognition as an artist and designer. <br /> <br /> Price is almost all the show here and gives a well-priced turn of the star as an offended person whose predicament evokes the sympathy of the audience. The rest of the cast is competent if it is colorless, and the weight of the entire enterprise falls on Price, who bears the burden easily. <br /> <br /> Good Solid B Movie melodrama, this is more of a crime movie than a horror movie, and it's enjoyable if you donâ€™t expect a masterpiece. The picture in black and white has a low level of dried blood and is best perceived as a melodrama and pleases with its presence. star giving a peculiar presentation
