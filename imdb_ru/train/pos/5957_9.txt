The name speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> I am not a film critic, and I will not behave like other snobists commenting on this film. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this film was not my multimillion budget, but the plot was very well done, the acting was amazing, and the cinema was great! Looks like you all had a lot of fun starring in this movie! I voted for 9 out of 10, because the sound was strong only on one channel instead of both, but I think this could be a mistake when burning a DVD. <br /> <br /> I will definitely check out other films produced by Brain Damage Films! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, the cast and crew, thank you!
