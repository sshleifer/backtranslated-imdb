Reading the comments left for this show, I could not help but notice that a large percentage of reviewers either didn’t actually watch any episodes of the show, either during the whole period of validity or of their own accord. The point is kerching! this is what this baby show is for CHILDREN, so it’s obvious that if you’re older, it will seem silly, forced and probably silly. I even found that one person said that the sets were stupid, but I remember how an eight-year-old boy wondered why Ted had molds on his wall, and also wondered if my parents would let me stick some (they wouldn't made). Yes, it can be annoying, acting could be better, and some characters really do weird things with their hair, but as the kids show, I rate it as 10/10. Compared to the things that they broadcast in their place today, well, let's just say that I want it to be retransmitted. DVD release, anyone?
