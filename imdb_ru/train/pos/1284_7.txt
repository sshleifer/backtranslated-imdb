I watched “Nanny” as part of the “Classic Drive-in Classic BCI Eclipse” (with Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. I think this is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> This film collects many stories in a very short time. You have hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexual abuse, blackmail and murder, all in one place! <br /> <br /> Leading actors do a decent job. And I found that the intricately woven plot was believable and interesting. <br /> <br /> However, the cast, first of all the bikers, shows high performance, especially when they are asked to put lines containing only a few words. They may have used real bikers instead of actors. Several characters, in particular, were exceptionally believable. <br /> <br /> Musical accompaniment absolutely exactly corresponds to the time, pace and progress of the story. I found music a real pleasure. I noticed in the opening credits that there was music "Food" in the film, I googled them; but could not find anything ... <br /> <br /> In any case, George E. Carey, who wrote, filmed and starred in this film, really liked the idea (about a wayward married man who was bought out through trial and grief, and, of course, a little help), which he wrote, produced and starred in "Weekend with the Nanny."
