A stylish, capricious, innovative blood bath. Also cheesy, of course, and sometimes cheesy. It reminded me a lot of “Big Heat” because the plot of revenge was started with exactly the same event, and the girl sided with the good guy because of the bad behavior of the bad guy. It's sad that there is no Gloria Graham, but so fantastic that it is Alain Delon, not Glenn Ford. Could anyone be as handsome as Alain, walking in a cashmere sweater and raincoat? However, it is absolutely cool and icy cool. No one in our time can touch him - although someone like Jude Law can try. It is difficult for any girl to look good with him. The music was cool and flawless, and there were several excellent car chases (and this is usually not my cup of tea) - especially one unwitting in the forest. People also met their destinies creatively and bloodily, for example, at the plant dumps. But besides cheese, the general atmosphere influenced and skillfully coped. More creativity, excitement and freshness in this “forgotten” film than most of what I've seen lately.
