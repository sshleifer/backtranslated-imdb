This early Circus melodrama, shot in black and white, is a minor film, but it demonstrates the talent of the German director in turning the tired plot lines into something resembling art. Established in the 1910s, Barbara Stenvik is a woman who sinned, leaving her husband and family in a small town for the bait on the Chicago stage. She never fulfilled her ambitions, and she is drawn back to the city she left because of the impatient letter to her daughter, informing her that she, too, was fascinated by the theater (that is, the high school performance). Returning to her old town, she again faces pettiness, and she has to deal with her hostile eldest daughter, bewildered (and boring) husband (Richard Karlson) and former lover. There is nothing new in the story, but Sirk singles out himself, creating meaningful compositions, with each frame carefully taken, and Stanvik immensely helps him as his leading lady. It works for a clear 76 minutes, and this is also good, because the material does not really have legs to go further.
