I like it! The plot was strange, Drew Barrymore and DC were uncomfortable for both of them. Acting Drews was cunning, but at the time it could be related to her life. Dennis Christopher was very cool, and, as always, he tries his best - in any case, I'm a big fan of Dennis, so I bought a DVD. <br /> <br /> I did not get the ending! that weird animatronic thing with a red skeleton looked the same as if it were out of film school, that's normal, I think, but it could have been more. <br /> <br /> .... and all this with a knife - if it was so uncomfortable, why didn't they just get rid of it? <br /> <br /> It was very incomprehensible when it was a strange Doppelganger thing, or when it was DC - or was it Dennis the whole time? Because Doppelganger figured out with Dennis and Patrick. In the scenes with Patrick, if Dennis were a double, I think Patrick would have noticed. <br /> <br /> The music was fine, but in some places intrusive, the whole orchestral score seemed to revolve around the topic, but this topic was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> A large mix of lots of blood and free nude pictures of Drew. <br /> <br /> In general, a bit of the movie GPM-Guilty Pleasure. Do not read too much, do not look for secret messages and a fantastic script, because you will not find it. There are a few diamond moments and an abundance of nonsense - LOOK THIS AND JUST HAVE A FUNNY WITH THIS!
