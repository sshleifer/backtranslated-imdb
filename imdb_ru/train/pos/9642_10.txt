The film is very realistic. Absolutely, this does not apply to the genre of Hollywood cinema, where each line should be pronounced perfectly and where each step is accurate. Actors playing the roles of lovers do GREAT work, representing the characters' feelings and thoughts - their daily adventures. Overall, the film completes the viewer in a depressed state. This is where the realism of the whole story is obvious. Not everything happens the way we think. I can say that the film does not end on a bad note. We look, we learn, we experience ourselves. This is probably the moral of this story.
