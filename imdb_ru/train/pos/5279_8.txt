I will not repeat everything that has already been said by other viewers of this film. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is an excellent film, and not only as a very human history of the development of relations between a father and his adult son, but also a small window into the world of Islamic confession for those who, like me, do not very familiar with this religion. <br /> <br /> An important aspect of this story is the attitude of the young man towards the beliefs and customs of the father, as well as how his attitude towards religion seems to change imperceptibly as we move along with them. <br /> <br /> This makes you wonder, please. A good film that I would recommend to anyone who has a brain and a heart.
