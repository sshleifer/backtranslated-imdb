The King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is a stunningly beautiful and deeply touching movie. Winner of 16 awards from around the world, this film, based on real events, tells about Wang Bianlian, a street performer of the 30s in China, who is getting older, but he has no heir to pass on his art of opera with a change of face. He has a unique talent for quickly changing masks in performance, and no one knows how he does it. He has a passionate desire to have a grandson, because his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir. Then we go out into the streets and see that people sell their children, because they cannot afford to take care of them: some even beg to take their daughters for free, because their daughters are not worth much in this society. From this moment begins the story of Wang Bianlian. <br /> <br /> The film was so amazingly good, the acting was awesome, and the problems were so compelling and well solved. There is gender inequality and the depressing fact that at this time and in this place no one wants a little girl. It is also interesting to note that the famous opera actor, who always plays a woman and is known as the Living Bodhisattva, is a man who dresses as a woman, and although he is known and respected, he considers himself to be something low, half female. As we delve into the film, we are faced with the problems of the human slave trade and its demand and, therefore, the lack of a possible solution, cruelty and corruption in the armed forces and the police, as well as helplessness and lack of power that any person can for unfortunate events or even good intentions. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best films I've ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Wang Bianlian, presents another great performance,
