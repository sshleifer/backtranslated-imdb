I saw this film in 1969, when it was first released at the South Beach Cameo Theater, now it is the famous nightclub Crowbar. It was the last year of the wild 60s, and this film really gained popularity. He has everything; the gap between generations, the sexual revolution, the desire for success and the conflict between following family "traditions" and the desire to find their own way in life. <br /> <br /> It was a fast-paced, very enjoyable film, Vegas was at its highest peak, City of Sins in all its glory. Beautiful women, famous cameos, laughter, conflict, romance, and even a happy ending. Very pleasant time for all. <br /> <br /> A poster from this film is on the wall of my bedroom. I look at it and go back in time; the time of my youth and my time with my father is a great time in my life.
