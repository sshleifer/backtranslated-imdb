In addition to Susan Hayward's woodwork throughout the film, it was as good as any biblical film. Henry King handles this movie with epic homage in all the little scenes, and Peck is impeccable as always. Alfred Newmanâ€™s exciting soundtrack with an exhilarating twenty-third psalm is memorable even after so many years. The scene with Goliath is a bit crazy, but not so badly done for the era when this film was made. It fits well with the less significant biblical epics of the time: The Song of Ruth and Esther and the King. Worth seeing, and Raymond Massey is superb as the prophet Nathan. The film is completed by the always beautiful James Robertson Justice as Abishay and Jane Meadows as Michel, David's first wife.
