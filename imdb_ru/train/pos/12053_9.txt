A well-made ghost story that will give you goosebumps and some pretty fair fears along the way. The story unfolds slowly, creating an atmosphere until you are ready to see a woman in black. You will not forget it when you see it. No blood, no knives, no hockey masks - just a well thought out story that is best viewed at night when the lights are off.
