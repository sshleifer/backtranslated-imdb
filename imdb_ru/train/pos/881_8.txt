“Read my lips” talks about a strange symbiosis that develops between a simple, socially unscrupulous office employee (Devos) and her intern in the workplace, a coarse former executor (Casel). When the film uncovers this unlikely duet, down to their identifiers, they are drawn into a frightening fusion of minds, each of which uses the other for its own selfish reasons with an extraordinary result. Good material for all in character-based films with strong psychodramatic strokes. In French with easy-to-read subtitles and good translation. (B +)
