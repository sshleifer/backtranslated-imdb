That was what was required to prove. It was a great series, and he really was one of the few that should be counted on! I suspect that in this era of TIVO and recording devices it will be much better than in 1982. I look forward to his DVD release! <br /> <br /> Although itâ€™s true that he has something in common with other television shows, such as Wild, Wild West, Bear Cats and The Adventures of Brisco Jr. of which I am a big fan of QED was a much more intellectual quality to this. However, they did not suffer for it - the dialogue was witty, and the action was high. The show was held in the UK under the name Mastermind, and it had something like a BBC, but with better performance than the BBC, as it was in those times. <br /> <br /> I was a nineteen year old guy, this series was originally held, and there was too much work in my life to devote time to television. However, I remember how my dear mother called me to remind me that Q.E.D. was turned on, and we sat on the phone and watched it together. Wonderful memories. <br /> <br /> Indeed, Q.E.D. This is a sad loss, and if today it could be done with the same quality and values, I would like it to pay off.
