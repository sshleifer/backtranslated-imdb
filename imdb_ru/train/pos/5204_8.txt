I don't watch a lot of porn, but I love a porn star. And I love bloody movies. So when I heard about the gore porn star, I was very happy. Of course, it was many years ago, and when I heard about all the problems associated with creating and ending a film, I never thought that I could see it. But I did, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I liked it, even with all its flaws. <br /> <br /> First, the disadvantages. The story unfolds in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story she wanted to tell is about the Sonia Bean clan from Scotland. So why not just put him there and skip the third-grade report on Samhain / Irish Immigrants / Halloween? In addition, he breaks his own rules by stating that you are safe on the trails, but then the cannibal mutants just start raging everywhere. It is never clear how many cannibals we deal with. There is a large stone castle, which is clearly ancient, but no one has noticed it before. Shy references to horror movies are annoying, just like characters. The heroine has memories of all her dead friends, in which there is a character whom she NEVER MEET. The end does not make sense. <br /> <br /> So what is working? Mountain! Of course, I would have liked more, but it was nice to see such a nasty film, which was not afraid to become nothing more than a bloody film. The two killings are played out, and Taylor Heis has a good disgusting scene. Two wild killings even got extended shots on DVD. I always thought that blood could overcome a stupid story, and Evil Breed reinforced it.
