Billy Wilder is a history co-lender, and his unsentimental touch is noticeable in this rather original story of ghost writers who both work on the burned legend of Oliver Courtney's music. Thank God, the obvious misunderstandings are quickly disappearing, and there is a witty and fresh mix with some beautiful songs (and even more forgotten), Crosby in his most charming, gorgeous twist from Broadway legend Mary Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant, providing most cynical beards (Levant in a rare form, and his wit is not dated at all). A delightful surprise, recommended to all fans of the genre.
