The main reason I wanted to watch this movie was a great cast. A ton of my favorite actors in one film is equivalent to not seeing them. But this film took me by surprise. It was not at all what I expected. It has been a long time since I saw it, but I remember that I could not stop laughing !!! And it was not only the cast that did this for me. The script was amazingly written. Every time you expected something to happen, this did not happen. There were so many twists and turns, but it fits in with the whole tone of the film, and not fancifully. Cinematography, along with the set, was also absolutely beautiful. I really can't say anything bad about this movie! Except that Andrew Davoli would have a little more time on the screen!
