This is the nastiest documentary I've ever seen. It was a simple and breathtaking view of a great idea. Based on photographs of hidden industrial landscapes centered around Chinaâ€™s modern industrial growth, Edward Burtynsky brings controversial issues that we so easily decided to ignore. <br /> <br /> This film is neutral and has no political sides. a moving picture of realities that our Western societies prefer not to inform us about - by-products of economic growth, external effects paid by citizens of less developed communities, the source of our comforts and the loss of our consumer lifestyle. /> <br /> Amazing, heartbreaking, impossible to ignore. This is a difficult journey, but it is worth going through - please stop being ignorant and, at the very least, look at these pictures of the truth without pressure to stand up for these issues. 10/10 definitely!
