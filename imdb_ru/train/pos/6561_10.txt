Honestly, this is the best reality show anyone has ever invented. In order to win money, you must be INTELLIGENT. Not only do you have to be bold, athletic, cunning, etc. This actually requires skills. Not like in some slop-ass shows that go on these days. And yet, they only have two seasons of it! Bull .. they need to return this show !! <br /> <br /> Although it will be difficult for them to pull Anderson Cooper out of CNN. He was great. <br /> <br /> But seriously, it was a terrific show. You never knew who will be when. And it was so fun trying to figure out the mole on your own! It was a show in which you could play yourself if you wanted! <br /> <br /> ACCEPT MORE PRAY !!!! RETURN PRAYER !!!!
