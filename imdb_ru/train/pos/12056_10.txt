Although I liked the haunted home movies, such as Amityville and Poltergeist, this was done for a television adaptation of Susan Hills' books, in which a huge blow to the horrors of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> With a brilliant cast (many of whom starred in Heartbeat and other television dramas), a great acting game and fantastic setting (in which the life of the 1920s is convincingly portrayed), it has all the necessary ingredients to seduce the viewer into a fascinating ghost story. <br /> <br /> Herbert the Wise did not need blood, violence or blood to cause chills throughout the audience. Using your own imagination, "Woman in Black" is a figure of fear and fear, whose presence never disappears as soon as she appears for the first time. <br /> <br /> Protagonist Arthur Kidd, a lawyer, finds out about his invisible ghost. on his mission to populate the estate. The widow dies, and Arthur spends several nights in his dark house, in which he notices many oddities that may haunt him for several days. Some scenes are very disturbing and claustrophobic, especially the locked room, which opens itself, which turns off the generator and closes Arthur in the dark. The film is becoming more scary, the more you put yourself on Arthur's place, and his efforts to get rid of this ghost. The author adds many chilling additions to the story, for example, the appearance of a tin soldier. Man seeks to understand the meaning of all this. The fact that we will never know so much about the widow leaves more to the imagination and makes it even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> Widow mostly looks angry and frightening. The scene after turning on the generator made me feel cold, a woman who appears from nowhere on an isolated swampy land with a howling wind ?? I myself was on such sites, and I can estimate how much it isolates. And the hotel scene was perhaps the most terrible thing I saw, which I don’t want to rush or show to elderly relatives. I often woke up at night, thinking that she was behind me in a dream. <br /> <br /> "Woman in Black" is a great TV movie and a lost gem. I agree to some extent that the excitement on the Internet for this film was completely inflated, and I understand why people were disappointed by spending the best £ 50 on it, but I think the network won the hidden gems because it makes movies , like this, overly naked, I think it still worked brilliantly and fantastically, and I consider it to be the greatest ghostly story of the past century.
