A brilliant chess player visits the tournament and falls in love with the woman he meets there. In itself, this would be a rather bad outlook on history. So that's not all. There is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world due to its brilliance in the game and the fact that the story is following the player. <br /> <br /> This film is a step forward and backward from romantic levity to the tension of the tournament to historical events that have shaped the chess player and work quite well. It is easy to attach to the two main characters and believe that they can fight together, as in this film. The additional effect of the tournament is also very good and creates a good tension setting. <br /> <br /> I have no idea about the strength of chess players, since I myself do not play this game, but it looks beautiful and believable. In general, most of the film is very easy. It is also forgotten again very easily, though. So it's nice to watch, but no more. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 chess players were between the rook and a difficult place
