This film is about a fictional soap opera. It is very fast and fun. To say anything else would ruin the movie. The film has several plots and subplots. This film has the cast with the hottest stars of today. All of them give the best results. This film is my favorite since 1991. Soapdish is perfect for fans of daytime soap opera or prime time soap opera !!!
