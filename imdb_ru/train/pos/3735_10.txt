A really touching story about a recruiting camp in America, where young people are preparing for the war in Vietnam. Human research has always attracted me when it comes to military films, because it translates personal, subjective opinions about war, films about military actions, where actions and technical data are analyzed, to the detriment of the human factor. <br /> <br /> The film manages to take a fresh look at the already ancient theme, and it manages to distance itself from ordinary war films, especially due to the attention to the anti-hero from the point of view of the traditional standard. The film tells about the tragic character Bozz, who deftly avoids being swallowed up by an inhuman military machine, and refuses to give up control of his destiny and fight for what he does not believe in, spending his energy on finding ways to avoid being sent abroad, both for himself and for his comrades, he, ironically, eventually finds his just reason to finally go to war. Perfect irony. <br /> <br /> The acting game is truly exceptional, and documentary-style shooting almost makes you feel transposed into a movie. In addition, the film will give food for thought to those who are inspired by the action of conventional war films or war games enthusiasts, and we hope to awaken the minds of a generation that, fortunately, has avoided the horror of being called upon.
