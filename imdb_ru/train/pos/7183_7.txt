This is the perfect series for family viewing. We gathered around the TV to watch it on BBC America. This is a modern version of Robin Hood, and it is popular with children and adults. Our teenager and teenager love to sit with mom and dad and watch the next feats of Robin. We can’t wait for the next episode to be released every week and are happy to watch “On Demand” for free. <br /> <br /> In the wardrobe there is a place for fashionable things. Every story has a moral. It is interesting. Violence is not excessive or unnecessary. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with the feeling of John William. This is a story about the old world, which comes to life again with a new worldview. <br /> <br /> There is so much rubbish on television, from the rotting of the brain of a “reality show” to senseless violence. You have to take it for what it is, and this is the updated “Robin Hood”, which cannot be compared with the exploits of the film of Errol Flynn. This is a gem for everyone. Parents who are concerned that their children are watching too much violence will love that Robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed. He is Robin Hood, who would rather try to find a way out of the disagreement than to fight. Maid Marian is also an attractive role model for young girls. Instead of standing apart and doing nothing, she assumes her role in helping the poor, being the “Night Warden”. The Nottingham Sheriff is delightfully unjust, as the Sheriff should be, and looks like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne plays an extremely handsome actor who makes most women want him not to play the role of a bad "guy." <br /> <br /> The only question we have is "Where is the Friar So?"
