This comedy, located in the city center and around Detroit, turned out to be a terrific new comedy duet. "Noriyuki Pat Morita" - a very funny man who turned out to be a policeman from Japan following a thief of industrial secrets who stole a super prototype type of turbo reluctantly goes to the United States to trace the thief, on the orders of his commander. Character Pat faces the character "Jay Leno," quickly speaking, "but right up to a business player like Detroit policeman. Although, when they cross paths, the honorable “Paths” of Japan meet all the paths of the old-school Detroit “Path” police. At first they stumble and stumble over each other, but then they develop a “rhythm” that turns into an explosive two-layer team that solves the matter coldly. After the battle with the city's criminal authority for the stolen “equipment” and the closure of the case, the two moved from contempt to each other to friendship and teamwork. A little worse due to wear and needing long vacations on top of that, they manage to come to a victorious closure. I rated it as 9. Lewis directing makes it an almost perfect comedy. Fun for all ages. I highly recommend it. (***)
