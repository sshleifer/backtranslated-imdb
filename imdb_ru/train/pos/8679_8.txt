If you're a fan, then you will probably like it. If you do not know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca or Seduction Cinema are, this is not the movie to start with. It's very cute, stupid, the girls are hot, and they are interesting to watch. There is no sex until the very end of the 45-minute film, but the cheesy and plot score is not boring. In this film, Misty Munda has bad makeup, and her hair is braided in awkward braids, so she is not as good at it as in others. But her panties are pretty cute in this (you just need to watch a movie so that it doesn't sound very strange). If you like it, you will surely like “The Girl of the 70s”, “Vixens Vixens” or “Erotic Survivor” (which is a bit more sexy). If you prefer to watch Misty or Esmerelda in less sexy, more horrible / exploited (but less expensive) movies, visit the Factory 2000 website.
