I remember watching it in the 1970s - then I recently borrowed a couple of episodes from our public library. <br /> <br /> With a break of almost 30 years, I came to a different conclusion. Most of the leaders surveyed in this series — some in the center of power, such as Traudl Junge (Hitler’s secretary), Karl Dönitz (head of the German navy) Anthony Eden (Great Britain) — have long gone, but their accounts will live at first hand. The generals and admirals of sergeants, Russian civilians who survived in concentration camps, are all registered here. <br /> <br /> I can recall Lord Mountbatten's interview (killed in the 1970s). <br /> <br /> This is really a gem, and I believe that the producer of this series was knighted by Queen Elizabeth for this work. - deservedly so. <br /> <br /> After seeing these few episodes from the library, I want to buy a set. <br /> <br /> This is the only “10” that I have given in any review, but I have discovered it as a bottle of wine, it is valued with little time ...
