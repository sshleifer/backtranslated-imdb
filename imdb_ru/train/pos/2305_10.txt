I thought it was a very good movie. It would be nice to see a little more in the film about how the two sisters knew that every sympathy of the same boy even before he was killed. Iâ€™m sure that if the film were shot this way, it would have a completely different end, so it made this film so good. This shows that no matter what happens in your life with your brothers and sisters, you can always go through it, and that if two sisters deal with a boy (the same boy) who works through pain and pain, Everything becomes seem better and easier to work between 2 of them. It's nice to see love stories in which someone's life happens to be a terrible thing that you can still get when it gets even closer after it ends. I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I still love it when it appears. It seems I watch this every time this happens. It would be nice if there was part 2 for this film, maybe if the older sister came up and gave birth to a child, it would really make a wonderful ending to the story after his death, so it will keep him alive, although he is dead.
