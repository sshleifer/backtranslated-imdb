Paris is a place where you can enjoy beautiful art and music and fall madly in love - like in this movie. A boy meets a girl, they fall in love, but something stands in their way of eternal happiness, a classic story. <br /> <br /> George Gershwin’s wonderful music complements the great dance of Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. “An American in Paris” is a humorous, carefree, loving film that is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br />
