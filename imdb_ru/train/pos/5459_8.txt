BABY FACE is a dynamic, wise crack, knowing a smirk about a film that lasts only an hour and 15 minutes, but oh, what a smart they are 75 minutes <br /> <br /> What a story which covers so many questions, can be told in such a short time, makes most of the modern filmmakers ashamed. Scriptwriters <br /> <br /> today have to study the economics of BABY FACE and reduce the scope that <br /> <br /> overwhelm many of their films. <br /> <br /> The story is not nonsense. Immoral woman rises to wealth first under <br /> <br />, and then above the bodies of men who fall madly in love with her. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the production code pushed him towards the Atonement, a happy ending, <br /> <br /> but itâ€™s not hard to see which direction the writers wanted to move <br /> <br />, Enjoy what you have, and use your imagination for a holiday, Stanwick is awesome, like George Brent and Douglas Dumbrill as the unfortunate suitor <br /> <br />. Not a very good movie, but definitely enjoyable. If <br /> <br /> you have never seen BABY FACE, catch it the next time it is shown on the cable <br /> <br /> or rented a tape. It is worth the effort ..
