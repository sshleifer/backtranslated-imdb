This film was an interesting take of Hollywood on the novel of the same name Pearl S. Buck. While some today may think that this is replete with racial stereotypes, at that time the very idea of ​​Chinese heroes was progressive in itself. I found that the white actors playing in Chinese were not as bad as I expected it was not the Asian equivalent of blackface. At that time, there were no Asian actors in America (even George Takei did not play), and Rainer did an excellent job with her role. It was not the best performance I've ever seen, but for the pre-methodical game of the old school, it was nice. The scene with the locust was very well filmed and contained compelling special effects. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the release time of the film during the Great Depression turns this film into an allegory. Especially the political upheavals confusing the peasant peasants, and how they seem to lag behind all this. <br /> <br /> The film had some parallels with John Ford’s style, but I think the Eastern influence influenced him. If it were a Western family, the locust would have won at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust and gluttony . However, here he learns a lesson and wins.
