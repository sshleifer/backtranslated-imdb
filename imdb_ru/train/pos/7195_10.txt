I really liked this exciting Republican TV series! The story was one of the best I've ever seen! Even so, the image quality was not the best, but everything is in order. The fencing in this series is also a bit bad, but not terrible. They should have practiced some more. As I said, the story is great! You just sit and wait to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is great! This is the same guy who did the music for the Zorro Walt Disney version, who did the music for the Faytin Legion. The costumes and buildings are very nice. Zorro is really cool and legionnaires too! I highly recommend this series. Buy it! <br /> <br /> I love the fact that Reed Hadley plays Zorro! He is fun, smart and brave! Rating: 6.
