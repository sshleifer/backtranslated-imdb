You must see this to be believed! Directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield did a really wonderful thing, it's 10 out of 10, so I can't believe that other users of this network rated it so bad, if only they didn't expect to see just a normal movie with people, love scenes, etc. I am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are a great way to wake us up to save our beautiful planet. Finally, this has nothing to do with Al Gore’s documentary “Inconvenient Truth”, mostly made from long monologues, painfully and with “truths” that are not always accurate, as many scholars have already pointed out. <br /> <br /> The best thing you can do on earth is not to miss the earth.
