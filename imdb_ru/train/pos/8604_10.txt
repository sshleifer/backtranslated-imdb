I know that many people do not like this film, but I just think it is amazing. I can't say anything special, but I think this is a good movie. The songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful, and there are many funny lines in the film, especially when Brigitte learns about what is possible and what is not in society. If you like musicals, I would say that you will like this one!
