I saw this film that day when it was released last year. I thought funny. Well, now it's on video, and I saw it again. I love this film! What they do is sometimes stupid, but thatâ€™s what makes my third favorite movie of all time. The special effects are fine, but a witty dialogue will make you roll. I am the person who will say that I am inspired by this film, so if you like dramas and other things, avoid. But for everyone else, enjoy! The game is great. Hank Azaria is the best player (he is not a commie, not a fruit), followed by Ben Stiller (well, do not correct me. It makes me sick), and then William H. Macy, who demonstrates his best results (superior Fargo), Macy's up to Garafalo, but I think Kel Mitchell was pretty good as the Invisible Boy. Two problems: the most boring part of the film - the plot of the novel between Stiller and Claire Forlani, as well as hearings about the early release of Casanova. Some scenes do not promote the story at all, but they are a blast. Kink, and especially the writers, as a rule, delay the scene until its fun disappears, but they change, and you are ready for more. I swear, seeing this, you are tired of the explosive climax (which, I think, was pretty cool). The camera is also pretty cool, moving at a frantic pace with the actors. In addition, Tom Waits demonstrates outstanding performance (he has such a cool bad coolness of the hero), and, as someone else said, the best moments are when the characters show them humanity. Captain Awesome is quite funny, (especially his speech to Casanova about his beautiful plan - I rode), and the rush is pretty cool as Casanova. One beef: the funniest comedian of all (Eddie Izzard) is almost lost, but his heart is in the right place. In general, a great movie. I give him twenty stars, and I hope that someday everyone will see the brilliance of the best parody of the film for six million dollars. Laughing right now, as I think about it. 20/10
