It has some excellent spots, but the length of the film cannot withstand a thin plate. This is another sailors' film on vacation, faster than Aster’s “Follow the Fleet,” but not as good as On the Town. <br /> <br /> Katherine Grayson is soft, but Kelly and Sinatra work well together. Their number “If you knew Susie” is jolly when they write a song, when they sing. “I begged her” is also funny when Sinatra shows how skilled he is in hooves. Sinatra's solo songs are boring and seem to be inserted to show his singing, and not as part of the story. Fortunately, there are experienced support actors such as Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton, and the unlikely, but adamant Jose Iturbi, like himself, to watch alone. <br /> <br /> Kelly is a film star, although it is interesting for the third account to see his interaction with children, which Aster never did. Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and is tied to the character Kelly. He also attends school, as a result of which he tells the children the fictional story of his life in the Pomeranian (!) Navy, which leads to his wonderful dance with the lively Jerry Mouse. In another scene, he dances a charming Mexican Hat Dance with Sharon McManus, a sublimely serious little girl, charming and sweet. <br /> <br /> Very nice, but too long. Taster best musicals.
