"Sweet is never so sweet without sour." In my opinion, this quote was, in fact, the theme of the film. Tom Cruise plays a young man who is all handed in life. He takes things for granted, and in this great movie, everything is in full swing. This film will keep you involved in the plot and will not be able to pause it in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that really makes you retreat and look at your life and how you live. You cannot truly appreciate the best in life (sweet), such as love, until you experience bad (sour). The theme really makes you "open your eyes." <br /> <br /> The only complaint is that the film is very confused and difficult to understand. I think the end is perfect though. I recommend you to see and be convinced of it.
