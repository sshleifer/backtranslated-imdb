... and the series allows you to forget all this. I am about three years older than the children pictured in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive a car during the first gas shortage and received my first thesis after graduating from college during the second gas shortage in 1979. The 70s were truly a terrible time for youth - inflation, the struggle for out-of-school minimum work with thirty laid off with something, terrible music, worse clothing. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that in this series nothing is ignored and yet you manage to make a funny image of the 70s, even for those of us who are old enough to know better. He manages to watch the 70s right in the face - complete with authentic clothing in time - and yet fill the show with the hope of young people and things that make school and college years both the best and worst. Then there are the parents. Two young lovers in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - really have terrible parents with the best intentions. Erik's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly Jun and Ward, although they are common for a decade. They represent what happened when the 60s finally reached the suburbs during the 1970s. Donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960s to show their whole life in order to give their strangeness to legitimacy. Erik's friends, Fez, Kelso and Jackie, complement the group, representing respectively tediousness, well-intentioned incompetence and snobbery. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a suburban show, but he pretty much represents someone who has to play cards that have been dealt to him, even when these cards are dealt mostly to absent and careless parents. I highly recommend all eight seasons, although season eight is a bit behind due to the lack of Eric.
