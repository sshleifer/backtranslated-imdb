I read more than 100 books about Nancy Drew, and if you are not smart enough to gain popularity, then Nancy Drew starred in the movie “YOUNG Nancy Drew”, and not the 18-year-old who does not go to a school that is from books about. That was when she was sixteen. Naturally, she would not be as smart as the one in the book, considering that she is only in the 10th grade. Also, I thought the movie was very cute. It was clean and suitable for everyone. It was funny at times. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. She was clearly articulated, character and sweet. I liked the awkwardness that Nancy and Ned had around each other, because they were obviously not old enough to have a serious relationship, like in books. It was a cute, PG movie that I really liked, because, unlike most people of my age, I watch movies without sex, drugs or profanity.
