Hollywood North is a satirical look at the time in the history of Canadian cinema, when the Government of Canada offered huge tax breaks for films made in Canada. Most of the time it was considered a tax haven or a cheap way to make American films. For example, Porky came out of this. In any case, Matthew Modine plays a novice producer who wants to make a film version of his favorite Canadian novel. However, to get money, he needs an American star. He gets a free gun and finds out that he needs to compromise to such an extent that the film no longer looks like the book on which it was originally based. He plays well in Canada, but may not be understood outside of the Great White North. Americans will think that we will be filled, but we will miss the moment when we actually make fun of them. For Canadians 8/10 for the whole world 5/10.
