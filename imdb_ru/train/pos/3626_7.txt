This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris, a science teacher / baseball coach who is inspired by his players to try his hand at the professionals and realize his dream of living in the majors. Dennis Quaid, not accustomed to sports films, plays Morris with enough conviction to get him to work on the role, and the producers do the real work of recreating the real events that led Morris to act as a pitcher of relief for the unfortunate devilish ray Tampa Bay, The film's first half, telling about his raggy group of high school baseball players (all of whom look too old to be in high school), is less effective and is probably too long. In general, the film suffers from some career problems and a few additional plots, without which we could probably do without. Nevertheless, this is still a rather fascinating film with an inspirational theme, which once again proves that baseball is a national pastime. Grade: B-
