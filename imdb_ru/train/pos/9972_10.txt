This message is not so PC, I am stunned that this film could have been made - at least without the federal government, through the IRS, crushing the creators, as they did with Juanita Broderick, Catherine Prudom, the Western Center for Journalism and countless others, who dared to speak out. “Live Free or Die” is the motto of Jason Priestley’s hat, as it brilliantly portrays “voice”, and this sums up the dangerous (for some) message of this film. <br /> <br />
