The film begins with the fact that Bill Coles (Melvin Douglas) tells the story of how his best friend is this client - Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family are tightly packed into a small New York apartment, where there is not enough space in the closet and too few bathrooms. When Jim's wife, Muriel (Mirna Loy), wants to renovate an apartment, CEO Jim falls in love (or falls in love with!) In the announcement of the house. As soon as he bought the house, bills and frustrations accumulate continuously, since everything that can go wrong with the construction of Jim's "dream home" goes wrong. <br /> <br /> One of Grant's and Loy's three actions, this charming little comedy is not very burdensome, without a really cool message, but a great way to spend an hour or two. Laughter comes from the beginning, when the alarm went off, and Jim tries to turn it off, but Muriel gets in the way every time. The time and supply of comedic plots and situations can only be set by a few experienced professionals, and this is what Grant and Loy give us: refined performances, simple chemistry and lots of fun. Myrna Loy in a rather ungrateful role (obviously, that Grant's character Jim gets the lionâ€™s share of roles and acting, and Grant, as always, performs both with remarkable aplomb), but she gives Muriel the color, life and bite that only Myrna Loy can give character . Melvin Douglas is also delighted to perfection with fun entertainment, never striking a single wrong note. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite scenes definitely happened when Bill locked himself in the "pantry" and Jim left to "save" him ... just so everyone was trapped inside! Every little problem that arises in the Blandings reconstruction project - including petty jealousy and the Wham advertising campaign - seems to unite everything that * can * go wrong when building a new house, but makes it believable and enjoyable hours, 8 /ten
