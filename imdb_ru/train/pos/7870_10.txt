The film is a real show of how high society has become unemotional and selfish. There are many characters in it, and each character represents a different category of people. Not a single character is 100% good and moral, unlike the heroes of all typical Indian films, and not a single character is 100% bad; rather, everyone is just different. The film is a perfect blend of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the first time I liked the film, which raises some social issues. I would recommend everyone to watch a movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who covers these amazing Bollywood parties for the newspaper, but this is the story of how she becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper. But this is not all, then it shows how she could not survive there and when she helped save some innocent children, how cruelly her voice was suppressed. Even she is fired from her job. Then she could not find a job of a crime reporter and she had to work again. Not only she, but also a very, very large number of characters are intertwined in the film, and all this gives a different feeling when watching a movie. I would very much congratulate the director for making such a wonderful film. Please do not allow yourself to miss it.
