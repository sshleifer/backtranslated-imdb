Anyone who loves Rheostatics music will enjoy this movie. I have minor complaints, mostly about the placement and casting of certain actors (not Mori), who are not very convincing in their roles, but I donâ€™t have time to write a detailed review. I just want to warn anyone who has seen this movie or plans to watch this movie in the form in which it is presented on the CBC channel in Canada: the version that is broadcast on the CBC channel is similar to the WHITE MUSIC version for Reader's Digest - do not watch it. It cuts out whole scenes and scenes (if you can do this) from the movie. CBC, which represents most of the films intact, took half of the guts from whale music. I do not know why. It's terrible what they did with the movie. Rent a video or watch it in the cinema, but do NOT watch it on CBC television.
