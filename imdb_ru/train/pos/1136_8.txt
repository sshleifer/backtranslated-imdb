I'm not sure that this comment contains a real spoiler, but I play it safely, so do not read it if you have not seen the movie. <br /> <br /> I adore this film, and just like everyone else I work with - and this is the main thing. I spent most of my working life in the cinema, not being an actor. Such people are the heroes of this film: guardians, renters, directors, lighters and writers, people in costumes, etc., D., Etc., and all this is told from their point of view, at least to a great extent. Most of the actors are crazy and self-absorbed to the point of absurdity that they fake this film so well, but you have to work with the actors to admit that this film is a real drama! Possible warning of a spoiler: in one wonderful scene there are two main characters, both actors, _explore_, how _to discuss something personal, something completely “outside the script,” with another actor, and they start to make lines, rehearse them and critically speaking each other . <br /> <br /> Since this film appeared in 1991, it has become fashionable, especially on television. But hardly anyone did it so well.
