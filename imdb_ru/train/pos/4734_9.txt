I'm a big fan of Jet Li! He is the best star of the HK action movie alive ... and, therefore, this film is shocked! I saw this in the video store and, as it was in the main section of this main video store, at first I did not register his presence, and I had to look twice. I immediately realized that I would be renting out. My only doubt (I suppose I was expecting this) was that it was dubbed (AAARGh), not with subtitles. Otherwise, the original / strange / cool plot of the film and its full action made it one of the best films of Jet Li ... although they all fall under this category ....
