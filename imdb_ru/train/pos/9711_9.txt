Well, I just discovered that there is a show that is more disgusting and shocking than Little Britain, and I like it! The League of Gentlemen is a sick British comedy about the most terrible, crazy and disgusting little town in the whole of Great Britain. This place makes Dibley and Rocky Island (from Vicar Dibley and Father Ted) quite normal !! The format of the show is in many ways similar to SMALL Britain, except that all this is concentrated around the citizens of this one hellish city. Both shows show the same parodies again and again in each episode and some obviously inspired by Little Britain (especially in search of work in the classroom). But the show is different in that, despite the fact that it is rough, like “Little Britain” (which means it is not a show for children), it has a painful and sadistic quality that distinguishes it from all these shows. In particular, animal cruelty and serial killings are repetitive themes throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Now, if you didn’t guess, this is NOT a show for children, easily offended or normal people, and probably that's why I liked it. However, you really need very thick skin and terrible love to enjoy it to the maximum. It's funny and incredibly disrespectful outside of faith - you have to see it in order to believe it.
