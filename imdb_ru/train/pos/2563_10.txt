I have seen a few comments here that Brando uses a southern accent, and some of them consider it a mistake. When this film was made, racism and discrimination were very strong in the south. Jim Crow's laws are still valid. Civil rights were in their infancy. Is it possible that it was a subtle social commentary: a southern man in love with a woman of another race? Just as MASH was a subtle critic of the Vietnam War? Any thoughts? <br /> <br /> Another comment was that MÃ¶shi Umeki looks "cold." Anyone who has been to Japan will understand. The Japanese, at least in my experience, showed no emotion to strangers. There were strict social rules, especially for men meeting single women. Americans in Japan were completely alien to this culture, and rude attempts to meet women were shocking for women. One of the features of the Japanese was to smile when they were embarrassed or embarrassed, which many American servicemen perceived as a sign that their successes were welcomed. Also remember that during the time shown in the film, Japan had just been defeated, and the occupation forces reluctantly accepted this offer. I think that Meosi Umeki very convincingly assessed the situation in which she found herself. Seeing her conversations with American actors brought me back some memories of my own experiences in the country. I was able to meet a couple of beautiful young women who, after convincing them that I was not the typical American man, taught me their language and culture during my stay in their country.
