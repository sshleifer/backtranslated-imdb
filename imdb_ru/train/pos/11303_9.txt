Visconti's first film has all of its brand-name visual talent and impeccable technique, accompanied by compelling performances from Massimo Girotti as a beautiful tramp and, best of all, Clara Calamai as an incredible, insane Giovanna. Reworked several times as “Postman's rings twice”, but never improved. I can not believe that this was the first film of this man! This shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of his career.
