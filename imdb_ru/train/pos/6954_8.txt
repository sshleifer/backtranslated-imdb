This film was one of the funniest films I have seen in recent years, and the audienceâ€™s laughter supported me. Since My Big Greek Wedding (2002), the laughter has not been so spontaneous and intense. Easily confused, like last year's Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005) in using parodies (spying with Mr. and Mrs. Smith and sex with my super ex-girlfriend). The balance of director Ivan Reitman between comedy and drama, between the crazy and the ridiculous, is simply magnificent. Shock and drama never break the rules of comedy. At the same time, this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements, even if the final is broadcast in advance. In a sense, it's so obvious that it's nice to see how this happens. As in real life, sometimes the truth is so obvious that it is impossible to see. Easily eight out of ten stars standing there with Tootsie (1982). Perhaps nine (depending on how it looks at the second viewing).
