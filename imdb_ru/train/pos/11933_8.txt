I think this is a great family movie. There are a lot of funny scenes and heartbreaking moments throughout the film. The actors are great and the effects are well executed in everything. Danny Glover plays George Knox, who runs the terrible Angels baseball team and is great throughout the film. Young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. are also fantastic. Christopher Lloyd is good at Al '' Angel ', and the effects are great in this super Disney movie. A touching and soulful film that everyone should like.
