Although the story of a worried child turning to boxing for self-esteem and managing anger is hardly a new thing, the story gets a new twist here when the main character is a girl, not a boy. <br /> <br /> Diana has problems at school. She just can't stay away from the fight. At home, her father constantly lowers her. Her brother trains boxing at the gym, and one day when she picks it up, she decides that she also wants to train. <br /> <br /> It would have been easy to call this movie “Rocky with Girls”, I suppose. But this is not what we are talking about. The story really benefits from the fact that the main character is a girl, not a boy. This way you can cope with a lot of problems at the same time. First, the problem is that she was not accepted, because she is not a girl, and then, when she came to the boxing gym, because she is generally a girl. It is also a story about how a goal can change someone’s life. How positive things can make you grow. I do not want it to sound pretentious, because the film does not look pretentious at all, but what I am saying is true. <br /> <br /> Also Michelle Rodriguez is very good at starring. It really is a shame that she is stuck in the cool girl typing now, because it's not really that her role in Girlfight is everything. Of course, she is a female boxer, but rather, these are more sensitive moments that really make her shine. <br /> <br /> So, maybe this is basically your usual story about the outsiders with a twist, but Rodriguez raised it above the crowd "performance. I rate it 7/10.
