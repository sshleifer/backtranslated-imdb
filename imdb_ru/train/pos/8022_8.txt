Jim Henson's dolls have been my favorite since childhood. This movie makes me feel like a kid again. Well, the dolls are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. It is assumed that they are trying to get on Broadway in a music show, where else, except for New York. You will see the cameos of the then mayor of New York, Ed Koch. In any case, this year the film turns 25 years old, and I hope that today's children will learn to appreciate the frivolous gang of dolls. The problem with the show is that Kermit goes missing, and the gang must find him in New York. It is worth watching children and even such sentimental adults like me.
