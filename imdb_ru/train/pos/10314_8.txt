This and Her Pilgrim Soul are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of the Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in my commentary on the new series, something is missing in this new series. Perhaps they emphasize too much lesson to be learned. This is a bit more disgusting and sentimental than Serlingâ€™s version. However, this episode can also be considered rather sentimental. I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, lovers can never unite. I remember, I was not surprised by the Korean film "Il Mare" (later converted into "The Lake House". I think it was because I first saw this episode, so it destroyed the influence of the later film.
