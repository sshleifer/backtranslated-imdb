Stefan Rideau was already the star of his tour in "Wild Reeds", and he is one of the largest French indie stars. In this film, he plays Cedric, a local boy who meets a resting Mathieu (novice Jamie Elkaim in a stunning, nuanced, unearthly performance) on the beach. Mathieu has a difficult relationship with his sick mother, demanding aunt and sister (with whom he has a competitive relationship). Soon they fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The split story of the film, consisting of long memories, pieces of present and progressive movement in the future in real time, is a bit difficult. Director Sebastien Lifshits does not indicate what time period we are in, and it may be difficult to follow the plot line. But note: the last 45 minutes of the film are so exciting that you can't take your eyes off the screen. In turn, heartbreaking and inspiring, this film is ranked as “Beautiful Thing” as a movie that is a must-see.
