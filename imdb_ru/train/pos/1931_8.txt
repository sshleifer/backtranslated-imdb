Connecticut Public Pool is the place for this “under the radar” movie, which is charming, fun, interesting and attractive. Despite the fact that he won prizes at major film festivals, “Big Bad Swim” was not released to theater hordes across America, but was distributed as a DVD and was shown in theaters selectively. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, “The Big Bad Swim” never had a hype about the Hollywood release, considering how much Hollywood HAS was released this year, such as “I know who killed me.” “The Big Bad Swim,” a really good independent film, had to go upstream on its own. <br /> <br /> However, in “The Big Bad Swim,” actress Paget Brewster is charming and believable, like Amy, a math teacher, working at the limit of opportunity, who not only leaves her husband, but also is going to lose her job, and eventually begins to play a new life. TV series actor Jeff Branson - HOT - plays Noah, a serious, vulnerable swimming teacher who does his best to help his students overcome their fears, and discovers that he can learn from his students. Cute, sexy Jess Weishler (did I just see her in a bank advertisement?) Dexterously plays Jordan, a future swimmer who works two jobs, one as a pole dancer and the other as a blackjack dealer. Her character provides a catalyst for change among the ensemble, but the least understandable of the characters, due to the lack of "background" or motivation, why she does what she does. Jordan is young enough to live at home with an omnipresent younger brother with a video camera spying on her. However, her parents have nothing to do with her life, which seems strange. There is no drunken mother or abusive father to explain why a normal, attractive girl from a Connecticut suburb would prefer to do self-service on a pole dancer who belittles herself for lousy stag parties. <br /> <br /> Despite this, Big Bad Swim is successful in many ways, because it is a happy, enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> As you would expect, learning to swim is a metaphor for life. Ultimately, it is better to jump with both feet and swim, and not sit on the deck, because life still happens to you. <br /> <br /> Big Bad Swim is a great date movie, a great dorm movie, a great movie “What I haven’t seen,” and men like it as much as women.
