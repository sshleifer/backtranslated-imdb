This is the work of Neil Simon, who received a lot of praise! “Strange Couple” is a one-of-a-kind gem that lingers inside. You got Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); a hypochondriac, fussy and neat, and a big thorn away from his roommate, Oscar Madison (Walter Mattau); complete slut. These people have a great job. Felix is ​​a news writer, and Oscar is a sports writer. Both of these men are divorced, Felix’s wife is nearby, and Oscar is on the other side of the United States (West Coast). Well, what can you say? Two men living in the same roof together, not driving each other crazy, impossible just as impossible. This is a lot of laughter and fun. I liked the part when these two British neighbors who talk to both gentlemen, and after Oscar drove Felix, he was lucky and he lives with them when he refused to have dinner with them the night before. The time has come for Felix to lighten up. I guess all neat freaks are neat to lighten up. They can be fussy, but must also be patient. Very funny movie and new classic. Neil Simon's Odd Couple is a classic film. 5 STARS!
