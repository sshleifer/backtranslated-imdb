Since the time of Sponge Bob Square Pants, I have not seen a big cartoon on TV. The colors are great, the voices can not be better, the characters are so original, great cartoon. I hope Nikolodian continues to develop this cartoon. I hope that the DVD of the season will be released soon !!! I like these cartoons, and I hope that more people will tune in to this wonderful cartoon. Finding Season DVD is very difficult, so if someone finds a store that sells it, please let me know. The only Catscratch product available at Nick Shop is a great shirt, but very, very, very expensive !!! If you like Spongebob; and who is not? you will also love the Catscratch!
