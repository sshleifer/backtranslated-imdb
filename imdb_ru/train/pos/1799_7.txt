I am 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and House Deluxe make a great pair. This film is really funny and I love songs. My favorite songs are: “You can't keep a good dog”, and this song is about sharing, I think it is called “What’s My, That’s Yours” This was the last film from Judith Barcy to play Ann Marie’s voice. My favorite character is Charlie, but I am so pleased to hear the voice of Itchy. Although some scenes really seemed scary to me, it is still difficult for me to watch the scene with Charlie's sleep, and Karrich scares me to hell. Other characters, such as King Gator, seemed very funny to me. The ending was delicious and sad, made me cry a little. I give this film 7/10.
