I usually donâ€™t really like Emma Roberts, but after seeing Nancy Drew, that changed my mind. The actors in the films made it all exciting and fun. Most of the time, when you watch a mysterious film, you can solve it until the middle of the show, but in this film you seem to be there. All clues should match each other until you can finally understand the whole crime. I am still amazed how she knew that. The whole movie was really smart, and the people who watched it with me also loved this movie. Clothing was my favorite part of the movie, it was so cute. I do not think that there will be such a film until the sequel is released. I give him nine, because popular girls don't seem to play the role quite right, but they still make me laugh. It was a really great movie and a great mystery. I definitely recommend watching it.
