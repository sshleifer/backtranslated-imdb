I found one single comment about this film completely uninformative and generally too sharp, so I decided to write my own. I first saw this film when it came out, and caught it several times more since. First let me say that, in general, the fact that this film gets RIGHT makes it worthwhile. It doesn’t matter that he has some budget flaws and other flaws. Worth seeing. The idea to base the film on Walt Whitman’s visit to the limited, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in Southern Ontario and to revive people is a brilliant mistake. The film is about a humanizing catalyst that inspired Whitman to people. And in this sense, that's for sure. The game - especially Ripa Torn (Whitman) and Colm Fyr as a doctor - is very good. Scenarios and dialogue are strong and pay due attention to morals and excesses of time. In general, what's not to like? Also, name another movie in which Whitman is so vividly animated?
