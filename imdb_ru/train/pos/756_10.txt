I have to say that although I despise such shows, shocking horror, I am a girl, I feel I have to express my opinion. I saw Dirty Sanchez before I saw Jackass, and I think it surpasses Jackass in terms of software development. Storylines and interviews are intertwined to create a more interesting show. One evening I watched a few minutes of the film “Jacques” and could not believe how bad it was, everything just turned into a joke for a joke without any connection. It must have been the fastest and easiest editing show, shockingly amateur. While vomiting is not really my thing, as a serious entertainment show is underway, Dirty Sanchez is the way out of the Jackass League.
