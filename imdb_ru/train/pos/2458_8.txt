When I sat down to the cinema, I had a cool mood, and I did not plan to change it. But this film is a powerful engine. I was sweating and needed a shower. So what about us? Theoretically, the age of maturity of a Turkish teenage girl living in Copenhagen, Denmark. Soon it occurred to me that the plot seemed almost entirely borrowed from “Bend it Like Beckham”, where we had an Indian girl playing football and spoiling her sister's wedding. Here we passed it to a Turkish girl who spoiled her brother's wedding by doing kung fu. And we have a love story and competition, of course. After I accepted it, it really turned out to be an exciting emotional drama in which beautiful Kung Fu was demonstrated (although I am not an expert). The leading actress Semra Turan is not only the champion of Denmark, but also an excellent girl, so we can safely assume that we have enough autobiographical impressions here, considering that this is her first film and that she does not have an education as an actress. The rest of the cast is fine, the camera is good, kung fu is intense. Sidenotes: - A male Turkish audience showed respect for the fact that she must have done something right. - The audience burst into applause when our heroine finally fought off and attacked the boys, who brutally beat her brother for revenge. - Xi'an Gao, a Chinese cinema instructor / actor of kung fu (“The Hidden Tiger”, “The Crouching Dragon”), played the main role in the leading role. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see it in a movie, you probably have a good and intense experience, and I don’t know if it also works on a small screen.
