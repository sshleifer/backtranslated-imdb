The word “classic” is too free in our time, but this film deserves a mention. The combination of Neil Simon, Walter Mattaw (possibly the world's best live comic actor) and the late George Burns makes a comic book masterpiece. It is interesting to think what the film would have been if death had not prevented Jack Benny from playing the role of George Burns, as had been planned. Thus, the reunion scene in Mattau’s apartment is unlikely to be surpassed as a side splitter. Definitely one of my films about a desert island. <br /> <br /> "Sign !!!!!!!!!"
