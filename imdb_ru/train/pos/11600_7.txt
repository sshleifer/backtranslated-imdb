William Hurt, perhaps, is no longer the American idol of matinees, but he still has pretty good taste in B-cinema projects. Here he plays a specialist in cleaning up hazardous waste with a tragic past, tracking down a perennial loser on the run - played by a former handsome boy Weller - who was infected with deadly poison. The current cute boy, Hardy Kruger, Jr. — perhaps more handsome than his father — figures as Weller’s arrogant boss in a horrendous sequence at a chemical plant that makes history move. Natasha McElhon is a slightly strange government agent who investigates the incident and provides the inevitable and crazy love interest for the hero Herth. Michael Brandon pops up to play a slimy type of "take it without captives" whose adventure you can't wait. Coca-Cola receives the 2000 Product Placement award, as the non-alcoholic beverage is present throughout the production, filmed with love on a winter postcard in Hungary.
