This film was really a revelation. I have seen this movie several times. First, when I was four years old, and I actually remembered it, and then, when I was 12. All the message that the director conveys is that everyone wakes up and does not make a mistake, leaving God out of our everyday life or just taking an extra mile to insult him. <br /> <br /> An excellent film for unbelievers and believers!
