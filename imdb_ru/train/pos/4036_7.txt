Good luck in finding this movie to even see - it has not yet been released on tape or DVD. I saw the release in the early 70s, I was lucky enough to catch him thanks to the efforts to preserve American Cinematheque, and he still has some tangible moments that have remained with me for thirty years. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to repeat Rvinta accurate comments here. As a new director, shortly after the booming success of Five Easy Pieces, Jack N is said to have coped with low-budget efforts as well as possible, and this certainly manifests itself in wandering and meandering that some could use, but it is also memorable an icon for its time: all the very intense collisions of sports of the late 60s, student movements, the sexual revolution and much more. <br /> <br /> Why watch this movie? Probably, in some scenes it was a breakthrough: a sharp rapprochement of men in the souls after the game; The scene of Karen Black with Tepper in the car will take you by surprise - but this is the first use of the word that I have not seen in the film before; and the accidental and unexpected use of nudity in general. Probably there are others that I omit. <br /> <br /> Look for the pleasant surprise of young Cindy Williams in one of her first films; thin david ogend stiers; Mike Warren has just stepped out of his UCLA blue uniform and was preparing for a dark blue TV; Robert Town is an actor; and many just play it themselves. <br /> <br /> Now: Is there a connection between the surname of Harry Gittes, Robert Town, and a certain character from the Chinatown and two jakes? <br /> <br /> This gets a "7" based on Karen Black. You will understand why.
