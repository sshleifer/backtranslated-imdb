Perhaps this could be the best movie ever made, and if it’s not, then this is definitely one of those who burned down on your students, because what Brian De Palma presents here is a great piece of cinematic art. . Firstly, this is the directing touch of Brian De Palma, which once again proves that he can be one of the best directors in history. This is a great performance by Al Pacino, who demonstrates an immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana). many different (cruel) scenes that you will never forget (the scene with a chainsaw, the scene in which Tony sits in a bathtub the size of most people’s living rooms), there are many excellent odnostrochnikov (count how many times the word "f * ck" is used) , there are excellent little details (the Pan American globe that shouts “your world”) or great discomfort from Giorgio Moroder. Nothing can be called that is not exalted here, and it is easy along with Godfather, Good Guy and White Heat, one of the best gangster films ever made!
