An outstanding 1943 film with Paul Lucas playing the role of Oscar as head of his family, returning them to America from Europe as the Nazi threat deepened. <br /> <br /> Plain stunning Bette Davis maintains his reputation here and for the change was not assigned to the best female role for this or any 1943 film. <br /> <br /> Lucas, who managed to betray them, successfully copes with the situation. He knows that he must return to Europe with a secret mission and return, and he does it. <br /> <br /> Davis pulls out all the stops again, like Katherine Hepburn, shedding tears when they have to leave. Determined, she knows that her eldest son must follow him on the path to freedom. <br /> <br /> A wonderful film, highlighting the positive propaganda of the United States against an evil enemy.
