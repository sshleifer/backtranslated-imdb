Words seriously convey the emotional power of this film; This is one of the most painful of all that you have ever seen, but the final is one of the most loving, tender and emotionally intense things you could hope for. Each actor in each role is terrific, especially the wise and understated Jamie Lee Curtis, the seriously wounded and tormenting Ray Liotta, and the heartbreaking turn of Tom Hals, who was supposed to raise him for every award in the book. (He is the No. 1 choice for the Best Actor of 1988 in Alternative Oscars by Danny Peary.) The last half hour borders on a melodrama, but the film earns all its tears - and if you are not made of stone, there will be many of them.
