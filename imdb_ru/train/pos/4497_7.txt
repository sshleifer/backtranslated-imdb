I only saw the first part of this series when it debuted in the late 90s, and only recently got the opportunity to watch all three parts via Netflix (by the way, a convenient service). In general, I liked this carefree, sometimes genre, mini-series. The story of a young man who fell in love with an elderly woman seems to be working, and the actors are fine. Yes, he has romantic running clich√©s in the rain or goodbyes at the train station, but the characters have a chance to be learned, so it doesn't look silly, as if it were a Tom Hanks car or something. Robson Green, who sometimes reminds me of the separated Scott Bakula at birth, does an excellent job with someone who is deeply in love, and the ebb and flow and rejection turn the show into watchable fare. Personally, I think the series could consist of two episodes, but I believe that this is a discussion. Obviously there is a sequel, and it should arrive tomorrow through Netflix.
