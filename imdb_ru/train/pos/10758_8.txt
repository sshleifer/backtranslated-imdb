"9/11" is a classic example of the cinematic faith, a kind of realistic documentary, in this case the New York firefighters fighting one of the most unusual events in world history. These are all tiny, unobtrusive, hand-held cameras, often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the filming (and the director, Naudet’s hand, often wiping the screen). <br /> <br /> In this film, you will meet the majority of firefighters - Tony Benatatos, a newcomer (or “try,” in New York jargon), fire chief Joseph Pfeiffer (who later discovered that he had lost his brother) and several others. Throughout the film, the studio conducts interviews with many of these people to emphasize the personal, reflective nature of the events. The build is quite dramatic and well done, especially the distribution ceremony in the fire station, with a few useful pans and a kind of dialectical editing of a rather limited movie (for example, Rob Reiner "A few good people"). ). Tony looks proud. <br /> <br /> The camera’s point of view and camera angle are usually among firefighters, which is interesting, and there are excellent shots in the lobby of WTC1, while Pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next - this is a classic cinematographer. There is also a creepy , the haunting sound of the accidental fall of a human body on a portico outside. It was then that Pfeiffer, the increasingly dreary fire brigade, realizes that his task is desperate and probably hopeless - and that is before the WTC2 collapses. You must pay tribute to Naude because he knew which faces to shoot and at what point. <br /> <br /> The sound of the collapse of the WTC2 is so terrible, painful and terrible that you understand what this test is for. firefighters. From the lobby, it looks, feels, and sounds like the end of the world, and poor firefighters look completely confused and frightened. You hear a huge rumbling, quivering whirlpool - like a giant monolithic beast slowly falling to the ground after such a fatal injury - the neighboring tower collapsed, but the fire brigade remaining in WTC1 does not notice this event. Where is the connection? <br /> <br /> This film is fascinating, but the story is an amateur one and should be avoided - such cues as “it was really a day, not like others”, or often banal sayings of Naudet, like “you could see” fear in everyone's eyes "and" I knew that Tony was in shock! " The film is just one long video diary. There are no photos above the building where some firefighters went. Imagine that this film is mixed with video surveillance footage shot in some rooms above, or with some news for the day. The effect would be more. You could even combine this story with the story of Mayor Giuliani and possibly the famous Cornishman Rick Riskorl, who literally was on many floors in the role of a hero. <br /> <br /> I don’t see a big propaganda element in this film, as some reviewers assume. This film is not "Triumph of the Will" Riefenstahl. Some time later, firefighters throw an American flag on a nearby, preserved building overlooking what became Ground Zero. So what? <br /> <br /> There are also a few moments of dubious camera work; for example, who holds the camera when two brothers Naudet reunited at the fire station? Is it a staging? <br /> <br /> Excellent finish, largely in the tradition of the excellent French director Alain Resne (Hiroshima mon amour), with two strips of light reflected in the water, flickering.
