I have to agree with most other posts. Was it a comedy? drama? for me it was a little leaning towards comedy. I could have been a great movie without a comedy, and it was terribly coined. Jamie continues to face Julio and what is his name. In New York, how many times do you come across someone you know in the center of Cleveland. And how could Robert Pastorelli dig up Yankee Stadium to hide gold. Again comedy or drama? But it was still interesting especially for Sunday morning. I liked Kimberly Elise's performance, she is certainly a beautiful actress and seems to be serious about her craft. She is a younger actress who will be viable.
