I liked the innocence of this film and how the heroes had to cope with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst. The gorilla looks simply amazing, and the eyes were especially realistic. From time to time it is even a little scary, and children should be a little scared, not overdo it. Rene Russo plays his role wonderfully feminine. Usually these types of Hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a villain from a straw man, but the only opponent is the gorilla. It is interesting to see how close some animals are to people, how they feel the same emotions as we do, and yet how we really cannot treat them the same way as people do because it is not. Not many films go to this territory, and itâ€™s worth to see if you want to see the similarities between humans and animals.
