The great talents of Michael Powell and Emerick Pressberger are noticeable in their wonderful "Essence of Life and Death." This was part of a recent tribute to Mr. Powell, who played Walter Reed in New York. This film, in particular, shows us one of the best British films of a particular era. <br /> <br /> In the film The Matter of Life and Death, brilliant cinematography by Jack Cardiff, a man who knew how to work miracles with the camera. Particularly impressive is the contrast from the monochromatic tones transmitted to the scenes in heaven, and the colors when the action returns to the ground. It was a real coup and far ahead of its time. The black and white sequence, including the long staircase where Peter and the Conductor are talking, should be one of the most amazing things in any film. <br /> <br /> Much has been said on this forum about the film, so our comment will be about the great acting game of Powell and Presberger, which came from a large, outstanding line-up who responded perfectly to the director's instructions. <br /> <br /> David Niven, Peter, whose plane is hit and his best friend dies as a result of this. This film was one of the most exciting events in the career of Mr. Niven. He was a great movie actor, as he shows us in this film. Kim Hunter is surprisingly good as June, the woman who talked to Peter when his plane fell from heaven. By the will of fate, Peter and June fall in love at first sight. <br /> <br /> Some of the best British movie actors adorn this film with their presence. Robert Coot, this is Bob, a man who went to heaven, but he is surprised that his friend Peter has never traveled with him. An excellent turn of the star is Marius Goring, who as Conductor 71 steals the film. Mr. Goring, who worked with directors, is one of the best things in the film. In addition, Roger Livesey, like Dr. Frank Reeves, makes one of the best performances in his career, as well as Raymond Massey, who is considered Abraham Farlan. <br /> <br /> “The Question of Life and Death” is an eternal film that will always look with gratitude to its creators.
