I know, sometimes it's really very banal ... But the game is awesome, and Melissa Joan Hart is as cute as a button. I love this show very much, and I am almost ashamed of what I do because there is a representative on the show. for being really banal, but it makes me feel good. My only problem is that sometimes it can be quite a low budget - sometimes the actors change, and you just need to cope with it ... As Sabrina's father - two different guys throughout the film ... I mean, we couldn't would they just say he is uncle or something? However, I can't dislike this show. Harvey and Sabrina make up a really nice couple, and Salem is absolutely funny. I definitely recommend it if you're looking for easy and fun entertainment ... My favorite episode is Pancake Madness ... A fun episode. The best time of the year is probably 3 ... I'm not really a fan of some of the distortions of the seventh season ... As soon as you get into college, Morgan joins the group, and her dialogue becomes painful and works very bad ... Plus it is terrible so the jokes about how she survives only because of her beauty were lost to me ... But I think it was set up to spend a really good eighth season, and I was very sad to see the cancellation of one of my favorite shows!
