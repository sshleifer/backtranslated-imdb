American boy Jesse boarded a train to Vienna to board a plane to the USA. In the train, he met the Frenchwoman Celine. Although they met for the first time, they spoke like good friends. When the train stopped in Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to accompany him on a tour of Vienna. Then a romantic story unfolded. <br /> <br /> At first they were careful. The funniest scene was listening to a CD in a music store. They looked at each other, although their eyes did not touch. After a deep conversation, their relationship became close. Then I saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their friend. Their deep love for each other was fully expressed in words. <br /> <br /> Love is a strange thing. When you really want it, it will not come the way you wanted. Love needs understanding. Without this, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is the most important thing for love. <br /> <br /> Excellent screenplay and execution led to the huge success of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the best romantic movies. 9/10
