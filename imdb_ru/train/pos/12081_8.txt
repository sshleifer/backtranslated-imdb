Nina Foch demonstrates a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this funny little gothic lacquer. She accepts the position of secretary to the widow of London society (powerfully played by the lady Mae Whitty) and her creepy son (the merciless and pesky George Macready). Before she finds out about this, she wakes up to be in a seaside manor, which she had never seen before, where Vitti and Makridi call her Marian and try to convince the servants and nearby townspeople that she is the mad wife of Makridi. Of course, this couple can only plan vile actions, and although we know that Julia must ultimately avoid her trap, director Joseph Lewis creates real anxiety by answering the question of how she will succeed. <br /> <br /> “My name is Julia Ross” has nothing stylistically to distinguish it from any number of films that came out at the same time, but I was surprised at how well he kept together, despite My budget for the laces and the B-movie pedigree. There are quite a few moments when you can just stand on the edge of your chair, and I found that I really support Julia when she jumped at the scheme under her feet and began to outsmart her captors. In any other gothic thriller, the heroine would faint, scream and joke, waiting for her hero to come and save her. So I can't tell you how great it was when the heroine in this film used her brain and tried to figure out how to save herself. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
