I thought this movie did a great job. He was not as creative or original as the first, but who expected it. It was very funny. the more I think about it, the more I like it, and when it comes out on DVD, I will be very proud to pay money for it, every last cent. Sharon Stone is great, she is always there, even if her film is terrible (Catwoman), but this film is not, this is one of those films that are underestimated throughout her life, and he will probably become a classic in 20 of the year. Do not wait until it becomes a classic, look now and enjoy. Do not expect a masterpiece or something exciting and touching for the soul, just allow yourself to go out of your life and get yourself involved in their lives. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is interesting, and I recommend that people who have not seen it see it, because what critics and box office say is not always considered, see for yourself, you never know You can just enjoy it. I take off my hat to this movie <br /> <br /> 8/10
