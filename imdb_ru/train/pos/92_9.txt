This is not an art house film, it is the main entertainment. <br /> <br /> Lots of great people, people, and actions. I found it very interesting. It does not have to be intellectually stimulating, it is a fun movie to watch! Jesse and Chace are funny too, it's just a sauce. Definitely worth renting. <br /> <br /> So, I would recommend checking it out for a small entertainment evening on Friday with boys or even with your girlfriend (if she likes to see how other girls wear this!) are good too Winnie, Cory Lardzh, gothic from Heroes. Very nasty villains.
