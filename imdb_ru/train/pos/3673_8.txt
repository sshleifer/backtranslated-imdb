Back in 2004, I saw “True,” Tom Tykwer’s contribution to Paris Je T'aime. When I saw this, I loved it and was excited. It became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format. Of course, I wanted to watch the whole movie, and I would even check who was tied, and so on. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I finally saw it, thanks to the Internet. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is that it looks amazing. The photo is beautiful in every short film, at least nothing special, but still brilliant and clear. Later, I read nothing here, and perhaps this is how scanning in 6K gives more justice for the whole work of DP. My special favorites are the first scene of "Quais de Seine" (this sunshine!), Esquire "Sin City" (but better for me) "Quartier de la Madeleine" and "14th arrondissement" - but you know what the hell like all of them: “Truth” or “Faubourg Saint-Denis” still makes me nervous because of these bright colors (my eyes are trembling!), and “Quartier Latin” is gold encased in silver. Handsomely. <br /> <br /> Yes, these are some BEAUTIFUL short films. <br /> <br /> Now let's get to the content. I really (and I mean VERY VERY) like eclecticism, which is so successfully felt. You have never had the same theme or treatment between the two shorts, and I think the formula is restrictive enough to allow all these artists to explore beautiful and deepening things inside the shorts. I liked to move from a simple love story to a crazy Chinese musical in Paris with Barbet-Schröder, to a social commentary, to a comedy of terror, to a modest monologue. I like surprises! And in this film they are! It's great that they took the opportunity to release all these directorial things that are not common in basic cinema (which I despise). This is not very experimental, but I can breathe the respite that these people had. <br /> <br /> I like little time and I love the game. I love simplicity and love love. I like simple feelings, beauty and eclecticism, and in general this is a film that is very, very, very pleasant to watch, alone or with someone. Just feel. I felt very good. <br /> <br /> There is something serious about this ... so frankly ... <br /> <br /> What did not I like? Well, for me there are two shorts that are not quite the best - "Quais de Seine" (which is good-natured, of course, and perhaps even necessary, but too much like an advertisement?) And "Père-Lachaise", which despite that I love acting, I felt that her themes were forced. But this, of course, was just me. “Tour Eiffel” I didn’t like it either, but I think it may be because I feel quite differently from Sylvain Chomet? I do not know whether this film is of particular interest to people who already know the actor and directors, and therefore they can enjoy their interaction, surprises (with an interesting role for Alexander Payne) and in general what this director will do about it? "Great question. I liked it very much. <br /> <br /> I repeat: most of the shorts I loved and all together make up a beautiful and energetic blend. I definitely recommend it. Definitely !!! So look, if you like eclectic beautiful love!
