This is a great movie. We are talking about many things: the hunt for a serial killer, the bureaucracy in Soviet Russia, the attraction of one person and the relationship between this man (the leading detective) and his boss. <br /> <br /> I am most interested in the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (sorry, poor spelling, please!). For some reason, he is moving to see how their evolution from hostility and insults turns into respect, camera work and teamwork. One line in the film sums up for me: "He would have said something witty, but he was overwhelmed with emotions." <br /> <br /> Great game of all the actors, even the smallest roles were made with believability. <br /> <br /> This is not a dynamic action movie; in fact, he sometimes moves like a slow drama, but it's worth it. Very nice and not exploiting crime at all. <br /> <br />
