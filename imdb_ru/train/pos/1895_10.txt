I watched it during the Christmas period, I don’t know why, but it reminds me of Christmas, so I watched it, and here we are. <br /> <br /> “Arthur” is a film that I watch throughout life with a big dull smile on my face, and this is a mixture of special performances, great fun music and a script that is amazing with wit and charm that evokes it. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore creates a character that you can hate very easily (a spoiled, wealthy, lazy drunk who feels sorry for himself), but turns him into the one you love. Liza Minelli is gorgeous because Linda Morolla is the queen waitress who manages to take down the hard / soft inner lady for whom Arthur almost gives up her world. John Gilgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them with pleasure. <br /> <br /> I can watch Arthur again and again, and it always makes me feel good, check if you need a lift, this is a great movie.
