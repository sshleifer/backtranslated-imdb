What are the chances that the Mermaid helium balloon flew out of Yuba, California (November 8, 1993) and landed 4 days later (November 12) in Mermaid, Prince Edward Island, Canada (about 4000 miles) This is a great movie. It is based on a true story. This film helps not only children to cope with losses, but also for older people. Hope everyone will like it !!! Rhonda
