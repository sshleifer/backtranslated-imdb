It was the first regular episode of the movie "Colombo", filmed in cinemas, but still it aired the second after the film by Stephen Spielberg "Colombo: The Murder by the Book." At the same time, it is one of the best! <br /> <br /> Bernard L. Kovalsky was one of the best creative directors! Not surprisingly, they later asked him to make three more Colombo films. The film has really creative and innovative shots, and the film as a whole is also made with style, passion and attention to detail. Each shot links to each other and is the reason why this film is better and also looks better than any other average score created for a television movie. This is definitely one of the best films about Colombo. <br /> <br /> For several reasons, this is not the original Colombo record. Murder is more or less random and was an impulsive act. Therefore, the killer this time does not have time to plan in advance the "perfect murder", then to remove any traces and get rid of the body. The killer in this film is viewed not only as the person who committed the crime, but also as the person who helps Lieutenant Colombo uncover the murder. This makes the character more interesting and multi-layered, and also helps to make the Columbo way to uncover all the crimes more interesting because of this. Of course, Colombo begins to suspect him rather early, and, as always, he comes to a decision, making himself vulnerable and looking more stupid than he really is, and gaining the confidence of the killer. This is clearly not a spoiler, since every Colombo movie is customizable. I liked the story of the film and how it developed. <br /> <br /> It also helps the film that he has such a good cast. During this film, Peter Falk really made his character Colombo his own character, and this character has already fully developed. Robert Culp is really great as a hot-tempered Brimmer. It's funny that later he will be shot again in three different films of Colombo and in one episode of “Mrs. Colombo”, only in completely different roles. He even played the killer again in several films. Incidentally, he was not the only actor who did this in other later Colombo films. Also the great Ray Milland appears in this film as the victim's husband. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very good early Colombo film and one of the best in a long-term film series. . <br /> <br /> 9/10
