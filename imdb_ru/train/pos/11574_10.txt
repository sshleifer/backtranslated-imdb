This film is half documentary ... and it is quite interesting .... <br /> <br /> This is a good film ... based on a true story about how a group of Norwegian saboteurs managed to stop the production of heavy water in Rukian, Norway, and delivery of the rest of the heavy water to Germany. <br /> <br /> This movie is not perfect and it could be a little better ... the best part of the movie is that some saboteurs are playing on their own !!! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the history of the Second World War and the film, this is a film that is worth watching !!
