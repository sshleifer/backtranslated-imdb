* WARNING * Spoilers ahead ... The authors of this story knew these people very well. The actors also portrayed them very well. As a result, by the end of the film, you feel that you are actually watching John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The expected tension is there, especially in the awkward first moments. But when they begin to weaken, the old partnership, through which the Beatles worked so well, begins to shine through. The bitterness is still present and is interrupted from time to time, but by the time John gets the idea to raise Lorna Michaels on his offer to pay the Beatles an oath of $ 3,000 to appear on “Saturday Night Live”, they can the most boyish pranksters who, along with teenagers, terrorized Liverpool and survived, playing in the night clubs of Hamburg, to climb to the Superstar. But in the end, this wonderful fantasy gently justifies us. We are reminded why the reunification of the Beatles, most likely, was never possible even before the murder of Lennon: the two driving forces of the group had outgrown each other.
