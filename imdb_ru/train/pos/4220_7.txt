This is the one in which the miniature Ruth Gordon plays Agatha Christie, such as the author of the murder mystery, who locks his nephew by marriage in a safe. Gordon thinks he killed her niece, and the young man dies from suffocation, and Gordon travels here and there to New York. However, he manages to leave some clues, scratches on a pair of black safes and an improvised and well-hidden note. Colombo enters the cause, immediately suspects her and solves the secret, simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive abilities. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is on hand as Gordon's secretary and potential blackmailer. Hartley, I suppose, is the granddaughter of psychologist B. F. Skinner. I'm not sure that her pedigree had anything to do with her attractive belly button, which is shown during belly dancing, but I have always admired Skinner. <br /> <br /> Murder is well treated. This is a good story, and none of the performers or team members do anything. But the outstanding figure here is Ruth Gordon, only five feet tall. She was over 80 years old and looked at it. There are moments when she almost hesitates, but she invariably exudes charm. Her game is unique. You can never be sure when she is serious or when she puts on Colombo and the audience. She also gave good lines. What humor is from Gordon. Colombo does not have such frequent comic moments. <br /> <br /> In general, great work for all stakeholders.
