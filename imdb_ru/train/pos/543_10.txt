This film is the best horror film, without exaggeration. I like that Stanley just throws women into the lake. I have been a fan of Judd Nelson for years, and he was stunned by me. It is a mixture of horror, drama and romance, not comedy. His angry, but charming look immediately captured me. This look in his eyes I will never forget. There is something in it, I can not describe.
