Good character development in a pretty cool environment. As a man, I probably do not have enough qualifications to fully understand this, but they have done an excellent job of creating a restrictive Victorian environment from the very beginning. This is not as gloomy as it really was, and the treatment of women was probably even tougher. What makes it go is a great chemistry among the main characters. Everyone has their own "thing" with which they struggle. As soon as they come out of the rain and break out of the web, they begin to interact and gradually lose their sense of suspicion. What I liked about this film is that there was no cheap comedy in it when this could happen. He did not try to learn a lesson from us. People who seem completely unfounded are really well developed people who see the light. I had some minor problems with the fact that Alfred Molinaâ€™s character had such an epiphany so quickly, but in this world it had to happen. A good game around with something positive in the lives of some pretty good people.
