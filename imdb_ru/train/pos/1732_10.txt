“Sandra, the creation of a woman” is outstanding among exploitation films, and this is true for two reasons: (1) Monica Gale’s superb, but effortless, performance, and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was at the helm of the project. These two talents, both of which are undervalued, make the film Sandra, which is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Another key element of the film’s success is its realism - there’s nothing false or “Hollywood” about it. about this filming in California. This is really a piece of life. The humble home in which Sandra lives at the beginning of the film, the simple dresses the character wore, the scene where Sandra wakes up in the morning to see Ears Digart bouncing at her front door, and Sandra sitting on the couch without help. up, while Digart is trying to sell her cosmetics, looking really, as if she just woke up (but beautiful nonetheless), harmless strange Sandra picks up who likes to make love to her while he wears a bra, one-room apartment what drives Sandra - all these elements of the film seem completely real, and, as such, the viewer is drawn from the very beginning into the small world of Sandra and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed. Sandra also defends her free love with eloquence and dignity, and she has many lessons. <br /> <br /> This film could easily fail in less competent hands and could descend into any of the usual directions of sexual exploitation, but the Garver / Gale team made sure that Sandra was not only a woman’s creation, but and making a great movie.
