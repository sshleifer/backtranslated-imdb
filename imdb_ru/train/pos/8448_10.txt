I have always been a big fan of "Murder: Life on the Street", so when I heard that a film about reunion was being prepared, I could not wait. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that I was not disappointed at all. It was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television I've ever seen. It was great to see everyone again, but the greatest pleasure was to bring back Andre Brauger, because the relationship between Pembleton and Beiliss was always the strongest part of the overall great show.
