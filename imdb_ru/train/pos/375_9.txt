it was one of the most touching movies i have ever seen. I was about 12 years old when I watched him for the first time, and when I watch him on TV, my eyes are on him. The acting and plot is awesome. it seems so believable to reality and touches on many controversial topics. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama.
