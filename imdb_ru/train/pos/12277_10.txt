Perhaps the best book by Isabel Allende, House of the Spirits, describes an alternative Chilean history, full of magic, a mystical veil and some ubiquitous sadness. This film brings together a great cast, plus an excellent artistic guide with a script that cannot contain all the quality of this book. For an almost unknown country such as Chile, it is unusual to be so well represented, as in this film, whose perhaps only sin is to set too high goals, and because of this the illiterate audience was a little upset, mainly they understood very little.
