This anime is a must see for Evangelion fans. This is Anno Hideaki's earlier work, but his unrestrained, dramatic style is appropriate. In addition, those who did not like Evangelion may find this release a little more enjoyable. Gunbuster is quite unique to science fiction anime in the sense that it is based on real science. In fact, there are several small “Lessons of Science” in the show explaining the physics of some of the events in the film. One of the main dramatic moments in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds close to the speed of light. The series perfectly copes with a traumatic imagination experience: to leave the Earth on a six-month mission, traveling at the speed of light and returning to Earth, where ten years have passed. The main character remains 17 or 18 years old throughout the entire series, while almost all other characters age significantly. Keep in mind, this show is sometimes hard. It also has a pair of the most completely undeserved chest shots I have ever seen. I found it pretty easy to ignore the meager forms and scenes with boo, because otherwise the show is very good, but viewers with low juice tolerance may want to stay away from it. On an interesting note, Gainax, as always, ran out of money in the last two episodes. However, they still managed to use black and white film and still sketches to get good resolution. The ending is a bit silly, but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut that I couldn't help but love it. Gunbuster, in my opinion, is one of the best parts of anime around.
