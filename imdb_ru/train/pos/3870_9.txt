This is an extremely dense, dark and complex film that unfolds rather slowly, revealing painful details, like the attention given in the novel, and watching this film “IS” how to watch the unfold novel. While I didn’t care about the narrator, because I felt that he was out of balance with the rest of the performances, this film presents some of the best bands I’ve ever seen, and the role of Summer Phoenix is ​​incredible. Her innocence and naivety may seem implausible, a kind of cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy this criticism, but it is still incredible, in part because it doesn’t look like anything I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly beautiful, shot by Eric Gotye and being part of a unique film. This film does not show what you expect. This is always amazing, and, despite its duration, the film never shows more than necessary. At 163 minutes, very briefly, I would say that this is one of the wonders of this film. It’s full of short moments that are just overwhelming, some of the best that you’ll probably see in the whole year, and all these moments ultimately add up to an unforgettable movie experience. Family moments are unique, Ian Holm is great, and what this film says about the theater has not been seen in films since the “First Night” by Cassavetes or, perhaps, by Limelight by Chaplin. But believe it or not, this film is much less familiar. I never knew where this film is going, and now, having seen it, it still has many possibilities. This is a powerful, incredibly provocative film.
