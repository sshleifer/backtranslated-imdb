I almost did not go to watch this film, because I remember that the penguinâ€™s march was not so exciting. I went mainly because Disney promised to plant a tree if I see it the first weekend, but after I looked at it, it was just amazing; the fact that photographers can shoot impossible images is just worth your money. You can also see different habitats, different vegetation, animals and natural phenomena that not only shake you - simply because you never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic - but also affect your souls and raise the issue of humanity by compared to the world, about how our life has deviated from nature to such an extent that we take for granted the natural beauty and wonders that are essential to our biosphere. You do not have to be an earth lover or environmentalist to appreciate the simplicity of this documentary. You just have to be a curious soul who questions the value and miracle of life. Enjoy!
