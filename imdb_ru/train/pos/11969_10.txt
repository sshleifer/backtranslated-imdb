I enjoyed growing up on this show, and I still watch the first seasonal DVD at the age of 19. What can I say? I grew up in a house very much like a house in Full House. I had a dad, two sisters and a dog. I think the only difference was that I did not live with my uncle and my father's best friend. I also grew up with my mom in the house. I do not know what I would do without Full House on television. I think that Stephanie (played by Jody Sweetin), JJ (played by Kirk Cameron Candace's sister) and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can relate to each of them, because I am the middle child in my family, like Steph, I have a younger sister, like Michelle, and I am an older sister, like D.J. I really like that the show always has moral values ​​because I don’t like any of the shows like O.C. Today. I also like the Full House comedy. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Cooler) and Danny (Bob Sajet) are funny like girls uncle, father's friend and dad, respectively. The story goes that after the death of the girls' mom, Danny Joey's best friend and his son-in-law, Jesse moves to help raise her children. Three men are trying to raise three young girls = fun. Every character in Full House is full of heart, cheerful and sincere. Joey is a novice comedian with a childish heart and soul. Jessie is a cool motorcyclist, uncle, strong guy who is softened by his three nieces, and later by his wife Becky (Lori Loughlin from Summerville). Both children and adults will love this show. Guaranteed.
