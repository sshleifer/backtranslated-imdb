I was prepared for a painful talkative soap opera, but I was happy to find a fast-paced script, a fundamental moral, beautiful images of all the actors, especially Peter Finch, amazing special effects, suspense and excellent cinematography - there is even a shot from the majestic Buddha Stone recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor at her most beautifully beautiful and sympathetic, before she succumbed to the mental hysteria that overshadowed her later work. All supporting players round it up, and I wonder who trained all these elephants. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the stone-Buddha sequence, you can really notice that this is Vivien Leigh in long frames. Her form and the way she moves differs from Taylor's form. The only thing that hinders this sequence is poorly executed technological frames when the background moves too fast for the horses during the walk. <br /> <br /> If you want a thought-provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring, spend a few hours with the Elephant Walk.
