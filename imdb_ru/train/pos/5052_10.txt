This is a great movie. As a Canadian who has grown up with a rural lifestyle, much of this is familiar: winter, canoeing, fishing, hunting, and the like. It is easy to take the familiar for granted, but after watching this movie several times it grew on me. <br /> <br /> The story of Gray Owl is well known to many Canadians, who are grateful to Attenborough director and screenwriter Nicholson. to expand the story. <br /> <br /> Brosnan portrays a complex person well, a very good presentation. Annie Galipo is beautiful in her first big role. The rest of the cast is solid.
