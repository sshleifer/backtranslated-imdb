This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I agreed to watch a movie about tiptoes, and somehow it ended. I have never heard of it or anyone else in it (except Mike from Friends). <br /> <br /> But it's great! Eva, Lake and Paul give amazing views. Humor is constantly dry and witty. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd largely plays the microphone character from Friends (which works great). The other characters are stereotypes, and the plot is formulaic (I mean that we don’t say Apocalypse Now). But the characters are cute, the story is interesting, the soundtrack, the staging and the direction work well. <br /> <br /> In all the great well-being films that really deserve more respect than ever. <br /> <br /> Everyone has their own tastes, but I really don’t understand what reviews one star gives.
