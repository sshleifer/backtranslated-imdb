This film is a real and historical film. This is very useful for those who are exploring the LDS church, because it is 100% true. This is a great movie and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is a very actual, exciting and motivating film. Some people think that this is not a fact, but it is. <br /> <br /> This is about restoring the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and about the prophet Joseph Smith, who restored it. In his life, events such as the illness he suffered when he was a little boy, wooing Emma Smith, Emma, ​​his wife, giving birth, and so on, occur. But most importantly, it reveals the restoration of the church.
