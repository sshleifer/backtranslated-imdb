This movie is awesome. The plot was just ... wow. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by the performance of Gackt and Hyde after I grew up in the American world of actors who can't sing and singers who can't play. <br /> <br /> In this film, young Shaw (Gackt) meets the vampire Kay (Hyde). Over time, they form an unlikely friendship. Kei suffers from being forced to live at the expense of others, the half-life of a vampire. <br /> <br /> This is a sad film, but not juicy. The plot was very unique, and contrary to your typical vampire film. The storyline was thick, with twists and fascinating movements. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I would say is that the film, despite the absence of a happy, albeit peaceful end, is several languages. I had an unsurpassed version (I was lucky that I understood everything, except some Cantonese), so I would recommend getting something with subtitles. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was just awesome.
