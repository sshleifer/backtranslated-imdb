It was a good movie. It was not your usual war film, but something a bit different. This film showed us recruits in training before the war, not in the war. This film is one of the most realistic views on war and the army than most other similar films. Colin Farrell did a great job portraying a military recruit, and Clifton Collins Jr. and Matthew Davis made a good contribution. Seeing Colin Farrell moving from one level to another in a few short years, you would never think that this would happen. I will also add that the creators of tigrland did a great job of shooting the film in 2000, and it looked like 1970 was a good touch. It's nice to see that talent is used wisely, and I hope to see this talent again in the near future.
