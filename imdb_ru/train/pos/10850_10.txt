What a good movie! Finally a picture showing the unknown side of the cliff: illusions of glory. Famous rockers are aging and forgotten, not music. And with a good sense of humor. Have you ever danced on Bill Haley's Rock and Roll? <br /> <br /> In any case, “Mad” is probably the best rock and roll movie I've ever seen. Much better than, for example, Spinal Tap. What for? Because in Still Crazy people are already mature. They have a different point of view on rock, on love and on life. They want to catch up with their crazy youth, which they lack so much. In addition to the story itself, we see characters with their own personality, weaknesses and dreams. Like any of us. <br /> <br /> Spend time watching this (listen to the amazing soundtrack!) And finally, thinking about your future. <br /> <br /> Goodbye!
