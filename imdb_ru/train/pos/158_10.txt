I have seen this film more than once, and someone always complains about the “obvious construction” of the plot after this. But then - this is part of the game Petzold: he plays by the rules of the genre. <br /> <br /> It is very nice that the incredible story about the meeting of two girls (Timoteo / Hummer) is again reflected in another, even more incredible story, that the girls are catching up. This film is a journey between fact and fiction, it is more about potentials, things that could happen in the past or in the future than about real events. This is a kind of thoughtfulness — so appropriate that there are many motives that Freud could find interesting for analyzing his dream, like all the constellations of the “double”. <br /> <br /> In addition, I think that the Hespenster can be interesting to see compared to the current Asian cinema of the supernatural: Petzold’s everyday urban architecture is also felt in an unobtrusive, strangely familiar form. This film is not about the obvious. To describe it as the story of two girls who meet and end up becoming friends and lovers, or as the story of an orphan mother who is searching for a lost daughter in Europe, says absolutely nothing about the nature of the Hespenser. ,
