I just watched the documentary "Fog City Mavericks" on the Starz cable television network. This is without a doubt one of my most pleasant viewing experiences! It tells about the artists and creative talents of the San Francisco Bay Area, responsible for some of the best films ever made. In addition to the listed well-known artists, t also includes segments with Irwin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and the Pixar Animation Studios segment. I hope that it will be released on DVD - it is necessary for any collection about the history of cinema and brilliant film production. If you are even remotely interested in movies and the people who create them, you will not be disappointed.
