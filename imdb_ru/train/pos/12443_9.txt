I like this movie. It was great to see a version so close to the vision of Peter O'Donnell. <br /> <br /> Many people did not like the film, but it should be viewed in the context of the origin of what it is. The film uses memories to show young modesty and events that turned her into the woman she became. In front of the network. Do Willy Garvin. <br /> <br /> The tempo is a little slow, and, for my taste, there is not enough tension in modern scenes. However, this is only acceptable in order to get such a valid version. <br /> <br /> If you like Modesty Blaise, you will even like its flaws, if you just want a car chase action, forget about it. <br /> He has the feeling that he is the first of the franchise, but since I have never seen him move anywhere, I suspect that he will not be more than follow. Unfortunately.
