Ah, the best and funniest film about female football fans is only slightly better than the 1982 saga of teenage delusions in North London (see). By the way, I just watched this in film 4 [2008-12-21] and regret my inability to establish the PVR). <br /> <br /> This is easily my second favorite football film after “Mike Bassett:“ England manager ”, but this time with an added twist, it looks like a partisan film made by a team that obviously continues to make films that are forbidden. in the country in which they were shot (just think about where the girls are taken from the stadium when the sun goes down: a quick reaction from all sides). <br /> <br /> The movie rarely makes me laugh out loud, but when a rural soldier escorts one of the girls to the shelter, forcing her to put on an inpromptu mask made from the poster by Ali Daei, I couldn't stop waking the others in my house with my snorts, especially when a young soldier misunderstood his grandfather's calls for help ... <br /> <br /> Speaking of toilets, I just wanted to speak Farsi so that I could write a toilet graffiti (yes, there were some scribbles in Latin , but they mostly belonged to wandering American rock bands). <br /> <br /> Also in the countryside Theme of Farsi, do you not think that Omid Jalili sounds like a yokel when he speaks Farsi? Listen to the guardian sergeant in this film, and then say "Yes." <br /> <br /> I’m not going to miss Iran’s sexual politics, and I’m not going to miss the dubious play of actors; My love for this film comes from script and editing: first-class things. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of my favorite football movies: 1. Mike Bassett, manager of the England team 2. Offside 3. Those Glory Glory Days 4. A blow to glory 5. The mystery of the Arsenal stadium
