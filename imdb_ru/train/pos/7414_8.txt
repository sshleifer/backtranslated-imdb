It was a very nice movie. Humorous, but sharp look at the family and the obligations that are associated with it. The story of a man who returns from his life in the city to his father's bath in a small Chinese village. There he learns to appreciate and even cherish the things he left at home to run away from him. The film is visually beautiful and emotionally beautiful.
