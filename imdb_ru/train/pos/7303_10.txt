I managed to see this classic for the first time just a few weeks ago. Made almost 30 years ago, I thought scary moments would be pretty tame. The boy was wrong. There are some great moments that made me flinch. Even the acting was great, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic, and Donald Pleasant was great. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the launch can be quite slow, but as soon as it starts, it cannot be stopped. This makes all imitators, for example, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Screams look very tame. I can't say that this is the best Carpenter, because I have not seen many of his, the only thing I can remember from him is Starman (I think he did it). Halloween is the crown of the horror genre.
