This is an intellectual horror film in investigative and procedural style that will force the hounds to chase the search for cheap thrills. <br /> <br /> Some people don't like any movie shot on video. This attitude is very old-fashioned and provincial. This attitude and the kind of films that put technical issues above entertainment or artistic value. These relationships are at the exit. Without a doubt, ZODIAC KILLER is a low-budget film, but astute viewers will go further and find an elaborate pearl.
