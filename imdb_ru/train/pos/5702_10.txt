I did not expect Val Kilmer to make a convincing John Holmes, but I found myself forgetting that it was not a porn legend myself. In fact, the whole cast has turned out in an amazing play in this film with an extremely underestimation. <br /> <br /> As mentioned earlier, find the two-disc set and first watch the Wadd documentary; This will give you a lot of background history to help evaluate the film. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to be unhappy that there is a video from the LAPD crime scene on the DVD. There are a number of reasons why it could be included, one of which is that the trial of the murder of John Holmes was the first in the United States, where such a video was used by the prosecution. If you do not want to see it, it is easy to avoid; in the menu, it is clearly labeled as “LAPD crime scene”!
