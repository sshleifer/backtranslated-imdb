Yesterday I watched this movie for the third time. It was recommended to me fried a few weeks ago. I have never watched or even noticed this before, because it falls (usually) into the category of “Swedish film”, and those who grew up (like me) with Hollywood productions tend to be skeptical of any foreign films. Damn, what a shift in paradigm! The film touches me because it just keeps hoping that humanity can change for the better. The Swedish village is only a model for all areas on earth where people live together - controlled by religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, predictions, hidden cruelty, and the ability to have fun, meet, sing ... It requires a trigger mechanism from the outside to rip off the mask everyone (who keeps them) and make them feel that we are all just people with a desire to live our own life. I will never stop seeing such stories, because it supports my hope, as described above. Five minutes, which tells the story of Gabriella's song, including her performance, is one of my most vivid pictures! Thank you Kay Pollak only for these 5 minutes, which made me happy!
