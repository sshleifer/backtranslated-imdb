People forget that there were several robberies in King Kong - Congo, King Kong Godzilla, King Kong (1976), they all rob each other, but YETI stands on its own. He only borrows one element from King Kong, and this attracts the animal to one female. <br /> <br /> The myth of YETI is based on a snowman (not like in King Kong), and archaeologists were fascinated by him, at one time they Existed, but there is no scientific data to prove it. <br /> <br /> This movie is hard to find, but worth watching. The first time I watched him was at the Mistress of Elvira's Dark Shows in the early 1980s. In childhood, this caused a chill, especially when YETI got angry. I saw it again, at about 1:00 am on ABC about 2-3 years ago. Seeing this again made me appreciate it more, he has some general good effects (for his time), and the story involves a dumb boy and his dog, and an evil businessman who wants to kill YETI for his own purposes. In addition, the music is very cool, I really like YETI. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and the Yeti create an atmosphere resembling a monster. <br /> <br /> Vote 7 and a half out of 10.
