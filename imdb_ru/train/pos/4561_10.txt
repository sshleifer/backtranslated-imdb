I have seen this film three times already, and every time I see it, it becomes more personal and more emotional to watch. <br /> <br /> The acting is awesome, it’s not hard to believe because it is Daniel Day Lewis who is a terrific actor. Brenda Fricker is an amazing surprise at this, though. She captures your heart as the mother of a disabled boy who can neither walk nor talk until he is twenty years old. <br /> <br /> I can't say enough good words about the movie, but I’ll stop here. I recommend it to anyone who loves movies based on real events, or simply enjoys good dramas in general.
