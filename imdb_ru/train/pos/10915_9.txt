RKO Studios decided to borrow William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Colombia for one of their larger budget efforts to capitalize on The Thin Man’s popularity. To some extent they succeeded. <br /> <br /> Many people forget that in addition to Nick Charles even earlier than before, Bill Powell also played in several films of Philo Vance in the title role. Thus, by this time he was pretty well put on the role. Dr. Bradford doesn’t do as many liquid dinners as Nick Charles, but Nick's main trait is still there. One difference is that while Nick Charles married the heiress, Dr. Bradford makes a living as a doctor. It helps him in his search for a detective, and in fact it helps in this film. <br /> <br /> He has two murders to be uncovered. The jockey falls off a horse that is entering the homeland of a great race, and dies for no apparent reason. The trainer suspects that something is happening, but he ran into a more conventional method of bullet. This is after he turned for help to Bill Powell. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy had a more sustained influence on Bill Powell than Gene Arthur. Arthur plays more giddy ladies in him than Loy. But it works here, and he and Powell have good chemistry. <br /> <br /> Always reliable James Gleason is a police inspector in the role of Sam Leuven / Nat Pendleton. All they needed here was Asta and, perhaps, Eric Bloor, since the butler Powell wrote this part. <br /> <br /> If Powell and Arthur were signed in this studio, we could see a whole series of Bradford movies.
