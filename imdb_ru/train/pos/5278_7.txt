What begins as a generational conflict in this film ends with understanding, solemnity, and grace. The film wanders around Europe with a father and a young son sitting in a car for more than 3000 miles. The cramps make you face lifestyle, beliefs, and life skills. There really is no clear winner. All this ultimately develops as an experience, an experience of several layers of life. For those interested in understanding Islam, this film offers a generous and gentle look, not insisting on the agenda. This is the story of the age of majority for a young son, his dismissive and rebellious nature turns into an openness for more ways of life.
