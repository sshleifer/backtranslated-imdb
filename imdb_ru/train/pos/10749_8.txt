I rented it for my son, who recently found an interest in 9/11. At that time he was a kindergarten and had no idea what was going on. I liked how it was said as a “documentary”. If there was one film that I would recommend regarding 9/11, it would be one! Usually you see a movie in which there are actors who are well known. Nobody knew this movie. In addition, you see a film about 9/11, you hear about how one or two firefighters died saving people. I did not feel that it was any of that! I just rented this movie and will definitely consider adding it to my collection! Very well done really! My heart is drawn to the survivors and families of the victims of 9/11!
