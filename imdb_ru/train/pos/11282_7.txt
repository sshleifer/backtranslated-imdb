It was the second of a series of 6 "classic" films of Tarzan, in which Johnny Weismyuller played a major role, and Maureen O'Sullivan in the role of Jane. <br /> <br /> As usual, it was a wonderful movie in this series; and perhaps stands out as an “intermediate” film in a progression, which can almost serve as an example of the development of cinema from the early 1930s to the 1940s. As such, he showed good tempos, although not as well as in the next films. In addition, the cinematography is less perfect than the later films of Tarzan in this series. The action I saw was of uneven quality, with some grainy landscapes and underexposed and overexposed scenes. There is no clear indication of Tarzan’s later films. On the other hand, there is one scene, very early, in which the sharp movements of the camera with foliage waving in front of it when the camera retreats, showing safaris advancing into the jungle, were indeed almost modern in their style and contrasted sharply with the stationary shots that make up the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, one interesting feature here was the almost inconstancy and inconstancy of Jane when she was influenced by Martin. flirting. Kiss ?? and Jane is stunned and partly to blame, the reaction ?? foreshadow something about Jane, which we will see in the future in these films. Compare, for example, in Tarzana, finds a son! The dual actions of Jane deceived Tarzan and brought the Boy to his family. Later, she admits to Tarzan that she was wrong. There is nothing more obvious here, but we have Jane, “returning” to Jane Parker of past years and an almost repentant series, taking off her evening dress brought by Martin and Harry to lure her out of Tarzan. /> <br /> I was particularly struck by this whole series of images and episodes. <br /> <br /> First, here we see a picture of the inner life of Tarzan, as well as later. , a combination of sensual idyll with always close possibility of violent death. For me, this is largely the basis of Tarzan’s experience. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised by some pretty cruel scenes even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> There was a whole series of scenes that gave me particular pleasure: Tarzan leads the elephants to the Valley of the elephants; Tarzan was saved from the water death by a hippopotamus, and then cured by monkeys for health; The cheetah finds Tarzan when Jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the escarpment; A cheetah in particular crosses a river along a log. The final fighting scenes of savages and lions on the ground and savages and monkeys on trees. Jane, showing us that she really is from the world of Tarzan, quickly demonstrates her adventurous wooden ship to create a line of fire to hold the lions. <br /> <br /> The last series of scenes is gorgeous: Suddenly Tarzan is on stage, throwing savages from the trees and taking responsibility for the lions, and calling the elephants to help! The last triumphal cry of Tarzan, holding the happy Jane in his arms, with the dancing and admiring Cheetah next to them, is an unforgettable picture and a truly excellent summary of the history of Tarzan and Jane. <br /> <br /> In general, this is another great classic movie of Tarzan. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.
