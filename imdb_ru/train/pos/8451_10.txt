How I got into it: When I started watching this series on the Cartoon Network, I must say that I had never seen anything like it, and it was the best. But when I began to collect series on VHS, and years later on the DVD part of the collections of Bandai Anime Legends. It was amazing, and really worth seeing. He had many explosive actions that would blow you up from your place. And, of course, the best songs “Just Communication” and Rhythm Emotions were the best. <br /> <br /> Characters and Gundams: My favorite characters in the series were: Heero, Duo, Relena, Treize, Lady Und, Noin and Zechs. My favorite Gundams on the series that I liked the most are Wing Zero, Epyon and, of course, Altron, Deathscythe I and II. <br /> <br /> Meaning to show: this series also tells us that wars are very difficult in real life, and we can sometimes win or lose. But it is also difficult to achieve peace, and I believe that the Gundam pilots are doing the right thing and trying to achieve world peace. <br /> <br /> But this show is really the best of the best. So, in conclusion of this review, after you watch this show, watch the movie “Endless Waltz”.
