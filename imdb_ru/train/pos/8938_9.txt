A wonderful version of a bestseller film and a stunning Broadway play about the life of Sadie and Bessie Delaney, two African-American sisters who lived over 100 years old and told their story that marks the centenary of American history. Ruby Dee and Diaann Carroll give very good results, like Bessie and Sadie, respectively. Amy Madigan is also as good as Amy Hill Hart, the white reporter for the New York Times, whose article on the sisters published a book, etc. Many scenes of memories and even many of the modern ones are very powerful, if not quite inspiring, like in a book. This is the only real disadvantage in combination with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not clearly presented, for example, the interracial origin of the mother of the sisters and why their father was so severe. But besides this, a very well-made, excellently executed, powerful film.
