Domestic import was a great movie. I laughed all the time. It was fun on many levels - from crazy outfits to funny situations. The game was great. Alla Koror, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman and everyone else did an excellent job. Since this is an independent film written by the first writer, there are no clich√©s expected from other comedies, which was such a relief. It was unique and interesting, and you fell in love with the characters and soul history. I heard that this is based on a true story? If so, then it's fun (and amazing!). I highly recommend this movie.
