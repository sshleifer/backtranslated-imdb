This film is fantastic, as it tells the storytelling and fantasy as a child does for adults. The idea that children's drawings become a place that she can visit physically and which can be influenced is amazing. At the same time, you could tell all the child psychologists about this and say that she really explores her subconscious, just like we do in our dreams when we sleep. The little thing that gives me goosebumps is when her dad is in a paper house and chases after her. The only thing I can not stand, is that it was sold as a horror film ... in fact, it is not. If you want to see something British with a lot of storyline that makes you guess, without the usual cheap thrill that most movies have to use, then watch Paperhouse.
