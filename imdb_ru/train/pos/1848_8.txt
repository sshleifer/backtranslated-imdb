A few years ago, the navy kept away from the filming of the movie "People of Honor" - a film based on the experience of the struggle of the first black master diver service to overcome violent racism. Always ready to support films showing the best side of our US fleet. Nimitz and two helicopter carriers with supporting shore installations were provided in addition to this fascinating tale of the battle of a young sailor with uncontrollable fury. Part of the film was filmed aboard the USA. Wood Bello. <br /> <br /> Antwon Fisher wrote the screenplay debut of director Denzel Washington in which he acts as a psychiatrist for the Navy, treating Fisher, in the role of which Derek Luke played effectively and deeply. <br /> <br /> Fisher is obviously a bright soldier assigned to the USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3), an advanced helicopter platform. It seems that Fisher cannot avoid his own attacks with minimal provocation by his conscripts. Directed to the MD as part of a possible pre-separation process, Fisher slowly opens up to a black psychiatrist, showing a terrible childhood with great disdain and trembling cruelty. <br /> <br /> The story develops as a Fisher cautiously, but more and more. trusts his doctor and takes courage to take up love interest, a soldier by the name of Cheryl, played by stunningly beautiful Joy Bryant. <br /> <br /> Fisher reluctantly makes contact with the doctor, asking long, boiling questions, but soon he realizes that he needs to look for answers, no matter how painful, to grow and move away from destructive, conflict-seeking behavior . <br /> <br /> Although all the main characters are black, this story goes beyond the race, while at the same time demonstrating the evil of violent religiosity and concomitant hypocrisy in a foster family. Viola Davis, the universal actress that can be seen in many recent films, is a picture of sullen immorality, but nothing compared to the foster mom, Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), who in short, but burning scenes would work - if she existed - Oscar for cruelty in the intestines. <br /> <br /> Films about the interaction between the patient and the therapist follow a certain predictability (all these things are transference and countertransference), but the seriousness of Fisher and his doctor / mentor really captures. This is a good story, well told. Period. <br /> <br /> Being in the navy, “Antwone Fisher” is in no sense a service history, as was the case with “Men of Honor,” an excellent film that told about crushing racism against real person. This is not a movie about blacks. It is about experiencing terrible childhood experiences and, as Fisher says, to be able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still "standing on his feet." The persecutors are reduced in size and importance, as a brave and strong young man declares his right to a decent life with the help of a caring doctor. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say is that Washington is the commander of the lieutenant, but he is being approached. as a commander. With all the support people of the Navy listed in the final credits, someone had to tell the director Washington that his character, like all naval officers below the rank of commander, is called “Mr.”. Not a lot of criticism, is it? :) <br /> <br /> I don’t know why this film is played in very few cinemas. It deserves wide distribution. Derek Luke may well get an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> 8/10. <br /> <br />
