It was actually my favorite Scooby-Doo series when I was younger. I thought that in each episode there was something more, and the villains put a lot of creative thought into it (and even very scary and believable). Some of the best episodes were “I left my neck in San Francisco”, “Twenty thousand screams under water”, “Ghoul, Bat and Ugly” and “When you wish a star creature”. If you have never seen these episodes, please do. This series was a bit mixed, although there were other episodes that did not have the same advantage as, for example, "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" and "Ransom Of Scooby Chief". Like the previous series, it was very well composed, an interesting plot and brilliantly traced. However, as everyone says, without Skrappi Doo it would be much better. The character was tedious and distracted from the story being told.
