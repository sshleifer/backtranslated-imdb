I bought this year or more for $ 2 (yes, $ 2), left it on the shelf for ages, now I watch a DVD while hiding from the cold. <br /> <br /> This is a haunting movie. Brilliant performances of all the participants, especially the 6-year-old boy (about the only smiles you get in this movie). <br /> <br /> The plot reminds me, perhaps, of my favorite movie, the Grosse Pointe Blank, but, obviously, it's carefree, it's With a heavy heart. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, clinical and forensic psychologist, I was shaken by a shiver when the identity of the new contract was revealed. Scary things! Great job. <br /> <br /> Pete
