In general, this film is not perfect. It does not “keep well” together, since the storyline is, in fact, a bunch of hooks to hang jokes. <br /> <br /> Some of these jokes are a bit “too 80s” and tend to appear in the photo. <br /> But some of these jokes are classic. <br /> <br /> You know that there is something special about the film when you and your friends still quote silly quotes from it more than two decades later. <br /> <br /> Plus, there are several familiar faces; Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilou Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dann and one of the last roles of Alan Hale, Jr., Skipper from Gilligan Island. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are some wonderful absurd moments, for example, when Johnny marks puppies with a price gun or dad appears in the Johnny area. In addition, the scene where the fake priest says a lot of words in Latin is superb. ("Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, radio is too loud ... Fast meridian, ante meridian, uncle meridian"). <br /> <br /> Other classic scenes include Ramon Maroni, English slayer of Danny DeVito calling Griffin Dunne on “Play Ball” Peter Boyle, thinking he lost his masculinity. Fake VD movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a home run. But, as in Porky's, there are enough classic comedic beats in it to make it memorable.
