I love this film! 10 out of 10 hands! It's damn good! I'm not a big fan of movies, but I must say that this opened my eyes. Striking color and fast energy. I was lucky to catch this on screening during Zoinks! The Boston Film Festival, and the story really embraced me from the very beginning. It had many themes and characters for adults, and when it ended, I wanted more. I hope they make a sequel. That would be fun. My only problem with this is the performance of Melissa Connor in the role of Ani. Ugh! She sucks! I saw a piece of wood pull the best performance. I do not understand what the director was thinking about when shooting it. But if you ignore it, you can not give this movie a big ten !!!
