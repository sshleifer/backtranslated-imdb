Mardi Gras: “Made in China” provides a wonderful, complex connection between popular culture, nudity and globalization through the making and throwing of beads. I saw this film at the International Film Festival in Boston and expected a dry acquaintance with globalization, but what I got was an exciting visual display of shocking shots from China and the United States. An eye-opening film is humorous, comprehensive, serious, not patronizing, and it makes you want more in the role. It is worth comparing with Murderball - it is just so well done. Young women workers in China have different points of view, and the owner is amazingly open to the discipline. Gourmets during the carnival are a highlight, but only because this excellent film gives a detailed context in a factory in China without narration. Bravo to the director for entering and finishing the film! I would never have thought about the connection between beads, China and New Orleans; Now I think about the human connection between almost every object, but also about the role of globalization, inequality and fun. More importantly, I can establish these connections without feeling guilty after watching this film, unlike other globalization films that I have seen.
