Viggo Mortensen plays the role of a new prisoner in a haunted prison, in which the warden (well played by Lane Smith) has a terrible secret, which may be the reason that various prison guards and prisoners are killed by supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is a lifeguard who knows the secret and fears for his life. When I think of prison films, I always think of action films involving Stallone or Van Damme or high-level dramas such as Shawshank Escape or The Green Mile. However, I did not expect the ghost story to be more like Exorcist III. The prison, however, is an atmospheric effort and, of course, remains the best film in the career of Renny Harlin. The film is creepy and has a good game from the actors (at the time) unknowns. Lane Smith looks the best, because his warden is not the usual clich√© of personified evil, but rather nervous and irritable, which adds some credibility to the film, which far exceeds expectations. <br /> <br /> *** of 4- (Good)
