I read a book and watched a movie. Both are great. The film is a diamond among the coals in this era. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and convey the intensity of their characters without flaws. This film was supposed to make them stars. Shame on the studio that they didn't leave all that they had behind the movie. This could be an easy franchise. A DVD release is a must, and a decent remake would revive this film. Look for it in your television guide, and if you see it on the list, no matter how late, watch it. You will not be disappointed. Do yourself another service - read the book (the same name). It will blow you away. Since then, times have changed dramatically, or at least we like to think that they have changed.
