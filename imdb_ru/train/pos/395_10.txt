This amazing martial arts fantasy, visually stunning and full of oriental philosophy, is presented to you by the main director Cui Hark, the man behind some of the best films made in Hong Kong. The special effects are beautiful and original. The plot is a bit on the cerebral side, but it is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons. However, if you think that this is not your forte, this may not be your movie. Maybe you should see the latest news from a Hollywood studio with no brains, but if you are looking for something more, he will find it.
