All I can say is that if you donâ€™t fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie, then you are not human! Even after I watched it for the first time, I was hooked. This is an exciting experience that is hard to describe, and I am sure that other fans will witness it. Looking at it, you will cry, thinking that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us. At least we have the Gray Gardens to remember them! I think that we all strive to enjoy the tough independence that these two ladies were endowed with. Although I have always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy, she will not remain in your heart, as Big and Little Edie do. What a rare pleasure to know such people; I only wish I had!
