This film is one of the exceptions to the rule that the sequel is worse than the original. His comedy is at its best. This film - comedy thriller, where every second something happens. Repeatedly, the entire audience laughed loudly at the joke. <br /> <br /> A big advantage is watching the first movie, but this is not a requirement. <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta kanal 2 also have the advantage of parodying the latest reality series, such as Survivor (expedition: Robinson Swedish). This is a Swedish film for a Swedish audience. Therefore, I do not see this if you are not familiar with Sweden and its language. Otherwise: have fun! Johan
