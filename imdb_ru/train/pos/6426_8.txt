One of the best films about the "return of Amitabha", which I liked. This was the stage when Govinda became strong with Dhavan. The songs were amazing and completely, as we call it, “suits”. Evergreen entertainer with similar multi-faceted Anupam Kher participating in the game. There are a lot of funny turns and turns in the storyline, as is known from David Dhavan's potboilers. With the timely arrival of Mrs. Madhuri "Nene" Dixit, this was a complete rebellion towards the end. It was great to see Amit speak with such force and humor after a long exile. Although some may consider this a typical Bollywood Masala movie, I watch it any day. I give him 8 points out of 10 just for the fact that I am a clean Bollywood.
