If you need Scream or something like a horrible product for a big studio that is being imposed on us these days, do not worry. This well-written film made me think about everything he could say. The importance of myth in our lives, to understand how children interpret the world (and violence in it), our plundering of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends ... everything is here, but not on the surface. Technically, you can call it a monster movie, even if Wendigo doesn't take physical form to the end, and then even you and your beliefs about what happens to the legendary spirit / beast. Some standard thriller elements for those who are looking for only the basics and the movie will never get bored, although in fact, the less you see the creatures, the better. Fessenden successfully continues the tradition of George Romero - to use this genre as a parable and as a discussion forum, but at the same time to keep us in fear.
