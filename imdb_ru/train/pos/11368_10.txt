Surprisingly complex and well-developed study of the "First" serial killer in the USSR. A scene from the productions of Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland, created during perestroika, enlivens this tense play. <br /> <br /> This study of Sicatillo as a murderer is well rounded and hints at some of his actions while directly showing others there is a subtlety that is irresistible, without being clearly graphic. However, not for the faint of heart, as its topic is often troubling, but necessary for the full development of the main participants of this story, based on facts. <br /> <br /> HBO provided us a great film in an unusual way. Congratulations to the director and editor of this wonderful piece. This is in my Top 10 must see list.
