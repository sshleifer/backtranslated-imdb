It is rare to find such a perfect film like this one. This is truly one of the best, most structured films I've ever seen. Each line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways, treating each of the three main characters differently. The film weaves an internal network of motifs and double crosses that trap you and refuse to let go. Add to this that the slow romance between Kevin and Fay is as touching as anything that has ever been devoted to celluloid, and you have the ingredients for a perfect movie. He reveals the romance of films such as Titanic, as banal clich√©s. If you are looking for a movie to watch while you fold the laundry, this is not true. You have to dedicate yourself to this film. You can not talk, running into the room and leaving it. This film needs your attention. Treat it with the respect you deserve, and you will get a lot from it. Unless you think Titanic is the greatest movie of all time.
