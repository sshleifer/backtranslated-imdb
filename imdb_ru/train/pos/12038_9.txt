Yes, a real classic! This is the essence of the British drama - realism and minimal use of special effects (and inflated budgets). The last time I saw this drama was when it was last shown on British terrestrial television in 1994. It really should look everyone who likes a terrible story, without big names, but, nevertheless, with a great game. This great drama is unlikely to be shown soon. I recently purchased Woman in Black on VHS, so now I can enjoy this really great British drama again. You should also try! <br /> <br /> Mark R. Khorobin
