My comment would have been added to the RELEASE DATE section, but I could not find a place for it. I was very surprised to see that this film was released in the USA in February 1955. I saw him at the First Launch Cinema in Washington, DC, in March 1958. I wonder if it was reissued or some kind of problem? ? In my opinion, this film is very light entertainment, but there are several classic characters in it. John McIntyre works great as a corrupt judge / entrepreneur / thief. Walter Brennan basically plays the same role as in the Red River a few years earlier. And, in my opinion, James Stewart gives the same great idea as ever. I have seen this movie half a dozen times or more, and never get tired of watching parts of it again. Photography and scenery are great, and they offer a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty-six minutes.
