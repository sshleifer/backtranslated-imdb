This is actually a trilogy of three short stories by Somerset Maugham. The first is Verger, which lasts about 15 minutes and is very pleasant. After 17 years, Albert Forman was dismissed from work in the church because he can neither read nor write. So what does he do? Of course, opens a tobacco shop! <br /> <br /> Secondly, Mr. Nerdy, who actually was a story I read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgot, until I heard a familiar introduction. Another 15 minutes one, and also very good. For me, it worked better than in the book, but perhaps this is because the last time I was only 14 years old. <br /> <br /> The third one is almost disappointing. Almost an hour in length, it just pulls. It's not so bad, but not as fast and fast as the last 2. I looked at the first quarter of an hour, and then moved on to the last four hours and found that it still makes sense, and I really did not miss the thing! <br /> <br /> In general, I give them 8, 9, and 6 out of 10, respectively.
