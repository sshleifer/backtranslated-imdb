In my opinion, the middle of the film, especially the love scene, is too long, but all the time you can imagine this feeling of the desert. but the best thing that made this film unforgettable is the gorgeous explosive pictures, their color, slow motion, and the pink Floyd music are unique in the history of the movie! <br /> <br /> Destruction in its popular and popular form.
