I think that if you asked most JW if they expected the miraculous because of their faith, you would find that they do not. I know not. Instead, you will find that they believe the promises made by Christ about the resurrection. Therefore, even if the worst happens and we die, preserving our integrity, Jehovah can and will correct it. <br /> <br /> It really comes down to a simple question: is God real for you or is it all just believing? If he is real and you trust him, you will follow his instructions, no matter what the short-term outcome may be. <br /> <br /> I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One of my family members was terrified when she saw the words "NO BLOOD" written in large letters above my table. I reasoned with her that if I were in a state that only a blood transfusion could save my life, would this be a good time for anger, if only one could bring me back to life when the time comes? She did not understand - God is simply not enough for her. Very bad. I wish she could be comforted by a strong faith.
