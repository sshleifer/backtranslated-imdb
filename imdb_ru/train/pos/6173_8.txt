A great movie. The game â€” from the doctor to the pavement painter to the main prostitute, with very few exceptions, was remarkable; I thought Sonia Hrazdan (Mrs. Noble) and Vrajesh Hirji (Saurabh) were the best of lesser-known actors. Even Kurush Debu (Tehmul), who can be accused of an excess, was a completely plausible and familiar character. <br /> <br /> Another great thing was camera work - and how it captured the energy of the Bombay streets, the calm of Gustav reading his prayers and life in tiny apartments. <br /> <br /> I liked the story of the wall, which becomes a shrine and then collapses - and artists perceive it philosophically. <br /> <br /> Nice to see good films on Indian themes.
