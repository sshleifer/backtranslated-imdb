Hello everyone, I am a chess enthusiast since 6 years old. I assumed that I was rather obsessed with chess, but, hopefully, not like the central character in this film. <br /> <br /> In this film, the central character reflects the real chess player Kurt von Bardeleben, who committed suicide in 1924. He is known for his game against Steinitz, where Steinitz played an excellent combination. Instead of resigning, he simply left the tournament hall, never to return. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the social incompetence of the central character is enjoyed by some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes get at chess tournaments. Chess, I believe, is a very big sacrifice, and you can sometimes find yourself in an imbalance in other areas of life. The main example of this is the chess legend Bobby Fisher. Although he was a genius, he was also very worried. <br /> <br /> The film depicts the World Cup match between the Italian grandmaster and Luzhin. The format is a knockout, which in fact the Fide World Governing Body sometimes used as the format itself - from 128 players to 2 in the final. But it was a group knockout, which also displays a realistic format in which the winners of each group play against each other. <br /> <br /> The position before closing makes itself an interesting chess puzzle. In fact, I shot a video on YouTube so that you can study the winning combination in detail - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best Regards, Trifon
