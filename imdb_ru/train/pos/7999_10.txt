It must be one of the best, if not the best film that I have seen for a long, long time. There was enough action to satisfy the fan, and yet the plot was very good. I really liked the movie, and I hooked me from start to finish. <br /> <br /> He added blood and blood there, but he brought in the realistic nature of what is happening in front of the film, and even had a tear I must think that the moron ends for many. <br /> <br /> Be sure to watch everything. Saw a lot of reviews, showing the film, but, frankly, most of the films that get bad reviews, are among the best. this proves once again. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, buy this movie, just go out and watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.
