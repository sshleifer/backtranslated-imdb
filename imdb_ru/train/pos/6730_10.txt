I wrote comments in IMDb, but no longer do. It happens that IMDb has become massive, and, therefore, subjectivity has spoiled the assessment. What I mean? Anyone who does not particularly love movies and has no experience in this matter, looks at some nonsense (or vice versa), and if he likes it, gives out 10, and if not, he goes to 1. It certainly doesn’t can measure anything correctly. Now about the film. I sincerely regret that I ever put some tens for very few films, because then I have to score this one with 12 or 13, which is impossible. In this documentary, there is something that I do not expect to see in my entire life in any other film. It is simply fascinating, and it is not just a way of saying; it really is. The last 25 minutes are filled with energy, visual fun and wisdom - the words spoken by the guys playing the main role - that really ... there is no coincidence. I don’t store films, rarely would I find any sense in this, but this one is the type of film you have to buy and store, and watch from time to time maybe 10 or 20 times over time. I have nothing to say. This is a real, objective goal for me.
