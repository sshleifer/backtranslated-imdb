This is really a great and heartbreaking movie !!!! Ripsteinâ€™s locations are impressive, highly detailed and well lit, the dialogue is extremely unusual, no doubt Garcia Marquez. Fernando Luhan and Marisa Paredes give us outstanding performances as a colonel and his wife. <br /> <br /> You should see this !!!
