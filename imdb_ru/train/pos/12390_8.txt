A bizarre horror film filled with famous people, but stolen by Christina Raines (later “TV Flamingo Road”), as a pretty but somewhat unstable model with a sticky smile who has to pay for her suicide attempts, guarding the Gates to Hell! The scenes with Raines' simulation are very well captured, the mood music is beautiful, Deborah Ruffin is charming as Christina's boyfriend, but when Raines enters the eerie brown stone of Brooklyn Heights (populated by the blind priest on the top floor), things really start to get ready, Neighbors, including the fantastically evil Burgess Meredith and the strange couple Sylvia Miles and Beverly D'Angelo are devilish people, and Eli Wallach is very funny, like a cunning police detective. The film - almost cross-pollination of "Baby Rosemary" and "Exorcist" - but what a combination! Based on the best-selling book by Jeffrey Convita, "The Sentinel" is a funny creepy, full of upheaval, well shot by director Michael Winner, who peers into a thoughtfully depressed, ending with a skill. *** 1/2 of ****
