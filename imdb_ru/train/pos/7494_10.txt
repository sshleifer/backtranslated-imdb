Mysterious killings in a European village seem to be the result of a horde of THE VAMPIRE BAT plaguing a frightened community. <br /> <br /> This amazingly effective little thriller was created by Majestic Pictures, one of the Hollywood studios Potops Row. Sparse production values ​​and rough editing actually add to its eerie atmosphere and give it an almost expressionistic quality. In general, it leaves the viewer with the feeling that he has been caught in a bad dream, which is suitable for a thriller of this kind. <br /> <br /> Although a possible explanation for heinous crimes is rather ridiculous and not quite. With proper development of the plot, the film boasts a good cast. The grave of Lionel Atville gives another of his typical speeches, this time as a doctor conducting research in the old castle. Beautiful Fay Ray plays her assistant in a role that requires her to do a little more than just look beautiful and alarmed. Dur Melvin Douglas looks like a puzzled police inspector, who also turns out to be a comfortable Miss Ray guy. <br /> <br /> Maud Abern, who can be very funny, given the right situation, is stolen by most of her scenes like Miss Ray's hypochondriac aunt. Elderly Lionel Belmore plays a scared village hamburger. And little Dwight Fry, who will always be remembered for his strange roles in the films FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula, is most effective here as a bat-loving person.
