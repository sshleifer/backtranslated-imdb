When I saw this movie, I was amazed that it was only a television movie. I think this movie should have been in theaters. I have seen a lot of rape movies, but this one stands out. This film has a kind of realism, which is very rare in modern films, not to mention television films. He tells a story that Iâ€™m sure is very realistic for many rape victims in small towns today, and I found it very believable (which is hard to find in other rape films) I also thought that Tiffany Theyssen and Brian Austin Green were great in the roles they played. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies that have a hard reality. I really liked it.
