The surprise hit was generally better than the Enforcer, in my opinion. It was created to be a great movie, but then I saw the villains and was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sudden exposure was different from previous releases. The plot in this film went in a different direction, as “Dirty Harry” this time is not very suitable for the police. We also won't see villains (s) until late, which means less screen time, which is better for all of us. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood again steals the show as “Dirty Harry”, enough said Pat Hingle was pleasant in the role of chief Jennings, the new appointed boss of Harry. Bradford Dillman seemed to change his name here to Captain Briggs, anyway, he was no different. Michael Kerry is decent as Lieutenant Donnelly, annoying Harry's boss. I personally liked Kevin Major Howard as Hawkins, a young punk who has a vendetta against Harry. Albert Popwell was great, like Horace, buddy Harry. Audrey J. Ninan was good as Ray Parkins, a famous lesbian in the city. Jack Thibault was played as Kruger, a pervert. Now for the really bad part. Sandra Locke, Eastwood's longtime mistress, was terribly wrong, like Jennifer Spencer, Harry's love interest. And Paul Drake was just awful, like Mick. <br /> <br /> Cinema would be much better if it were not for the best composition and acting skills in some parts. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
