I totally disagree. I thought it was a great movie for kids. Dawn wells from the island of Gilligan, and the promise shown then hardly known by Dana Plato. It was Disney, and can hardly be ignored as meaningless fluff. This is not scary and should not be. I did not spoil the ending. But it was unusual, as it was done. I mean, the children's characters were great, and I didn't know what to expect at the end. The plot also has much more in common with these children than you say that the fact that these children were experienced fishermen is central to the plot, especially at the initial stage. It also helps them get out of the mash by the end. He also has a plus not to be too long
