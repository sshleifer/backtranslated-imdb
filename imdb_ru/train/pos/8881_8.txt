First, you need to take into account the period of time in which this film was shot. 1995 year. There were rappers in it, and it added to his talent. <br /> <br /> Remy was a socially awkward teenager who tried to find his way, and could not, until he met and became friends with the Nazis. They accepted it. The Nazis are not so embarrassing, but, like most gangs, they fill the void, which is absent, be it economic, social, emotional, whatever. Michael Rappaport played a great role. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps was the star of a popular track with questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder. He continued to try to pity himself and his plight, and forced his girlfriend and professor to correct him. <br /> <br /> Kristen was a young white girl who tried to find herself and tried to fit in while she was raped on a date. Then she found herself experimenting with her sexuality and taking political part. <br /> <br /> This film is about racism, and, like most things related to racism, people’s own views come into play. <br /> <br /> I read so many comments that there were no “evil” black characters, but there were evil white (Nazis). So what? Remy was not at all portrayed as evil, he tried to find his way and continued to fail, until some skinheads accepted him. He was scared, it was sad to see him do that. He even speaks right before committing suicide, I didn’t mean it, I wanted to become an engineer. <br /> <br /> Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were evil blacks, Ice Cube was a kind of intellectual, and Busta Rhymes was just depicted as a stupid thug. Both of them didn’t care about their roommates at all and, as a rule, don’t really like white people. They were evil as Nazis, but not at the Nazi level in terms of total depravity. Sorry if this seems unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis? <br /> <br /> People say it shows white = bad black = good. Wrong, the only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (Omar Epps' roommate) was a good guy, and even Remy was a good guy, he was just confused. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Bust were seriously spoiled characters evil and inconsiderate. Although their constant harassment by the police seemed to justify their anger. Remy's inability seems to justify his anger. <br /> <br /> Good movie, well done. As with all films about racism, this is a great thing to discuss. <br /> <br /> I don’t think that Cube and Bust could defeat these Nazis.
