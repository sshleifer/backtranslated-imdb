<br /> <br /> In the film, where the black-haired Barbara Steele dominates, she was seen when I was seven or eight years old and created permanent images of pale vampire men and women chasing the castle in search of blood. Steele is an icon of horror films and otherworldly beauty, and the views of the walking dead of the preceding Romero Shambler “THE NIGHT OF THE LIVE DEATH” unite them in my memory. <br /> <br /> I don’t see the connection between this film and the film HUNTING, which is smart but ambiguous regarding the forces present. “LA DANZA MACABRE” is a no-claim bi-film, allowing you to fall in love with Barbara Steele and experience the consequences. There is no such draw to curb Claire Bloom. Comparisons with Ghosts are superficial. <br /> <br /> And no, this film does NOT need to be redone. Not only is it a product of the sixties, but a large percentage of untalented cretins in Hollywood cannot understand the MACABRE formula for terror. This formula is based on one main factor: GOOD LETTER. The classics of the low class, such as CASTLE and the films of Corman "On" with R. Mateson and Tourneur "Out of the past", have a common feature of strong writing. It's simple. Find a real writer such as Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie, and let them put the plot into today's cinematic mess. In addition, allow Hollywood to try to change the original material and stop using the clearly superior product of the past.
