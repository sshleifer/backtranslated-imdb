<br /> <br /> In 1970, after a five-year break, Kurosawa made his first color film. “Dodes Ka-Den” is a film that tells about the many intertwining stories that take place in a small Tokyo slum. <br /> <br /> The name comes from the sound made by a mentally retarded boy when he imagines that he is driving the train. We are gradually meeting people from a small community, two drunkards who sell wives, because they are unhappy with those who they have. The old man who is the center of the city who helps the robber who is trying to rob him. Very poor father and son who can never afford a house, so they imagine their own. By the end of the film, all the stories go full circle, some become happy, others sad. <br /> <br /> Since this was Kurosawa’s first color film, you can see that he is taking advantage of it, and this shows Maybe too much. This film goes in many different directions, and it is difficult to calm down and get into it. But don’t get me wrong, Dodez’s “Ka-den” may not be Kurosawa’s best, but, based on the greatest director of all time, this is much better than 99% of modern films.
