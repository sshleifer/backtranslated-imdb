This is what I wrote to some friends earlier: <br /> <br /> HOLY CRAP, The Grudge, to be honest, is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen! I either get very soft in old age, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures did KICK A ** work! (I can't wait for the Bogeyman!) <br /> <br /> I was very scared, sitting in a dark theater, and I wanted someone sitting next to me, except for the main character in Grudge. I watched the movie myself.) I swear there were a lot of jumping scenes that were NOT expected! I felt stupid, but my nerves didn't care! I was delighted with the whole movie, starting with the credits, and the music was fantastic scary. I always think about this sound, and I DON'T LIKE! <br /> <br /> I actually sobbed several times and shouted “o” in one scene !! Oh yes, I even closed my eyes several times! A word wise though: I thought some scenes were a bit psychotic. My DH hated Event Horizon and thought that the one who wrote it was sick and crazy, but I don't remember the movie, so I can't compare. <br /> <br /> I can't say that I “liked” this film c I was terrified, but it was very, very good and scary. The final scene too ... Wow! For a 32-year-old mom, I think I may have nightmares from this film, especially because of this sound. Please get out of my head;) <br /> <br /> In general, this is not a slasher as I grew up (Jason, Freddie). This is the most creepy movie. Ideal for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Two great trailers for this film - “Boogeyman” and “Ring 2”!
