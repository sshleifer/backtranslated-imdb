“The Running Man” is often called another fighter “Arnie”, full of explosions, bad puns and shooting, and, frankly, there is a lot of things in it. People used to look at this and compare it to the TV series Terminator, saying that it was one of the poorest Schwarzenegger films. <br /> <br /> But give it 18 years, and you can appreciate it in another light. Instead of being another brainless fighter, he works very well as a parody of a reality show. True, it is very different from the book by Stephen King, but I doubt that Hollywood, with his love for cheerful endings and the so-called “ordinary guys” who, as it turned out, had the skills of a trained commando, would have taken it in his book. The current form. <br /> <br /> But, back to the review. <br /> <br /> Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a police officer who works in the dystopian United States, where democracy is a thing of the past, and the government / media association drives the entire country. The economy is in tatters, the food is insufficient, and the state distracts people by creating sadistic game shows for them, such as Jumping for Dollars, where people jump for money through the pit of rabid dogs, and the most popular of them is Running Man. a game show organized by the skimpy Damian Killian (played by the entertaining Richard Dawson), where alleged "criminals" hunt theatrical, stalkers, hunters for "stalkers". <br /> <br /> Some, however, try to oppose the government. When a group of hungry people holds a protest in Bakersfield, California, a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to "calm" (i.e., kill) a protest. When Richards refuses to shoot innocent people, he is arrested and set up for killing people in a crowd. He is sentenced to a slave labor camp, but he runs with the help of a resistance leader (Japhet Cotto) and sets off to flight. <br /> <br /> However, his freedom does not last long, and after he abducts the network, employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso), trying to escape from those who haunt him, is taken prisoner again, but this time he is forced to appear in "Running Man". <br /> <br /> And there, of course, the entire film kicks into standard Arnie mode. Richards is sent to the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles (why is Los Angeles always destroyed in these gloomy worlds?) And forced to flee from the “stalkers” along with two other prisoners who fled with him from the labor camp. Amber also begins to be interested in Richards' protests for innocence and discovers that he was framed. Guess what will happen to her? So, when Amber, Richards and two other guys are running around trying to avoid their pursuers, we soon realize that Richards is no ordinary cop. He is Super Arnie, an unkillable army consisting of one man who can destroy evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered with Christmas lights and still be an ordinary American guy with an Austrian accent. <br /> <br /> Yes, the rest of the film becomes dumb, loud, classic, funny Arnie 80s. There are many exciting fight sequences, horrible trademark puns (“He had to share,” being my favorite), and a total formal final confrontation and happy ending. It is very funny to see how Killian reacts to this in the typical “healthy” manner of the game, and also some of the funniest moments in the series revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as a seemingly benevolent host. for the damned old woman!) and the cold, cynical person whom he will actually do to raise the rating. <br /> <br /> If you expect an intelligent film with high eyebrows, you will be disappointed. But if you want a big movie of the 80s, that's all. But the great thing about this film is that it was rather prophetic. <br /> <br /> If you look at our entertainment today, you will notice how a reality show is currently being shown - a show with the participation of people who want to give five minutes of fame, and the producers are too willing to let them humiliate themselves by tv Not too far to imagine that some nasty television performer is trying to get the right to show people who will be executed live on TV. We already had this, however, with the horrific al Qaeda hostages beheading videos posted on the Internet. It seems that in the present circumstances, at least some people watch death very well on their televisions. <br /> <br /> Given this, and combined with the fact that everything today seems to be the 80s Revival, you should be impressed by the vision of this film. Of course, we have not yet achieved this, because it was the terrorists, and not the mainstream media, who bought us easily accessible programs about real human death, but you just need to wonder how much time will pass before any executive director decides to check. find a way to make a show that combines the desire of people to have fun and the desire to indulge their painful curiosity ...
