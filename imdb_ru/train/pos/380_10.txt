In the early 80s, Steven Spielberg took a break in his escapist race. He shot Whoopi Goldberg in Alice Walker's film "The Color of Purple" about the desperate existence of an African American woman in the 1930s. Watching Selberg play Goldberg is incredible that this is the same woman who starred in films like Act of the Sister. This is such a film that can easily be - no, make it MUST BE - part of the curriculum for the study of black and female studies. There is one scene that can be the greatest editing job ever that was on the screen (you will know about it when you see it). I can't believe it won a single Oscar; this may be Spielberg's second best film after Schindler's List (perhaps even associated with it). Also starring Danny Glover, Adolphe Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akoshua Busia and Laurence Fishburn.
