It was in 1988, when I first saw The Ronnie and Nancy Show (on Austrian television). At that time, I was already a big fan of Spitting Image (since he won a bronze rose at the Montreux Film Festival in 1986). Of course, I recorded every show on tape and watched it over and over, especially “The Ronnie and Nancy Show”. I remember that scene when Ronnie stood in front of a picture of Abraham Lincoln (thinking it was a mirror) and said to himself: “I need a shave.” Or the funny thing is when he played the ball with his dog - but the opposite! <br /> <br /> This is such a shame that the Spitting Image seems to be forgotten; it was one of the most fantastic and smartest television shows ever. Compared to other satirical programs, it was definitely the best. <br /> <br /> Almost 20 years have passed since then, and I would like to see the show again. Can I buy it from someone ... somewhere?
