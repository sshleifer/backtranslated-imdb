One day I woke up late in the evening switching cable channels, and 10 minutes later I ran into this film — every time I even thought about going to bed, something constantly prompted me to keep watching it, although it was far behind my bedtime. <br /> <br /> This film could have been another easy film against guns, but instead they decided to study the consequences of shooting. And, even better, the film continued to live in real life - when you think that they will choose an easy and obviously contrived way out, change and change the whole look of the film. This film not only does not follow the formula, but also shows how other events often lead to what happens afterwards and / or affect them. <br /> <br /> I would just like the filmmakers to study the issues regarding antidepressants. Moreover, the children from Columnine, who were filming, were on them for years, and it was scary to watch Deanna tossing them every time nightmares began. Until recently, they were handing out such things as candy, and only now are they even beginning to understand the long-term effects of drugs. It was very nice to see that the film tells about a mental illness and that he has a relative suffering from a mental illness. I can say that the film was completely insane in all aspects of mental illness. Bravo to the director and writer who obviously did his homework on these issues. And for those who think that there cannot be certain things in the hospital (I do not want to tell any details), you are also mistaken - I was there. The script was so real that it was awesome. <br /> <br /> Go and buy this film and show it to your teenage children before it’s too late. Someday they will thank you for it.
