When “Grinch” came out, I was excited, although I thought it would be a happy movie, and it is. Although before Christmas, he had a little Nightmare. You know, something dark and creepy. I liked this film because it helped fill people with the spirit of Christmas. So basically, the Grinch saved Christmas. And what happened then well in Vivilla says that Grinch's little heart grew three days later that day. HAPPY DAY!
