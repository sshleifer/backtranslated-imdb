I really like this movie, although I donâ€™t really like James Belushi. In this film you can see several big names, in particular Linda Hamilton and Courtney Cox; Kane was already big, of course. The plot in this film is simple; it's like a sliding door movie. This, however, was said carelessly, and I like comedy moments. It made me try to relive my own important moments in life, for example, that if I took this girl for a film, and not another, etc. small details had to change. It also reminds us of the need to be careful with what we want. Life is not always as good on the other hand as we think; maybe what we have now is better for us, considering all the circumstances.
