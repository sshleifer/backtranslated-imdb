Henri Verneuil represented the commercial cinema in France from 1960 to 1980. Being always strong at the box office and usually telling dramatic and disturbing stories about robberies at casinos, setting up accounts in mafia battles and battles in World War II, Orney could expect us to have two hours of entertainment on Saturday night. He worked with the cream of male actors of his time: Gabina, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I ... I know that this is the only time he led Yves Montand. This is a strangely static film, shot mostly in offices and conference rooms, in which there is not a single chase scene and almost no violence. <br /> <br /> Montand gives good results, although somewhat dry, and is well supported by other actors. I could not help but wonder what Costa Gavras could do with this story on the basis of Z (the murder of Lambrakis) and L'aveu (the torture of Arthur London in Czechoslovakia by the Stalinists).
