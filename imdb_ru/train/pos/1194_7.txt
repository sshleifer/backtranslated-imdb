The film is mainly devoted to the bullying of Robert Taylor as a ruthless bison hunter and people who have to put up with him. Located in the midst of hunting for dwindling numbers of buffaloes, it depicts the end of the tragic era of senseless slaughter and is full of drama and remorse for both bison and Native Americans. Taylor is blinded by his hatred of the Indians and his naivety that the herds of bison will never disappear. In one scene, he shoots an animal after an animal, and in another he kills Indians, and then eats the food they cook on their fire. Under this ruthless appearance lies an uncertain person who is forced to ask his comrades (Stuart Granger, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblin) not to leave him. This is not the most pleasant film, and it is burdened by the drama he creates, which leads to a dark and very suitable conclusion in a blizzard.
