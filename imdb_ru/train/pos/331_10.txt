This 370 minute film was shown by Italian public television in the early seventies. It tells the myth attributed to Homer about the journey home to Odyssey after the Troy War. This is an epic story of the ancient Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, told in the list 500 years after the events of about 1100 BC. would find that the sound is only mono, and there is no other language than Italian, even an inscription in Italian. A pity. Many would have liked this masterpiece if it had English subtitles. But if this is not a problem for you, then I highly recommend watching this movie.
