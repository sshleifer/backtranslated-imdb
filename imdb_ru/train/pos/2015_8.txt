This may not be one of the best films ever made, but overall this is a very pleasant, carefree piece of foam, in which, it seems, all the participants have a good time. Strongly recommended because it is a factor of well-being. So, Frank Sinatra's “game” leaves much to be desired, but his singing is an excellent feature, and the songs fit perfectly into the romantic atmosphere of the film. Sinatra has made many more films in which his undoubted acting abilities have been traced, but this is his first adventure in Hollywood, his voice, and not the acting, is his main contribution to this film. I just watched it again on TV, and it still lifts my spirits just as I had the first time I saw it many years ago.
