Remember H.G. Wells's "Invisible Man"? Well, here's another movie like him, just more extreme. "Empty Man" does not look like the story of invisibility as the choice of weapons. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Kane, a scientific genius who goes to the world of invisibility and makes him useful for military purposes. Initially, preparing the serum was an easy task, and the return of the person was not. Most of the first attempts were unstable. Until one night when he perfected the formula. And who else, except Kane, will be a laboratory rat. The gorilla was the first and almost died, so when he came to, she was close. So when Kane appeared, he decided to use it for entertainment. Then, when he was tired of not being seen, the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of flesh. However, the appearance formula does not work as it should, and Kane will plunge into madness. So he ends up being the one insane invisible killer. It is best to just leave the city and not take the lives of people close to you. I would not give a damn about those who made you wrong. Great movie, lots of fun. 3 out of 5 stars!
