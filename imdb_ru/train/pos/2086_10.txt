Dedicated to the work of Pearl S. Buck, whose years spent in China as a child with missionary parents, which gave her a deep understanding of Chinese culture and its philosophy, this screen version is brilliantly performed both in technical and artistic form. /> <br /> Van Lung is a humble farmer, grateful for the basics of life: survive outside his land and become newly married Olan, the servant of a rich and powerful family in the village. Despite the best efforts of Van Lung and Olan to cultivate the land, raise children, accumulate savings and wealth, hunger threatens to destroy everything they worked for. Deciding not to sell their land, the traditional Asian faith, they instead go to a major city to wait out their hunger. Being in the city, they boil down to begging and are only one of hundreds of other unfortunate homeless families. Olan, though not a marauder, finds himself in a crowd robbing a rich manâ€™s house. She is briefly assembled for execution by the army, but saved at the last minute. However, she was lucky that she found valuable jewels at the site of looting, which gives her and her family the opportunity to return to her farm and start all over again. Recently found wealth transforms Van Lung. He becomes selfish, selfish and takes credit for the find. He becomes a very rich farmer, but this only aggravates the situation, as he becomes more and more disrespectful, arrogant and difficult to reason. He loses touch with the basic things in life that money cannot buy: loyalty, loyalty, trust, justice, and honesty. As punishment, nature again turns the table on Van Lung, sending the plague of locusts to destroy all that he has. Rising to his knees, Van Lung enlists the support of all his friends, former friends, workers and family. With all this help, he manages to save the farm. From this experience, he returns to humility and an appreciation of the foundations of life.
