Yes, the horror thriller dancing in tap-dance ... with Shelley and Debbie! Goody Goody. This is a crazy and fun fun and part of the cycle of the 60s Guinulles, which leaked into the 70s. Released as a double feature of Burt Reynolds' Fuzzz comedy, this insane panic is so obsessed with being completely interesting. Like a mixture of DOGS DAY, OTHER and CHILD JANE, I suggest to any potential viewer to accept the idea that it is almost intended to be askew and sit with someone you can shout and jostle with for all this. In fact, get drunk while you watch it ... on cheap champagne. Again, with the many ideas of the 30s film, they are also about delusion; the struggle of time for a better life becomes bitter and distorted by emotional madness, which flows into murder. But this one is just crazy. It also reminds me a lot of BLOODY MAMA about the shilling festival of De Niro - Winters, thanks to which this film looks great.
