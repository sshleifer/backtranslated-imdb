... intimate and specific. Yes, a little story about Cinderella, but only after many tangled turns, earning deeper and deeper in Antwon's soul. Only superficial viewing can condemn this film as superficial. This is what heals people, this is one of our great national stories. Antwone's path to emotional health encompasses the entire family history, the history of slavery and its consequences. In my first directorial work, first, I hope that Denzel Washington once again confirms that he has a really beautiful mind and soul.
