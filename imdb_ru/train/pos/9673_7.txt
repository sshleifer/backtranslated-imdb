Poly sounds like the most saccharine, tearful and sentimental trash you could ever find, but in fact it is much better than you could expect. The plot madness could easily set the tone for the entire film, but in fact most of the other sections of the film are charming. <br /> <br /> If you are interested, Poly is a parrot. Purchased for a little girl with difficulty in speech, Paulie becomes her best friend and walks with her everywhere. He even sits on her shoulder at the lessons of speech therapy and eventually he himself becomes a super-intellectual speaker. However, Paulie sent the little girl's mother away, and he spends the rest of the film trying to move from New York to Los Angeles to reunite with her. <br /> <br /> So why does this sound awful? Has the film been relatively successful? First, it has some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. Secondly (and, more importantly), he has the courage to accept his ridiculous premise and tells a truly touching, often funny story, without worrying too much about the obvious shortcomings of the storyline. Thirdly, he has some surprisingly strong performances, including Jay Mora as an insidious cheater, Gena Rowlands as a good old woman and Cheecha Marina (yes, Chika Marina who smokes drugs!) As a musical immigrant. Perhaps this is not a classic, but Paulie is great fun for children of all ages.
