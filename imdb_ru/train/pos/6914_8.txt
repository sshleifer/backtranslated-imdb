This film contains one of the greatest performances of Richard Dreyfus as an actor who plays a dictator and does so so convincingly that his own mother does not detect an impostor. In addition, this film is funny, but it also has a serious side. What is particularly intriguing in this film is the character of Madonna, who is the dictator's mistress, but ultimately becomes the leader of the country. The evolution of the Madonna from a mistress to a political leader significantly increased the quality of the plot and the entertainment value of the film. And the main character, who at the beginning of the film is a fighting actor and something of a jester, also develops and by the end of the film inspires respect. I like this movie.
