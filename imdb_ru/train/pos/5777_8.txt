The meteor crashes into Crater Lake, the heat from the impact causes the appearance of a prehistoric egg. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the plot is just rubbish. But, despite the obvious low budget, it looks like one of the most exciting and interesting monster films on the loose. There are good moments of humor. In an era filled with so-called "monsters" who are nothing more than ridiculous creations in men's rubber suits or lizards, dressed in frills and forced to tear each other apart (cheap style of operation), it is pleasant to recognize Plesiosaurus in this small precious stone - an excellent creature in the style of Harryhausen, stopping the movement. <br /> <br /> Finding a rather difficult movie, but worth finding.
