“Spin it!” <br /> <br /> The “90s” opened with Disney's smart favorite, “TaleSpin,” a cartoon series featuring characters from The Jungle Book. Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker as they fly a sea duck like you have never seen her: from Cape Suzette to Louis to the mountains, through the jungle, to the water, to volcanoes, in search of adventure, in search of treasure, in search of funny all in one adventure cartoon adventure !!!!! <br /> <br /> This was my favorite and beloved movie. This continued in the second half of the 1990s at Disney, until the original cartoons moved to Disney’s Old Channel in 1995, which I saw on vacation in 1996, and did not receive a telegram in March 1997. <br /> <br /> And the good news: today the DVDs are here !!!!! Relive the fun and excitement of "Dun, Dun, Dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" <br /> <br /> 10/10
