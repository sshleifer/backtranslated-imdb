Kurt Russell, whose career began when he kicked REAL Elvis in “It Happened at the World Fair”, will probably never achieve his superiority as king in this biopic, directed by Slash and Shock Carpenter. There are moments when you feel that you are looking at Elvis, until something brings you back to reality ... perhaps the memories of the unfortunate Don Johnson in Elvis and the Beauty Queen? All the performances here are excellent: Season Hubley in the role of Priscilla, Pat Hingle in the role of Colonel, and even Shelley Winters bring the right level of nerves and hysteria to her perception of Presley's mom. <br /> <br /> Kurt Bing's dad plays Elvis Vernon's Father here, and Robert Gray has a wonderful performance as a friend of Elvis and his bodyguard Red West. <br /> <br /> Be sure to look at rock and roll lovers.
