Pursued in secret, Ben Thomas (Will Smith) seeks redemption for a radical transformation in the lives of seven people whom he does not know. Once his plan is established, nothing can stop him. At least that's what he thinks. But Ben did not plan on falling in love with one of these people, and it was she who eventually transformed him. Will Smith is back with director Gabriele Muccino after the life-inspiring movie “The Pursuit of Happyness”. “Seven pounds” is another life experience that not only reminds you of their previous collaboration, but also happily inspires you at the end. Will Smith, also a producer again with some others. These films are very realistic, depicting the life of an ordinary person and his struggle through life. Seven pounds may have taken some time to get a real boost, but after half an hour of the movie the movie is fully set to control your heart. In addition, this film has some twists spinning around, which allows viewers to continue to guess. Director Gabriele Muccino is a winner again, with his emotional, but inspiring message. He makes all the characters in the film very real, so that people will actually end up somewhere in the film. Along with the director, Will Smith is another winner, with his excellent acting skills. Once again, the director-actor duet works like a charm. In addition, there are other talented actors in the film who did an excellent job with their role. Rosario Dawson, beautiful with brains, so it can be called. She looks beautiful and does her part very well. Barry Pepper has great support for the film, and Woody Harrelson does the same, although Woody did not have much time on the screen (it would be nice if he had more). You will not forget this film easily. Watch this movie and change your life. Top class cinema!
