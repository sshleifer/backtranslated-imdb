GI Samurai sees Sonny Chiba and some other guys return to feudal Japan affected by the civil war for no particular reason, and a big slaughter follows. It is rather an essay on the essay “The sword against the machine gun”, which ultimately gives interesting results. <br /> <br /> The plot basically runs along rails that you can expect from the title; initial “fish out of water” tricks (“what kind of flying metal box is this?”, etc.), “are we not better here,” discussions, and ultimately a huge battle. The latter is proof that the film does not take itself seriously at all: the slaughter takes up most of the second half when the samurai army fights with Chiba's platoon; a person who could be expected from the name, but still manages to amaze with its ingenuity and extravagance. This is certainly one of the most unique combat sequences of its time, and it does not pull, despite the increased length. <br /> <br /> Chiba demonstrates a rough game, like Iba, initially a good leader, but one who finally discovers that he questions his own morality, as the situation slowly affects him. This is definitely one of his top cars from his amazing resume. By the last action, the two worlds had such an influence on each other, that you have to ask yourself if it was some kind of nihilism on the part of the authors, because they seem to be asking, “Weren't we better then?” this reads too much, as a rule, can be described as an extremely fascinating two hours (almost) non-stop action.
