I saw it in the theater in the early 1970s. The most memorable and scary scene is when the German army first attacks the yellow cross with mustard gas. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to foot (or hoof) with eerie protective suits. Experienced British soldiers wear gas masks (only) and once again wait for gas clouds and German attackers. Gas clouds are moving closer, finally enveloping the British defenders. The Germans are advancing slowly and threateningly in their terrible clothes. Suddenly, the defenders cry ... This gas is not like any of those that they have experienced before .... <br /> <br /> Now you will understand why I remembered this scene for the last 30 or so years of trembling, I think you too!
