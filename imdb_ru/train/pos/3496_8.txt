I am surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars. <br /> <br /> But they just don’t understand the film. <br /> <br /> The story of how I grew up in a difficult situation. Situation. <br /> <br /> There is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for her grandchildren. <br /> <br /> And there is a good reason why so many critics love this film. <br /> /> And the reason is that they understand the film. <br /> <br /> I’m sorry for the low ratings that some people give. <br /> <br /> I would just like to write a short summary of the film, but IMDb requires you to write 10 lines. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have nothing more to say.
