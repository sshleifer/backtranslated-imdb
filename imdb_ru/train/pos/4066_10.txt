Lapyut (Castle in the Sky), more than any of Hayao Miyazakiâ€™s films, brings the joy of telling stories to viewers. This is a movie that makes a person feel like a child again; it's just magical. This is a crime that it took so long to get released in the states, but now that he's here, check it out! And stick to the original language; Dub changed my impressions of the characters, which should be avoided at all costs when translating a movie (or a book, whatever). <br /> <br /> I give him ten / ten.
