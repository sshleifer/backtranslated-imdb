“Gunga Dean” (1939) is based on a poem by Rudyard Kipling. The film was shot by George Stevens. It was installed in India in the 19th century, when three British soldiers must stop an evil guru and his murderous cult. Gunga Ding is an amazing adventure war comedy with many exciting moments. The three leading men are great. Cary Grant - Sergeant Archibald Cutter, Victor McLaglen - Sergeant Mc'Chesney and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (the son of the legendary one you know someone) - Sergeant Thomas Ballantine Let's not forget about other good players, including Sam Jaffe, who plays Gung Dean superbly. Beautiful and talented Joan Fontaine - Emaline Stebbins. It is very interesting to observe the difficulties of the plans of Tommy and Emmy. Gunga Ding is terrible. It can be funny, it can be exciting. This may be all that is required for a good movie.
