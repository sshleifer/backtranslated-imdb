The first and only time I saw a woman in black, I think that the only time, as far as I knew, she appeared on television in 1989. It was Christmas Eve, and my father and I watched him in the living room shortly before we all went to the midnight service in the village church. At that time, I was quite young, but I’m not sure who was more scared walking through the churchyard to the church entrance that night, me or my father! <br /> <br /> There are a lot of factors in this movie that makes it so creepy, but I think one of them is that there’s not much of a soundtrack that plays against almost every Hollywood movie, so that every creak, punch and punch is amplified in your head as there is no distraction. Another factor that distinguishes him from other ghost stories is not a jump factor, for example, things that bounce in the closet, so he doesn’t necessarily do what you see, but what you hear and what you think happening. This is a smart environment, since nothing scares you more than your own mind, randomly thinking about what is happening around the corner or behind the door! <br /> <br /> A great ghost story, I have never seen anything like it, and with all the repetition on TV, I can't believe that the BBC removed it after (as far as I know) only one show!
