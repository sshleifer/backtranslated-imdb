Have you ever read Jim Thompson? He is a hard-boiled noir with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy I have ever encountered. In his works, there are rarely private detectives - just losers, psychopaths, and petty fraudsters. In this film, Thompson nailed: "If God made some real mistakes in this world, he gave us the will to live when we have no excuse for this." Each character in the film balances on the verge of a razor between surrealistic and eerie realism. There is a sleazy, cunning Uncle Bad, played by Bruce Dern and a frighteningly good-natured Doc Goldman, played by George Dickerson. Jason Patrick gives a wonderful, often heartbreaking performance like Kid Collins, a not-too-bright, shy former fighter who fears himself more than anyone else. Rachel Ward - Fay, a sexy femme fatale we cannot understand ... This is not your standard noir film, and it should not be. After Dark My Sweet, along with The Grifters, presents two wonderful versions of the novels of one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson.
