I like this movie, but the music in all alumni meetings is just dumb. <br /> <br /> The fateful game took place in 1972. This means that the main characters graduated in 1972. But almost all the music was played in dances, etc., dating back to the 1950s and very early 1960s. <br /> <br /> Having just attended my 30th reunion in high school, I can assure you that the last music to be played at the reunion or dance of the former high school people is the music of their parents. <br /> <br /> I understand how difficult it is to find the right music from the 1970s - we all know what musical time it was. But it was not completely devoid, and the producers of the film should have taken more care. I found these dance scenes very harsh for my otherwise unwilling suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> It was a bad decision of the director and / or producer.
