I believe that Alan Jacobsâ€™s review is very accurate with regard to the film, but I had the opportunity to rent a DVD from the blockbuster with a comment from BYU curator, the James D'Arc movie archive. Heber J. Grant, the then prophet of the LDS, endorsed the film, which understands deviations from historical content for dramatic expression and telescopic events. For example, the film showed Joseph Smith in court. despite Brigham Young's loud speech in defense of Joseph Smith, he was still convicted. Then Joseph was killed. Historically, Joseph Smith has never been convicted for anything. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested in this particular case. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were killed before the trial.
