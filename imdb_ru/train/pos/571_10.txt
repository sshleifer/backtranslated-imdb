Seeing how the two brothers interact and eat from each other throughout the film personally makes me happy to live in the countryside just as they did in the film. I have watched this movie countless times and I have a book next to my Bible. After watching the film, I agree that this is one of the few films that makes the book fair. I highly recommend anyone who has the opportunity to go to Montana to go fishing or be on the street to do it. It's amazing. I can't think of anyone else who could play a role better than Brad Pitt. Do yourself justice and watch one of the best films in the modern age of cinema. STRONGLY RECOMMENDS And, as a guide for fishing trips in Montana and Wyoming, do not try to learn how to fish in movie scenes, because although it looks great in a movie, you canâ€™t imagine how much practice and fishing are beret. Thanks for listening. Watch this movie, please, if you want a long, sad movie.
