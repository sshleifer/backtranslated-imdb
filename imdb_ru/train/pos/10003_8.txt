This is not a typical Mel Brooks movie. It was far less farcical than most of his films, and in fact the plot was quite understandable. Lesley Ann Warren made the film, she is such a fantastic, underrated actress. There were some moments that could be realized a little more, and some scenes that could probably be cut out to make the room do this, but overall, itâ€™s worth renting and seeing. Overall, the game was good, Brooks himself did a good job, and his characteristics were not addressed directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor in the film, but Fume and Sailor played their part well.
