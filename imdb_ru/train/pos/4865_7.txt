I could not wait to get my hands on this when I read about Fred Astaire, teamed up with George Burns and Gracie Allen in the movie with the PG script. Woodhouse and the music of Gershvins. It’s definitely worth a look, but there’s not enough of the cohesive quality of Fred and Ginger films. <br /> <br /> This story is probably best read in Woodhouse’s book, where humor is better. In some acting games it is completely painful to watch (especially the boy and the girl). <br /> <br /> But ...! The dance funhouse is worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but the guy does it in this film. Have you ever tried to stand on one of these rotating discs in an entertainment house? Imagine dancing in high heels! She watches Aster remarkably well and significantly improves the overall picture quality. <br /> <br /> A few good songs, especially funny ones, are “Good work, if you can get it” and “Hard upper lip”. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Astaire, Burns & Allen fans. I had to go back and watch the dancehouse again as soon as the credits returned.
