this one there. Not much to say about it, except that he deals with a rarely touched topic in films about bestiality. I can understand why this film was banned for so long, the topics covered in the film are still a bit taboo for most of the world, and he will say that eroticism in the film is well-deserved and consistent with the mood of the film. This is a good film that is well-played and serves the purpose ... to shock the viewer and cross borders that we do not often see in films. I stumbled upon this movie online, which I thought I could check out. I liked the film because it provokes thoughts and at the same time is somewhat erotic. What you rarely see in movies today.
