In my opinion, this is the best show I've ever seen. I immediately became a fan of Eddie after seeing Dress to Kill, but I must say that I consider him to be the best work. I would say, however, if you ever have the opportunity to see him live. It's worth it! <br /> <br /> Most of the time, after seeing the routine a couple of times, the jokes start to age. But I have to say that I have seen this show very many times, that I literally remembered all this (that yes, I understand, this is rather sad), but every joke still makes me laugh. This is a really good show. <br /> <br /> Dress "Kill" will never age for me. I own it and watch it at any time when I need to laugh.
