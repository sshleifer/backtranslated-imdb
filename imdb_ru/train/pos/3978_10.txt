I had the pleasure of reading the book “I Can't Find My Way Home” by Martin Torgoff, which is full of information about the drug culture of America, covering the years 1945-2000. This guy knows his stuff !! I found him a great representative of this documentary. I especially enjoyed watching video clips from the hippie era and the masons culture of the 70s. The soundtrack was superb. The one who composed it was definitely in touch with the melodies of each era. I hope they pack them and sell them as a set of CDs. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960 experiments with LSD forever changed the American culture as we know it. One thing that was missing was the mention of George Jung (who was played by Johnny Depp in the film “Shock”), who was allegedly responsible for most of the marijuana and cocaine that entered the country in the 60s and 80s.
