In 1978, the phenomenon began. The release of John Carpenter’s Halloween made people stand in line around the block to witness the evil Michael Meyers. Critics loved him, the world liked it, they imitated him, and he became one of the greatest films in cinema history. <br /> <br /> The plot: 15 years after the murder, four friends (all women) look after children (and spend time with their boyfriends) on Halloween night. After escaping from the hospital the night before, Michael Myers returns to his hometown to pursue these people. He kills 3 of them quietly and subtly. He does not speak. He walks slowly. He is hiding .... <br /> <br /> Only one of his friends is saved after Dr. Loomis saved him (the pursuer and Dr. Michael) <br /> <br /> There is one reason why Halloween works so well , Simplicity. We do not know where Michael is, we do not know why he kills, and he scares us. These are the only reasons for which we are afraid. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter wrote the film and shot it. He creates an unbearable tension throughout history and scares to such an extent that sometimes we cannot observe. And the climax is really amazing. <br /> <br /> Like horror, this is important. This is terrible and works well. This is also mysterious. Michael is power, not man. A force that cannot be denied. <br /> <br /> Sequels are too focused around Michael and his “story”. This film is about the fear of the unknown. Perhaps this is why this thing is a masterpiece.
