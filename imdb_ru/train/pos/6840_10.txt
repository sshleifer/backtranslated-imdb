the fact that the film is predictable is not a problem. this film is like a beautiful picture you can enjoy. The museum scene is like a nice music video. The apres sexual scene is too familiar a scene in our entire adult life. but the film wouldn't interest me without Keith Gordon. Kate Gordon is perhaps one of the most underrated actors of our time. almost everything that I know about acting, came from studying mostly his eyes. he had the most compelling face. his character has qualities that I look like in a guy, sensitivity and loyalty. Keith Gordon is great. By the way, I would like him to shave his beard now, because his lips, chin and Adam's apple were his most beautiful mesh around the eyes.
