I can not believe my eyes when I read quite a lot of other comments and feedback. As if it was an ordinary film about some ordinary dudes. <br /> <br /> The film is excellent, funny, crazy, excessively cruel, although with minimal blood, and so on. energetic to the core. Loved every bit. I can not remember anything crazy, like this, made for laughter and demonstration of martial arts. And now the most important thing (at least for me): these are free computer effects. When I watch some Hollywood actors showing it on the screen in modern high resolution and a fucking high-budget action movie “fuflo” (Russian word that means “bull * beep *”), I understand that any child can do it * beep * - You You can adjust the wires to the case, add some nice computer effects and insert them into the action movie. Here everything is different. I don’t think that there will even be a dozen physically advanced action movie stars around the world who can repeat the fight that happens at the end of the movie or the Chinese Football play. And this is just a small Hong Kong cinema, created for entertainment, and not to pretend to be "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> Having a DVD with an English soundtrack is not a problem for this film. It does not spoil the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I can not fail to mention a very neat theatrical production. Some of you probably won't like it. As for me, this is amazing. Look at the friend of the Dragon, who courageously speaks to the criminals and suddenly gets a punch to the left side of the head. The expression on his face turns into something bizarre, and he approaches the Dragon with a childish expression on his face. And take a look at the terrible size of his mouth - he almost makes grimaces for a long time from one ear to the other. <br /> <br /> This film deserves a higher rating and thousands of comments from people from all over the world. , Many thanks to our Russian industry for the release of classic films about Jackie Chan. His modern, in my humble opinion, is much weaker and do not deserve much hype. <br /> <br /> A total of 10 out of 10 is a legendary film in its genre. Thanks for attention.
