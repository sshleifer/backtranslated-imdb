“De Grot” is a terrific Dutch thriller based on a book written by Tim Crabbe. Another of his books, Het Gouden Ei, was turned into a great Dutch mystical thriller called Spoorloos (Disappearing) in 1988. This book is not as good as this thriller (although much better than the American remake, also called “The Disappearing”), but there are times when it comes close. <br /> <br /> Great moments especially open up. We see a man, later we learn that his name is Egon Vagter (Fedya van Hyut), arriving from a plane in Thailand. When he picks up his bags, it becomes clear that he is transporting something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and filmed. Some kind of expectation is created, which usually would not exist in the initial scene like this. Later we will see how Egon makes a deal in Thailand with a woman, and both declare that they have never done anything like this. <br /> <br /> From this point on, the film is constantly returning to the past. We see how Egon, as a child (playing here Eric van der Horst), became friends with a guy named Axel (as a child with Beney Bruining). We learn how they grew up as friends, and how Axel (as an adult, played by Marcel Hensem) became a criminal. Egon, meanwhile, goes to college and settles with a woman. Around this time, he sometimes meets with Axel, but in reality he does not want to have anything in common with him. <br /> <br /> In a sense, the film is chronological. It depicts Egon and Axel in childhood, not students, young people aged about 30 years. But from time to time, as I said, the film goes back to when they were children, and jumps forward again. Every time we see them as children, this explains what happens when they are adults. <br /> <br /> Minor spoilers are here. <br /> <br /> The name means “Cave,” and this cave gives the film its happy ending, although in reality it is not so happy. Like the beginning, the end is awesome. The middle part of the film is interesting and in a sense distracts our attention from the first scenes, only to return to this point at the end. It is editing that gives the film its happy ending, although we can say that the dramatic ending is also happy.
