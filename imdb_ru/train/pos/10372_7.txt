ROLL is a wonderful little movie. Toby Malone plays an 18-year-old child (by the way, very well) who is interested in football. Malone's cousin takes him on the eve of his big adventure game with many turns involving two sports bags, a drug lord, some cool bikers, some policemen and some prostitutes ... and the film makes us guess which characters any sports bag and even what gender is the key biker. In part, it reminded me of a SMELL and TWO SMOKING BARS. <br /> <br /> For me, ROLL confirmed three opinions that I already adhered to before seeing ROLL. These opinions are: 1. I really want to visit Australia one day. The country and the cities are beautiful and it looks so cool for a holiday. <br /> <br /> 2. Some of the best filmmakers in Australia. ROLL's cinematography was particularly impressive. I liked the stylized colors and lighting in many scenes. <br /> <br /> 3. Australian women HOT!
