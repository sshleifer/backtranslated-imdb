Note to the previous reviewer: According to the screenwriter, this film is a “fantastic adaptation of the Iliad.” So, whether the links are painful or not, no apologies, this is the basis for the film. They admit that they stole ... although the PS adapted it. time limit <br /> <br /> Great movie, but too short. Probably didn’t work out the way the author, director or studio wanted, but damn fun. The fact that the studio itself exploded during creation only adds to its heritage. <br /> <br /> A big budget remake will not be so fun, and probably will not make the script more fair. But to dream of potential is fun there. A DVD release with some meager additions is obviously available, but I don't think it will play on NTSC players. I am not an expert, and thus still trying to figure it out. Now I live with the embodiment of VHS.
