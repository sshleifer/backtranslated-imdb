This film was one of the best Disney films I've ever seen. Great for the whole family to watch. ideas may be a little contrived, but this is a pleasant comedy and a great game. I love a little boy and some of the Academy Award winner Adrian Brody could have been very short, but very memorable. highly recommended.
