Henry Thomas was "great." His character caught my attention. I was so fascinated by the story that I forgot that it was not real. I wanted him to leave the child and see what a special person he was. Other people in the story were significant in the composition of his character. The way they came together to help each other was truly inspirational. I love films that show the real side of human emotions, without hitting you on the head, that you are not smart enough to understand yourself.
