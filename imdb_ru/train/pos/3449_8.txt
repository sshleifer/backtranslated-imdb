TACHIGUI: AMAZING LIFE OF FAST PRODUCTS Japanese name: Tachiguishi Retsuden <br /> <br /> Director: Mamoru Oshii Cast: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyudo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada - Author Koichi Ya ------------------------------- <br /> <br /> Back in 1995, Mamoru Hosea released his dazzling animation function. "Ghost in the Shell", which helped consolidate the international recognition of anime, and also plunged into the overall concept of "The Matrix" by Andy and Larry Wachowski. <br /> <br /> Continuation of the film “Innocence” (2004). ), it was the first Japanese animated film that was supposed to compete for the Golden Palm in Cannes, and it made the heads spin not only because of its style and innovative effects, but also because of its incomprehensible plot. <br /> <br /> Always a trendsetter, Oshii has now presented us with Tachigui: Amazing Lives of Fast Food Grifters ?? which has nothing to do with either Ghost In The Shell or the Japanese anime in this regard. <br /> <br /> Say hello to the creation of Oshi “superlivemation”: not exactly animation and not live action. Instead, the cast ended up with about 30,000 shots that were digitally processed and recreated in a deceptively simple paper-cut way resembling Balinese puppet art. The movement itself is an unnatural style movement, which echoes the episodes of the experimental Shinya Tsukamoto Tetsuo: Iron Man (1988). <br /> <br /> “I couldn’t think of a single method besides this,” said Oshii. in a recent interview with The Daily Yomiuri. "I realized that this project is not suitable for traditional animation." <br /> <br /> The choice of actors is no less mysterious. Kenji Kawai, who also wrote an excellent soundtrack, looks like a hamburger's predatory fanatic, while well-known Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki spends his time on the screen, being killed in a strange way. Among others, Katsuya Terada, who dabbled with Oshi on Blood: The Last Vampire, and Shinji Higuchi, a master of special effects, who worked on Godzilla films. <br /> <br /> Koichi Yamader's narration sounds like material from an NHK dry documentary film ?? which contradicts the comic overtones here, as well as Yamader's vast career, voicing stoic anime characters such as Spike Siegel in Cowboy Bebop. <br /> <br /> And the plot itself - a strange reinterpretation of Japan after World War II in the context of various fast food snacks - from soba ramen stores to Gudon bars; American dogs in trays for warming up in fast food shops in restaurants of a chain of burger shops inspired by McDonalds. “Food is the main root of desire,” explained Oshiy as an explanation. <br /> <br /> A new type of consumer has been added to this mix: fast-growing authors of the title, people who don’t like to pay for their money and constantly perfect their sophisticated scam to perfection in order to win free snacks <br /> <br /> Oshi said that his hidden motive was respect for "art" in the streets ?? something in this country was still considered something of a taboo, which explains the use of the word "tachigui" in the title. <br /> <br /> As a live-action film director (Avalon, Stray Dog) as well as animation, Hosea often blurs the definition between two media. The result of celluloid here is placed somewhere in the gray area between both formats. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a visual experiment here is as exciting as it can be annoying. Just do not ask what all this should mean; Hosea films, which are equal parts of the brain and innovative, are often not particularly clear in the plot. Where does Oshii succeed through a liberal dose of black humor ?? here you will find Kentucky Fried Rat, death from hula hoop, the fastest samurai chef in the world ?? and in the very nature of the film's surrealism. <br /> <br /> This is a man who is subject to the influence of cinematographers such as Godard and Truffaut, and perhaps owes so much to Andrei Tarkovsky, like David Lynch. Therefore, it is not surprising that at one stage the B-52 bomber flies to the Yoshinoya franchise. The 54-year-old film director seemed to think it was natural. “Japan, which I portrayed in the film, is not necessarily true to reality,” he suggested. <br /> <br /> Of course. -------------- <br /> <br /> Andres Bergen
