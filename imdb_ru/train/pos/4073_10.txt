Have you ever wished that you could avoid a boring and tense life at school or at work and go on your own magical adventure with one of your closest friends, faced with all sorts of dangers and villains and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization that just waits Someone will reveal all their secrets? Even if you are not a fan of fantasy, have you ever dreamed of just experiencing, what is it like being a child again, and not having any care in the world, just a couple of hours? <br /> <br /> This is exactly what Miyazaki's “Castle in the Sky” is. Pazu, a young but very brave and ambitious engineer, lives the village life in a mining town until one day a girl named Shita falls from the sky like an angel and sends him on a journey far beyond the clouds until all this time they have pirates and military units. Simply put, this is just an incredible adventure that every child dreams of at one time or another, and I can't help but feel that my experiences fade away every time I see it. <br /> <br /> Like this one Of Miyazaki’s older works that take up a lot of space in everyday life, the film isn’t as visually dramatic and deep in the storyline as Spirited Away, Howl's Movable Castle, or even Princess Mononoke. Nevertheless, it is hard for me to say that any of these films is superior to others, because all three of these films are at some point mystical to such an extent that they are mysterious, if not puzzling, especially for the youngest viewers. <br /> <br /> Heavenly Castle, on the other hand, is not trying very hard to be an allegory of any kind, and this is not the history of the majority; instead, quite possibly, this is one of the best images of the inner part of the child's mind that I have ever seen. Not only is the work of art beautiful, but the use of perspective from the eyes of children is amazing; whether it is panning the “camera” to see huge trees or clouds overhead, or the incredible sense of height from looking down to the ground or the ocean, when there are hundreds of feet in the air, I just can not feel, but I feel that I am there with Pazu and Shita, just a child in another world, far from reality. <br /> <br /> Even the children themselves do not have complicated relationships that suggest such hope as that of Ashitaki / San or Chihiro / Haku; Shita is an angel to Pazu, who once literally fell into his life from heaven, from the very beginning he was an absolutely perfect man for him. As the film progresses, more and more of their true adventurous children's spirit is manifested due to their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions. They not only delightfully remind of who I was, but their friendship does not weaken throughout the entire film, but only intensifies until the last frame. For this reason, I fell in love with them two more than any other pair of Miyazaki. <br /> <br /> At the same time, “Castle in the Sky” is such an easily accessible film. because no matter what type of movie buff you can be, you will definitely find your solution here. Mystery, thriller, drama, comedy, suspense, fantasy, romance, even some western ... it's all here, almost everything for which people go to the movies (except, perhaps, for horrors). That's why I can easily recommend it as the first movie of Miyazaki; it is ideal for those who do not expect from the fact that they have already seen the incredible otherworldly life of some of their later works. <br /> <br /> Even the final song of the film, translated into English, conveys a sense of longing for the discovery of some lost civilization and a kind of soul mate that cannot be found in our worldly life. “The reason I miss a lot of lights is because you are in one of them ... The earth rotates, carrying you, carrying us both, which will surely meet.” Miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make final songs from Joe Hyasashi's magnificent scores, but the only thing I saw was a touching love song and an inspiring dream. I found myself in tears, just listening to him. <br /> <br /> “The Castle in the Sky” may not be the most advanced, spectacular or informative work of Miyazaki, but it is absolutely perfect for what it really should have been. : A true vision of children's fantasies and a wonderful way out of reality for any adults who want to have the same wonderful sense of imagination that they had when they were just carefree young children. Relax, relax and love it for what it is.
