I really liked the Night Listener. This is one of the best movies of the summer. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams gives one of his best performances. In fact, the whole cast was very good. Everyone played only the right notes for their characters - not too much and not too little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch. Tony Collett is gorgeous, like a mom, and never goes beyond. Everything is very believable. <br /> <br /> This is a short film, just under an hour and a half. I noticed that the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the most disturbing images from the movie were cut out? <br /> <br /> The director told the story and made it right, which today is an unexpected change for many directors who seem to think the job is to impress the audience, rather than telling the story and telling it OK. <br /> <br /> Avoid shocks due to previews and advertisements. This is not a hitchcock thriller. See The Night Listener, because you want a good story to be well told. If you expect Hitchcock, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the film is the ending. The director could have left a little more for the imagination of the audience, but this is a minor trick.
