A great example of “cowboy noir,” as he is called, when unemployed Michael (Nicolas Cage) loses his job because he insists on being honest (he has an ass). In fact, he can do nothing, so he decides that this time he is going to lie. When he enters the bar, the owner Wayne (deceased, great JT Walsh) takes him for a hired killer who was hired by Wayne in his sexy young wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in great shape), Michael plays along with and accepts Waynes's money. * Then * he goes to Suzanne and informs her of the intentions of her husbands and takes * her * money to get rid of Wayne! If this doesn’t complicate the situation too much, then the real killer “Lyle of Dallas” (Dennis Hopper, in the ideal role for him) will appear, and Michael will have even more problems than before. <br /> <br /> Red Rock West gets a lot from its locations. Directed by John Dahl, who wrote the script with his brother Rick, was able to realize the potential of the plot in a really isolated small town, which may have seen better times and in which residents could participate in any schemes. This is also a funny idea about the problems that an honest person can face if he decides to give up his principles and succumb to the temptation of any level. This is a rather grim and abundant story with a set of main characters who, if not spoiled, are at least morally compromised, like Michael. The lighting of the cinematographer Mark Reshovsky is excellent in his capriciousness; even the culmination of a graveyard gives it all a good, painful quality. Even if the script is not particularly “logical or trustworthy,” the film has a good way to intrigue the viewer and just draw it straight. <br /> <br /> Cage copes with the role perfectly, but his colleagues at the grandiose old time immerse their teeth in their fleshy and greedy-motivated characters. Hopper, Boyle and Walsh are watching them in a fun way. Timothy Karhart and Dan Shor are good as Walsh's deputies (in one particularly good turn, Walsh is also the local sheriff), and there is an interesting cameo role for country music and western star Dwight Joacam, who also receives a film with pleasant end credits. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty good little movie worth watching. He moves forward at an impressive pace, and, of course, is never boring. <br /> <br /> 8/10
