From time to time, the film advertises itself as scary or intimidating, although this is usually not the case. Most modern horror films fit into this category. <br /> <br /> Then there are films that do not just cause tension and adrenaline to pump your veins more than usual. They really scare you to a level you have never experienced. <br /> <br /> “Halloween” is such a film. This takes on so many risks that it will make most filmmakers cringe. But almost all of them work. "Halloween" impresses with its simplicity and horrifies in general. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) looks after the children on Halloween night, while the madman is free after he escaped from the mental hospital after the brutal murder of his older sister 15 years ago. Of course, the madman, later known as Michael Myers, begins to kill the local teenage population, and in the end he comes for Lori. <br /> <br /> Sounds familiar, right? Just another brainless slasher filled with blunt teens and mucus. No chances. <br /> <br /> I think that James Berardinelli perfectly describes this in his review of Halloween: “Because of their name, Halloween is often grouped together with all the other spray films that have inhabited theaters around the world. late 1970s and early 1980s. However, although Halloween is rightly considered the father of the modern slasher genre, he is not a member ... "<br /> <br /> He has a point of view, and for a number of reasons. First of all, this is terrible, while most the entrances to the adolescent slasher are dull bloody reverers (it can be argued that many of the recent ones are mocking, but most of them also fail.) Secondly, there is almost no violence (very few of which are bloody). John Carpenter knows tantamount to terrible, and he relies very little on him (in fact, the number your victims are pretty low.) In fact, it can be argued that this is not really a horror film, at least by today's standards, when most deaths can be crammed into one film, each one more beautiful and sadistic than the previous one. He relies on ideas for panic, as well as skill, and thirdly, although some characters may do stupid things (which sometimes imprint their fate), they don’t, because they are stupid. Characters are real people, so instead of thinking that characters are dying because they are idiots, we are scared because they make a mistake. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why Halloween is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that this is real. There is nothing difficult in this film. There is no supernatural, no ridiculously creative plot elements, "inventive" murders or anything else. Instead, all installed parts and camera operation (with the exception of the opening sequence) are simple. Carpenter simply sets the camera in place and says action. What we get is the feeling that we really see the murder that happens right in front of us. <br /> <br /> Horror films are probably the most complex films, because in order for something to be scary, everything must be perfect and ideas never work twice. This is a hit or slip game, so if I told you all the good ideas Carpenter has (and I don’t), they would seem primitive (especially because they repeated with less effect over and over again). through the years). <br /> <br /> Acting here is not a plus, because it is not necessary. This is a movie about scary ideas, not a movie about dramatic, controversial characters. Actors behave like real people, not characters from the story. Nothing more. The exception is the one who plays The Shape or later is known as Michael Myers. It can be scary when someone says nothing and just kills, but this is difficult to accomplish (and even harder not to let people ask why). But the guy copes, and the result is terrifying. <br /> <br /> This is Carpenter’s movie right through. He directed it, co-authored it, jointly produced it, and wrote a blood-curdling account of it. This man is brilliant, and his later film “The Thing” supports this statement, although The Thing is not as scary as “Halloween”. Unfortunately, his success has drastically decreased, as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is used, when the big producers “realize your potential”. No matter how good this film is, it is not without flaws. The famous opening scene excites, but not very scary. And not many of the panics work on the first part of the film. The point is not that it is bad, there is simply no good reason to be afraid of the “Form”. Fortunately, Carpenter basically uses this time to establish relationships between the characters and the audience. Although there is no intimacy in this relationship, they fit the purpose. We recognize the characters, but not so much that they become discouraged when they die. But as soon as the film hits on Halloween night, it is then that Carpenter starts spinning, and he NEVER stops until you reach the end. <br /> <br /> Although Halloween may be a mistake, this is only a little. This is a terrible scary film that everyone who loves scary movies must watch. Be careful, this movie will scare you to death!
