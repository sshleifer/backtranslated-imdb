I married a Japanese woman 14 years ago. We are still together. <br /> <br /> However, in the 1950s it would never have been so easy. <br /> <br /> Life in the army has been mined in action films, dramas and comedies for years. to this moment. Get to death. Mixed relationships gave him a new basis for coverage. It's an old hat today, but then ...? Then marrying an Asian meant that you either owed someone or you were some kind of freak. This affected both possibilities along with the third. Maybe this is love? <br /> <br /> Brando did a great job. Garner did a better job than usual. He is good, but it showed how good he is. Umeki-chan made her debut here, and although I think she earned her statue, she did not stretch. It was a role that none of those who were not abroad would have recognized, and novelty was the main theme. <br /> <br /> Red Buttons were the real thief of the scene. Red was the best in this movie. Bank on this. And the Japanese way of life was shown in a delightful light. <br /> <br /> Classic.
