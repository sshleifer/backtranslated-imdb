I think that the idea of ​​the plot is ideal for studying, above all, the emotional experiences of the people involved, and, secondly, as someone else wrote in the commentary, the consequences of this kind of relationship (incest and lesbianism) in Romanian society. <br /> <br /> so ... let's start with the second aspect ... in short, it was not at all visible ... <br /> <br /> as in the first ... as I said , he had much more potential ... I think that such a relationship carries much more voltage ... much more voltage ... and the potential voltage has not passed ... <br /> <br /> I think the soundtrack could be something more than those few songs in the background and a theme (which was good but not enough and not always at the right moments) ... yes ... I could feel the lack of a better soundtrack .. <br / > <br /> actors .. I think they were somewhere from 7/10 to 8/10 ... there is not enough sensuality at key moments ... <br /> <br /> a total of 7/10 .... mostly for history
