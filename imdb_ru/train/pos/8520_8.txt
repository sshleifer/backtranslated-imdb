I thought the movie was actually pretty good. I enjoyed the game and it developed well. The director seemed to really understand the story he was trying to tell. I have to see a big budget coming out today, obviously, they had a lot more money to give it up, but it was very watchable. When you watch such a movie with a small budget, you should take this into account when watching. There were some things that could be better, but most of them are related to the budget. The game was pretty good, F / X and tricks were well done. A couple of outstanding people was the guy who played the camera. and the boy who played the child. Similar films helped Los Angeles to work, and this film was successful.
