I first saw this film when it was released in the USA in 1984. Since then, I have seen him many, many times. What amazes me in the film is the inclusion of the art of rehearsal in the life of the characters and vice versa. Throughout the film, both are intertwined, and sometimes one is never too sure if anyone is watching the characters' lives or the scene from the rehearsal. This continues until the climax of the film. All these years later, my friends and I still love to argue about whether or not Carmen was stabbed to death at the end. From the reactions of other characters to the stylized murder, he is open to discussion. The passion for dance, the quality of acting, the love of art and the brilliance of the performances - all this creates a magnificent film that again mixes and twists the line between life and art.
