I love TV shows. Hooked the first time I saw it. I wish I could be there with them. This concerns reality, when you love someone and think that you want to spend the rest of your life, and then unfold the events that you meet with someone else, and this person is more than the one you want to be. You are in a situation where you had to choose one or the other. Someone will suffer, it does not stop. Making a decision is difficult, but you want to continue to be unhappy when you could be. Why continue to live the kind of life that you thought you wanted or thought you were doing right and you are both unhappy. That other person is not going to wait all his life, he has a good life. Making the decision you really want will be better at the end. To do the best of what you have is fine. Money, cars, houses, etc. Don't make you happy, because the one person you really want to be with is sharing them.
