I just watched it for the first time in a long time - I forgot how original the images were, and how witty the movie was. I did not forget, however, the first scenes that (with the scene at the Candlelight Club on Waterloo Bridge) are among the most romantic scenes ever filmed. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is interested in politics or history will love the film’s candid references - anyone interested in romance will be touched by Hunter Niven, and anyone who loves visual images will love the image of the other world. <br /> <br /> “Strange Man” is still my favorite movie, but it’s excellent <br /> <br />
