This is a film that everyone who is interested in or suffers from an eating disorder should watch. This is an amazingly accurate and delicate image of bulimia in a teenage girl, her causes and symptoms. The girl is played by one of the brightest young actresses working in the cinema today, Alison Lohman, who was later so impressive in the movie “Where the Truth”. I would recommend to show this film in all schools, since you will never see the best in this subject. Alison Lohman is absolutely outstanding, and everyone is amazed at her ability to express the suffering of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder. If barometers give us air pressure, Alison Lohman gives us emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy. Her emotional range is so accurate that each scene can be measured microscopically by the degree of injury, the scale of growing hysteria and despair, which reaches unbearable intensity. Mare Winningham is the perfect choice to play with your mother, and she does so with a lot of sympathy and emotions that are exactly the same as those of Lohman. Together they create a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with each other. This film is truly an amazing achievement, and director Katt Shea should be proud of it. The only reason not to see this is if you are not interested in people. But even if you prefer natural films, this is, after all, the behavior of animals on the edge. Bulimia is an extreme version of how an exhausted soul can destroy its body in insane despair. And if we do not sympathize with people suffering from the depths of despair, then we are dead inside.
