A wonderful documentary giving a vivid description of a country deeply divided within itself (for more information, see some comments on IMDb ...!). It compares extremely favorably with Oliver Stone’s “Comandante” (which is basically an in-depth study of the hairs of Fidel Castro’s nostrils). I don’t know whether Chávez is anyone he represents, or another one of a long series of populist Latin American Caudillos. Also, I do not know whether he can cope with the huge expectations that he clearly created among the poor majority of Venezuelans. It is hardly reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions — but I, of course, now got a pretty lively idea of ​​what was at stake and what it was like to be caught in the middle of a coup. Someone says in the movie “we are creating a story,” and this is exactly what the film considers exciting. Outstanding things.
