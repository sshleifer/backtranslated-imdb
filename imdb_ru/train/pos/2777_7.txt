Meanwhile, the earth and the Israelites are at the head with Nathan - they accuse the king of their distress ... They storm the palace and demand that Bathsheba pay for her sin ... <br /> <br /> Peck plays a merciful king whose lustful desire outweighed his common sense and honesty. <br /> <br /> Hayward, like Bathsheba, is a sensitive woman who begins to believe that every disaster in her life is a direct result of her adultery ... The sequence of her washing could be a great moment in the history of biblical cinema he is mistreated, and the eyes of the audience look briefly at Hayward’s face and shoulders ... <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey appeared as the Prophet Nathan, sent by God to reproach David for adultery with Bathsheba; Gwyneth Verdon, Queen Michal, who is trying to resist ambition and greed, which have become an integral part of David’s personality and reign; the former silent idol, Francis X. Bushman, played a short role in the role of King Saul ... <br /> <br /> The best moments of the film were: The Ark on its way to his permanent home when God breaks a young soldier who is trying to touch to the sacred subject; a defining moment in David’s life when he confesses his sin and is ready to accept his mortal punishment; and for the climax of the film, inserting it as a memory, David remembered his battle with the giant Goliath ... <br /> <br /> With excellent color photography and virtuoso music, David and Bathsheba won Oscar nominations in the following categories : sounding music, art and scenery, cinematography, plot and script, costume design.
