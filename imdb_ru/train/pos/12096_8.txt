I watched this movie several times and found it very good. This film is also known as "Castle of Terror", "The Sepulcher of Terror" and "Dance of the Macabre". Barbara Steele, her usual beautiful / creepy me. George Rivi√®re, the lead man, does an excellent job with his role. The whole film is saturated with atmosphere, and there is a lot of tension everywhere. Camera viewing angles are good, but the game, for the most part, is not bad. This film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have a DVD version that is far superior to the edited TV version. Take some popcorn, turn off the lights, go back and enjoy. John R. Tracy
