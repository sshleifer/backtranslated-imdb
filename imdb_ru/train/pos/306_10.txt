Well, I saw "They all laughed," when he went to <br /> <br /> Europe in 1982, and kept a vague, but expensive souvenir. I just saw it again on film, almost twenty years later ... Bogdanovich feels sincere affection for his characters and good sympathy that is hard not to feel. Excellent comedians and actors, good lines everywhere and for all and pretty good editing, too. I laughed and smiled all the time. Just like we do from time to time. Go get it.
