One of my favorite movies that was missed by too many viewers, an observation that puzzles me. Not only the director of the famous Ang Lee, he had many young actors who were to become major stars, such as Tobey Maguire (before Spider-Man), Skit Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before the Tudors), James Kavizel, Simon Baker Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson and Jewel. All the actions were excellent, and each of the actors mentioned gave unforgettable performances, especially Meyers, who portrayed the evil villain who killed for the sake of murder. <br /> <br /> When the directorâ€™s biographies and achievements (even when he won an Academy Award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually excluded from their past performances. I discovered the movie on a DVD by accident, and it became one of my most watched movies. However, it is rarely seen on cable. I look forward to reading what others consider to be the reasons why this film is not very well known.
