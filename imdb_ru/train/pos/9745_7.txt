As someone else said, this is a good movie. He has magnificent landscapes and an amazing voice of Luciano! I have seen this film many times and only today saw it again. I forgot how much I miss Pavarotti singing about Nessun Dorma, and I need to get a CD! This is a great movie to just pass the evening, immersed in fun and reverie. Eddie Albert is great as an agent and a bit exaggerated, but still all agents. The Italian countryside is gorgeous, but nothing surpasses a balloon flight for a perfect view. If you need the role of Olivier, this film is not for you. If you just want a flight of fancy and some beautiful music, watch this movie. Just enjoy!
