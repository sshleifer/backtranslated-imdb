I first saw this film in my course of plays and playwrights in Tulan. I was delighted with how beautiful and rude this documentary was. This is a sincere look at the unedited reality of living alone. The family is charming, and I thought it really showed Little Edie in her core. ** As a note. My professor even told me that during the filming, Little Edie was fond of one of the operators. ** I believe that beauty lies in the naturalness of family dysfunction. In the relationship between mother and daughter, it is obvious that none of them can function in society alone, and you begin to desire the rehabilitation of Little Edie in society. In general, the film captures its aesthetic quality and the image of amazing beauty. Two thumbs up!
