I was disappointed if not surprised by the lack of recognition that this film received. Once again, Billy Zayn proves that he is more than just a Hollywood handsome man in a quiet performance that combines spastic slaps with low pathos. To call this silent film inaccurate, as there is a lot of music and sound. It has a manic pace and is full of dull ingenuity, for which, finally, Ed Wood begins to appreciate. Look at the cast list and see that everyone is shining. No one, just to show your face. I believe that they are all in the film to show their appreciation to Voodoo and to play a wide, physical role that they have not seen in our day. <br /> <br /> But today, reviewers are trying to guess what is going to be a hit much more than they show any aesthetic appreciation for the film. And IWUETDID has no noticeable target audience. This was done mostly out of love for the Wood script. Even after his death, fashionable social parasites dealt him another serious blow and deprived the world of petty classics. This is a very interesting and truly experimental film that really deserves to live, at least on DVD.
