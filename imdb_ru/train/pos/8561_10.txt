When the two screenwriters shoot the script for the breakfast at Tiffany's, you know that something will go well. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope and Sally Kellerman are great actors. The FBI agent was a terrible actor. The scenes when Patrick looked at Holly as an objectivist were just weird. Drew Barrymore is very hot. The intimate strangers where Sally Kellerman worked were a great part. A strange sticky worm was just weird. Nathan was a very beautiful cat. But what was the scene when Patrick followed Holly into the cesspool, and did Mr. Gooding attack him? And the scene with Dr. Wallace? What was he fumbling about? And not every man has a woman, as Sally Kellerman stated. And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew outside Victor, it was weird.
