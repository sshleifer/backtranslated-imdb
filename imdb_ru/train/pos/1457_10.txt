I watched this documentary twice - and although I am a big movie buff, most documentaries do not attract my attention. This film however was fascinating. Almost every shot is perfect - it says much more than audio commentary (which is not in this documentary). <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this film is amazing, I can not praise him. Mardi Gras beads - who would have thought ?? <br /> <br /> A terrific and excellent interview choice - filming a factory in China - the film makes you feel that you are actually there. <br /> <br /> I am aware of politics - and I read several books on globalization, so this film was not surprising to me. However, it made me think so much. <br /> <br /> I also really want this world to be a better place. <br /> <br /> Million thanks to the director - and thanks for making this movie. <br /> <I want everyone to see this.
