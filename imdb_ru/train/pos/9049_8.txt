There is an old saying that refers to the inspiring new film of Joe Johnston, which sounds like this: "A man who believes he can, and a man who believes he can not, both are right." This is a very presumptuous statement regarding the motivation of oneself and belief in a person that in this film remains true even after road barriers and family problems interfere. <br /> <br /> “October Sky” is about a young man who believes in himself by the name of Homer Hickam, who grew up in a strict traditional family in the 1950s. Homer loves a small coal mining town where almost everyone becomes a miner. All his friends, Quentin, Roy and O'Dell, think that their life after school will be the same as everyone. Homer is not thrilled with this future. <br /> <br /> One night, when everyone is looking at the sky, the Russian spacecraft Sputnik flies overhead. This is something new to Homer, and he finds it exciting and stunning. From this point on, his outlook on life will never be the same. <br /> <br /> First, he tells everyone he wants to work in the field of rocket science for training. Stunned by what he says, his family passes the idea through his head and continues to live as usual. His friends, however, think that this idea may have some potential. After all, Quentin is a very smart person when it comes to this sort of thing. <br /> <br /> When four friends start testing model rockets and smash a white fence, what they seem to fear from a forest fire, they are forced to stop their development. <br /> <br /> The performances in this film are absolutely exciting from start to finish. All the actors give performances as if it were a real fetish here. Outstanding in all its glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. This very well can be a reward of the Academy if the judges can recall the beginning of the year when this film was released. <br /> <br /> Characters are also very well developed. Not only the filmmakers give a clear, obvious reason why Homer is interested in this subject, but also explain to viewers how they manage to study rocket science. We clearly understand all the motives and beliefs of the characters, especially the father, who is prone to eternal traditions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film lost some of its strength in the middle due to stupidity, a reworked romantic plot involving Homer's love interest and how his brother stole it from him. This type is becoming so common in school films that this film is not intended for high school students. Actors mindlessly look at each other, as if in a trance. I put up with it without complaining in 1997 in the “Invention of Abbots”, but I had enough of that. <br /> <br /> But this is only a small complaint. With a genuine looking time frame, an Oscar-worthy cinema, and real Homer clips at the end, which everyone amazed with their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first great film of 1999 <br /> <br />
