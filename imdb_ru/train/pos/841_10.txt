I found this to be a very funny dark comedy. Brosnan is a genius; as someone will now say, he should not be spoiled as a link. Kinnear was as charismatic and funny as any other. I don't know if I laughed so much during any movie! What an unexpected pleasure! My favorite phrase is: "I feel like a prostitute in Bangkok on Sunday after the fleet left the city." Brosnan put this very free line with such an unexpected comedy grace. I was also very impressed with the performance of Hope Davis. It seems that everyone in this film has moved away from their previous work to such an extent that it actually improved the comedy. If you like the gloomy and cheerful "Weather Man", you will definitely like it. <br /> <br /> I voted for 10.
