I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I love to watch Brosnan in any film, he is always good, but it was completely different. He is in disarray, and plays very well in disarray. In fact, he reminded me of himself several times back at the university :) So yes, there is not so much violence, not so much action, but the dialogue is amazing, the game is great and very refreshing, and it's pretty funny too :) I don't think that you leave the cinema and say, “Wow! I was amazed,” but you will come out with a smile, enjoying a good movie. I can not ask for more. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you are lucky, some jerk will incorrectly put a commercial, and you will turn over, turned over, turned over (with an upside down sound) ads !! Brilliant. Nothing like watching a Daniel Daniels ad where a drink returns to a bottle from a glass with a rough American commentary on Twin Peaks :)
