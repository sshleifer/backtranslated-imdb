This frivolous comedy should be used for entertainment. Sometimes it gets rather hysterically funny, but if you haven't spent time on the “other” side of the tracks, you will miss the comedy when it breaks out. <br /> <br /> The composition of the characters is well combined and quite plausible in their roles. The way Grace handles her friend her late husband is well played. She is a real lady. And, my favorite white suit is Grace, which she wears. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to laugh out loud, who is a fan of a loser, or just wants to watch something else.
