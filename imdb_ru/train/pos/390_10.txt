The first thing I thought when I saw these films was: this is not really a film, at least it is not something we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word “film”. it is completely symbolic, everything in it has a figurative meaning. Therefore, if you are not used to expressing things in a symbolic way, you will find it strange, if you are not familiar with philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you think that this is just a fairy tale ... and even a strange chaotic. For me, the "Legend of Zu" is completely transparent. And I like it. He tells us in images the story of the struggle between light and darkness, of a struggle that is as old as humanity, and everyone who seeks feelings in this life faces it. The film is clearly made by Buddhists. I am not a Buddhist. My religion and vision of the world and man are different. But since we are all human and have the same human nature, we definitely have common experience and can understand each other. This is really a beautiful movie! And I had more such films - films that matter. Too many empty stories that are good only to make the time pass faster.
