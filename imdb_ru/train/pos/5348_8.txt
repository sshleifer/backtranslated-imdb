Another great Arnold film. This futuristic film has a lot of action and is one of the best Arnie films. Arnold is considered the bad guy in this film and plays the game of death. This film is great and great science fiction / action movie. I always liked this film, and it must be one of the greatest adventure films of all time. 10 out of 10! Perfection
