The late, great director who exploits the film-making class “Z” Al-Adamson really surpasses himself with this superbly awesome sci-fi musical comedy atrocity that delights in delightfully dark and sluggish depths in sheer celluloid stupidity and stunning stupidity. In the gloomy totalitarian future of 2047, sex was deemed an illegal act of Big Brother, like the powerless, clumsy idiot of the Controller (funny silly Erwin Fuller). Nevertheless, sweet'n'sexy Cinderella (radiant blonde cake with cutie Catherine Erhardt) is still determined to change things for the better. With the help of his effeminate Godfather of the Fairy (bright courtesy of Jay B. Larson), Cinderella attends a grand gala-ball with a special plan for seducing the beautiful stallion Tom Prince (stupid Vaughn Armstrong) and teaches everyone that making love is a positive, pleasant and quite acceptable activity . <br /> <br /> Adamson directs this ridiculous yarn with his usual incompetence, demonstrating incredibly awful songs and dance episodes with a completely incompetent lack of skills and talent. The scandalous and terrible number "We all need love" with people in ridiculous animal costumes, clumsily riding around the forest, is a ridiculous monstrous miracle; just as disgusting is the "Mechanical Man" routine, showing a bunch of clumsy galloping robots. Rude, static cinematography by Louis Horwart, sticky plastic miniatures, Sparky Sugerman's magnificent pulsating disco score, profusely nakedness (gorgeous hot brunette Sherry Coyle deserves special praise in this particular department), mind-boggling attempts to laugh at the humor in a low style (Rosko) in low style (Rosco) robots are especially annoying), and the evenly horrible views (the insanely audacious image of Rene Harmon about the Cinderella's wicked and domineering stepmother who got here in a large mined prize) even more or strikingly abundant bliss to be enjoyed in this delightfully dreary and bleak.
