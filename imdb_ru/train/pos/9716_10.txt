To love this movie to the maximum, you must be: a) deeply in love (without marriage) b) recognize English humor, which is dedicated to the admiration of gallant and witty life situations, and not just jokes crying over every minute of this movie, and only if you meet the requirements of “b” and “c”, can you recognize and enjoy the opinion of the author. d) to fully enjoy the film, you must love women like Kirsted Dunst, who is so natural, sweet and compelling. e) you should admire creative, melancholic people with wonderful and wonderful personalities. <br /> <br /> If you meet all these requirements, you will probably appreciate this film about 10 points. <br /> <br /> I never laughed in half (!) as much as from watching this masterpiece. And sometimes I even managed to cry, laughing (I always become sensitive when something good happens to Kirsten Dunst)
