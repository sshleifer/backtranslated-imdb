My 3rd French courses have always been very popular with this film. In a multicultural, urban urban school, the film provided many subjects for discussion (in French in class, but I know that a lot of discussion continued in English after class). The most obvious is the relationship between Proteus and Amy compared with relations between Proteus and France. <br /> <br /> I always mentioned that it seemed to me that in this film there was one of the "sexiest" scenes I had ever seen in a movie. Once, a 17-year-old African-American man shouted: “Yes!” When he found out the scene: the one where Prote helps Amy sew up her evening dress, all the while both are studying the reflection of the other in the mirror. Directors use the “mirror technique” when they then want to focus on internal conflict from one or more characters in the scene: this is a great example of technology and it is “sexy.” <br /> <br /> Most students had trouble understanding the end of the film. One of them suggested that one of the themes of the film was “Africanism”, and that no matter how much people loved Africa or Africans, you cannot “become” African (as the driver tried to do): you need to BE an African.
