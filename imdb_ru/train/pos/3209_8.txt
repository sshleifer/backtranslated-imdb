An interesting mixture of comments to which it would be difficult to add something constructive. However, I will try. It was a very good fighter with several great scenes. You will notice that I have indicated the genre. I was not joking about the lack of performance, and I did not scold the acting game. Enjoy, if for the fact that these are people, well above the average action movie. I could continue, but I made my comment.
