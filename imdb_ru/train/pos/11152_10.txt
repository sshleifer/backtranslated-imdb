Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a master class in acting / directing / cinematography / editing / writing. I was too young to watch him when he was originally released, and saw him only a couple of years ago, but he absolutely stood the test of time, and since then I have watched him several times. <br /> <br /> Everything in this film is brilliant, from the sharp speeches of Vojt and Hoffman (although I know this movie well, I still feel good every time Vojt highlights one of his innocently painful views, or Hoffman coughs in his painful and ominous way) in stunning cinema and superbly edited dream episodes. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s a shame that many of our modern directors are not ready to take risks creating films that look as visually and aural as this one. Midnight Cowboy should be viewed in all film schools. <br /> <br /> 10/10
