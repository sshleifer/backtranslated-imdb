Having finished renting movies, I took Freebird. I struggled with the first third of the film, wondering if the rest would not be an empty spectacle. Fortunately, he really warmed up, and I really liked the movie. In the second half of the film, I was smiling and laughing all the time. Fortunately, although CGI fragments were present, they were not exaggerated or dominated. <br /> <br /> However, I must say that all the actors have strong European accents, so be careful if you have problems understanding them. voices or their cultural humor. <br /> <br /> I really liked this film, and Iâ€™ll have to order a copy for my own collection.
