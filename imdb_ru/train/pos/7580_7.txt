No matter how much I enjoy Hanzo the Razor films, three are enough: “Who got the gold?”, The last adventure for a Japanese lawyer with an impressive package is a pretty nice piece of Pinku movie, but offers little new in terms of ideas, taking a big step back into with regard to outrage. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the appearance of a female ghost and looks as if he is going to explore supernatural territory, something that may have taken the series in an interesting new direction; unfortunately, after the ghost turns out to be nothing more than a Scooby-Doo-style trick (prepared by a corrupt treasury official seeking to keep people away from the lake where he hides the stolen gold), director Yoshio Inoue is happy with the processing of familiar elements from the first two films, the result of which is a rather stale thing. <br /> <br /> Once again, Hanzo heads up an investigation that requires him to interrogate women with the help of his powerful member, cut his enemies and mock his superiors. On the way, we get wild orgies, good-natured rape (Hanzo imposes himself on women who value his self-will) and bloody sword battles. <br /> <br /> If you have already seen and rated the first two films, you can also watch this release to complete the set, but keep in mind that this is probably the least satisfying one of them. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10, rounded to 7 for IMDb,
