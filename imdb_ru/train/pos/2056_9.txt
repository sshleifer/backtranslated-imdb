I do not think that most people give this film as much merit as it deserves. I love low-budget horror films, and this requires special attention, especially for originality. Yes, Scarecrow is a kung fu action movie, but why not? No one else wants to go that far. I really haven't had so much fun watching a film since Candyman. Thus, the city chooses this one child, who calls him a stuffed animal, even his mother does not care about him. Then he is killed, and the spirit penetrates the Scarecrow, which is then sent to the Killing Spree. His death is relatively easy to imagine as soon as the film begins. The initiations at the end go straight to a bunch of horror directors, but with great dedication Dario Argento impressed me very much, these people who want to make films of a new genre. In the film, there are a lot of tears of Arnold, with one insert, over which you will surely laugh like a stick, and he kills the sheriff with a stick. I would say, take a pizza with friends and laugh at this movie. I love it for its originality, the most fun.
