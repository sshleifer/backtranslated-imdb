I saw this movie tonight in New York at Landmark Sunshine. I didn’t know what to expect, I wouldn’t read much about it, because I knew that I would see it, no matter what. Overall, this is very well done. He does not focus on summarizing "anti-war" statements, which, in my opinion, do not take into account politics. The soldiers mostly talked about their awareness of toxicity in training at the training camp and how hard it was for them to return to civilian life. It was very nice to see how Paul Rikhoff and Camilo Mejia talk about how difficult it is to survive not only the war, but also to refuse the command to retreat when it contradicts personal morality. Make no mistake - this is not an anti-war film. Anyone who says this has not seen it or does not live with the scars of war on their souls.
