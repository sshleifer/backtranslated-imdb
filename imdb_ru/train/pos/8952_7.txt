Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. In secret, she is attracted to a completely normal neighbor, Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She casts a spell on Shep, which causes him to leave her fiancé and fall in love with her. Things are going pretty well until Gillian discovers that she really cares about this mortal man. She decides to tell him her secret. But how will Shep react when he finds out that he was “deceived” by falling in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> For the carefree comedies of the 1950s, Bell Book and Candle is good, but nothing special. This is quite a nice watch, and they should please almost everyone who sits behind them. Just do not enter the film, waiting for the best of sliced ​​bread. The film is cute, sometimes funny and touching at the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have some real chemistry. Novak (as others have noted) looks pretty incredible in some ways. The supporting cast with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold and Elsa Lanchester often laughs funny and attracts the attention of Novak and Stuart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle cannot decide exactly which film they want to see. This is a comedy? Is this a romantic comedy? Is this a supernatural comedy? If director Richard Quine stuck to only one approach, the film could be even better and more memorable.
