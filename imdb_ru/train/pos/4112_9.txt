The name is onomatopoeia, the sound of a tram knocking on rails. This is metaphorical for all that people who live in a landfill cannot have. The misfortune of these people is illustrated by a passing tram, which represents the relatively inaccessible rich life of the middle class. The pathos of a little boy and his beloved, but sadly insane father is the most touching. It was Kurosawa's first color film, in which he uses gorgeous shocking shades, colors that can only be seen in a dream. The film is surreal and surpasses in beauty. Compassion for humanity is the main force, but, as always, Kurosawa focuses on capturing the beauty of the film. This is a masterpiece of movie genius.
