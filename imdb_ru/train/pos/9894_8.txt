“Slaughter High” is a completely ridiculous slasher about a high school botanist Marty, who is always nagged by some jokers. The joke goes wrong, and he ultimately gets offended. only ten of them, of course, are low, and so Marty kills them one by one. British actress Carolyn Munro ("Maniac") plays the main role in the role of the heroine (who dies anyway!). The game is absolutely terrible, also not in waiting. Many grotesque scenes of death to satisfy the monsters: a guy’s stomach explodes, another female victim has an acid bath, a couple having sex in bed, a current, a guy crushed a tractor, one girl drowned, and the doctor gets a needle from subcutaneous injections in the eyes. The killer wears a decent and rather creepy jester mask, and the setting (beautiful old English castle) is really good. However, the final dream is completely pathetic. All this is true that "Slaughter High" is a piece of garbage, but I liked it. Only for fans of really bad slashers.
