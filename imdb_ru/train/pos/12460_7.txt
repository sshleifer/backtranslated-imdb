Farewell friend aka Adieu L'Ami / Honor Among thieves is not perfect, but it is a neat and interesting thriller, in which you can see the uncoordinated demobilized French veterans of the Algerian war, Alain Delon and Charles Bronson, trapped in one basement vault, one to return the stolen bonds to another to clear out the two million salaries sitting there on the Christmas weekend. Naturally, things are not so simple, even after they open the vault, which leads to some elegant turns. On the debit side, there is a very strange strip scene in the parking lot, Bronson has a very annoying catchphrase similar to Fonzie, which he uses in the most inappropriate moments, Brigitte Fossey, in which, perhaps, the most disgustingly misunderstood hairstyle of the 60s (this makes her look like a bald woman, whose wig is ripped off the top of a strong wind), is this something like responsibility? her "I will cook spaghetti! I will learn to make good love! I will read Shakespeare!" speech hysterical in all the wrong directions ?? And it's a shame for the terrible last line / frame, but otherwise it's a surprisingly interesting and unassuming number, which is worth checking out if you can find a decent print. <br /> <br /> British DVD Cinema Club only offers an English soundtrack, but since Delon himself voices himself and the rest of the actors is pretty well dubbed, this is not a big problem, especially since the transfer of a widescreen image is of rather good quality.
