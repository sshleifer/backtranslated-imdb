My short commentary on this film: go and pick it up. Most likely, you will be pleasantly surprised by the variety of elements, perfectly disclosed in this criminal thriller. There is no way that the Miklos character, demanding and trying with all his might, will not make himself nervous to the extreme ... 2 thumbs up!
