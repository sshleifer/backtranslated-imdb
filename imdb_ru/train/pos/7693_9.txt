"GOOD TIME", in my opinion, is a CBS hit! Although I have never seen every episode, I still enjoy it. It is hard to say which one is my favorite. In addition, I really like the theme of the song. If you ask me, although I like everything, it would be nice if everyone stayed on the show for the whole run. Everyone always gave a good presentation, the design of the production was impressive, the costumes were well thought out, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, despite the fact that now it can be seen on TV Land, I strongly recommend that you catch him in case he permanently disconnects from the air.
