Well done, but mostly dreary melodrama with a low standard of living, which, according to the accompanying interview with presenter Isabel Huppert, writer / director Piala, is permeated with a large number of autobiographical details; given mostly unsympathetic characters, this does not make him any compliments - and he seems to have been a worried person, since Huppert also says that Piala often disappeared all day long during the shooting! <br /> <br /> However, the acting is equally superb; despite their relatively young age, Huppert and his colleague in the film Gerard Depardieu (as the main character!) were already in the forefront of modern French stars - a status that, with varying degrees of success, both of them still retain. <br /> <br /> I have 3 more Piala films in my compilation "VHS To Watch", although they are all in French without English subtitles; because of this fact, and also because of the depressing realism of LOULOU — despite its undeniable artistic merit — I cannot say that now I am in a hurry to check them out ...
