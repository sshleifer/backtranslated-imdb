I think this is a great movie. because you see how diana lives at home. She has so much aggression, and she wants to prove that girls can fight too. I think she and Adrian were great actors. Because of this movie, I'm boxing too. It really impressed me. the only negative part, I think. This is the end. because between Diana and Adrian everything is in order. But you do not see how it is at home. And I didn’t like that you also didn’t see how her father and her brother were doing. but I think it was a great movie, and I think I will watch it a lot more :) I recommend it to everyone, even if you don’t like boxing, you’ll see much more than just boxing. I had a great time watching this.
