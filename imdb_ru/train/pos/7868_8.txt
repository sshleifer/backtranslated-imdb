Again, Madhur Bhandarkar will send you to the wild side. And this is wonderful, in the literal and figurative sense. <br /> <br /> Hi-society Mumbai - stars and stars, glamorous dolls and sorcerers, business magnates and brokers, yes, this whole stinking party is in sharp focus here. In a typical boulevard fashion, their worlds unfold, and each colorful story in itself is a tricky storyline. <br /> <br /> Fighting stars, abandoned by the producer after she became pregnant, the flight attendant and her high-ranking husband, a pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife, reporters and the police captain; All shades are exhibited and countless shades in between. <br /> <br /> Bhandarkar works great by digging up mud on dramatic kings, dancing queens and the living dead. Atul Kulkarni strikes, as does Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Concon Saint Sharma is effective as a reporter for the strikes of a former criminal, but she could be a little annoyed in accordance with the change of place of work and the party scheme. <br /> <br /> Strongly focused (140 minutes long) and refreshingly different film costs money.
