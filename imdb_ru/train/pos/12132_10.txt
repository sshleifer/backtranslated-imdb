It's nice, despite Leslie Howard's performance. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a flat, uninteresting character. It is supposed to feel sorry for this person; however, I find myself welcoming Mildred Bette Davis. Ms. Davis gives one of her best performances (she received an Oscar nomination) Thanks to her performance, she brings to life this rather boring film. ** Do not miss when Mildred tells Philip exactly what she thinks of him.
