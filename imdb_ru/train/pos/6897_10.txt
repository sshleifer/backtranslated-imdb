It was released in France on DVD a few years ago â€” I would like it to be reprinted with English subtitles. Do not confuse this with the remake of Penelope Cruz, which receives bad reviews. Gerard Philippe is a peasant to whom the fortune teller says that he will marry the king's daughter. He goes to the army and goes to war. However, his love is Gina Lollabrigida in an early film for her. I will not spoil the end. Gerard Philippe died a few years later at a young age, which was a big loss for the preacher.
