1930s Awesome, elegant Adele (amazingly played with decent determination by Debbie Reynolds) and unpretentious, cheeky Helen (gorgeous Shelley Winters delighted with her usual histrionic panacea) - the mother of two murderers. They leave their dark past in the Midwest and move to Hollywood to open their own dance school for beginning little stars. Adele begins dating the dashing millionaire Lincoln Palmer (always beautiful Dennis Weaver). On the other hand, the religious fanatic Helen soon falls into despair and madness. <br /> <br /> Directed by Curtis (“Night Wave”, “Ruby”) Harrington, working on the sly script by Henry Farrell (who wrote the book “What happened to Baby Jane?” It was founded and co-wrote the script for “Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte ”) skillfully composes a complex and compelling psychological horror thriller about guilt, fear, repression, and religious zeal, dangerously running amok. The super-cast has a ball with their colorful roles: Michael McLiammoire as a pompous teacher of eloquence, Agnes Moorehead as a harsh radio evangelist of fire and sulfur, Yvette Vickers as a dazzling, domineering mother of a cheesy mime star child, Logan Ramsay as a detective spy, and Timothy Carey - a terrible ass. A difficult recital of talent featuring Pamelina Ferdin (voice of Lucy in the cartoon “Peanuts”) as the lead and original victim of Friday the 13th, Robbie Morgan, performing the ominous obscene impression dead on Mei West, is considered definite. zest. David Raskin’s eerie score, fantastic scene with Reynolds performing incredible tango in a chic restaurant, fragrant atmosphere of the Depression period, beautiful cinematography by Lucien Ballard and a particularly striking eerie ending - all also for money is excellent and effective. MGM presents this amazing gem on an elegant DVD disc that says "Whoever killed Aunt Roo ;;" Both pictures are presented in clear widescreen broadcasts along with their theatrical trailers.
