I saw this film in which Jane Austen became addicted and always doubted the cinematic reproduction of the complexity of her novels: well, this transposition is just accurate, intelligent, delicate, careful, tactful, respectful, intense, in a word, perfect! br /> <br /> Emma is one of Austinâ€™s most delightful and amusing novels thanks to ironic situations and characters. The film respected this subtle irony, without disregarding the comic element (especially Miss Bates). What attracted me to the novel, and the film clearly shows it, so much is the deep knowledge of human life, shown by the English novelist, and the modern view that women, men and their relationships treat, and it is amazing if we think like a female novelist 18- This century, which lived an almost solitary life, could understand such a depth and truth about life as it did: this is what fascinates me most of all. We can feel this modernity throughout the film: just replace the costumes and use a more modern language, but situations, feelings, ideas would be extremely modern. I think about the painful interest in the lives of other people or about that obsessive envy, which now as always rules relations with women, and how it is still difficult to disclose and express their feelings, especially love: each situation becomes universal and beyond the meaning of time < br /> <br /> The cast is really talented and offers very good and extremely brilliant performances: young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suited for this role (she is probably too adult now for this), Tony Colette is just great. And how I envied them for the beautiful dresses they could wear! And then the breathtaking English countryside, where every situation takes on such a magical and fabulous dimension ... a truly enjoyable and dignified film.
