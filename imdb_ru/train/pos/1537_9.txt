The film takes place in a small Swedish town where everyone knows each other. Here Mia visits her parents for her fatherâ€™s birthday, in which some kind of tragedy happens sometimes, the only question is what will happen this year and you will be surprised ... This is a very well-composed film, with a story with a perfect balance of humor seriousness that is rarely seen. You are happy, you are injured, and basically everything between them. Finally, you can't help falling in love with Mia (if you're a boy, I suppose (main actress)), she is very well chosen, like many other actors / actresses. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
