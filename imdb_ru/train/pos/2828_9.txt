After a six-month tracking, I finally found a copy, and it did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> Not disappointing, because I'm one of those SMAP fans who need to watch all of their work, and I finally got to see the so-called hot Goro film. But I could not believe that Goro was forced to make the film as such. Now I am sure that in his respectable I cringed on what made this film. However, they found the perfect person to look embarrassed, ill at ease and almost depressed most of the time. <br /> <br /> Dude, I still can't believe that he made this film ... look at many sides, not believing that he really made such a film .... hahahaha .... < br /> <br /> But I'm glad I looked at it. Thank God, he grew up ....
