So far I have only seen 1 season, but this is just great !! On the island stuck a variety of people. Nobody is who they seem to be, and everyone seems to have a lot of skeletons in their closets ... It seems that Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family, and why is it so great? This is probably not, but then the ad spoon full of X Files, a dose of "what" ?? and the big “hey” and the island, which has everything you have ever dreamed of - in your bizarre nightmares, and you will be lost. The story got so many twists and turns that it is unbelievable. Superbly tuned, purposeful, acting freely and with the knowledge that in the end all people (well, almost all ... I think ...) with good and bad sides. But strange, oh, how strange ...
