Going into Seven Pounds, I was not exactly sure what to think, because the preview left a lot to understand what the film really was about. So for the first 20 minutes or so, you are completely lost in the plot, have no idea what is happening, and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big asshole. It all ends when the "turn", so to speak, unfolds at the very last minute of the film. In fact, Tim (Will Smith) was worried and often haunted by the big accident he had caused, which killed seven people. With this, he decides to embrace seven new people who are in dire need of help, to whom he, in turn, gives up his life. <br /> <br /> The acting work in this film is great, as I feel that there will be a blacksmith, no matter what part it seems to be impressive. Rosario Dawson, for me, is one of her best films, besides the eagle eye, which I think is there. She was in poor condition, but in this film she copes. Other actors, such as Woody Harrelson, play very small roles and are not large enough to understand the character. Although the casting of the film was still good. <br /> <br /> This film was definitely not what I expected, and, of course, much slower than I had hoped. The film, however, was still pretty good. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 minutes of the film, and everything falls into place. Until then, it just seems like a meaningless love story. Last thought seven pounds = seven stars.
