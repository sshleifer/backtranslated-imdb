Just seeing the mini-series A Perfect Spy at a time, you can do nothing, except to take off your hat - a pure masterpiece, which compared to other Le Carré mini-series about Smiley has completely different qualities. <br /> <br /> In the Smiley mini-series, this is Alex Smith, as Smiley is stealing the show - the rest of the actors just support him, you might say. <br /> <br /> The ensemble and the story are important here, as the leading actor Peter Egan played well in the last episodes is not at all charismatic. <br /> <br /> Egan just plays a guy named Magnus Pym, who is lying, crafty and telling people that they like to hear, everyone loves, big and small. The only one who seems to understand his inner being is Alex, his Czech handler. <br /> <br /> Never better told about the machines behind the spy and / or traitor! Having traced his life from an early age, we fully understand what makes him a possible traitor. His ability to lie and forge everything that makes him an “ideal spy,” as the Czech handler calls him. <br /> <br /> And, following his life, we fully understand how difficult it is to return to the straight and narrow path once you have turned off of it. He continues, even if he never extracts anything economic from it, except for promotion from his spy masters MI5. Everyone is happy while the flow of falsified information continues! <br /> <br /> Magnus' father, who is wonderfully played by Ray Macanally, is a bad crook who always comes up with schemes to fool people out of their money. In subsequent years, it was his son who was supposed to help him out again and again. But following the example of his father and his uncle, who becomes a guardian when his father goes to prison and his mother is sent to an asylum, Magnus learns early that a lie is a way to survive, not to tell the truth. At first, he was a little overdoing, but he quickly learned to speak the right lie and to be constant, without changing the stories from time to time, told to those who want to hear about themselves and their father. <br /> <br /> His Czech handler Alex, skillfully played by Rüdiger Weygang, creates with the help of Magnus a network of non-existent informers who supply the British MI-5 with false information for years and years, just as the British did with German spies who were were active in the UK before and during the war - they continued to send fake information to Das Waterland long after the agents themselves were turned, eliminated or simply replaced by people from MI5. <br /> <br /> Young guys who play Magnus in their youth do it well, and most of them are more charismatic than older ones, a bit more cynical and tired, Pim, played by Egan. But you can easily buy the difference, because so often we change throughout life, from enthusiasm to sadness or indifference. <br /> <br /> Really worth the money!
