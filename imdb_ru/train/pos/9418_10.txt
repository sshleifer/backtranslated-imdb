I had this film on film for many years, and I started watching it again this morning (waiting for my laundry - how ironic!), Mostly because I wanted to hear the title music of Benjamin Frankel again. In the end, I sat for the first half hour, admiring how wonderful the direction, composition and performances were provided. The film is similar to who is who from the British heroes of the 50s: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont and, in particular, Ernest Teziger, great as the dried-up old textile textile giant. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, not about the characters as such, but charming, charismatic heroes. This is pure science fiction as well as comedy. A classic for all times, and I hope that no one will ever try to remake it!
