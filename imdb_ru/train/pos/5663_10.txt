14 years since the show was made, and it is still the best ever created. The letter was 1st class, and production was unsurpassed. This show will never be done today, and it is a shame. I hope that if you are thinking of finding this show to see what you are doing. <br /> <br /> AG came out that year when I graduated from high school, when my favorite TV show was “x files”, and this gives an idea of ​​why I first got on this show. AG was a much better program with better spelling, but it had only one reason? I know that this is not the only program to get only one season, and one more example that comes to mind is a lonely thug (files are spinning), he had a good composition and he was funny, but also got only one season . It does not seem right! <br /> <br /> We also need to remember that this show was even before such shows as twilight, did the dark shows "cool", so I think it could also allow the show to go down the hill. <br /> <br /> Watch this program and enjoy! 10 out of 10 for me.
