I believe that this film is the best film about Mike Hammer, and the role of Biff Elliott in the lead role - Mike Hammer. Harry Essex's screenplay is excellent and contains many improvements to the Mickey Spillane novel. His direction is strong and creative, and he makes great use of light and shadow. John Alton’s camera work is first-class, as is Franz Waxman’s score. The cast includes many veteran players, as well as Peggy Castle in her unforgettable performance as Charlotte Manning. All in all, this is one of the best private movie ever made. Biff Elliott and Haari Essex should have been given more options. I have always treasured this movie.
