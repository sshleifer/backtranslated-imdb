I will never forget when I saw this headline in the video store even once. I've always been a big fan of Weird Al, and when I saw this video, I shot it and watched. I was too young to appreciate Al's subtle humor and satire at the time, but I remember it much later when I was old enough to understand what I was watching. If you are a fan of "Al", especially his early works, you will love this movie. This is done in the MTV-esque “Rockumentary” style and tells the true (but sometimes exaggerated) story of how Al got to where he was in 1985. You'll love it if you enjoy his humor and, more importantly, his music.
