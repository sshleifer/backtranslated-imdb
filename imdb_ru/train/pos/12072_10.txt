What if Marilyn Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe DiMaggio, and Senator McCarthy got together for a stunning evening of relativity? <br /> <br /> This delightful Roman key never uses the real names of the characters, which he so thinly curtains and violent revelations not only for the people they were supposed to be, but also for what they began to present over of time. If you are confused by an allegory, or if you like your movies prepared with digestion and softness, you will not like this movie. This is a difficult opus, which on many levels rewards the viewer with the intellect to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Rejecting for the time being an exact evasion of using real character names, we see Einstein, who is going to make a pacifist speech at the UN, obsessed with the desire for nuclear weapons, which Marilyn Monroe is visiting, after filming the notorious seven-year itch which, as some say, led to the end of her marriage with Joe DiMaggio. They have a wonderful interaction, in which Einstein stumbles with a suitable professorial clumsiness around innocence, perhaps the greatest sex symbol of modern times. <br /> <br /> Enter Senator McCarthy, who thinks Einstein is red. He is determined to extract from Einstein assurances that he will support the activities of the Committee on the Activities of the House of Unamericans, while providing the main weapon in the name of peace. Add Joe, an amazingly fragile and vulnerable person, perhaps not ideally played, like Gary Busey, who hates Marilyn's exhibitionism and believes that Einstein became her lover, although Marilyn wants only to show Einstein that she understands the Special Theory of Relativity. <br /> <br /> But that's not all. <br /> <br /> Like each of us, these characters have their deepest fears, which they discover one after another, chasing memories. It is these weaknesses that ultimately give humanity to those figures that we cannot but see, but see almost exclusively in the abstract today. Finally, we see the shocking horror of Einstein’s vision, and the film’s statement becomes clear. This is a powerful and memorable moment. <br /> <br /> “Minor” is one of my top five films of all time. This is absolutely awesome.
