I do not understand why other comments focus on McConaughey. He was never a very interesting movie actor. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film is the script and wit. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGow make an unusual comic duet, definitely not a type of stock. Although one cannot say that their characters are well developed, this does not make them any less fun. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was for HDNET and had subtitles for the Spanish dialogue, so this, of course, is a problem. Using Spanish gives him more authenticity. <br /> <br /> A very underrated film, judging by the unusually low score that IMDb members gave him. I thought it was fun and interesting and cost at least 7. Many interesting films with higher scores and higher earnings at the box office are much less interesting.
