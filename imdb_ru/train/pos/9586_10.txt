The film really challenges your ideas about the individual and the society in which we live. He is well made and very strong. People in the film are honest and reveal a world that exists outside the normative ideological perspective. I believe that this gives a deep understanding of the subculture, which shocks the very ideas that the viewer has in society. It is shocking at times and more powerful because of this. Some parts were difficult to observe, like most realities, but this is not all done. This is good the first time you watch it, but it gets better the second or third time; because you had the opportunity to focus on the topics they discuss and challenge.
