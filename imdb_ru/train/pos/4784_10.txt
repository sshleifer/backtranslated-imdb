It's nice to watch a movie with real people with honest feelings. Sissy Spacek is as convincing as the simple but at the same time cute daughter of Robert Farnsworth, <br /> <br /> who finally, in her last role, shows how he was a good actor. It's hard to believe that this is a David Lynch film. It is slow and smooth, sweet and touching. One of the best, if you do not like car chases, sex scenes and violence.
