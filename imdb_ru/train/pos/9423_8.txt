I can’t say whether British comedies after World War II, produced at Ealing Studios, are acquired or not, but I’m totally addicted, and the Man in the White Suit is one of the best. No need to go into the famous story about the threat posed to the textile industry and textile unions indestructible, dirty fiber. Suffice it to say that the lines and arrows, from which the naively idealistic Sidney Stratton suffers, in pursuing his polymeric vision, cause comedic delight. Many of the famous characters from the world of British character actors - nervous Cecil Parker, cunning and cunning Michael Gough, and frankly merciless Ernest Tesinger - put on great performances. Guinness - as always and forever - great, and Joan Greenwood is amazing, like Daphne (exactly the way she utters the word "daddy" makes the film worthy of attention). <br /> <br /> “Knudsen !!! !!!!
