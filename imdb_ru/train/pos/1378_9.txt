I saw this little Belgian pearl two days after watching “American Teen.” Make no mistake, adolescence is a rollercoaster ride, whether it is American or European. "Naissance des Pieuvres" (or, as it is called in the USA, "Water Lilies") is a story about a young 15-year-old girl (played by Pauline Aquart, who sometimes reminds young Scarlett Johansson), who plays a cool, retired girl who wants to be on the school swimming team, just to be close to another attractive girl (Adel Henel). It is more than obvious that Marie is more than attracted to Floriana. Amid all this, Marie’s rather plump, unattractive girlfriend, Ann, who just wants a boyfriend like any other girl of her age. On the way, we are shown the usual set of games for teenagers (broken hearts, going to the store, drinking alcohol and / or drugs, casual sex, etc.). This is a quiet little movie that takes time to penetrate your system (fans of Michael Bay, note: the step is s-l-o-w, so stay away), but if you have no problems with that, Water Lillies is a caster. No rating here, but it will pull a tough "R", because of the language, nudity, adult situations.
