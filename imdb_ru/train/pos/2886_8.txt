Cinderella is a beautiful film, with beautiful songs, of course. In fact, this is one of the best films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I think all the characters are amazingly depicted. You can see the cruelty of the Cinderella stepsisters and her stepmother, the sweetness of Cinderella. Mice are also funny and cute. <br /> <br /> I think they changed the story a little, but I think it's for the best. This is such a good film, and I donâ€™t think that someone can resist it deep down. <br /> <br /> I give him 8/10. I don't think this is the best Disney movie. But it really is a classic.
