Shintarô Katsu, who played the blind swordsman "Zatoichi" in 27 films, ends the Hanzo trilogy with this superb film in which he makes love with the ghost of Mako Midori (Blind Beast). <br /> <br /> The big stick, often used to achieve justice, resigned forever. <br /> <br /> Katsu was his usual impudent man, pursuing those who would steal from the treasury to give loans in height could not afford to pay. <br /> <br /> The usual amazing sword game and the big guy’s skill, as well as blood, were present. <br /> <br /> I'll miss him.
