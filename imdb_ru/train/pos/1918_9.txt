I will be honest with Yall, I was junior in high school, when this comedy series first appeared on ABC, I did not think that I would like it at all. But with John Ritter in him, I felt that there was little potential in him, plus they were something else that I liked. The acting was great, not too many horrible comedy lines of the 2nd rating, John Ritter always brings his game when it comes to comedy. It was a great show, and I will tell you why it was a great show. My father, who never sees sitcoms at all, he just watches movies, sports and law and order, he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my mom and me, and watched the show, which I think because John Ritter was in it. Honestly, I think this show will continue if John Ritter God gives rest to his soul, and I would like him not to die.
