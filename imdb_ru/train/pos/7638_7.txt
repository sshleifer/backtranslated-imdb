Larry Burrows has a distinct feeling that he is missing something. Since he missed the decisive baseball shot at school, which was worth the championship, he was sure that his life would have been better if he had made this shot. Then one night his car breaks down again. Going to the nearest bar to wait for a tow truck, Larry meets the bartender Mike, who without the knowledge of Larry is going to change his life forever ....... <br /> <br /> An alternative prerequisite for living in Kino is hardly a new thing that goes away in the past, as “This is a wonderful life”, and showing no signs of weakening of the relatively recent Sandler car, which was a “Click”. This is a genre that gave very mixed results. Back in 1990, it was staged under the direction of James Belushi, rarely mentioned when the mentioned topic appeared, it seems that it has been largely forgotten. Which is a shame, because it exudes charm and is not short in the department of humor. We know that we are led to the end of his final message, but this is a fascinating and enjoyable way to go down. The film also serves as a notification of how great comedian James Belushi was. I mean, if his style of clever stinging and gross annoyance is not your thing? then chances are that you will still avoid this movie. But for those who are attracted to companies such as Red Heat, K-9 and Business Care, Mr. Destiny is right on your street. Linda Hamilton, Michael Kane, John Lovitz, Hart Bochner, Jay O. Sanders, René Rousseau and Courtney Cox participate in the trip. <br /> <br /> Mr. Fate, the purest pleasure of escaping with a kiter in the heart. 7/10
