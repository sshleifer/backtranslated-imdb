The Cinderella story is one of my favorite works of Charles Perrault with Sleeping Beauty, which was also filmed in the Disney film in 1959; This film is a cute, seductive masterpiece from Disney. <br /> <br /> The film has an excellent soundtrack; this is what i like in the movie, this is a very good soundtrack, and i also love songs; my favorite romantic song is "So this is love." I also love mice from the movie, they are cute. My favorite scene is the scene after the story, little birds trying to wake Cinderella in the morning; I also like it when Cinderella's animal friends (mice and birds) clean up Cinderella's mother's dress so she can go to the ball ... until Dreamella and Anastasia tear it to pieces, damn it!
