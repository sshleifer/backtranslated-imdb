I made this film at IFC, and I liked it, although I felt that the editing work was a bit rough, although it may have been intentional. At first it was a bit difficult for me to understand what was happening, because they seemed to be going to present a little non-linear plot in the style of “Pulp Fiction”. Although it seemed a bit forced. I, of course, think that the film is worth seeing, but I think it could be a little clear. Some scenes just don't make sense after others. <br /> <br /> I am surprised to see such a low rating here. This is not outstanding, but he has no really serious problems. I gave him 7/10. The film showed, at least, that Lawrence Fishburne can act when he wants. They must have just told him not to star in the films The Matrix.
