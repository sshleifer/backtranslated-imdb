I watch them all. <br /> <br /> This is no better than amazing (_Strictly Ballroom_, _Would we go dancing? _ (Japanese version), but it is quite respectable and pleasantly different in parts. <br /> <br /> I am a teacher English, and some of these reviews consider me ignorant about the language. For example, “the name should scream, not look. How does it move.” Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? "<br /> <br / > There is nothing wrong with the grammar of Caribbean English. It is not Canadian standard English grammar. I think that I don’t like comments about the dialogue. I don subtitles, because I am Canadian standard English speaker, so I just AUTOMATICALLY assumed that I would have problems understanding all of this. It wasn’t that difficult and it gave a different the flavor, as the other step-by-step films I saw were so American. I liked that this film was shot in Toronto, and, in fact, I would like it to be even more clear. loved that the heroine was so atypically abandoned. I enjoyed step by step procedures. I liked the manageable character of mom. I felt that many of the issues in the film were considered more subtly than is typical for dance films. <br /> <br /> In general, if you like dance films, then this is a decent question. If you have problems with the superiority of the grammar of the English standard on which you grew up, you may have difficulty watching this movie.
