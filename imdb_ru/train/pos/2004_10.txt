I admit that I am a vampire addict: I have seen so many vampire films, I lost count, and this film is definitely in the top ten. I was very impressed with the original vampires of John Carpenter, and when I discovered the sequel, I went straight out and bought it. This film does not follow the same rules as the first one, and it is not so dark, but it is close enough, and I felt that it was beautifully built on the original. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss: his performance was pleasant and yet difficult enough for the viewer to believe that he really could survive in the world in which he lives. One of my favorite parts was right after he met Zoe and wandered into the diner bathroom to see if she was more than she thought. His comments are beautifully unbalanced and at the same time extremely practical, which contrasts well with the rest of the scene when it unfolds. <br /> <br /> Other actors were also well chosen, and they intertwined beautifully to create an interesting and original film. This is not just a rehash of the first film, and it grew just like Fright Night II grew from Fright Night. There are various elements that make it a new movie with a similar theme. <br /> <br /> If you like movies about vampires, I would recommend this one. If you prefer your films to be less bloody, choose something else.
