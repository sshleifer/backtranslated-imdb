Just to mention one more thing about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the assessments that make this one of Errol Flynnâ€™s greatest performances in the career of great travelers. I think that this role of boxer Jim Corbett looks more like his real identity than the hooligans he played in. Flynn seemed like the beast of a party from his memoirs and was one guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen version. Another thing I wanted to draw attention to is to notice the magnificent montages, transitions and inserts that underline the film. Although the director was Raoul Walsh, a frequent contributor to Flynn and cinematographer Sid Hickox, the editing was done by a preparing editor named Don Siegel. I never knew that Siegel had gone so far back, but he is listed. He would continue his great career as a director himself.
