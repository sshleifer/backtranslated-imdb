when Eddie Murphy gets up, the woman from the hall shouts to Eddie, and the man from the hall answers. what is said, women, DO MR ROB (this is a character from a Saturday evening live), a man replies "CLOSE A BITCH." unlike the previous post, which said that women shouted "awkwardly", this is wrong, although the poster said that it was there, they should have a problem with hearing! Although the poster says that it is impossible to listen to it on a DVD, listen carefully to how you can actually hear it on a DVD - DO MR ROB !!!! I hope this helps any curious of the explosion welcomes gas !!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!
