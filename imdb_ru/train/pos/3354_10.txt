This film is finally released on DVD in Italy (fully restored). I have seen this film so many times, and I consider it even relevant these days (2003), when Italy again suffers from a kind of brainwashing dictatorship (or the United States in this regard). I am glad that there are such outcasts like the one that Mastroianni played in this film, who can sing out of tune; maybe they can teach Sophie Lawrence of this world how to be strong and fight to be recognized people. <br /> <br /> Back to the film: as most people have mentioned, the acting is wonderful, but the sound background is amazing. I must assume that, unfortunately, something is lost if you do not understand Italian, but I can assure you that a demonstration of Machism, a distortion of reality in this omnipresent radio chronicle of Hitler's visit to Rome can really make you tremble! <br /> <br /> Masterpiece! <br /> <br />
