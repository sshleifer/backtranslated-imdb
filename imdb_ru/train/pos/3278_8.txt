This is a beautifully written and well-played psychological drama. This is not really a horror movie, so those who are looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. What really surprised me in this film was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail of the plot, as well as the efforts made to ensure internal consistency. I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil's psychowski or New Age revisionism. Instead of promoting the agenda, the filmmakers simply told the story, told it well and allowed the viewer to think about it. Rare dreams resembled Wyatt's paintings and were remarkably effective. <br /> <br /> A great example of how to make a good film with a small budget, without big studios, star actors, famous directors (it was much better than many Hitchcock films), special effects or "smart plot twist.
