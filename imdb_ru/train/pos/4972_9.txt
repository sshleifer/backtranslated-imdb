LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first film I watched in 2000, and I doubt that I will see the best film this year. This beautiful tragicomedy of the Belgian director Benoit Mariage is located in the industrial wastelands of Wallonia. Benoit Poelvorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car for him (“Lada”). For this, the son must break the record of opening doors. That the father really wants his son to be someone, because he himself never did it further, as a local news reporter for the newspaper, ironically called L'Espoir (Hope). Of course, nothing works as planned. This film can best be compared to Aki Kaurismäki's DRIFT CLOUD, although it is more dramatic and humor is darker. However, as in this film, the tone is more melancholic than depressive and ultimately upbeat, but unrealistically happy. Humor is absurd, without making the plot incredible, and Mariaj finds stunning images in gloomy conditions that never seem artificial. The best thing in LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the acting skills of Poelvoorde. This actor achieved fame thanks also to the brilliant cult classic C'EST ARRIVÉ PRÈS DE CHEZ VOUS, in which he played the charismatic killer Ben. Since then, he has played only two small roles in films that were not released in the Netherlands, because, as he said in an interview, he was not convinced of his own acting skills, and all the roles that were offered to him were repressions of Ben . With his return to the leading role in the LCA, there should be no doubt about his playing. He’s just great as a man, so stupid and angry that he can hurt his family, but smart enough to understand what he did and get upset about it. Must see.
