World's Finest is a unique project. This is a trailer for the Superman / Batman crossover movie that does not exist and will never exist, at least not in this form, with these characters, actors, and storyline. <br /> <br /> So the movie is one big tease, even more than standard everyday real movie trailers. The trailer will promote you all in vain. In this regard, I really did not like this short project. When you watch this trailer, it makes you feel hunger and excitement and at the same time sad - and maybe you even then feel deceived when it turns out that the full-length film of this trailer will never exist at all. In some ways, you wonder why this project was done in the first place. Of course, to demonstrate Sandy Collor's skills, but he couldn't do it with a real short film, like his earlier film Batman: Dead End. <br /> <br /> But when you have to judge this short purely whatever it is, so from a technical point of view it is really great. He looks great and much more professional than you might initially expect, although people who have already seen “Batman: Dead End” will already know better than they would expect short ones with cardboard sets, cheap home costumes and rate actors. A short film does not always look impressive, and, obviously, the budget was not too high, but for the most part it is very impressive and professional, with beautiful costumes, decorations, special effects, cinematography and lighting. <br /> <br /> Short has a very good and typical trailer assembly, and perhaps too many posing frames are too full, but this is justified, but hey, this is well suited for the trailer style. He has a few impressive shots, but there are a few unsuccessful, mostly Superman flight sequences. It was obvious that the guy was just standing by a moving car with a camera aimed at him at an angle down. I even thought it was a rather ridiculous thing. But truly better and more exciting moments really make up for it. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn seemed like a pretty good Superman / Clark Kent, although he is obviously not the most talented actor. Clark Bartram reiterates his role as Batman again, and Kurt Carly looked amazing Lex Luthor. The rest of the cast also did a pretty good job. <br /> <br /> It is especially interesting to watch this short film after the recent new modern interpretations of the two main superheroes of this film, in the films “Batman Begins” and “The Return of Superman”. It is interesting to compare the style and character of the characters in these films with this. In fact, it’s amazing and funny to hear Kurt Carly sound like Kevin Spacey, the actor who played Lex Luthor in Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> This is a good-looking, well-made and designed trailer that, however, will make you want more, even if you know that there will be no more. What happened to the plans of Waner Bros., by the way, about the creation of the feature film “Superman / Batman”? I thought that the development of events had already begun a couple of years ago, but since then nothing has been heard about him. Instead, two new separate films about Batman and Superman were made; "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns." <br /> <br /> 7/10
