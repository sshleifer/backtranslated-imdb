I bought it some time ago, but for some reason I forgot to watch it until last night. I like Juliette Lewis, although I am indifferent to Brad Pitt. After this viewing, I have to admit that he is an absolutely wonderful actor - his character was quite plausible, and I did not think at all that "Brad Pitt". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can't say the same for David Duchovny. I'm a X-Files fan, and I had to look twice to confirm the date of this film, because I thought it was done several years later. I like Duchovny, but he found his character a little two-dimensional, except when he makes off-screen text. This part was strong, it seemed characteristic, good intonation, etc. Otherwise, I continued to think "Agent Mulder", which is a great pity. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes was a treat. Why did I not notice her before? (I will look up to see what other roles she has played, and see them as soon as possible). I'm a little concerned about the stereotypes about Lewis, this film and “Natural Born Killers” (the favorite company). Although it is interesting to see the contrast of the characters - in the NSC, she is a voluntary accomplice, whereas here she can not tolerate violence and tries hard not to recognize the dark side of the Early One, until she stumbles upon her face. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie almost unconditionally. Except that Duchovny’s character did not seem to be fully formed (and, perhaps, somewhat “washed out” by Pitt’s character), he was perfect. I was also pleased with the ending - glad that innocent heroes did not die, but they had to suffer first. It was realistic, intense, anxious. <br /> <br /> If you like the NBK, you might like this movie, and vice versa.
