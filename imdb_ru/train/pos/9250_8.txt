Clark Gable plays a crook who breaks into the life of a hard-boiled lady Jean Harlow. He tries to suck her while she shrugs off her hard attitude. Despite their cynicism and minuses, they fall in love. When Geybl accidentally kills a man during a bite, he runs out, leaving the faithful Harlow in the women's prison, where she discovers that she is pregnant. The letter of Anita Loos and Howard Emmett Rogers is excellent throughout with many well-drawn and amazing characters (including the imprisoned Jewish socialist and the imprisoned black woman and her father-preacher, playing with little or no stereotype). Gable and Harlow demonstrate their character as actors, adding to their characters nuances and quirks that go beyond the typical roles of Gable and Harlow. And the direction is much better than you expect from Sam Wood. In one beautiful picture, Harlow is imprisoned and then led into a surprisingly snowy yard when the camera tracks her. This is one of the best genres of "criminals in love" and "women's prison", and it presents some of the best hard-boiled dialogues ever written.
