This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of the classic novel I know. The representation of the court of the Chancellery as a “character” in the drama is magnificent. The game is amazing, from the sinister Tulkinghorn to Dedlock, Shallow Seaweed, Crook, Miss Flyte and two young lovers. But it is the spider web of coincidences that unites all this, and the cinematography is magnificent. What mistake did the BBC make regarding copyright, which meant that this version could not be seen in the UK either on video or on DVD for many years? I tried to find out from them, but I ran into a stone wall. In the end I got a copy of a DVD from Canada.
