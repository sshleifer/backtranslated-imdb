I think this movie is great. there are many reasons why, but these are some of them 1) good game of Tom and Tyler 2) brilliant machine-gun scene that was part of the brilliance 3) I thought the final was a good turn because I never expected that in the end all services to Sam Mendez. Like these 3 points, the shape of the film is also good. I am in college and we studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films I have seen in many years. I just wanted to say a big thank you to all the people involved in making this film. Finally, I would like to say that the best scene in the film is a machine-gun scene where John Rooney kills, it's just pure brilliance in shooting the scene in silence, until John Rooney says, “I'm glad it's you,” it's much better I think so, because the viewer creates his own sound, and this sound is completely different for each viewer, just great. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading this comment, written by Ross Kirk at the age of 16.
