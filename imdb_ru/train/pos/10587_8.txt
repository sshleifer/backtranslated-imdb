This film is not a slok, despite the fact that he was a producer and his relationship with Troma. Dark fable for adults. Exploitation is the subject of Sugar Cookies, and everyone wonders if the cast has not thrown the victim at the said subject. A strange film with attractive visual effects: shadows and contrast are noticeable. Definitely worth a look, especially from Warhol fans and stylish decadence. Despite all the cruelty and viciousness, morality, although distorted, can gleam.
