I lived in those days, and I think that the program fell into the heart of an era. I do think it should have dealt with a lot of the African American problem, but I think it covers a lot in the program. It was scary to sit and watch the riots on TV, hoping that they would not get to your familyâ€™s home and not burn. I thought Jerry O'Connell did a great job portraying the vet returning from the war. I went to school with the guys who came back. Some have changed more than others, and some not so much. It bothers me when someone comments that the problem is not sufficiently illuminated or not interesting enough. Live through it and then comment. I thought the movie was great and everyone did a great job in it. Thanks for the ride (sad and good) down memory lane.
