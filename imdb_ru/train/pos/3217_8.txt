Kurt Russell is so believable, and the action is so unceasing that after that you need to think about it in order to understand that there are important topics concerning honesty and kindness [overcoming Stranger fear, learning to rise above early preparation, a force that loves friendship can bring and etc.] into the storyline. It happens so rarely for a “guy with militants” that even I [who thinks that most of the A / A is a cruel dad], liked the movie, and I recommended it to every friend I know. because rightly it had to be one of the biggest box office hits in the action-adventure genre - it has something for everyone, without straining credulity and not losing almost unceasing moments of action. I am afraid that the answer will not be a hit, is that adults did not go to see it. Anyone less than 20 years old may have not only seen more violent actions in their video games, but probably either would not catch the multi-layered, multi-dimensional beauty, or would not care about it. This film can transform anyone who avoids A / A as mindless violence. If a guy takes his lady [or rents her, or sees her in the list of telegrams] to watch this film, he is much more likely to force her to go with him to other militants.
