Great Caruso demonstrates the unique talents of Mario Lanza. He shows excellent acting ability and is in great shape as a lyric singer paired with Dorothy Kirsten, soprano Metropolitan Opera. In fact, I dare say that he performs some songs better than Caruso (see A'Vuchella from Tosti and La Danza from Rossini). MGMâ€™s art and music departments also did a good job. This film could be perfect if it were not for Ann Blyth's embarrassing presence; we see that she tries her best, dressed in the style of the fifties in scenes shortly before 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserves a better leading lady, and Blyth must adhere to less demanding productions. Also note that Ms. Kirsten sings most of the film's film duets with Lanze, giving the wrong impression that Caruso had a kind of permanent lead soprano.
