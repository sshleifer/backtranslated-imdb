This film is one of those who have a deafening acquaintance with it. This is a down-to-earth, down-to-earth movie that makes you think ... and smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk will take you on a journey that you will not forget. The soundtrack is beautifully diverse and appropriate; and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air. It certainly deserves recognition of both the film and the actors! Finally, a work of art that is different from the obvious love story and the frequent special affects that can be seen today. I have never left the film with such deep warmth and a sense of thoughtfulness in my heart; it seemed as if someone had just wrapped him in a fluffy fleece blanket. To see this film means to find the real treasure and enjoy it.
