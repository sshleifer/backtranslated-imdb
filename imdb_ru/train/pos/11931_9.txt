It was a first-class film with a first-class cast. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and especially Christopher Lloyed played well in this charming film about real angels helping the Angels baseball team. You never know, it can happen. I liked the role of Lloyd in this. He was fun. The story of how to turn your life around, as the childâ€™s faith in Angels helped turn into an angry, tempered and angry manager Glover to see the best in people. The film was well made, as well as to see the best in people and achieve your dreams. It was funny, charming, touching and sad, everything is very well done. You will like (or love) this. I guarantee. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
