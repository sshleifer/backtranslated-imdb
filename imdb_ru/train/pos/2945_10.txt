I watched this movie several times in the 90s and almost laughed each time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this is something else. He is so funny. Even R.S. The gang will find it funny. It is necessary to look, and even better if you invite guys or girls to drink. Michael Jackson's takeoff is so much like him, if you close your eyes, you believe that he sings. The things he describes are true to life, and you would seriously have to bypass humor if you thought that was not funny. My local video stores no longer provide this video, but I would like to get a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humor. Anyway, highly recommended, I hope you enjoy it.
