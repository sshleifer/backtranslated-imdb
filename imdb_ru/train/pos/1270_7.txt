This film is really mixed. On the one hand, the plot and concept of the film are really good, tense and have some nice plot twists. But again, on the other hand, everything is told very slowly, without style and imperceptibly. However, I think “Just Cause” is above-average thriller simply because of the great cast. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery may not have been in his role. I mean that he is not as believable as the main “hero” and the father of the young daughter (by the way, she is played by the very young Scarlett Johansson) and the husband of Kate Capshaw. I feel that he was just too old for the role to be truly credible. However, Sean Connery is, of course, a great actor, and this is the only reason he can still shoot a film as well as he does. But, of course, he is assisted by a very solid cast, in which actors such as Lawrence Fishburn, Blair Underwood, Ned Beatty, Hope Lange, Lynn Tigpen and Ed Harris participate. All the actors are really good, but some of them are very underused at the same time, which is a real shame and a missed opportunity. Especially Ed Harris is just great as a serial psychopathic killer. He is really frightening and acts great. Usually he does not play this ruthless, frightening role in the movie, so he really surprises with his role in this. Already one of his speeches is more than enough to watch this movie. However, due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too articulate, none of the characters in the film actually work well, because it seems too far away. <br /> <br /> This is really a way of telling stories that kills the entire movie with its wonderful potential. Arne Glimcher directs the film with a little style and keeps the tempo too slow from time to time. Because of this, we, the audience, never participate in the plot or in any of its characters. <br /> <br /> This is actually very bad, because Right Cause has more than enough potential. A wonderful cast and a pleasant story with unexpected turns in which nothing is what it seems. The cast and plot is the only reason why this film is still above-average thriller, which probably will still please the fan of the genre. However, the eternal shame is that the film lacks history and style, otherwise this film could become a real classic in its genre. <br /> <br /> 7/10
