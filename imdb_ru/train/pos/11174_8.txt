Probably the most accurate adaptation of Stephen King. Not surprising, since King himself wrote the script. The story tells how the Creed family moves to a beautiful home in Maine. One of the other residents is Jude, a pleasant old man who knows something about the area. One of them is the highway that runs right through their front yard. Another path leads to a pet graveyard where children have buried animals killed on the highway for decades. Soon the cat Ellie Creed, Church, was found dead. Fortunately, this happens when the family, with the exception of Louis (father), leaves for Thanksgiving. Jude takes Louis to another burial site, behind the Pet Cemetery, where the Church should be buried. Later, Louis welcomes (not so politely) the church. He returned, apparently chewing the way out of the bag in which he was buried. Perhaps he was buried alive. Probably no. I can say nothing more without destroying history. <br /> <br /> Of all the King’s adaptations I’ve seen, this would be the most terrible. The characters are real, and the situations are normal. Mary Lambert does an excellent job. Suspension is maintained fairly high throughout the entire film, in part due to the development of the plot. The scene where Gage is killed will forever remain in your memory. Then, of course, we have a conclusion. It is easy to determine what will happen, but Lambert makes some really scary and sometimes alarming moments. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good movie and a great adaptation. If you like being scared and don't mind being harassed by some sometimes disturbing images, then “Pet Sematary” is what you need. Not horror fans will want to avoid this.
