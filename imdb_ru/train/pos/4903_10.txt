This film, inspired by at least a small number of Ivy Benson & Her All Girls Orchestra, who performed during the war years at Covent Garden Opera House, talks about an elderly saxophonist trying to reform (almost) the entire female band she played with as Schoolgirl near the end of the Second World War. Too brief memories of the original band on the stage bring us wonderful music and help the band members fill the background, and in particular the relationships of the girls with the single male member - their transvestite drummer (who tries to dodge the call). <br /> <br /> Ian Holm (“The Lord of the Rings”, “Cromwell and Fairfax”) and Judi Dench act in superb leading roles as the recently widowed Elizabeth, and the cunning, feminine Patrick, the drummer. The late Joan Sims is perfect as the leader of the group now playing the piano by the sea, and June Whitfield shines as the trombonist of the Salvation Army. Other greats, such as Cleo Lane, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis, and Billy Whitelaw, make cameo comebacks that make it unforgettable. The film is a noisy memory lane, with a starry composition of what should, in all rights, be a group of supermountain actresses. All I can say is, I hope I look just as good at their age! Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox at the age of 69. She, of course, still keeps my pulse! While I was watching him, I mentally scolded the director for not using women of the appropriate age. After that, I looked at these girls and found that each of them is old enough to perform in London in 1944 (although this may seem like a stretch to Judi Dench). <br /> <br /> If you like swing bands, they succeed in nostalgia or just want to see how well a woman can look from three quarters of a century behind, don't miss this movie. <br /> <br />
