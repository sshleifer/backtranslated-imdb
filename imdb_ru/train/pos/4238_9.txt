At first glance, this postwar romantic comedy is above average. Under plywood, this is the funniest acting trick for MGM characters. <br /> <br /> Leads straightforwardly, but all the minor characters play against the type. Margaret Hamilton (aka The Wicked Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (a professional obsessive-compulsive squirrel) and Sig Ruman (Nemesis of the Marx Brothers in “Nights in Casablanca” and always a wonderful “Night at the Opera”), playing Willful Gang trying to combine two roles , instead of separating them, as their "ordinary" characters would. <br /> <br /> This also makes fun of many of the conventions of the romantic comedy, which is another indication that it can be not so much a “direct” romantic comedy, as a screaming message from many post-war romantic comedies and their two-dimensional, characteristic characters. <br /> <br /> I only saw this once, intermittently, so I can't be sure, but this film may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time in which it was made, but less successful. Now, when viewers “see” these minor characters through a completely different lens. I guess this is the case when I give him 9 stars. I thought it was hysterical.
