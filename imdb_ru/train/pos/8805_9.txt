A quilt about 911. 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (for example, first), sometimes they say to Americans: "We had more deaths than you, and you supported killers" sometimes very strangely (but symbolic and interesting). I really liked Claude Lelouch (the couple’s personal life in New York, showing that our everyday “problems” are not important), Shoi Imamura (strangely, strongly opposed to the war in general) and Idriss Ouedray (ridiculously Typical African optimism, despite the terrible daily suffering), and Yusef Chein (an Egyptian intellectual who advocates peace and is having moral difficulties in adopting US policies toward Arab countries). I am very pleased to see that many Americans like this film. This shows that we (or they? I'm still Belgian, but living in Texas for 12 years) are still interested in other cultures and are able to question the past and present actions of our government, as we should in a democracy.
