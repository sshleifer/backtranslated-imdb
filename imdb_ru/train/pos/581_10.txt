The river flows This is one of those films that deserves to be seen in the theater in order to appreciate the greatness of its cinema. The game is wonderful and understated, with every gesture and smile and bow that makes sense. Brad Pitt plays brilliantly, and Tom Skerrit is powerful as the father of a preacher. The film moves like a river, you have to be ready to follow it through the ebb and flow, but it's worth it.
