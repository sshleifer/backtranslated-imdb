I was very touched by the story, and because I am experiencing something similar with my parents, I am really connected. It is so easy to forget that someone whose body is falling apart was once energetic and passionate. And then there are mistakes that they have made and with which they have to live. I liked the performance of Ellen Burstyn, and who is Christina Horn? She is great! A real find. There is probably the most erotic scene I've ever seen in a movie, but nothing was shown - it was so beautifully made. The overall appearance of the film was a stunning, truly emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very good in this picture, he humanizes the man coming down. I liked the director's approach to the life of this woman, never sentimental, never too big - enough to hook us, but not enough to get bogged down.
