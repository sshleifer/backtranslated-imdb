If there ever was an inspiring story that could have prompted anyone, disabled or not, to continue to do so, no matter what, (even if “doing it” as an expression, in fact, can have a wide place that ultimately is personal truth) MY LEFT LEG is. Sometimes they watch a heavy film: they see how less calm aspects of Christie Brown's personality appear in two key scenes - one when his sister announces that she is pregnant and is about to marry while her father has a bad reaction and at dinner. The table, when the woman who approached him, gave him the opportunity to communicate effectively, now announced at a key moment (Brown's inauguration) that she was going to marry another man - tough. Very, very hard. Moreover, this is a person who cannot respond to these events accordingly and can express himself only in a way that he knows how: through shouts, yelling and profanity aimed at hurting himself. However, this is not a story of mental pain and family dysfunction, even if there is a lot of it, giving an autobiographical report, but a story about a person overcoming his serious disability, becoming an active person and a force to be reckoned with in the world of art. Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his powerful, unforgettable performance as flawed, but tenacious Christie Brown, and Fricker Brand did so, and for her minor role as Brown's solid mother.
