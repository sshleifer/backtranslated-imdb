Along with the “King of the rocket men,” it was still repeated on BBC TV in the early and mid-eighties. If I downloaded the time capsule of this period, both of these series would probably fall into it. <br /> <br /> Someone who watches her for the first time will think that this is stupid, but this is one of the best examples of “serials.” Don Del Oro will make you laugh (When I was little, my nickname for him was Mr. Dastbin’s head), and it was funny when he was shot, he says, “Your bullets can't hurt me,” then he stumbles back, seemed to be less than happy. I also like the way he treats Sebastian the first episode. <br /> <br /> I watched it again because I had good memories of it many years ago, there are good tricks and good music, there are ingredients in it. you expect, including water, rockfalls, runaway carts ... Besides the first episode (with Ralph Faulkner), the sword playing was not as good as I remembered, and yes , it has an inevitable episode of “memories"! It gets 8 out of 10 because it still suffers from slow tempo, indents and other tricks. If you are interested in these series, I recommend William Whitney's book "At the door, into the battle, at the door , in pursuit, ”although there is only a small record about this series.
