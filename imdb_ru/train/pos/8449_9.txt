I became a fan of Murder: Life on the Street at the end of the show, but very quickly became a fan. It was a police show, unlike any other: visually different in the use of hand-held cameras, taking the viewer everywhere, with its multinational and multinational composition and their volatile and exciting personalities, and that covered all the good and bad police administration, including corruption and personal collisions that surface. <br /> <br /> Murder: the film, the continuation of the reunion of the series, is as good as the film can be made for television. After Lt. Jardello (Japhet Cotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, was shot dead, the crew members returned to help find the killer. In addition, the actors who left the group, and those who died, also manage to take their place in the film. The intensity and fire that marked the series return, and the script is replete with the same fire as the series. In general, a terrific television movie. <br /> <br /> Vote: 9
