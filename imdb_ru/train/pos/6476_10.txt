A number of posters commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion. This is always a problem with long, complex dramas. Crime is essentially trivial, so the returns are always anti-climatic, while a detailed presentation distracts from the human drama. The author used several ingenious tricks to try to get around this, but was not completely successful. The answers are exactly what happened and why it might have been delivered, but if so, they are well buried. The viewer inevitably feels a little cheated. <br /> <br /> But in a sense it doesn't matter. The drama has never been about crime or even investigation, but about the impact of events on the lives of those who were involved; family, investigators, witnesses, the press. And as such it was exciting. The letter was a significant reduction compared to showing the mill for prime time drama, and the performances are equally good. In the ensemble's work it is indecent to focus on individuals, but Penelope Wilton deserves special mention of the extraordinary power in the role of mother-wife-daughter, and Janet Maktir was in excellent shape, like a stubborn old cop. <Br /> <br /> One of the most interesting aspects of the drama is controlling the race, like an elephant in a room that no one is willing to mention. Thin, powerful things.
