I think I really love this movie. Prix ​​de Beaute was originally a silent film, but was later renamed French in 1930. Despite the fact that someone’s voice was re-recorded over hers, this is still a stunning tour of strength for Louis Brooks. The fact that her singing voice is duplicated by the legendary Edith Piaf helps soften us, purists, with a deceptive deception. <br /> <br /> This is Lulu's story, and we see her at the resort for the first time with her boyfriend Andre (Georges Charlia) and their friend Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the frame as a pair of legs: we see her inside the car, changing into a bathing suit. Lulu is very free to demonstrate his body, and this does not suit the tiresome Andre. When Lulu is considering applying for the title of Miss Europe, we know that a happy ending will not sit at the end of Easy Street. <br /> <br /> In the film a lot of attention is paid to men who look at beautiful women. We see a lot of bathing beauties and the reaction of men looking at them. But in the center of all this is gorgeous Louise Brooks. <br /> <br /> If you don’t mind watching movies from past eras, consider this option. Louise Brooks is not the name that most ordinary movie lovers can easily recognize, but once you see it, you will be mesmerized and want to learn more. Also check it out in Pandora’s Box if you can find it. <br /> <br /> Be careful with the release of the Kino DVD for USA. I do not know if they have the correct projection speed. Many scenes seem to be showing too fast. Perhaps that's how they were shot. I dont know. But since this is the only way to watch this movie, it is worth swallowing one small bitter pill.
