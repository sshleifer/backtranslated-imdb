If your idea of ​​a thriller is car chases, explosions and dozens of people who are killed by shooting, then “House of Games” is definitely not for you. If you love and appreciate the psychological drama and uncertainty, then by all means look at it. <br /> <br /> “The House of Games” tells the story of the respected psychologist and writer Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who is trying to help the patient and gets involved in the dark world of scam artists led by the charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna). Saying anything else about the plot would ruin the wait. Honestly, I find it hard to believe anyone who says that he has seen approaching corners. Like a smart con artist, this film draws you to its web and puts your vigilance to sleep. <br /> <br /> The story is tight and thoughtful, the dialogue is intelligent and concise, the acting is equally good (Mantegna is superbly charismatic). Some complained that Dr. Ford was not a very responsive character, and wondered why Mamet made Lindsay Crows look so physically unattractive. But Dr. Ford must be cold and aloof; Moreover, her home comfort is important for the plot (at some point, I believe that the trauma of her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation ... I will not say more). <br /> <br /> “The House of Games” is a gloomy look at the reverse side of human nature, consisting in awkward ambiguity. He will hold your attention every second while you look, and will stay with you for a long time.
