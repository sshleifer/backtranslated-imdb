As the one-line summary reads, two films left me with this remark when I left the theater. One of them was “Excitement Echo” with Kevin Bacon, and the second was “Vanilla Sky”. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films in which you sit deep in a theater chair and stop thinking about someone around you stop wondering how the film will end, and just leave the film fast where he wants .. Leaving the cinema was a bit strange, like the feeling that you have when you are sick and you can not think about anything. One of those films in which you become one with the guy and feel that nothing is moving around you except for the things in the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain. The actors are awesome, the soundtrack is great and everything in the movie is 9+. <br /> <br /> Of course, one of the best films I've ever seen, and the movie that made the best and most shocking awakening about my life and my goal in this world.
