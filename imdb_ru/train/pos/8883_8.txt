The design of the film seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the main problems in this country (USA). We see relationships everywhere in the university setting for the film. As expected, the obvious from the student against. the teacher is present. But what the film adds to its value is its other relationship: man versus. female, white against black, and personality against. society. But the most important and in direct connection with all other relationships is the person against. myself. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at how the director’s two-sided viewpoint was on demonstrating race relations on campus. Most films tend to show the injustice of one side, showing the suffering of the other. This film showed the injustice and suffering of both parties. He did not try to show how it was right, although I would say that the scalp was shown much more cruel and vindictive (quite obvious at the end). The film also talks about sex and rape. Ironically, this injustice in some way brings the two races together for a while. Laurence Fishburn as the astute Profesor Phipps makes an incredible game. He destroys the idea of ​​a race of favoritism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and repressed with a hard-working and positive. Other stars that make this film are Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport gives a superb image of bewildered youth with inappropriate anger who seeks acceptance. Tyra Banks makes his film debut and proves that supermodels can act. <br /> <br /> Higher Learning got its name by showing college as something more than attending classes and getting a piece of paper. In fact, I would say that the film is almost a satire, showing the interaction of students with each other, and not some kind of dry book, like a real education at a university. It is a learning process of life, not a textual one. I think you will find that “Higher Education” refers to important issues in many universities and even to life in general. 8/10
