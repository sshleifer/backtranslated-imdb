“Cypher” directed by Vincenzo Natali is a complex and creative thriller, which, although it requires some suspension of faith and great concentration of attention, can be a very interesting experience. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), caretaker - husband of husband with powerful wife decides to add some spices to his worldly existence, taking a job as an industrial spy in high-tech company Digi Corp. His job is to travel to conferences throughout the country (according to Jack Terby’s alleged identity) and secretly conveyed speeches given to his bosses using an elegant little electronic pen-gizmo. <br /> <br /> In reality, however, these speeches are just a cover for much more vile actions. Morgan and his conference colleagues are brainwashed. Drinking water, which they drink, puts them in a temporary coma, during which they are told to forget about the past and forever accept new personalities. As soon as they are fully convinced that they are someone else, they are ordered to apply for a job in competing companies where they can engage in corporate espionage without suspicion. <br /> <br /> But the plans of Digi Corp are the intervention of the shadow operational hired Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), which opens Morgan’s eyes to what is really happening. She gives Morgan an antidote to mind-altering drugs so that he can resist brainwashing techniques. She also warns him that if Digi Corp suspects that he does not quite believe that he is Jack Terby, he will be "eliminated." Morgan plays along and claims to work in the rival Sunways business. <br /> <br /> However, having arrived at his new workplace, he passes a lie detector test and immediately rumbles like a spy. Fortunately, Sunways bosses see this as an ideal opportunity to transmit false data to Digi Corp, and Morgan becomes a double agent. <br /> <br /> From now on, things are getting harder; the plot unfolds and poor old Morgan is unable to trust anyone. In the exciting finale, everything eventually becomes clear (but only if you follow the events very carefully). <br /> <br /> Directed by Natalie confidently does business and, of course, has an excellent opportunity to make a cool film for a relatively low budget. He manages to get some great performances from his talented cast; Jeremy Northham, in particular, is fantastic - his image was originally a little nervous Morgan played to perfection. <br /> <br /> Cypher is another fascinating film from a director who is willing to take a chance, and I look forward to his upcoming projects, High Rise and Necropolis.
