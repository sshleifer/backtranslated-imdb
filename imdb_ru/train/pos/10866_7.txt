Johnny's “Elections”, that is, great music for opening credits, as well as good design of initial titles, a kaleidoscope of Chinese characters and those Asian mafiosi solemnly taking an oath or pronouncing some sacred things; actually the whole movie is well rated. I learned about “To” from Bishop Seraphim Siegrist and really wanted to watch the film “To”. The one I started, ELECTIONS, is exciting and interesting, and only moderately violent by modern standards — moderately and also essentially violent; The story of the Asian godfather's intrigue, which uses a puzzle game with elements, cruel facts from the lives of gangsters, race for the scepter, truthful details, and, as in the case of Coppola, we must assume that some of the morally charming gangsters are entitled and beautiful and nice. The performances are quite funny and colorful. <br /> <br /> ELECTIONS are well done in a pleasant, somewhat sloppy style of the Hong Kong fare; the end is bitter, true, straight and will frighten children.
