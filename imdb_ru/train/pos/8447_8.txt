In truth, this is not really a “film,” but an extended final episode; By this I mean that if you did NOT follow the show (“Murder: Life on the Street”), I suspect that it will not be easy for you to watch this movie for television. Having said this, "Murder: the movie" is still a great watch. I think it says a lot about the television production, which EVERY single cast will return, many years after the absence, to re-portray their characters and complete an incredible program. The film reveals this feeling of “family” not only among the characters, but also among the actors. It’s very sad to know that this will be the LAST time when we will see them all together again called HOMICIDE. According to the plot, I found this film somewhat lacking. The candidacy of Mayor Jardello seems particularly contrived, and I felt that his shooting could be considered in the framework of his regular lieutenant position. In addition, Det. The extraordinary twist of the story of Bayliss, who was left hanging at the end of the series, was finally resolved, but I, for example, NEVER felt that this was necessary; I liked to remain with the riddle (let's remember that the first case of the very first episode also remained unresolved for the entire series!). As a loyal fan of the series, I can love this film and the fact that it was shot even after H: LOTS was canceled, but I would not recommend it to anyone who has not had the slightest impact on the series. Now, if they just release it on DVD ...
