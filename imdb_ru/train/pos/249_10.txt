I have seen the trailer for this movie several times, and I must say that Ned Kelly looks like it will be a great movie. When I first saw the trailer, I could not take my eyes off of him (he certainly caught my attention). Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him, historical plays. Not to mention Orlando Blume, who is seen fantastically for a split second. I think this film will be a hit, and many of my people will see it again and again.
