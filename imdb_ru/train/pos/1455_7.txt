Mardi Gras: Made in China is a great film that shows how the two cultures have much in common, but they donâ€™t even realize how much influence each society has on each other. David Redmon will open your eyes and let you see how workers in China produce beads that cost almost nothing and sell in America for up to $ 20. When Redmon asked Americans about the origin of these beads, they had no idea and seemed stupid. When he told them that they were made in China for less than nothing with terrible pay and unacceptable working conditions, the Americans seemed sad, offended and repentant, but in fact they did not seem to stop buying beads after When Redmon interrogated workers in China, they did not know that Americans wear them over their necks and pay so much for these beads. The workers laughed at the goal behind the beads and could not believe it. This film is a great film that gives us the opportunity to think about other countries besides ours. <br /> <br /> M. Pitts
