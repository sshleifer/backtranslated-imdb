All good films "inspire" some right on the video. I was afraid that “Gladiator” was not a really good film, because I had not seen a single film in which there was something that would remotely resemble something Roman, on the shelf of new releases for several months. Then I noticed the last sentence of the Full Moon, Demonic. I'm a fan of the Full Moon's Puppetmaster and Blood Dolls series, but have never seen any of their non-killer puppet films. In any case ... <br /> <br /> Demonicus chronicles what happens to a group of tourists in the Alps mountains. One of the campers, James, finds a cave with old gladiator artifacts and feels compelled to remove the helmet from the corpse and try it on. He becomes obsessed and, like the demonic gladiator Tyrann, is forced to kill his friends in order to revive the corpse, which is a real Tyrant. <br /> <br /> Of course, as in many films about the Full Moon, this is not enough or not. budget. At times, editing and directing were so amateurish that I swear that I watched the Blair Witches project. Attempts to chop off limbs and heads remind me of Monty Python's parody. The weapon, although it looks real, looks really plastic. It literally looks like it was filmed by a group of friends with a digital video camera over the weekend. Of course, there is nothing wrong with such a film industry, just don’t hand over it in anticipation of a technical masterpiece. It seems that there have been attempts to study the script, because, although Tyrann really does not behave like a gladiator, at least he speaks Latin. <br /> <br /> All aside, I actually liked this movie. Perhaps not so much as a puppet killer film, but Full Moon still delivers! The only thing that disappointed me was that at the end there was no Full Moon video zone!
