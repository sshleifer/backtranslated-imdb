Of course, the plot is not Oldboy. It seems that the only "wonderful" films these days are surprisingly shocking or high-budget / somehow untwisted. <br /> <br /> “Spin Kik” is a drama / comedy about a group of people who have decided to shed their hearts in taekwondo. No matter what you expect from this film, you are guaranteed to be touched by the work, the pain and the expectations that heroes are forced to experience. Although it is sometimes comedic, many moments and characters are reproduced perfectly: there is an old guard who takes things too seriously, the bully turned into a good guy who just wants a second chance in life, a meek substitute team who will die happy if he just won victory once in a lifetime, and many other comprehensive characters have their own problems - but most importantly, their hopes and dreams. Although the plot and goals of the film are simple, these aspects of the film simply emphasize the development of the characters when they overcome their personal and interpersonal struggles. <br /> <br /> In short, this film will make you feel fresh, determined and contented.
