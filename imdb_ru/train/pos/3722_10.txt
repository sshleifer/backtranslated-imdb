First, I saw this film, without knowing anything about it, I just knew that Joel Schumacher did it, and that was enough for me. My friend and I went to watch it at the festival of Danish cinema, which is called the festival of night movies, where many different films are shown during off-hours. The festival largely specializes in showing films that would otherwise not have been shown in Danish cinemas. /> <br /> In any case, my friend and I went to look at it, and we were surprised at how real it seemed, and that it struck our feelings, we really found ourselves involved in the story, unable to understand the final, which is a big plus in our book. <br /> <br /> The film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the Danish initiative "dogma 95", which was launched by 4 Danish directors, including Lars von Trier (Dancer In Darkness). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the film is really worth seeing, it gives a different look at how things are going with the American soldier. It is expected that Joe, after leaving the school, will serve his country in a battle far from home. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell is an exceptional character in this film that I havenâ€™t seen before, but I can't wait to see him. more than him. <br /> <br /> Lars P.
