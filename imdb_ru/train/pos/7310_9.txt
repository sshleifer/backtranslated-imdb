There is no doubt that Halloween is definitely one of the best films in the entire history, not only in its genre, but also beyond. I like creepy movies, like this whole situation that can happen here, this situation makes you wonder. Also imagine if you were in that situation, what would you do. This is a movie that I enjoy watching, especially during Halloween. John Carpenter is a very professional director, I love many of his other films, but there is no doubt that his most famous film is the film “Halloween”. Yes, and if you don’t think about seeing the Rob Zombie remake, it’s not. It's just crap, and a true Halloween fan would have liked the 1978 John Carpenter version. in any movie and this is a very famous movie. So, by all means, look at this masterpiece, you really will like it.
