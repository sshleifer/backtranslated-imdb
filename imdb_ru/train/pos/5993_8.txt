The Cure uses voice-overs to create an intense mood. Although the action explains all the lines of the film, it does not surprisingly distract from the visual history. Using multiple films adds texture to the story. The choice of a combination of black and white and color images worked perfectly to speed up the jumps in time. The end will make you jump, despite the fact that you can foresee the result. I especially liked the thrill of waiting for a movie. Close-ups of the love scene are also beautiful and tasteful. The piece is rather short, but it achieves much. Careful editing really helps to show what a short film is capable of. Worth seeing more than once!
