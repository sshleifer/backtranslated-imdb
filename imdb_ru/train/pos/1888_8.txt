"If I wanted to drip, I would call the nurse." <br /> <br /> "Aren't you tired?" ... "More than enough". <br /> <br /> “You gave me a chu-chu.” <br /> <br /> “If I start to die, take off (cowboy hat) off my head. I don't want to be remembered. ” <br /> <br /> Some of the amazingly funny and often insightful quotes from this charming and often insightful movie. Dudley Moore is charming, attractive and rich. Sir John Gilgud is aristocratic, charming and loving ... and poor. These two have a non-father / father and son relationship that define the person that Arthur should become. Will he follow his heart and soul, or just his wealth? For more than twenty-five years, I returned to this film with joy, joy, and joy. This is a film in which you need to come back again and again and remember what is important in life, no matter how short it is. <br /> <br /> Judge Miller
