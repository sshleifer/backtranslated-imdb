Mating Game is a charming, wonderful film from a past era. Hollywood should consider a charming remake of this film. My wife and I would go see it. <br /> <br /> This is a great romantic comedy that my wife and I watched at AMC. <br /> <br /> In this film, Tony Randall is at his best. Debbie Reynolds is gorgeous as always. <br /> <br /> Loved it. We are planning to order on DVD to add to our growing collection of films. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Hollywood no longer makes such films. <br /> <br /> Hey, Hollywood ... dig out some of these types of scenarios from the old safe, update them a little (without spoiling the original film and script, as you did with other remakes), and cast. <br /> <br /> A remake would be a great success on a silver screen, DVD, and cable / satellite television. <br /> <br /> S.N.
