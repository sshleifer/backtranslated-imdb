Joe Don Baker is one of the few actors who is often better than his material and almost always underestimated. He starred in a ton of films, both as a heavyweight and as a hero, and he had such a strong and solid presence that Wallace Beery made half a century before. Baker can deliver material that will sound ridiculous if it is received from another actor, and this is something that is so cool in it. He seems to mean what he says, no matter how cliche, obvious or stupid, which puts him in an alliance with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. This is what made the WALKING TALL trilogy work so well, and the same magic here in FINAL FAIRNESS. It was a significant hit in movie theaters and on video in the 80s, and he endured much better than many of the possibly more famous militants of that era. By moving the action from Texas to Europe, you get a true timeless quality that does not distract you from the action on the screen. Frankly, I always liked the films of Graydon Clark, who is a mindless director in the same vein as Clint Eastwood of the 1970s, and this is one of his best. FINAL FAIRNESS is one of the lost pearls of the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true zeal and violence. I believe that if they redo it from The Rock, then the new audience will love it as much as I do.
