This is one of those films that I have seen so many times that I can quote most of them. Some lines in this film are simply invincible. I especially like to watch him stumble and fall intoxicated, go to a trendy restaurant drunk and with the elk. <br /> <br /> I don’t know how many times I’ve seen this sequence, but it’s fun every time. From the moment Arthur gets to Susan’s dad’s place to keep up with the elk, you laugh all the time. I remember watching the beats with elks. Everything went just as I imagined. They all laughed so hard that it was difficult for them to take it off. <br /> <br /> The late Sir John Gilgud was a great addition to this. His behavior, his one-liners and the way he treated Arthur were equally fun. It is always a funny moment when he hits his head with a hat or says that he is a spoiled little ____. I laugh every time I listen to “I'm going to take a bath” and the lines that follow.
