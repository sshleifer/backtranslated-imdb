I first watched a movie on the BBC on July 27, 2005. For me it was a good interpretation of Conan Doyle's personality, and I really wonder what Sherlock fans think about this. I also think that this is a film for these fans, regardless of whether or not they agree with what is mentioned. You may ask yourself whether A.S. Doyle is a strong man or he put himself in question. However, he was the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much of this was a kind of semi-biography? Nevertheless, I strongly promote this adaptation, this is a film that you should watch - even if you are not interested in films or books about Sherlock Holmes - watch it, enjoy it and think about it by yourself.
