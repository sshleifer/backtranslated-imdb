Summary: Zandali is a young woman who more and more feels trapped in her marriage with Thierry. Thierry himself struggles with his fatherâ€™s death last year and has gone astray. He plunged into work, put down his letters, and Zandali desperately misses the attraction between them. This includes Johnny and Thierry's old friend, who were once artists in exile together. But Johnny continued to draw, and he had just a day job on renting. He takes the day as he is, and leaves tomorrow for his fate. Between Zandali and Johnny instantly there is a gross attraction, and they enter into a novel. But Zandali struggles with his passion for desire, conscience and love for her husband. But none of them, neither Zandali, nor Johnny, nor Thierry can stop the relationship between them in order to completely get out of control. <br /> <br /> Comments: this is a thriller. But maybe more heart thriller than the usual thriller, where it comes to life and death, and the threat of violence. Not that the thriller of the heart could not accept the fatal proportions, but the threat comes from the other side. And it will not be until the second half in Zandal, until a thriller appears, and although the basis for this is laid in the first half, I cannot really describe the genre as a thriller then. Much more romantic drama than anything else, but with the main currents of other genres. Developmental thriller is, but it also has more than a touch of sensual erotic look. Because this is all that drives the characters and, therefore, the whole story. A wish. Necessity and necessity. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is not bad, certainly much better than his current rating (4.1). It takes time, but he has a good sense of uncertainty, and he copes very well with his erotic part, with taste. It is always an integral part of the story, it is necessary in order to give the story the necessary weight, and I never felt that this was an excuse for showing a naked breast or something like that. But, unfortunately, the culmination of history comes long before the end, and the end itself seems to be a kind of flat, even if in its own way dramatic. <br /> <br /> The cast is impressive, headed by famous actors such as Nicolas Cage and Judge Reinhold. But the show is almost completely stolen by Erica Anderson. Beautiful and very skillful in occasionally playing out subtle feelings of desire, she is superb in that Cage and Reinhold sometimes go overboard and get a little rough. Her career after this is too small for the talent she shows in Zandali, I can only hope that this is because of her own choice. In addition, two small favorites appear in small roles, which give the film an additional advantage: Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano. <br /> <br /> If you are in a good mood, this is a very good movie, he can use the other end to get the credit he really deserves. <br /> <br /> 7/10
