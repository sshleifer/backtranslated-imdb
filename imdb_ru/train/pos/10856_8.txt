British comedies are usually divided into two main types: calm, introspective, usually romantic exploration, and farcical social satire. Settings, characters and concepts differ, but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows in one of two categories. Butterflies, perhaps, the embodiment of the first type. <br /> <br /> The scripts are very verbal, including the long internal monologues of the protagonist Ria, mostly happy but indecisive housewife, curious about what she could miss when she entered a completely ordinary life. When she meets a successful, but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman (who makes his interest in her completely clear), she plays with the idea of ​​finding out what the other way could offer. <br /> <br /> The game of actors and scripts is always on the money, which makes the reaction to the show almost completely personal: I was neither amazed by this nor turned off. My mother, on the other hand, adored this show. I think that the degree to which a person identifies with the Ria dilemma is the most important factor determining a person’s response to butterflies.
