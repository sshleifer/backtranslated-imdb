It's just the best movie ever! Sorry, Hollywood! I saw him in the early 70s, as soon as he appeared on Bulgarian television, and I immediately liked it (I was 14 then). 25 years later I bought it on videotape, and a few months ago he finally appeared on DVD here in Bulgaria. I live with this film for 35 years, like all my friends and my family. My son was a teenager when he saw him for the first time, and he, too, immediately fell in love with him (and this generation that grew, watched almost only Hollywood films and did not speak or understand Russian at all!). What makes this masterpiece of Danelia so special? It's hard to say, because it's hard to describe what beauty is ... But the fact is, you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as you did for the first time. I canâ€™t remember any other such film, no matter how many millions it cost or how great the cast was ... Chapeau, maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
