Diana and I watched this fabulous film today in Fremantle, and we both agreed that from the fake films, he was a cut above the rest. I say this because we were delighted with the short five to ten minute fragments that made up the film, and the fact that this film had a theme around which each part was composed, and, of course, this theme was love during many of its forms. <Br /> <br /> Allegedly, the film was held in various Parisian districts, giving a special flavor to each segment. Having been only a few times in Paris, I was not knowledgeable enough to readily recognize places, but I am sure that Europeans and especially French could easily recognize the location of the city. In any case, the viewer is immediately drawn into each story because of their production superiority, so that these city locations end up in consequence. <br /> <br /> The film is moving fast, and the viewer remains absorbed in one scenario, while the new one is on the screen. The stories themselves are not graphic, like some kind of nonsense of Hollywood nonsense, they are thin and provoking to think and tender, as for most of life without a mass press that hides so much the beauty of life under the nearest pile of manure just to sell or sell. sell ... <br /> <br /> Go with someone you care about and let this magical little film redeem you like a spa treatment, and when you leave, I think you will feel renewed.
