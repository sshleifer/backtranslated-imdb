Perhaps this is not a catchy classic, but it is a touching novel with an important topic that emphasizes the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating consequences for the career and life of any unfortunate person who does not have this vital skill. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Iris, a widow who meets a factory work colleague, an illiterate dining room worker named Stanley. Iris discovers that Stanley is unable to read, and after he loses his job, she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen. Of course, as you could predict, these two, although initially afraid of involvement, develop feelings for each other ... <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda competently plays Iris, a woman with her own problems, coping with work has no prospects two teenage children (one is pregnant), an unemployed sister and her abusive husband. Nevertheless, Robert De Niro, of course, is gorgeous in his enchanting portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate Stanley, bringing dignity to the role of respect. This is not an ordinary charming young couple yuppie, as it is usually portrayed on the screens of novels, but an ordinary middle-aged couple, a middle-aged couple with a rather mundane fight. <br /> <br /> I will not give the ending away, but this is a wonderful, touching novel and personal look at the troubling problem of adult illiteracy, albeit from the point of view of a fictional character.
