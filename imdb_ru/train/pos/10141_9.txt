I was fully prepared for this episode, seeing that this “Master” really doesn’t have horror films under its belt ... but this is by far the best episode of the season. <br /> <br /> The acting was good !! I do not know how he argued, but we have a real talent in this episode! And although you could see events emanating from the story, which is beyond a mile, at least it was interesting and managed to keep me in suspense for the full 56 minutes, which was not enough until this point in the series. <br /> /> I especially liked the bit at the end, not the turn, so to speak, but just a funny piece, where he becomes, as always, a courageous man. <br /> <br /> Really good effort. As I said in other reviews - these are not real masters who make a lot of these episodes ... but they may someday become masters in the future.
