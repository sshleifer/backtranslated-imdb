I understand that this review will amaze me with experienced film critics patrolling this site, but I will defend this film. <br /> <br /> Dentist is a really very good movie. The action is not always top notch, but the thrill is good and the story is good. In addition, you see Linda Hoffman's boobs. Not that I was an expert in this area, but the direction seems good, and the plot makes sense. Corbin is a great creepy dentist. It does for dentists what Jaws do to sharks ... ish. Obviously, he had a fairly limited budget, but they coped well with this as best they could, and they developed characters well (those who thought). <br /> <br /> the end.
