Not many films really used the fear of the dentist that many people have. Those in the profession have some really scary looking tools. Give writers Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon and Charles Finch for extracting the maximum value of “make yourself into a chair” shock out of their premise. <br /> <br /> Corbin Bernsen in a pleasant nuance - Alan Finestone, a dedicated dentist whose train leaves the rails early on. Unbalanced obsessive-compulsive, he begins to think about decomposition, even imagining him where he is not, and also identifying decomposition with the corruption of society as a whole. After seeing how his unfaithful wife Brooke (Linda Hoffman) ties up with their machine-gunner, he decides to punish her. At the same time, he is under pressure from intelligent I.R.S. agent (Earl Bohan, best known as Dr. Silberman from the Terminator franchise) to do a favor in exchange for an agent keeping his mouth shut about Feynston's financial affairs. Feistone begins to perceive everyone around him as discouraged in one way or another, and he begins to kill when police detective Gibbs (always welcome Ken Fory) begins his trail. <br /> <br /> Directed by Brian Yuzna clearly has great pleasure from the script. This takes into account some really nasty and surprisingly spectacular scenes of blood, which not only cause sympathy for the victims, but also excite the public. The script gives the Feinstone character several thin lines of dialogue and, in general, quite cunning and funny, with large doses of completely black humor (for example, Feinstone orders the victim to “remove his tongue from the road!”). Brooke and I.R.S. Agent figure in particularly effective torture scenes. The effects of makeup are pretty good for the most part. And the film does an excellent job of maintaining its forward momentum, as Feynstone, with his tireless pursuit of excellence, switches from a respected professional to a reckless killer in record time. <br /> <br /> It is always cool and interesting to watch in front of me, rather wasted in the detective role of the standard edition, but there is some pleasure in watching Boen play his slim role in the handle. Hoffman and Krista Sauls give a very attractive eye candy. And before fame Mark Ruffalo can be seen in a small supporting role. But this is all very similar to the show of Bernsen, when he pours his teeth with full confidence (sorry for using this expression) in his lead role of plum. <br /> <br /> “Dentist” is considered one of the most original and interesting horror films coming out of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> 8/10
