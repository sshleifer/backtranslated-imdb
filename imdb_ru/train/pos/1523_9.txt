GBS wrote his own adaptation of this play, which won the Nobel Prize, but did not live to see how it came out (he won an Oscar in 1938 for the brilliant adaptation of his play PYGMALION 1914). When Otto Preminger established (produced and directed) this production in 1957, seven years after Shaw's death, he noted that the British writer Graham Green was making an adaptation, and it was a solid choice. <br /> <br /> Taking the hint of Show’s own script, Green uses Epilogue material from the stage to create a framing device to combine the two acts of the play (one early and one later in Joan’s story) into a single and most satisfying whole. Where on stage the change in tone is balanced by a break, it works as well as returning Charles King of the King’s bedroom to the bedroom (where the man Joan put on the throne dreams about the events that led to his current position) and more from Epilogue Show - introduction of the shade of Warwick by John Gilgud (the English “creator of the king”). <br /> <br /> Most of the language is solid GBS, as well as performances by persistent chauvees (for example, Felix). The Inquisitor Eimler or Harry Andrews de Stogumber) for relative newcomers (the film marked the beginning of Jean Seberg's career) - first-class. Some who are only familiar with many of the villains from the Richard Widmark movie may seem to be playing a frail and somewhat stupid Dauphin, but the performance, oddly with the highest price, is professional, even if possibly erroneously. <br /> <br /> The symbolism of the opening credits and the choice of the director to use the visual dictionary of black and white filming - all this is well suited Shows and stories. Go in anticipation of quality entertainment, and you will not be disappointed.
