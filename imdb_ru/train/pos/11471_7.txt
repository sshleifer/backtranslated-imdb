I am a big fan of cinema and watched this movie because I heard how interesting it is. I can honestly say that it was really very interesting. The two main actors are awesome, the film is never boring, and the concept behind it (although obviously inspired by the killing of Columbine and the killers' home movies) is really interesting. There are some weaknesses, such as the last 20 minutes, that really distract from the realism observed in the first hour or so, and the ending really doesn't make any sense at all. A shaky camera can sometimes be distracting, but people in the movies believe that this is a given. But I still think the film is very well made, and director Ben Kochio deserves praise.
