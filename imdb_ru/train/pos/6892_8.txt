The closest thing I've ever seen was the video shown at the Gerard Philip show in Paris about two years ago. I was not interested in a remake, and only half a century after it was made, I caught up with the original, and I can only conclude that the inept fencing was a deliberate, aimed at a long-obsolete goal. Hollywood has led realistic swordfights since the 1930s, when the greatest of them, Basil Rathbone, crossed the foil with Errol Flynn and others, so that the equipment was accessible and left only satyr. After a while, you don’t notice or enjoy Henri Jinson’s dialogue, reminiscent of the Prisoner Of Zenda, both versions. Gerard Phillip definitely had such a role, and Gene Lollabrigida was probably a little better than Martina Carol, another obvious candidate of the time. The imprint I saw was particularly bad, and at some point it broke down completely, so maybe the DVD version will improve it.
