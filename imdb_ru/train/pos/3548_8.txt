I just saw this version of Frank Lessser’s “Guys and Dolls” movie for the third time with my mother, who had never seen it before. She was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of Gene Simmons and Marlon Brando. And she thought the episodes of Havana, where Simmons and Brando were dancing the storm, were excellent. For me, this was also quite impressive and usually was the highlight of the film. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, this film, which originated as the story of Damon Runyon, initially takes some time at a slow pace in non-musical scenes, but draws you down after a while. Another story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not so convincing to me, but still had its charm, especially during the number of "Sue Me". I also loved the Stubby Kaye number “Sit down, you rock the boat” and the performances of Sheldon Leonard and B.S. Pulli. “Guys and Dolls” with theatrical design is not a very good film, but certainly very good.
