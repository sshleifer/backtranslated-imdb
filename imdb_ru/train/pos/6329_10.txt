Cult film for every true Russian intellectual. Everything is great, especially acting: it is beyond praise. The film, like the book, is full of symbols: my favorite is the brightest symbol of Ruin (the colloquial Russian word "devastation", often designates a period of chaos in the lifestyle after the Civil War 1918-20) - a wide opened dirty door in a brick wall creaking on a snowy the wind, and the black hole in the doorway behind it. <br /> <br /> Now the film is released on DVD with fully restored image and 5.1 sound. well translated English subtitles, although some obscene words of Sharikov were replaced by softer versions in translation. I don’t know if this DVD is abroad, but if you find it right away, it’s really worth watching. <br /> <br /> And finally, the fact is: about 50% of Russians today are mostly young, largely attributable to Sharikov. This is the post-Soviet effect: Soviet people were completely unprepared for the information attack of Western civilization, television producers and directors made the entertainment industry and the media amazingly aggressive, soulless and mindless to incite the gloomy instincts of every Russian. Even among Internet users, every third person uses obscene language in forums and chats, because it is surprisingly often found in colloquial speech.
