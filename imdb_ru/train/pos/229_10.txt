In the modern world of digital production there is no computer that could replace an actor and a writer. Alas, nowadays this type of movie with “character” is too rare. The game Duval and James Earl Jones are true to their expectations. Interestingly, this movie was made for television? It has a “close-up” of personal quality in the story. To say that all the performances are outstanding is an understatement. The only thing that prevents him from being a masterpiece of cinema is the absence of a great cinematographer, but beautiful pictures are not all. How can a talent, such as Jones and Duval, continue to do such great work in an era when actors pose for digitization?
