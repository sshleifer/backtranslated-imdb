I was lucky to see it at a whim during the film festival, and I was so shocked that I saw that I came back the next night at the second of three shows. A funny, wild and sharp attack on all aspects of mass entertainment, passively swallowed without a tasting by a target audience with the lowest common denominator, led by a lone journalist who slowly receives participants for his partisan war for predictability in a way that you are left after the credits roll with renewed hope, and are excited that the original films can still be made. Anyone disappointed with the unfulfilled expectations of something that arouses their imagination would have succeeded in hunting (and I mean hunting) on ​​this barely noticeable object. For fans of Fight Club and any movie Charlie Kaufman, and viewing is necessary for anyone who avoids multiplexes like a mad dog.
