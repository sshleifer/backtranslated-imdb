Charming! I saw Domestic Imports in Philadelphia in October with my children. We all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents. I have not heard them laugh like that for years! It was the first time I remember a movie that my parents and my children could watch. It's really nice, and we can't wait to get it on DVD. They need to make more films, such as Domestic Imports. It's nice to go to the cinema, which can be enjoyed by three different generations (and not be embarrassed). I have not seen such a cute movie since my big greasy Greek wedding. I loved Mindy Sterling as a mother. She was also in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also in this and he is funny. I remember him from WKRP.
