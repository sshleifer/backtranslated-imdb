Reese Witherspoon plays Danny, a young country girl who falls madly in love with a new 17-year-old neighbor, Court, played by Jason London. The court tries its best to let Dani understand that the difference in their age will make love relationships incredible. Soon the marriage charm of Dani begins to win the will of the Court. Then the meeting of elder sister Dany, played by Emily Warfield, begins, and the short problem of love / jealousy begins. <br /> <br /> Tess Harper and Sam Waterston complete the cast. It is a fresh, free spirit; but a heartbreaking drama that touches deeply. Feel free to cry.
