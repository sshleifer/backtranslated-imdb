I don’t know why some guys from the USA, Georgia or even Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about what they don’t understand at all. For those who have not watched this movie - watch it. Do not expect too much or do not put some frames just because it is Kostyuritsa. Watch the movie without prejudice, try to understand all the humor inside - people from Serbia really got married, while Bill Clinton bombed their villages, Roma in all Balkans ALWAYS try to deceive you in any way possible, LOVE is always unexpected, clean and colorful, and the Balkans are extremely creative. For those who claim to be a bad film, I can only see that American jesters (such as Meet Dave, Get Smart, etc.) are much worse than a clean, frank Balkan comic film with a love story like Promise me. The comment should be useful and in second place should represent the personal opinion of the author. I think the film is great and the people who watch it should pay tribute to the director and the story told inside. It is simple, but true. It is cruel, but gentle and makes you laugh to death.
