I love this show. Now I'm not a big fan of many science fiction shows, so if it doesn’t look like them, I haven’t noticed. I like a collection of stories about the quality of cinematography. I even like a love story, although while I enjoy it, deep down I wonder how the hell this part of the story can really develop, seeing how Ned can't touch Chuck or something else ... well, you you know I even like Chuck, I do not find her annoying at all, and I generally hate overly cute, good, beautiful characters. I even like the voice of the narrator, even if he is bothering one of my family members and is a bit like some Walgreens commercials. I could find fault with all other things about Ned's predicament and how the writers are going to solve it in the future, but I just prefer to look and wait and see what the writers say.
