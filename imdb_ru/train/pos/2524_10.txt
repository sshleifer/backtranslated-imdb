I didn’t expect that the performances of Gackt and Hyde would be as good as they were, and I didn’t expect them to play in such an artistic, well-developed film with enough plot to interest you and enough variety to make it original. This film was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and I will be looking for the next film like it. I especially like the fact that this is a movie about vampires, but it was not a stupid movie about vampires, nor was it embellishing this fact. All characters possessed human traits. The way he shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasty, and it makes you feel sorry for them all your life. I will show this film with two thumbs. Definitely the best film I've seen in the last five years.
