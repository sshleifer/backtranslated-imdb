I really enjoyed AWTWB Tom Barman. You just have to let it come to you and enjoy it while it lasts, and expect nothing. It's like sitting on a cafe terrace with a beer under the summer sun and watching people pass by. It definitely won't make you think, really, but it is not a prerequisite for a good movie. This is just a terrific movie experience. <br /> <br /> I felt that there were a few threads that could be worked out a little more, but being a Lynch fan, I donâ€™t care :) <br /> <br /> And I * liked * the style or the talent of this film. It's smooth, but fresh, and the soundtrack is beauty. Any music lover will enjoy AWTWB, I assure you. <br /> <br /> I'll post 8 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (for music 10 out of 10)
