If you have not seen this little-known little charmer, you must find him. This is the story of the awkward wartime Sad Sack (Fred McMurray), who is listed 4-F every time he tries to join any division of the army. He finds a magic lamp, in which, of course, there is gin (Gene Sheldon), but gin is even more clumsy than McMurray, and sends him through time to serve in all inappropriate times and places than the one he wants. This is cute, fun and pure fluff, and you can not like it. The plots are very similar to the Disney movie, especially since the two stars (McMurray and Sheldon) made many Disney films in the 50s and 60s, although not together. Needless to say, everything ends well, and the audience leaves, feeling pretty good.
