Most people know Paul Verhoeven as the director of many good (and bad) science fiction films in Hollywood. But long before that, he released general thrillers in his homeland. History is the basic premise of a femme fatale, nothing new or exciting. Verhoeven thinks he can do it better by adding a series of sequences of dreams, which instead of defining our main character and his situation, are simply used as a way to advance the predictable storyline. The script was solid, the dialogue helped to soften the effect of the unrestrained story. What really made the film at least good was some awesome game. Jereon Krabbe was adorable as a “tortured artist,” and supporters were also very good. In addition, the cinematography of Jan de Bont adds to the film a little bit of life, helping Verhoeven to look at least a capable director. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> * * 1/2 / * * * *
