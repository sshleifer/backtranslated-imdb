This is definitely NOT an intellectual film with a deep mission, so I really do not think that there is too much to understand if you are not a Czech. <br /> <br /> This is just a comedy. Humor is simple, quite funny, and sometimes, maybe a little painful. Some actors and characters are very similar to Samothari (2000) (Jirí Machácek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimír Dlouhý), as well as the authors. But it does not matter, the genre is really different, and these two films should not be compared in this way. Jedna ruka netleská will not try to give you a lesson, she will try to make you laugh, and there is some chance that it will succeed. <br /> <br /> A good movie, not brilliant, but I liked it, Some scenes are really worth watching.
