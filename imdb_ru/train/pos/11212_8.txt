This picture came out in 1975 and became the second in a series of three parts of the life of Sherif Buford Pusser. Bo Svenson assumes the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser, and Luke Askew plays the role of the bandit Pinky Dobson. The last thing we saw at Sheriff Pusser, he lay in a hospital bed after him and his wife, who was killed in an ambush on Sunday morning. After recovering, Pusser follows the people who killed his wife. Is Pusser able to avenge what he is pursuing, or is the mob trying to kill him before he succeeds. The only thing that bothers me about this picture is the real true story. How could you go to the city with such a crime, but nothing can be done about it. Since there was no real actress in this picture, I cannot give her 10 affection stars, but I can give 8
