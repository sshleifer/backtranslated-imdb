Full Moon High (1981) 3 of 5 Director: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Rose Kelly <br /> <br /> Tony (Arkin) is a regular middle school guy. Getting ready for a big game home, problems with a friend and growing hair in strange places - you know, as usual. But hair in strange places loses control a little when a trip to Transylvania with his father (YES! McMahon) leaves him with an evil case with balls. Now doomed to walk around the world forever young, like a werewolf, how will Adam get girls? <br /> <br /> A full moon is not often spoken of, but it is a silly and entertaining travesty of horrors. Larry Cohen (Q The Winged Serpent, The Stuff) includes as many jokes as he can think of as a writer / director. Arkin (20 years old: Halloween, 20 years later) shows a good time in the lead role. If you like fans of frauds, such as “Airplane” and “Student bodies”, I think you will enjoy this funny holiday.
