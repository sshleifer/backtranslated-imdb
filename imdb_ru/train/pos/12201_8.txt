Filmed in 1946 and released in 1948, the film “Lady and Shanghai” was one of the big films made by Wells after returning from relative exile to create “Citizen Kane”. Dark, thoughtful and expressing some paranoia during the Cold War, this film stands out as a crime film, Film Noir. The cinematography of this film is filled with Wells' characteristic quirks of strange angles, quick cuts, long pots, and sinister lighting. The use of ambient street music is the forerunner of the incredibly long introductory video in “Touch of Evil,” and the mysterious Chinese characters and episodes in Chinatown can in many respects be considered only as inspiration for Chinatown Polanski. Unfortunately, it is Welles’s passion for technical filmmaking that hurts this film as a whole. The plot of this story is often lost due to an incomprehensible confusion of cinematographic techniques. <br /> <br /> However, despite this criticism, the story, combined with the wonderful performances of Wells, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (Laughter), make this film a joy to watch. Orson Welles copes not only with an Irish accent, but also with torn personalities of an honest but dangerous sailor. Rita Hayworth, who was married to Wells at the time, breaks up with her usual roles as the goddess of sex and takes on the role of real depth and contradiction. Finally, the strange and bizarre image of Glenn Anders or the legal partner of Elsa's husband is nothing more than a classic!
