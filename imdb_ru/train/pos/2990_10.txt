I think it was Ebert who gave four of four stars to Stella, but, apart from him, I never read a positive review about this sadly misunderstood drama about class separation, love and sacrifice (three themes that are in the greatest romantic stories or movies). are common). <br /> <br /> Here the main theme is the division of classes. Stella is the story of the era of depression in America. However, he was transferred to the screen in such a memorable way that this remake (if you ask a fan of Stanvik or two) was not appreciated. Fans of the original never gave him a chance. In addition, this version of Stella was made in the 1990s, and not at a time when America was in great financial difficulty (as it was in depression). <br /> <br /> Now is the time to take off the rose-colored glasses, in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in America, and we see that this powerful story still rings true, relevant and relevant like never before in its updated format. <br /> <br /> Yes, the class gap is the main theme here. Stella among the working poor, lonely, with big dreams, but little hope for the realization of these dreams. She works in a bar, has little money, lives in a dirty apartment. You get drift. In the morning she does not want to get out of bed. There are movie stars on her wall that she worshiped. <br /> <br /> A man sees her dance in a bar. He is rich, educated, from a single upper class family, which has nothing to do with Stella. His main concern is that attending Ivy League college, how to pay rent, how to be "happy." They have a romance. They like each other. Stella ends with a pregnancy. Stella tells the guy the news. His answer? "How about an abortion?" She replies: "I just wanted a room full of balloons." He delivers balloons and an offer, but she sees that his heart is not in that, and has too much pride to accept. She sends him packing things. <br /> <br /> Her daughter ends up torn between two ways of life - the love she feels for her mother, and the advantages, happiness and love that her rich father gives her. Stella, alone and unloved, not wanting her daughter to become as unhappy as ever, brings the ultimate sacrifice. She refuses the only love and happiness that she ever knew to ensure the happiness of her daughter, and, perhaps, to live an interesting life and with hope, knowing that at least her daughter had found something for which she could live. <br /> <br /> Now for the film. Everything is correct about it. Excellent score, skillful cinematography, magnificent scenographic design (the contrast between the two lifestyles; dirty apartment and decorated mansions), wonderful and emotional performances of the entire cast, in particular, with Ottar-worthy Bette. <br /> <br /> This is a film that is much more important and better than you could believe.
