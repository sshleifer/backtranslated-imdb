"Emma Woodhouse" Gwyneth Paltrow ("Shakespeare in Love", "Duets") has nothing to do with herself, how to draw, walk with your friends in a chariot up and down, greet people in the city and try to find everyone she knows . I suppose there were no films or television in those days, and the girls had nothing to do except gossip. I would like her to read a bit more. I like Gwyneth, and I think she is a beautiful young woman. She is talented, and in Emma everyone has the honor to hear Gwyneth singing. I look forward to seeing the duets where she should sing. She dared to speak British English with all these native British people, including Emma Thompson’s sister, Miss Bates Sophie Thompson (“Four weddings and funerals, dancing in Lugnas”). "Mrs. Elton" Juliet Stevenson (Truly, Madly Deeply) was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991. Gwyneth is part of the American royal cinema, being none other than the daughter of director Bruce Paltrow (St. Elsewhere) and Tony Award winner Blythe Dunner (The Fingerprint Myth). I hope she will be very long. Lucky for us! I liked Emma and also recommend it. This is one of those old stories that are still accurate. Favorite scenes: Emma sings and plays the piano. I especially like when she sings a duet. Favorite quotes: Mr. Knightley ": Emma, ​​you didn’t ask me to contribute a riddle." Emma: “Your whole personality is a mystery, Mr. Knightley. I thought you were too qualified. ” Miss Bates: "It left us speechless, completely speechless, I tell you, and since then we have not stopped talking about it."
