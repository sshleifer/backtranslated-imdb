this film is not porn, it was not destined to be porn, and if my uncle does not work for the presidency of the world should never be treated as porn. <br /> <br /> Now that this question has been cleared up, I can say I fully recommend this film, since its problems are still widely available. it's funny, the acting is great, and it raises serious (curious) questions. <br /> <br /> I canâ€™t fully understand why this film was so badly treated, maybe that's why I plan to never visit us. Lena is a true pioneer of the modern rebellious movement, embarrassment, curiosity and wit are her main qualities, she sometimes gets angry, but aren't we all?
