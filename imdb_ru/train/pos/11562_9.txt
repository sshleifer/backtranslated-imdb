I just can't understand how brilliantly Walter Mattau and Jack Lemmon are combined. It’s as if the movie doesn’t even need additional characters, because you never get tired of the dialogue between these two. <br /> <br /> Lemmon has starred in several famous films, such as Mr. Roberts and The Apartment. Mattau had just won an Oscar for Cookies (another Billy Wilder film with Lemmon). This particular film was not as good as this one, because the story did not stand for such a long time (I think it was almost 2 hours). However, this happens in a lively hour and a half, even though the introduction of the events leading up to Lemmon ending in Mattaw’s apartment is a bit long (this was the sentence). This is a small chatter, and the rest of the time you are having a wonderful time. <br /> <br /> I have already written a comment about how the role in this film has lagged behind, and I will not go deep. in it. The reason why it is such a joy is perhaps because the film was shot just as the innocence of American films began to quickly disappear. There are some sexual references, but they are treated so innocently that you can't even get "Well, I never ..." from the boorish person there. It is quite funny to watch a film from a long-lost era, and perhaps that is why the continuation did not work, because you had Mattau and Lemmon, who spoke a lot of obscene words, and this simply does not suit them. > <br /> Of course, now they are both gone, and you can be just happy that you can still enjoy them in such a wonderful film like this one. I think the only male actor in this film who is still alive is John Fiedler. Edelman died recently. So you have it. Just one of the best comedies and movies ever. <br /> <br /> Add: I recently learned that John Fidler died, so I am very sorry for all his fans. I did not mean disrespect and will try to be more careful that I will blah blah brehing next time.
