The overall storyline in the films consists of the main characters, who leave the turmoil of the city and find themselves at rest in nature. In the Gangwon Province, we are shown two stories of people doing just that, trying to find themselves traveling to popular Korean parks in the mountains of Gangwon province. However, instead of episodic moments, we have two characters whose journey into nature was just another form of escape. <br /> <br /> The pace of this film is slow, contemplative. In the end, we learn what really led everyone to Gangwon Province, and find out how they are related. For those who want a Hollywood glam and film to give them a definite answer, this film will not satisfy. But for those who want a film that will make them think, wonder, influence them over the years, this film will more than quench that desire.
