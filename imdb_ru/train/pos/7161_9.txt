Loved the movie. Loved two families crossing paths in history. The only question is: if Sam is killed, how is the line of his family going? He is the son of Madame Zeroni, and Zero must be a relative, but not mention the other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. Never mentioned any other children or wife before he spoke to the teacher and fell in love with him? Maybe she had a baby before she started kissing Kate the Bandit? Even with the mistakes in the film. Just loved it. The game was great. Not sure where was the story with Mr. Sir, who in the end was Marion, and the woman makes his character more fun. Another “consultant” seemed to be worried about the children, but, of course, not so much. Poor Guardians must have had a smelly childhood to be so angry when she grew up.
