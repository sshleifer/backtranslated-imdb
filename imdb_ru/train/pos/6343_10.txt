Let me set the scene. These are school holidays and there is absolutely nothing in the films. My friend and I decide what to see. We are looking for a film that will start soon, and “Grinch” will appear. We buy tickets, not knowing what to expect. What we got is a roller coaster of fun. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey (I can add that this is my No. 1 actor all over the world) was absolutely brilliant as Grinch in Ron Howard's best film (next Apollo 13) The way this movie was made, the scenery, the actors, the props, and the music were simply awesome. It really enlivened this children's film. <br /> <br /> History is based on the history of Grinch. As we all know, the Grinch is a terrible person who just can't stand Christmas. He lives high above whoville and never mingled with the townspeople. But one little girl will radically change Grinch’s view of life and others. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lou, played by the new charming actress Taylor Momsem, meets Grinch, finding a good part of him right away. She is trying to break the barrier and help Grinch get closer and mingle with city dwellers. <br /> <br /> This entire film is a barrel of laughter for the whole family, both children and parents. SOLID 10/10. Well done, Jim. <br /> <br />
