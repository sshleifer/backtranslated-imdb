I generally like ghost stories, but I especially love the cool, atmospheric and elegantly creepy British-style ghost stories. This qualifies for all items. A naive young attorney (“attorney” in Bricpick) goes to a small village not far from the sea to settle an old and deceased woman’s home. This is the 1920s, a time when many Britons from the middle class go on vacation at sea for "their health." Well, guess what, there is nothing “healthy” in the village of Christine Gifford, an eerie place of a huge, brooding Victorian estate of an elderly woman located on the outskirts of a foggy salt marsh. When a lawyer saves the life of a little girl (none of the locals help a threatened child - you will find out why later in the film), he inadvertently incurs the wrath of an evil spirit, a woman in black. It is not vile, tasteless, but a solid black silhouette of anger and evil. The viewer sees her only a few times, but you feel her angry presence in every frame. When the camera sneaks up to a lawyer while he looks at legal documents, you expect to see a woman in black at any time. When a lawyer goes to the generator shed to turn on electricity for an eerie old house, the camera sneaks up on it, and you think it will appear there too. Waiting for a woman in black seems incredibly tense. We have already seen many elements of this story (a locked room into which no one enters, fog, a naive outsider who ignores the warnings of local residents), but the director somehow managed to unite them all into a completely new and irresistible ghost story. Watch this with a buddy so you can hook someone warm, expecting a woman in black. ,,
