This film rewrote the history of cinema in all respects. No one cares what anyone thinks about this film, because it goes beyond criticism. Each flaw in the film is easily overcome by many of the amazing things that the film has for it. This is a very beautiful film, and I doubt that many of us will see something like that again. I have seen it more times than I would like to count, and I still get shocked every time with a feeling that is hard to describe. One for ages.
