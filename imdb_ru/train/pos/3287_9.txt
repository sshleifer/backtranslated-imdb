My friend and I chose Paperhouse from a random pile of movies on our weekly excursion to the Horror section - none of us had heard about it, but the advertisements on the box were really promising. And the film did not disappoint, although I still probably would not have called it an exclusively horror film. <br /> <br /> 11-year-old Anna Madden draws a house and visits it in her dreams. She definitely sleeps when she sees a house, but in a sense it is so real that it is almost like a separate reality. That, in view of later events, does not seem far from the truth. In any case, she finds that she can add to the house, its contents and its surroundings, simply by adding to the picture. <br /> <br /> While this is happening, Anna is increasingly falling ill with a fever, and, in addition, she is completely obsessed with the house and her drawing. In addition, she and her mother also deal with their absent father; he has a job that takes him to long stretches, although it seems that there is more to this story than this one. <br /> <br /> OK, so the drawing sounds good enough - but, to be honest, there is something really awesome about it. The world of dreams is terribly surreal - the house, for example, is just a gray block in the middle of a deserted field. The people who made the film did a great job, making us feel very embarrassed in this alternative world / constant dream ... <br /> <br /> One of the things Anna adds to the house is a boy, Mark, who seems to be the same patient that her doctor keeps talking about (I will not give it up, you know, from the moment he seems to be the same child). In fact, Mark cannot walk due to illness; in the world of drawing Anna, he can not walk, because she did not draw him any legs. She blames herself for his real illness and tries to correct the situation, but ... everything starts to get really strange. She even led her absent father into a drawing, with disastrous consequences. Disagreements with the father are really terrible. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to give anything away, so I’ll stop at this ... In this film, a lot of things seem to be happening. I am sure that you will have a ball analyzing this thing, make death with your buddies after you look at it ... Is this a simple story, as it seems, or do you really have layers of meaning? I do not know, but in any case it is quite fascinating. There was something like “A Nightmare on Elm Street” in which reality and dreams intersect at some point. I like these things. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that it seems to me that it CAN end many times, but it is not. I am pleased with the ending he had (some of you sensitive types might want Kleenex to be at hand!), Although in fact he could have different conclusions. In any case, he doesn’t feel overwhelmed as soon as he’s really over, but as you watch and continue to fade, it is a little unnerving. <br /> <br /> However, "Paperhouse" is really a GOOD movie. It's well done, and acting is — especially Charlotte Burke, like Anna — at the highest level. Burke, who has never before and since then appeared in the film, is a real gem. I do not know why she has never done anything else, but in any case, she is really convincing and pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> “Paperhouse” is not exactly a horror movie, it’s a kind of fantasy / movie like “the unknown” or something else, with certain horrible moments - but you can still watch it with your family and Do not worry about your younger brother or grandmother quarreling for splashes of blood or the like. <br /> <br /> Give him a chance, you will not regret it! And maybe you should read the book too ...
