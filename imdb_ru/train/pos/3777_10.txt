Anyone who does not think that Bill and Ted's Fake Journey is one of the greatest films of all time needs a head test. He somehow manages to be both completely reckless and easy, but at the same time frightening and intelligent. One of those rare films that truly surpasses its predecessor, Bogus Journey can be enjoyed again and again. Notable highlights include the duel with Death and the ending, which is very "emotional." Keanu wants to forget all this trash of the Matrix and do what he does best, by Ted Theodore Logan in Billa and Ted: The Return.
