Perhaps the film itself is not one of the best Jackie Chan films, but I think everyone will agree with me that the fight in the mall was one of the best fighting scenes ever made. There were also some memorable tricks that were so impressive that they made this film a classic action movie. This film influenced many other action films, and I think that now the creators of action films should learn from this film (as if they could remake this chase scene, I think they could make it even better with the help of modern technologies). There were also some funny scenes that made this movie enjoyable, even when Jackie didn't fight. Although I think they could add more fight scenes in this film.
