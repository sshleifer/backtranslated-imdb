The story tells of Ankush (Abhay Deol), who is a professional witness of marriage, in short, he acts as a witness for couples in the marriage registration office, and Mege (Soha Ali Khan), who ran away from her home in Nainital to marry her . Love interest Dhiraj (Shayan Munshi). The story begins with the fact that Megha is waiting at the Dhiraj marriage registration office, but for some reason he does not appear. Thus, Ankush appears in the picture, which approached Megha with the intention of earning Rs. 200 for the work of the Witness, and he eventually helps her by giving her asylum. Ankush grows on his side, working in a bank as an agent ... Ankush falls in love with Meghu, and she also falls in love with him (or with some kind of love), both agree to marry, and Diraj returns to the photo. Unexpected circumstances happen, in fact I must say, expected circumstances with an unexpected reaction, and then ... <br /> <br /> In fact, the story of the film is a little different from the films that we see, and I do not think that it will be accepted by the masses, but if you like to watch movies like me and like to watch something else, then you will definitely like the movie. The film is simply an innocent love story, very well composed by the characters Abhay Deola and Soha Ali Khan. The characters are so natural that you feel something is happening to the guy next door. The background music of the film also plays a very good role, it is too good. The way Delhi is shown is very good and gives a feeling of freshness. <br /> <br /> Let's cut it out and summarize. <br /> <br /> History: A very common story, which is very well and Turned into a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> Music: Well, since it was the creation of Himesh Reshammia, so I did not expect much, but I still liked a couple of songs from the film, including Kawwali. <br /> Acting: Abhay Deol was the most impressive, very natural and innocent actor, but he should stay away from singing in songs. Soha Ali Khan, she is a doll, a very cute doll, I must say. Again, a very innocent and natural game, and both actors fit perfectly in their characters. Besides these two, Shayan Munshi needs some acting classes and there may be several layers of fat to cover the bones. Other actors coped well with their work. <br /> <br /> Stars: I would also give him 3.5 stars out of 5. You will like the film, if you watch it in the theater, I would recommend to watch it in the theater, if you are a movie freak and take unusual stories. Otherwise, wait for the DVD to arrive. Mass definitely will not like the film, and the business that it can do, word of mouth.
