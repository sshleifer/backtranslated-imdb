I first saw this film at the sundance film festival this year, and as a teenager, I found this film quite attractive. These children are extraordinary and very unexpectedly found themselves in a film of this level, but with the right dialogue and unnecessary material they made the film a complete success. I liked this movie more than others, but I highly recommend releasing and watching this movie. it is a mixture of witty comments and fun reality. grasping the essence of high school, school records ranked first on my list of favorites, and I hope there is a chance to get to the cinema. I sincerely thank all the children who have put all the hard work into making this film, it helped me cry with laughter.
