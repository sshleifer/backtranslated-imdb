What a wonderful, fantastic movie "Stardust". <br /> <br /> I could easily end it with this one statement, and suffice it to say that one could take it as a very strong recommendation to watch it. <Br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems inclined to force itself to redo and continue to drink, “Stardust” makes us remember why we all go to the cinema - to avoid reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives. , other times or other planets. Ironically, “Stardust” takes us to all three places effortlessly and with the childish joy we all strive for. <br /> <br /> “Stardust” is full of all the characters we remember in childhood: princes, witches, pirates, ghosts and villains. He has a poor girl, a hero, rogues, obstacles, spells, antidotes, enchantments and even a light touch, which makes him almost modern. <br /> <br /> “Star dust” is about a Man from the City of the Wall, who is conveniently located next to the wall that separates their city from the magical kingdom. The only way through the wall is through the breech, which is diligently guarded by an untidy old coder (wonderfully played by David Kelly). One day a young man from the Wall by the name of Ben Barnes maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech. He ends up in a bewitched kingdom called Stormhold, where he meets a chained (and very sexy) young lady named Una. She is captured by a witch and tied with an indestructible chain. While the witch is absent, Una seduces Ben and sends him off. Ben returns to the Wall without incident and continues his life. But after nine months he is called to the wall, where the old guard gives him what you would expect - a boy. <br /> <br /> A boy named Tristan grows up to be a rather unhappy young man (Charlie). Coke), who is struck down by one girl from her league, and also betrothed to another. However, a young lady (named Victoria and played for Sienna Miller) once meets Tristain, and he confesses her love. After they see a falling star, she tells him that he can get it if he finds a star and returns it to her. He agrees and goes in search, which will transfer him to the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, in the kingdom of Stormhold, the old king dies (beautifully played by Peter O'Toul), He calls upon his surviving sons to tell them who will succeed him. The names of his sons are Primus, Sekundus, Sextm and Septimus. Other sons were killed by other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne. <br /> <br /> In any case, he throws his ruby ​​charm into the sky, and Voila, that which brings the star to the earth. <br /> <br /> A star falls in the form of a beautiful woman named Iwain (Claire Danes), and she, of course, wears charm. But little does she know that Tristain, Princes, and an aging witch named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer), who wants to cut the heart out of the stars, to persuade her youth, are trying to persuade her. <br /> <br /> Difficult? Yes. But all this happens together when the adventure unfolds. <br /> <br /> Tristain is the first to find Ivain, but so blinded by his devotion to Victoria that she does not recognize the growing connection between him and Ivaina. His initial interest is only to return Iwein Victoria as proof of his love. But first he must pass by the princes and Lamia. The princes are not such a big problem, as they are constantly trying to kill each other — and just like in Pirates of the Caribbean, death has never been so funny. <br /> <br /> But Tristain also encounters a witch who enslaved his mother (although he does not know that this is his mother) and a group of flying pirates led by Robert De Niro. <br /> <br /> His most important character in the film, and DeNiro plays his t-shirt. He steals the film with his power, and soon we will learn a secret secret that will leave the audience on the floor laughing. Although his role is small in length, DeNiro is not an ordinary one! <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderful, as Lamia is a sexy, evil witch. Claire Danes is most appropriate as a bewildered and frustrated Yvein. She makes a perfect damsel. Jason Fleming, Adam Buston, Rupert Everett and Mark Strong add the ideal dose of levity as fighting princes who, dying, return as ghosts ala "Spirit of bliss" and "High spirit". <br /> <br /> Moreover, director Matthew Vaughn, whose only directorial experience was “Layer Cake”, weaves a fascinating story that everyone will like. <br /> <br /> “Stardust” may be too difficult for small children, but for any person over 13 years old. will want to see this movie several times. It's so great. “Star dust” is what films should be. Perfectly written, perfectly matched, well directed and well played. In other words ... perfect.
