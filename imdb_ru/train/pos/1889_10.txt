My family watched Arthur Bach stumble and stutter from the moment the movie was released. We remember most of the lines. I watched it two weeks ago and still feel the tickling from the simple humor and outlook on life that Dudley Moore portrays. Liza Minelli did a wonderful job as a side kick - although I'm not her biggest fan. This movie makes me just enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur visits his bride's house. His conversation with the butler and his father Susan does not care. The line from the butler, “Could you wait in the library,” followed by Arthur's answer, “Yes, I would say there is no question of a bathroom,” is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer. "Arthur is really" fun stuff "!
