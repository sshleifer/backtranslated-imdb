The woman in black is fantastic in all aspects. It's scary, tense and so realistic that you can really see how this happens in real life. I first saw it on TV back in 1989, and with the lights turned off and the volume turned on, it was probably the most creepy experience of my life. I managed to get a copy, and now I check it every Halloween and show it to too unsuspecting family members who have no idea what they are for, and all I can do is laugh with joy. As for the film: <br /> <br /> It begins with a young lawyer named Arthur Kipps, whom his company commissioned to go to the place of Christine Gifford to settle the documents of the recently deceased client, Mrs. Alice Drablow. <br /> <br /> This film begins with a rather solid and interesting ghost story. But then Arthur comes to the funeral, and from this scene we do not feel safe. We are constantly on the verge of biting our nails, and this continues for the next hour or so, until the final, exciting finale. <br /> <br /> Warning to all new viewers: do not watch it alone. ..
