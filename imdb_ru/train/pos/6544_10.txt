I really liked this movie! Despite the fact that it was not something similar to any of the books, it is still the classic style of Nancy Drew. I have seen a lot of commercials for this film, and since I got into Nancy Drewâ€™s books, I had high hopes for this film, and they definitely met those expectations. Almost all the characters were exactly as I imagined them, reading books. I'm really happy to see this movie. All the actors and actresses really acted as they acted, as in a series of books. Since I watched this film, I have wanted to read every book of Nancy Drew that is there. All the actors and actresses really entered their characters, and it definitely showed when they showed this movie on the big screen. Definitely it seemed that all the actors and actresses really were in those positions in which the characters were. I definitely put this movie on 10 out of 10.
