I have never watched this program before, although its members recommended to my family members. Oddly enough, my friend lives in Hadfield (location), and she pointed to several landmarks when I first visited. <br /> <br /> This aroused my interest, so I bought the first series on video and sat down at the clock. Besides the fact that I learned some places, I was not surprised. Once again the BBC were responsible for producing another example of the finest comedy in the world. TLOG is easily ranked as Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python as probably the best. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that I am hooked on the program now. The characters are excellent and show unusual depth, while maintaining a frighteningly realistic advantage. The appearance of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes gloomy feeling of the North (disrespect for Hadfield, which I found a very hospitable and warm place). <br /> <br /> I only hope that it will continue its originality throughout its launch (which is based on the 2nd series, which completed its repetition in the UK last night, this is certainly true). <br /> <br /> Great, BBC !!
