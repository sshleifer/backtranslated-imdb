The “dangerous criminal” is the story of a seemingly antisocial girl and how she succeeded. This is based on a true story, and although I was annoyed by the single-note image, that is, the ever-sullen, title character and the loyalty of her lawyer, committed to the cause, I have to admit that life imitates art and there are such people. <br /> <br /> The film is successful for me because, although the behavior of the main character softens a bit almost to the very end, the person gradually begins to sympathize with her, because the film shows how she got into her current state, which turns out to be more self-destructive than antisocial. <br /> <br /> A truly touching film that will give someone a throat when you think about it - which will happen often. <br /> <br /> Despite many shortcomings (including the fact that they are difficult to watch sometimes due to physical functions and suicide attempts), this is another statement I’m proud to call a Canadian.
