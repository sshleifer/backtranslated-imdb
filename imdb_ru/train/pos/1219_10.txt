The second Care Bears movie is much better than its predecessor. It has a deeper plot, better character development, and melodies (especially the final song) and throws and hearty. Of course, the film has a tendency to over-care for stress, but come on, this is the film “Care Bears”. This film is a great picture that can be shown to children, because it emphasizes friendship, love and, again, care. Not to mention Care Bears, they are just amazing!
