Julie Waters is outstanding, and Adrian Pasdar is a revelation in a very warm, very real and unusually interesting look at the complications associated with gender dysphoria and transvestism in the life of a young leader. This film is based on true truth, which you yourself must accept before you hope that others will accept you.
