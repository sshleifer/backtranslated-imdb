This film is a very funny and touching story about an orphanage that has financial problems. When the director goes on vacation, his dad agrees to temporarily intervene. <br /> <br /> This is by far the best work Leslie Nilsson has ever done. His idea to shoot children in the film is immediately innovative, and the sales technique will definitely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that I know I will never forget her, Just make sure you donâ€™t miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> Such wonderful family fun is rare nowadays. If you go for a bit trite pictures with a happy ending, go for it! I could watch it again and again, and I often do! My only complaint about this film is that finding a copy is so difficult.
