I have this film, and I watched it several times over the years since its release. Prince does not overwhelm us with his phenomenal style of play or anything else, he is a musician, and I feel that this is what he showed here, he is simply the best to tell this story through influence. Most of this movie is straightforward and youthful, but it’s the fault of the directors and writers, however, it’s a great movie with even better music. The principles and moral beliefs in Purple Rain are strong enough, and if more films were based on the basics we were taught when we were young children, we would be better off in the environment if art reflected life reflecting art.
