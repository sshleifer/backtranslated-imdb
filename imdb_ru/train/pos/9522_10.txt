This is the first Tom Hanks film that I received in the theater, although it is my favorite. When I heard that he was going to play an assassin, I was a little overwhelmed, thinking: “Can Mr. Hanks take this off?” And he did in high fashion. This film about the depression era of the 1930s talks about loyalty, redemption, and the way you don’t want your children to stumble. Tom Hanks leads the star cast as Michael Sullivan. Being a family man, and the secret life of a contract soldier for Oscar was put forward by Paul Newman. In this film, Tom Hanks relies more on reaction and opinion, rather than on the dialogue in which he puts on a knockout performance. <br /> <br /> One day in one of his works - the son of Michael Michael Jr., played by newcomer Tyler Hoechlin, Witnesses of the hit. A partner of Michael Sr. in crime, a colleague of Daniel Craig, can not disclose this information. Therefore, he kills the son and wife of Michael Sr., except Michael Junior. So, they are heading to Chicago to get Conner Rooney (Mr. Rooney’s son, Paul Neumann). <br /> <br /> The drama and the intense plot really thickens from them, as the father is trying to fix everything, although the son is ready for the trip. While on this deadly journey, someone hired a hit for Michael Sr. The murderer will be the photographer of the deceased Harlen Maguire, who will be played by Jude Law with jagged teeth. <br /> <br /> In the film you will feel the old days. And with the beautiful and haunting Oscar-nominated score of Thomas Newman, you can't help but appreciate this film from the winning director Oscar Sam Mendes. So relax and enjoy the wild ride.
