This film is similar to the allegory of the Gospel. He has such direct honesty and innocence that you cannot believe that he was made after World War, when Italy was ravaged and devastated, and was filled with a huge homeless, impoverished population. This is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit, as well as the endless creative resources of this country of inspiration. <br /> <br /> Toto is a character like Dostoevsky's Idiot, a modern Christ who has found his way in a big city. He is good and clean, backed by love, and his actions change the people with whom he meets, as well as the miraculous dove. The story is told in a natural manner and in a simple style, but at the same time permeated with magic, which is almost a prediction of Felliniâ€™s surrealistic fantasies. This is one of the most inspirational, inspirational films ever made.
