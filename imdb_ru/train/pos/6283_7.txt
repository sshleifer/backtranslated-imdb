As much as I like big epic pictures - I will spare you from the movie called - it’s great to let go of some beer and a simple click of the action sometimes. Movies where the plot fades into the background. Films where the dialogue is not so cleverly written that he binds himself to endless knots of purple prose There are hundreds of films that meet all requirements ... but, in my opinion, "Gone in sixty Seconds" is one of the best. <br /> <br /> This is a movie update that has its own name. It also shares the spirit of this picture, but not quite its execution. Whatever was good in the original, it was ordered. Everything that was streamlined was also strengthened by a larger budget. Often, such attempts are recipes for a complete catastrophe - look at the grim remake of “Italian Work” to see how it happened - but here, thanks to a group of mostly excellent actors, the Sixty succeeds. <br /> <br /> The plot and most of the dialogue is not so important as to write about IMDb. Often you will have scenes in which the same line of dialogue moves back and forth between the actors, each of which voices it with different intonations. Many people found it annoying; I find it causes a smile. Each actor gets a chance to demonstrate his definition of style here, with Cage, Jolie and Duval, of course, leading in this group (and it should be noted that it is also fun to see that Mrs. Pitt did not receive the first bill here). The chemistry between good old Saint Nick (see the Review Date) and Angelina leads to several pleasant moments. <br /> <br /> The villain isn't even a bit scary - I saw Chris Eccleston play the Roles of the Tough Guys before, so I know that he can deal with them, but I think he was intentionally meant to make his part irrelevant, so as not to distract attention from the action. We know that heroes will somehow succeed; we just sit in the car with them, enjoying the ride. I think that many of these scenes were reproduced in language so deeply that it embraced the heads of many people who gave it a bad rating. In fact, I would not mind if several fourth walls winked at the camera: this is just a film of this type. <br /> <br /> This whole style, and not so much substance - which often exhausts my patience, if not done * just * like that - would be useless if there was no action. And for the most part it is. It is so wonderful. I noticed that these days it seems to be a common tendency to use fast extreme close-up shots for direct action. I personally find such things tedious. I prefer films like these, where the stunts are impressive enough not to need artificial pressure build-up by constantly raping tight frames. I was told that Cage actually performed as many car tricks as he could afford without losing insurance (in real life, I mean - his character clearly doesn’t care), and it shows. A person can actually move a vehicle, and it is well used in the slow-burning climate final, where he drives the Mustang into the ground in the most outlandish — and funniest — way. <br /> <br /> So yes This film is not an "epic, life-affirming picture after September 11, with mandatory social commentary." The pace is uneven, some scenes could be cut, and not all actors cast a line. But automotive films are rarely better than this. So if you hate cars ... why do you even read these comments ?! <br /> <br /> I would take on many repetitions of "Weak and Tedious" (guess the franchise) on any given day. 7/10
