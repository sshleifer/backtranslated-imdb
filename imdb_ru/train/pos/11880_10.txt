"Scarface" has a big cult even after 22 years after its release. <br /> <br /> He was also widely criticized for being very sticky, unidentified, excessive and bloated! These are people who compare Scarface with the Godfather films. It is true that in technical terms (cinematography, script, direction, etc.) Scarface lags far behind Godfather. <br /> <br /> But it is also true that Scarface has some other gangster. the lack of films, rudeness, the apparent rude approach of the gangsters. The Latin American gangsters in this film look much more formidable and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other classic gangsters, such as The Godfather or Goodfellas. This is one of the main winning points of Scarface, and I firmly believe that this fact was written off by most critics as “stickiness”! I saw the original Scarface of 1932, and I must say that both of these films are too different from each other and should be considered as two different films, and not to praise the original on the "remake"! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was criticized for loudness in this film. But how about thinking that this is exactly what the filmmakers wanted, so that the character of Tony Montana was like that! This is the evil young man who makes hasty decisions and every second erupts from hysterics! He is not calm Michael Corleone here. This is Tony Montana, a very reckless, uneducated person who doesn’t think much and gets angry all the time! <br /> <br /> This 80s movie definitely reigns supreme. Soundtrack all 80s! I like some songs, including “Theme of Gina and Elvira”, “Push it to the limit” and instrumental title track. <br /> <br /> There are several memorable and beautifully filmed episodes, including the famous chainsaw scene Hit Rebengi, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony's visit to his mother. <br /> <br /> About the performances: Al Pacino is gorgeous as an angry Cuban refugee. He reportedly mentioned that he liked to play Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And indeed, it seems he fully enjoyed all his scenes! I wonder how Scarface will be without Pacino? I just couldn't imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana, and, in all likelihood, the film would not have been as effective without him! <br /> <br /> Steven Bower shines like a friend of Tony Manny. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is wonderful, like Tony's boss, Lopez. Just like F. Murray, Abraham (as Omar) in a small role. <br /> <br /> Then Michelle Pfeiffer plays Elvira. She looks beautiful and adequate in her role. <br /> <br /> The director goes a little overboard during a certain part of the climax. Without revealing anything, I would say that it was the only small part that suffers from mistreatment. <br /> <br /> “Scarface” is undoubtedly one of the most spectacular and best gangster films in history. of. Enjoy what we have: a rough image of the Lords of Drugs and their bandits!
