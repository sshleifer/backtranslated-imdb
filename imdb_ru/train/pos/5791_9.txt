This must be one of my favorite episodes in the Twilight Zone, primarily for the image of two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic setting. <br /> <br /> Cobweb-strewn shops and creepy streets, broken off by streets, this is how the twilight zone works best. <br /> <br /> Although a parable can be a bit tough by today's dramatic standards, it is excellent â€” it uses tuning to make a statement that fits with human experience. as well as geopolitics, so that timeless. The whole drama lies solely on the shoulders of Mr. Bronson and Miss Montgomery, who do not disappoint. (Let them both rest in peace.) <br /> <br /> A real classic.
