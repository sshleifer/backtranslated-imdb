It seems more than strange that such crazy assholes like "Dukes of Hazzard" and "The Hills Have Eyes" (new version) can find distributors of DVDs, while old - and far superior works like this film - nowhere can not found. With all the current debates about the morality (or lack thereof) of the war and the interest in espionage (consider the many works of Jack Ryan, Born, XXX and Mission Impossible), this seems to be the obvious choice for the DVD release. True, it looks like a 1968 movie, because it is a 1968 movie. But apart from the style, itâ€™s still a performance, which really has something to say, and there are many plot twists to entertain the audience. If nothing else, SOMEBODY, please think over the recording of the soundtrack to some CD, be it a compilation with other morricone music or as separate. I don't know if industrial people will bother to read what our fans need to tell us about their products, but if you read this and other comments, please take us seriously. We pay for your luxury homes with our hard-earned dollars spent on tickets, DVDs and CDs - give us what we want! , if you are reading this and have it I have not seen this film, I am lobbying for its release so that you can see what those of us who have seen it say. You will not be disappointed.
