This is a great example of a rather simple story from the film “Noir Film”, which is coped very well thanks to the excellent direction of Otto Preminger and some great acting. Dana Andrews plays the role of a hot detective who too often uses his fists instead of his brains. Shortly after the film began, Andrews was reprimanded for it, and he is warned that if this continues, he will lose his power. A little later, while investigating a crime, a suspect attacked him, and Andrews had to fight to protect himself. This time he does NOT use excessive force, but the attacker is killed. Andrews panics and assumes that they will not believe him, so he tries to hide death - although instead he is blamed for an innocent person. <br /> <br /> The film is much more than this ... -including the plot with the participation of the slippery villain (Gary Merrill) and love interest to Andrews (Gene Tierney). In general, this is one of the best examples of the genre - with a great sandy dialogue, excellent lighting and a simple but very effective story. That was what Noir should look like.
