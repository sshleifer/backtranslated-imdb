Tigerland follows the lives of a group of soldiers recently recruited to fight in Vietnam in 1971. <br /> <br /> At the moment, America knows that they are fighting a losing battle, and the director takes us with the help of a 16-mm portable documentary about the lives of several recruits in the Tigerland training camp in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> A film is more a study of character than a plot, but it is about a key point. the character is Roland Boz, who is a scattered, but still intelligent person who just wants to escape from the camp. We are assigned several characters in the squad, waiting for the story to unfold. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is a great story about Vietnam and, more importantly, about the army as a whole. Great game, and very memorable. In addition, filmmakers make good use of film and style, because this is very similar to the old shots that you always see in Vietnam. It's nice to see how the film shows that all the conflicts and problems were so important to the problems of the struggle in this battle. The specific scene in which Boz leaves the training mission, where the instructor shows how to use the radio as a device for torture, briefly summarizes everything about war ... and it is useless. <br /> <br /> Fantastic film. Not only about Nem, but also about who should decide what is morally right while in the army. <br /> <br /> Rated 9 out of 10.
