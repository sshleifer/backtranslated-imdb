I have to say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this film was very cute and i mean super cute. It had all the “sexual” content that most comedic works of Ivan Reitman have, but with something extra, CHEMISTRY. Mind and Luke have this monstrous, but believable chemistry that seems to go beyond every scene. Both seem to create these strange, intricate and interesting relationships with powerful “sexual” tension, which you laugh at until you feel your face. Anna Farris and the rest of the support team seem to play each other perfectly, and even the rather small role of Wanda Sykes makes you laugh. Although such comedies are not for everyone, but I must say that I went with a man who usually does not like these films, and he laughed like crazy. This film, of course, is not for everyone. especially younger children, since some moments are too small ... well, let's say, ADULT for younger viewers. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this film, although the final that I found was a bit weaker than the rest of the film. (3 1/2 * out of 5 *)
