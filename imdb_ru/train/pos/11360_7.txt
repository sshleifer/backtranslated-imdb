Chris Gerolmo took care not to just give us a list of dead people like Jack-sweep: he went deeper into psychological characterization with convincing results. Perhaps mainly because of the excellent performance of Stephen Rea, who plays against Donald Sutherland with a good sympathy of both. Was it a game of these two parts ?? above all ?? what made the film something more than just a painful account of the history of the Rostov butcher. Supporting actors, especially Max von Sydow, performed their roles very well. Good direction. The photo was also good. It goes without saying that the fact that the film was shot in Hungary should have caused a couple of aberrations, but, frankly, given the depth of storytelling and interpretation, we can completely forget these little things. br /> This time, the HBO film for TV turned out to be a trump. Recommended, especially if you like to analyze the characterology and forget some painful scenes ?? which, I hasten to add, never exaggerate.
