The American icon of Henry Fonda depicts the “Elegant” John Howard, an aging trucker, whose favorite large installation “Eleanor” was returned after a long stay at the hospital, forcing him to skip his payments. Deciding that he would like to do another perfect run, he breaks out of the hospital, steals Eleanor and contacts his old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan), who needs to move his troupe of prostitutes. /> <br /> Fondas' wonderful performance is a natural support for the film, which pulls at the heart strings just as effectively as tickling a funny bone in comedy scenes. The gorgeous cast, including Robert Englund as a young, reluctant assistant, Susan Sarandon (who also receives co-producer credit) and Daba Taylor (the delicious ham, as always, in the most explicitly comedy part of the film), helps immeasurably. <br /> The exceptionally life-affirming nature of the painting and the sharpness of the journey carry an incredible weight; This is a picture that, provided you get into it, you can remember long after it is over. <br /> <br /> The promise of the open road is vividly shown here; The countryside just looks beautiful. If we talk about the beautiful music of Craig Safans, then this is a wonderful picture in terms of aesthetics. <br /> <br /> In the final act, she loses a bit (characters played by John Beiner and Austin Pendleton are nothing more than invasions). ), but he still retains his good vibration due to the attractiveness of his central characters. <br /> <br /> It’s not at all what you would expect from the “exploitation / driving into a castle” picture from the name (especially its alternative name “Smokey's Great Checkpoint”), this is a rewarding movie experience that I can recommend without a doubt. 9/10
