One of the best works of television drama of the last decade. For five hours, perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged, as it examines many aspects of contemporary British society. David Morrisi, as usual, is great. At first, he ran into brass weapons in conflict with the heroine, but then turned out to be smart and caring when he worked with her to uncover the truth. I have never seen Surrain Jones before. I think she comes from the world of television soap. Her performance was great because she retains her humor and composure, trying to balance the demands of business and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on and talk about every actor who participates in this magnificent drama, but their efforts mean little without such an exciting script that constantly challenges your assumptions about any of the characters. It is these programs that restore faith in television drama, while at the same time making it almost impossible to be content with most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the air.
