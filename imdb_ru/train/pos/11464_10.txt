What worries this film most is not that school kills like the one actually depicted happen, but that they are committed by teenagers such as Cal and Andre ... normal children with normal families. Ben Coccio, using the technique of hand-shooting in the style of a la Blair, managed to bring us to life two friends who have problems with high school, although we have not been told exactly what is behind these problems. They seem typical - many people hate high school, so what? A part of you simply does not believe that they will ever make a very well thought out slaughter on Zero Day. For this reason, the observation scenes at school during filming become even more powerful. You cannot believe that this is really happening, and that this has indeed happened. Technique with a handheld camera also creates the illusion that this is not a film script, a brilliant idea, given the subject.
