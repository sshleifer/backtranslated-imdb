My favorite film is about two warring New York "characters", Steve Brody (Raft) and "Chuck" Connors (Beerie), who aspire to become the "Main Guy" in the Bowery at the end of the XIX century. <br /> <br /> Brody (1863–1901) and Connors (1852–1913) were real people, although this is a strongly invented story about their antics (based on the play). Legendary Brodie (did he do it? - this is still the cause of the argument!), The jump from the Brooklyn Bridge (1886), which he became famous for, is shown here as occurring at about the same time as the Spanish-American War (1898). Director Walsh clearly had a great affection for the period so beautifully recreated here, and includes a wild noisy ragtime number from singer-saloon Trixie Odbray (young Perth Kelton). Raft in his attractiveness, like Brodie, and Bury again shows how clever the actor is, how hard, with a big heart, and sometimes quite touching, Connors. Pretty Fay Wray is a love interest pursued by both boys. <br /> <br /> The Bowery, full of life and energy, is moving at a fast pace (unlike many early talkers). This is not an easy movie, but it is worth watching.
