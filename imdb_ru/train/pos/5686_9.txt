* Wonderland SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> July 1, 1981: five people, Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Susan Launius (Christina Applegate), Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner) and Joy Miller (Janine Garofalo) is attacked while they are sleeping, and is severely beaten on the head with steel pipes in his house at 8763 Wonderland Avenue, Laurel Canyon, LA. Susan only survives. <br /> <br /> Main Suspect :. John Holmes (Val Kilmer), the former king of porn, the owner of a 30 cm long member, and now a hopelessly addict <br /> <br /> Two. investigators, Louis (Frankie J.) and Sam Niko (Ted Levine), investigating the case and trying to solve it with the help of a witness who claims to know that John, at least, was involved in the killings, David Lind (Dylan McDermott) Barbara's boyfriend, and is trying to get testimony from Down Schiller (Kate Bosworth), Holmes' 19-year-old girlfriend, and Susan, who unfortunately does not remember anything but a shadow about the night when she’s husband’s head was broken, and almost suffered the same fate, and the name of Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosyan), the chief drug lord (who Always close to women like Barbie (Paris Hilton)) is revealed as a suspect planner about a Wonderland massacre. <br /> <br /> But what happened that night? And could Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), John's wife, learn anything about this? "Wonderland" - a trained, intense thriller, a desperate love story and the story of the sad decline of man in one; there is a clever use of the Rashomon technique (we see the events of this fateful day and night through the eyes of David, John, Dawn, Susan (albeit very briefly) and Sharon), good direction and a great script, but mostly convincing for performances, especially for Kilmer who comes out on the central stage with his hopeless, exhausted, sometimes childish Holmes, Lucas, whose Luna is strangely attracted by the strong Sharon Kudrow and the innocent Dawn of Bosworth. <br /> <br /> Wonderland: 9/10.
