Brooks's funniest and funniest movie I've ever seen. I can watch and revise the tape 100 times. I laugh, I ** and off, and I cry in some moments. This is a really good and funny movie, and if you like Brooks, this is a must! In short, Brooks (the billionaire) goes homeless for 30 days on the streets to recapture the entire poor neighborhood from his rival. Reality bites, but in the end - we are talking about the warm relations between people ... I highly recommend!
