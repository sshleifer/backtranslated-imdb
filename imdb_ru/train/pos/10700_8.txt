This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, without a doubt. If you leave, pretending that you know, or you are not indifferent to what communism is and what real Russians or British people are, if you agree and have not suffered from agreements, you can have fun with this film. Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, touching and funny. Ben Chaplin avoids Nicole's complete shadow, and the rest of the cast also does a good job. The final moves, and logical - the logic of the movie, of course. Worth seeing if you accept the rules of the game.
