Directed by Brian De Palma and screenwriter Oliver Stone, “Scarface” is a film that will not be forgotten. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for the American dream. Montana then becomes the “king” of the drug world, as he ruthlessly rules his criminal empire in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very cruel, and some scenes look unpleasant. This film contains about 180+ F-words and lasts almost three hours. This movie is interesting and you will never be bored. You support a drug lord, and in some scenes you discover that Montana is not as evil as some other crime lords. This is a masterpiece, and I recommend that you see it. You will not be disappointed. 9/10
