I still liked Still Crazy more than any movie I've seen in recent years. The successful group of the 70s decided to try again. They start playing a few concerts in some sinister European concert halls, with fun results. The music is fantastic, the script and acting are awesome. The characters at the height, especially the soloist with a high voice of heavy metal, makeup and personal problems. The concert at the end was unreal. Go and see, preferably in a movie theater with a good sound system :)
