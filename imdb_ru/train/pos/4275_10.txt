Actually, I am surprised that there were so many comments about this film. I saw it as part of the festival of Slavic cinema at a large American university. But no one in the US has heard of this, which is a real shame! The dynamics between people is what makes it funny and sad. They were stuck on a long bus ride - somewhere where most of us were !! But I have never had this! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where they stop at a funeral. Then a man and a woman sneak into the woods to make love, but everyone follows them, watching without the knowledge! As soon as she lifts her skirt, and he enters it all the time - the consumer starts to crack, and they understand that everyone is watching !! Let's talk about surprise! But ... you really have to feel them, even if it's funny! When you see the finale, itâ€™s somehow ironic that they enjoyed it! Serbian humor at its best!
