A show about two sisters living together. Holly, who is younger, has problems with a teenager, on the other hand, her sister Val has a job, boyfriend, problems with her fiance, like most women on the planet. They try to support each other, sometimes make mistakes, but they do not give up and continue. And the show is also about friendship. Priorities in life. I really enjoyed this show. It's funny, and the actors are so good. I am very sad that the show is over. I still watch replays from time to time :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth may be new to the comedy, but she plays very well. She is one of the actresses I love to watch. I like the relationship of Vince and Holly, they are very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh every time he appears. With Tina, Holly has found a true friend, and I really like that they hang out. The character Lauren is so funny and she has a natural talent. I would like to see her more. This show really captures you and makes you laugh. I wish the show wasn't over yet.
