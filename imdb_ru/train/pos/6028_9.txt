This is a film from the middle of the Antonioni period, which most critics quickly reject as a “flawed” view of American youth culture / politics in the 60s. Whatever it takes, I found it more touching and memorable than his more famous films, such as L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because he shows more emotion and sympathy here than anywhere else. The story is simple, but it is used as the basis for Antonioni's brilliant observations and criticism of American consumer culture, student life, counterculture, and the entire anti-war, anti-war backlash that was so noticeable at the time. <br /> <br /> Even from a purely technical point of view, this is a great film; from the sequence of initial credits to the strange love-in desert, to the use of billboards and up to this terrific, cathartic finale that used 17 camera settings (in its own way, as powerful as the climax of a wild bunch). In addition, Antonioni chose one damn leading lady with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful, who ever decorated the screen. There is not a lot of “acting” here, as it is more like a documentary drama, and therefore the use of non-professionals as a lead couple works quite effectively in this context. And the soundtrack is not only filled with amazing music, but also impressive with its use (I can not forget the beginning of the film, mainly because of the choice of music - Pink Floyd - which is so good at caring for visual effects). br /> <br /> Contrary to popular belief, this is a real achievement in the cinema, and I would enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who has a taste or tolerance for the original. Worth a search and one of those key films of the 60s, which requires recovery / release DVD.
