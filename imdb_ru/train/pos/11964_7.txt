This afternoon I went to the cinema, expecting Scop to be delighted. Fortunately, the film exceeded all expectations, at least a little. There is nothing heavy, nothing deep - and nowhere is it as good as any number of Allen’s true masterpieces - but it’s also quite pleasant, like a light humorous comedy. There is something simple and pleasant about it. “Darling” was a word I heard from people in the audience when they were leaving after the show. It does not seem like Allen intended to create a masterpiece here, it seems that he wanted to do a little comedy and have fun doing it. Compared to everything that Hollywood produces, Allen's things tend to fascinate. Even the fluffy things. These days it's just refreshing to go to a movie made by a real person.
