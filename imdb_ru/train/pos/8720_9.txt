All of you who are desperate, looking at the emptiness and weakness of the latest Disney Studios productions, this is something that should heal your wounds ... Once and for all, A Bug’s life brings proof that purely synthetic paintings that create a good script give more interest, not fake drawings “handmade, old Disney” (see “The Lion King”, Pocahontas and all the latest productions, in which you, unfortunately, regret that the magic background and the atmosphere of Bambi disappeared forever). <br /> <br /> Life of a beetle (1001 Patt for my fellow Frenchmen!) Allows you to avoid all the flaws that make you wake up in the middle of a movie and say: “Hey, this thing is generated by a computer!”. No weak points, no great effort, showing its effectiveness in the background and a general view of the scenery, an amazing three-dimensional bird (close to perfection in its imitation of reality) ... and this is just a mention of technical aspects. <Br /> <br /> Script, my friends, the real backbone of the film, has a certain thickness! Curiously, and, obviously, thanks to the team of Lasseter, in the life of the Bug almost no musical sequence. This means that the story is long and rich enough to break free of these 3 or 4 minutes that some children value, but most others don’t like (the same is for parents or anime fans like me). This film reminded me of a really old film with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase: 3 Amigos; he had basically the same story (the whole Mexican village, living in fear of several bad guys, hires armed people (who finally become actors) to protect them, etc. ...). Simple but effective and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of evil insects. <br /> <br /> Since the days of Microcosm, many films tell stories about insects, their lives, fears and hopes, but I think that the life of the Beetle is the funniest and best of all. The process of humanization was perfectly achieved ... And the entire audience was fascinated by the adventures of Flick (also known as Tilt in France). <br /> <br /> Many thanks to the Lasseter team, especially in the last 30 seconds. ... it is so strange and at the same time wonderful to see how the whole theater is captured by laughter, and the beetles / actors forget their lines or get into the camera ... <br /> <br /> And finally, especially for those of you who saw the French version, other congratulations go to dubbing actors who did a great job on this movie. The life of a beetle is really good fun, and I think that it will soon become part of my video collection (a privilege granted to very few films, and this is not a repository problem :). Go and see this order.
