When I saw that this film lasted only 80 minutes, I thought that we had a problem. The condensation of the giant novel by W. Somerset Maugham in the film, which begins in less than an hour and a half, seemed like a catastrophe, waiting for what would happen. But you know, the film is not half bad, and he even manages to keep most of what makes the book resonate with its readers. <br /> <br /> I heard that many movie lovers complain that Leslie Howard was wet actor noodles, and he was, but I can't think of someone more suitable to play the role of Philip Carey than wet noodles because this is definitely what Carey is. Howard plays him well, which means that you want to shake him and hit him several times on the head, and then finally pull him out and buy him a spine. <br /> <br /> Ah, and here is Bette, as the girl from whom Carey is possessed and who brings his world crumbling around him. I didn’t know that Mildred’s appeal was actually in the book, and the film remains true to that detail. But in the role of Davis, she becomes the most exciting character in the story, and if she is nasty and unattractive, then she is at least the most dynamic person on the screen at any given time. Davis' performance here is attributed to a change in the course of the film adaptation, in much the same way as Brando almost 20 years later, when he shouted “Stella !! in that little-known play by Tennessee Williams, and it is not difficult to understand why. Davis is intense to horror. She does not make any effort to arouse sympathy from the audience, and she allows herself to look ugly and most disappointing. Her appearance, when Carey enters her late in the film to find her dead or almost dead from an unnamed illness (although not particularly cared to hide the fact that this is an STD), is shocking. Of course, it helps that this movie shouted out shortly before the Production Code took effect; If this were done a year later, you could argue that everything would be a little different. <br /> <br /> Yes, most of the novel and many of its most interesting pieces are left on the floor of the cutting room. and the story really becomes about Carey and Mildred, and not about much else. I found that this is the least interesting and most tedious part of Maugham’s novel, but it’s this part that gives the novel its name and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to, so it’s wise to me that some directors have to adapt the novel the way they did. <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
