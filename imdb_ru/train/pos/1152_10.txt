The scene where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg go to the mall to revive Sally's perfume is enough reason to enjoy this movie. There is something else! This crackling good daytime television, movie stars on the way down (and above) and the horrors of love. Robert Downey Jr. shows the bright side of his genius, and Katie Moriarty is gorgeous. The dialogue is witty, and physical humor is made with unsurpassed skill. This is a film that will appeal to those who really love acting, directing and writing.
