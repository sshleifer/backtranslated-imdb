The film captured from start to finish, and his b / w photo of the American heart is amazing. We feel that we are near them when they cross the country of a big sky, and then to Mexico and again to America. Toward the end of the film, the reflection of rain on Robert Blake looks like little sweaty rivers and tears flowing down his face. In the end, we follow them up the stairs until the last moment. <br /> <br /> Two criminals played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, as well as Perry Smith and Dick Hickok, could be seen on any street in any city. Hickok is the smiling boy next door, and Smith is the guy with the stars in front of the other side of town. This moment is made in the film, and we are always surprised that the criminals in appearance are no different from others. Evil, even the most vile, is part of the human condition. These two delusional men kill the whole family in search of a safe, which is not there. Once on the run, they begin to write bad checks, paving the way for the authorities. <br /> <br /> There are many good support actors. I like John Forsyth as a detective in this case, Alvin Dewey. In addition, Will Gere acted in a short but superb scene as a prosecution attorney. <br /> <br /> I often wanted to watch this film through, only by catching it in short passages; I finally got to this after buying a DVD. The result was the best classic crime movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this great movie. For me, this is what makes great filmmaking.
