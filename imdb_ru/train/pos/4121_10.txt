This tends to be noticed by many critics and Kurosawa fans, but I thought it was wonderful. This is an episodic, multi-character study of Tokyoâ€™s poorest people who live in a city literally made of rubbish. Despite the fact that this bomb looks just like a bomb, the film has some serene beauty thanks to the excellent use of Technicolor. The name comes from the sound made by an insane young man who drives an imaginary cart through the slums. All the characters were wonderful, and all the stories were exciting, but perhaps the most tragic concerns the man and his young son, who live in an abandoned car. When they are not looking for food, they spend their free time using their imagination to build their dream home. Emotionally touching and beautiful film.
