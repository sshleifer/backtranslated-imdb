It seems to be the perfect day for swimming. A normal family wants to take advantage of this and goes on a trip to the beach. Unfortunately, it happens that the father is trapped under the pier, and neither his wife nor the little son can help him with this - while the stream rises. A woman (Barbara Stenvik) gets into the car and seeks help. <br /> <br /> John Sturges' short film (69 minutes) is very strong due to unanswered questions. Stanvik finds a guy who can help, but there is a price she has to pay for it. There is a double question that puts the film. How far will you go to help the man you love, and on the other hand - watching Stanvik behave towards a stranger - does she really love her husband? Like a good story, this film leaves the viewer with questions to which he can only answer himself.
