<br /> <br /> The presentation of Lily Mars is one of the genres of the film, which, unfortunately, seems to have disappeared with the studio system. Well, now that you know my bias, here are a few reasons why I think this film really stands out. <br /> <br /> 1. While the main story - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York, becomes a star and wins the heart of its director (Van Heflin) - a rather Hollywood Hollywood story of that time, the writers really change the subject . more than usually. Although Lily gets a big break when the star leaves, she did not succeed and must swallow her pride and return to a minor role in the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Judy Garland (stop talking!) <br /> <br /> 3. The supporting cast includes some really great performances. Spring Bayington, like Lily's mother, is truly beautiful, as is Faye Bainter (director's mother is John Thornway (Van Heflin)). Outstanding performance in support, however, plays the role of actress Connie Gilchrist in the role of Frankie, a former actress who has become the custodian of the theater. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing for sure. One of those films that are created to make you feel the world and your dreams better.
