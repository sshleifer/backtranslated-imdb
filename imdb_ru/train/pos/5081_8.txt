This film was awesome and even with an inconclusive ending, yet it is worth seeing. The film begins as Claudette Colbert is about to marry Robert Ryan. When the minister asks if anyone has any objections, the guy jumps up and announces that Colbert cannot marry because she is already married !! Colbert insists that this is not true, but when they investigate, they discover that the justice of the peace and many others remember her wedding, and even have a signed wedding license! Gradually it becomes apparent that Claudette's mind slips away, and people around her seriously doubt her sanity. Then, when the alleged first husband was killed, all the evidence and suspicion falls on Colbert. <br /> <br /> The film is an exciting movie with mysterious anticipation, since what I described is only the first half of the film. What follows is amazingly clever and fascinating. Unfortunately, the conclusion, however, is a bit disappointing, since the guiding force underlying all of this turns out to be “straight from the left margin” - and is confusing, since it was so unexpected and impossible to guess based on the information provided the viewer. However, despite this, the film was so good that I can even excuse the weak ending. In particular, Robert Ryan did an excellent job as a “ruining fist” groom, although, besides him, other performances were also excellent.
