This is such a great movie! Never mind the low rating here. I really have no idea where it came from, they must be discussing another film then. Because I really liked it, and I discovered that this is a little treasure. <br /> <br /> This story was so original and charming ... I really can't think of anything bad to say about it. It may have to be “your type of thing,” but I saw it with my sister and my mother, and it captured us all. <br /> <br /> The acting was also very good, and in such a film it is difficult to do. But I found all the characters very intriguing and responsive. <br /> <br /> I have always loved Dougray Scott and found his new “dark” role very interesting. It's really terribly difficult to make me love a bad guy, but this time I haven't had any problems with that. Especially since I adore him. <br /> <br /> Anyone who loves a good thriller / drama, which also has a dose of love and tragedy, should definitely watch this movie, without a doubt! Anyone who wants to watch a film of bloodshed by 80% should rent something else, though ... But I think the name already gives it away. This is a love story, not Saw 3. <br /> <br /> I give this film 4 out of five stars !!! Good job !!! <br /> <br /> xxx Enjoy!
