Jason Bourne is sitting in a dusty room with blood on his hands, trying to figure out what he just did. Meanwhile, the head of the CIA in New York outlines the agency’s response to what has just happened on the screen. The American flag stands proudly in the center of his desk in the foreground of the shot, but, as he says, he sticks out of focus, as his plan turns into morally questionable territory, as if he does not want to be associated with the course of action that a government person decides in the interests of national security. <br /> <br /> This frame effectively reflects the mood of the film. In addition to showing the ultimatum Born’s desire to find out how he became Jason Bourne, he also analyzes the human costs of measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security. <br /> <br /> This is also probably the best film you’ll see in this year’s movie. <br /> <br /> This is so intense. Bourne tells Simon Ross (Considine): “This is not some kind of newspaper story, but a real one,” and you almost believe him in the audience. The camera is trembling, but remains stable enough so that you can see everything and feel that you are here with Born when he tries to escape from his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem to be characters who are portrayed instead of just being actors, performing well-written roles. The scene of the militants is so cruel and dynamic that it seems instinctive, and not planned to the smallest movements; Stunt work is nothing short of amazing. <br /> <br /> The pace of stimulation is incredible. It continues on its way to completion, but not so fast that it forces you to struggle to make a plot; The script delivers the necessary information as quickly and clearly as possible before proceeding to the next stage of intense action. Although they are often simple (the Waterloo sequence is, in essence, just a person on the phone, followed by a person on the phone), they are so charged that you cannot take your eyes off of them. The film is so focused on moving forward that you cannot keep from it. <br /> <br /> With its intense fighting, the brilliant pace of the plot, and the clever analysis of the decisions made in the Name of National Security, the Bourne series is a series that accurately reflects the ambiguities of our century. Ultimatum is its peak.
