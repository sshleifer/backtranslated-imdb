The stunning black and white night cinematography, and a lot of it, underlines this supposedly true life story about the 1950s murder in Kansas, in which two men destroyed the whole family. <br /> <br /> The story was written by Truman Capote, so you get a very liberal report about the death penalty at the end of the film, which is absurd, knowing the facts of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play two unlucky atheists who distort views of life and unduly kill this beautiful family. <br /> <br /> Despite the annoying bias at the end, this is a fascinating story from the very beginning, and the cinematography makes it even more fascinating. The famous photographer Konrad Hall did a fantastic job in this direction. I want more modern films to be made in black and white. Watch it on DVD. <br /> <br /> Blake, Wilson, John Forsyth, Jeff Corey and all the supporting actors are great. My third viewing of this film took place in early April 2005, shortly after Blake in real life was declared innocent of the murder of his wife. After that, no one can not look at Blake and this film in a different way.
