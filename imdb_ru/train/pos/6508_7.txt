I grew up on Scooby and was always a fan of him. This cartoon is removed from the same old routine that can become boring for the audience. The “Rogues in a Mask” habits are aging, and this cartoon is a change from this. I'm not sure that this will replace Scooby's gang, it's just a break in the same crime scene, both for viewers and for writers. The focus of the cartoon is Scooby and Shaggy, who inherit a large amount of money and use this money to thwart plans to conquer the world from a mad scientist and his goons. From time to time there are small honors of the gang and the gangs themselves. If you're a Scooby Doo fan, you can still appreciate the connection between the boy and his talking dog, as well as the jokes that go with him. Just enjoy the cartoon and support the creators / authors and producers so that this is not the latest Scooby cartoon.
