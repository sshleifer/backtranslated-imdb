I decided to watch this movie on Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and found it one of the best films at the festival. Both leading actors demonstrate a well-thought-out, sensitive game that seems to fit the characters on a personal level. The director did a great job of bringing the characters and story to life with a skill that is not usually noticed in the first film. <br /> <br /> One interesting aspect of this film is the love of wood and New York City. (In particular, Brooklyn). Does the film revolve around family-made furniture and weave fine cinematography and carpentry and Brooklyn's everyday life ?? Thanks again to the director for this excellent choice. <br /> <br /> This is a gem, and I sincerely recommend it (Iâ€™m sure it will hit the screen).
