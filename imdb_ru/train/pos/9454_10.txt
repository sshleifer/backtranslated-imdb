In this, perhaps, the best adventure film of all time, four city guys face the wrath of nature in the history of survival. The situation in the wilderness of Georgia with its forests, mountains and wild rivers. <br /> <br /> Directed by John Burman decided to use local people, not actors, to portray secondary characters. These locals fill the film with a depth of characteristics that is unmatched in the history of cinema. No central actors could come close to the remarkable faces, voices, or actions of these people. I do not remember the film, where the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. Like everything else, it is this realism that makes this film so amazing. <br /> <br /> Another force is the theme of the film. Nature in the wild can be cruel. How appropriate is the situation in the American South? Very few places in the United States are or were as cruel as a village country. In the story of Darwinian survival of the fittest, the film conveys the idea that people are part of nature and not separated from it. <br /> <br /> “Liberation” is in many ways a product of its time, when, unlike today, the Americans expressed concern about the disappearing desert. The magnificent landscapes of the film, the sounds of birds, frogs, crickets and the roar of river rapids combined with the absence of civilization - all this conveys ecological thought. And this is another strong point of the film. <br /> <br /> At the entertainment level, the tension gradually increases as the plot progresses. Even halfway through the movie, the tension becomes excessive, and then never goes away until the final credits end. Very few films can withstand this level of intensity for such a long period of plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, the technical quality of the film is top notch. The direction and editing is flawless. Cinematography is excellent. The dialogue is interesting. And the game is awesome. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty played well and copes with its task. And John Voight was supposed to be nominated for an Oscar. If the film has a weak link, then this is music that seems shy to me. <br /> <br /> In general, “Liberation” will almost certainly appeal to viewers who love outdoor adventure. Even for those who do not, the rough characteristics, action and tension of the plot are sufficient reasons to watch this film, one of the best in the history of cinema.
