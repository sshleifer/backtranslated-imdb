I read somewhere (in a rather sharp review) that this is something like fur live anime, and I think they are on the right lines. I first watched this film when I was very small, and I was impatient to see it again, and when I finally starred quite recently, all the memories came back. I do not think that this should be taken too seriously - this is just a bit of a good old 80s film, almost television fun (this happens against the background of a rather dark future, although this point is not emphasized too much). What fascinated me most about this film is that the dialogue did not sound generalized - without clich√©s, without predictable lines - in general, just fun! Maybe time was not kind to this little film, but still I can appreciate it in me. This is by no means ideal, but it is interesting and does not try to be something else. Let the nerds and comic book guys worry about the technical details - who cares? See for yourself and make your own decision. Someone's opinion does not matter.
