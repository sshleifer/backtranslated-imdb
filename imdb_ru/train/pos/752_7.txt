Four teenage girls in the suburbs of Los Angeles get into all kinds of trouble: parties, drugs, police, mixed parents, older guys. Jodie Foster, a kind of mother-of-the-pack flock, tries to hold everyone together as a “family” (as a family unit she never had), and the heartbreaking thing about the film is that it cannot. Gradually, all grow up and go. The exact point of the plot, although it is emphasized everywhere, unfortunately, is forged. We really needed a long sequence when Scott Baio clocked a car full of gangsters on a skateboard? Or an even longer sequence - also with Bayo - where Foster has a strange monologue about the "pain of illusion." Some of the dialogues actually went in cycles, and I didn’t really like it when the end of the film was a clumsy transition from death to a wedding. But it sucks in what is basically a very sensitive story about losing a strong connection. And Jody's face in the final speaks volumes. If the audience really suffocates at the end, the film has earned it. It does not condone tears and does not require sympathy. This shows us an example of friendship and hope, which we understand. *** from ****
