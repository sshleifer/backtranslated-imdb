This movie is fun! I watched it with a friend of mine, and we just had to see it again. This film is not for film lovers who will only watch Oscar-nominated films (you know who you are.) I will not summarize this because you have seen it from all other reviews. <br /> <br /> “Whipped” is a carefree comedy that made me laugh everywhere. It does not take itself too seriously and should be watched with your friends, and not with your girlfriend. He will not win any awards, but he just needs to look to be appreciated. True, some jokes are toilet humor, but this is not necessarily bad. Everyone can use it sometimes. Some people need to clarify and see that it is “Whipped”, and not something that it is not. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 from *****.
