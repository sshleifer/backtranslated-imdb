Thelma Ritter stole the painting. I just finished watching it again. I could not become emotional in her last scene. She did not get an Oscar. That is why you should not believe too much in Oscar. Richard Widmark never had a better role, and he was the perfect actor in the role of a three-dimensional, flawed man. Gene Peters was gorgeous as a street, tough girl in her best role. And Richard Keely must have been very good; otherwise I would hate him that way. Yes, it was hard on patriotism; but without that, you don't have much of a movie. Look at their faces! The top three stars really didn't need much script. I would like them to make this film without dialogue. If you have ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in Thief, you may know what I mean. When I was a child in 1956 during my first trip to New York, I forced my uncle from the Bronx to take us to the foot of South Street in search of No. 66. It was then that I realized that Hollywood could not be trusted. But I found a river. <br /> <br /> I don’t distribute most of the story because I hate it when I know what is going on before I see it for myself. If you have seen this, no explanation is required. Just maybe, the one who reads these comments did not see “Pickup on South Street”. You'll like it; just don’t look for 66 South Street in New York.
