A walk with cavemen, organized by Alec Baldwin, is a look back on all kinds of hominids (it's us!) For the last 5 million years: who they are, what they were and how they died out. Along with a very interesting scientific view of the information we have about these views, the Walk with the cavemen also explores what makes us human. I waited a few weeks to watch this, and I was not disappointed.
