Going into this movie, I heard good things about it. Coming out of this, I was neither surprised nor disappointed. Simon Pegg plays quite childishly, as in his other films. There were a few laughs here and there - nothing funny. Probably my favorite parts of the film - this is when he dances in the club scene. I have to try it the next time I get in the club. Several stars, including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, this girl from the X-Files and Jeff Bridges. I was pretty funny to see the cameo role of Tandi Newton in the scene. She, of course, in the previous film with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a throw, you will either enjoy it to some extent, or you will find it a bit boring. I can add that in this film, Kirsten Dunst is charming. : 3
