I like this movie !!! The characters were people you could feel. The young man who returned from service is still in love with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect in the romantic leadership, and Donna Reed is always in the love of her life. The looks he throws at her, as if he is hungry because of her appearance, and also because of her indecision and confusion, and also her feelings for him were played very well. The rest of the quirky characters in the store were perfect as they tried to get them together. However, the most touching scene was a young couple in his great-grandfather's house. I laughed piece by piece, cried for some, and I really enjoyed watching this movie. In fact, I reviewed it about 5 times. A definite must see for general romance.
