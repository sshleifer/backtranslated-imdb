Me and my cool 20-year-old friends just can not get enough of this amazing park Posey CLASSIC! I tried to rent it on a DVD, but I can't seem to find it too badly, as I am sure the functions will be “special” !! :) We all highly recommend this super-awesome Flickerino comedy on a date or even just a cozy nightly party alone! It will also be the best movie to watch it with your cat, or even have a party based, for example, at the Party Girl party, just like in a movie that holds an attractive, hugging, compressible Parker Posey. in the end. Oh, and be on the lookout for an exciting and fun unexpected finale ... step aside, The Sixth Sense, you have just surpassed yourself in the best movie! Sorry, no offense, just call it as it is! Take it from the old movie buff, the comedy just doesn't get any better than “Party Girl” with Parker P! Feel it! Sincerely, Ronald Marie McDougall (aka DJ Cyber-Rap)
