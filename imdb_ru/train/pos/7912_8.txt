These things have been flying in my head for almost 10 years. Some parts of this work were truly unforgettable. - I would like to see another more recent example of a cg of spectacular awesome things. In fact, I would gladly take part in it. <br /> <br /> If I had the opportunity to just say what I wanted, that's all, I wouldn’t have to write all this extra to make “10 lines if text” as the site requires. I mean really? It almost discourages me, I mean, fortunately, for the guys who made the film, I really liked Minds Eye - and it took me 3 times to get enough lines, I hope you didn't understand me by mistake. - Yes, you did.
