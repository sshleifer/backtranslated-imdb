From the author "What happened to Baby Jane?" and "Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte," this end of the sixties horror cycle has some eerie and fun fun. Michelle McLiammuir performs a bit like Victor Buono, but too often the film dangerously approaches a bad musical ... halfway through a particularly horrible children's concert. Debbie knocks, dances tango and tricks, and the religious fanatic Winters has a lesbian advantage. Agnes Moorehead is registered as an evangelist. Weaver has nothing in common - and even has to pay a gigolo to dance with Debbie.
