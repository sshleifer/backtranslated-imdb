This is a good film, but it is not recommended if you do not like intelligent films. We are talking about two guys who want the world to disappear, and this is exactly what they get. The acting is great, the ending was not predictable, and in fact he had a good story, unlike most films in our day. People complain that the film is too simple or too boring. I think they should just stick to movies like Toxic Avenger (I really like B films) or Billy and Mandy's Dark Adventures. One note: if you notice this, he will have exactly the same actors from Cube, except for four. Take two notes: wait after the credits (trust me on this). Enjoy the movie.
