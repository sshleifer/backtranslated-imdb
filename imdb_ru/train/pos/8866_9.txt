“COSBY”, in my opinion, is the hit of CBS! I'm not sure that I have never seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It is hard to say which one is my favorite. In addition, I really liked the theme of the song. If you asked me, although I liked everything, it would be nice if Madeline Kahn didn't die during the show. Since it happened, I always wondered what the show would be like. Everyone always gave a good presentation, the design of the production was impressive, the costumes were well thought out, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although this can be seen on TBS now, I strongly recommend that you catch him in case he permanently disconnects.
