Wonderful movie, one of the best horror films of the 70s. She has realistic settings and atmosphere. As usual, these were the inevitable ordinary negative comments. I have noticed that most horror films of a certain period many times do not even reach sufficiency. Obviously, because most horror films are old and must be denigrati, this is similar to the mental mechanism that drives the minds of potential music critics here. <br /> <br /> Even before you read the review, you already knew what the final decision was. The film is a good gift, because 10 is really well done. Raines reads very well, and the film, as a way of producing it, reminds me of many Kubrick films. He is really impressed. Great movie really. I look at the anthology of the 70s film.
