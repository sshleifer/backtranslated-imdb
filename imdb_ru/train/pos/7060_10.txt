Many people point out that this film was not nearly as good as the first one. Well, maybe it's not for you. However, how does your child respond to this? Well, my loved him more than the first. <br /> <br /> Disney movies of the past can sometimes be a little harsh for small children. (For example, Bambi's mom was shot.) This film was very good for my sensitive little girl who loves humor and happy endings. <br /> <br /> If you want to be a snob on what should be Disney standards based on the past - skip this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a cute little girl or a little boy with a small heart that you really want to please, buy this film and treat your little children. This film is great as a bedtime movie for happy dreams instead of nightmares. I am satisfied with the film that my child likes, and I do not need to constantly surprise my parents.
