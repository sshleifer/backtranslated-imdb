Gray Gardens (1975) is a strange documentary by the Mazes brothers about the eccentric aunt and first cousin Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, who live like pigs in a 28-room mansion in East Hampton, Long Island. 78, witty and dry, and her daughter, “Little Edie” Beal, 56 years old (emotionally about 13 years old), still a beautiful woman who once had a promising future, lives in isolation from the rest of the world, with the exception of their many cats and raccoons in the attic. They have fun by bickering all day long, listening to the radio, or singing to each other (they don't even have a TV). Their fall from society is amazing, and the audience is drawn to these two very unusual, although obviously unsuccessful people. . One of the best documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today.
