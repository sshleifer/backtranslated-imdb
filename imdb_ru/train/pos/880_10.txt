Probably the best movie of the year for me. This small French film is dedicated to the secretary working in the office of Carla (Emmanuel Devos), who spends the days doing other people's work, without credits, and being a source of their contempt and talk during the lunch break, which she understands too much, since she is partially deaf. reading lips The change takes effect when she hires the newly conditionally released con Paul (Vincent Cassel) as her assistant. Relationships that develop between them are the focus of the film. Mutual dependence, for very different reasons, binds them. Carla is fond of Paul and the fact that he makes her feel attractive for the first time. Paul does nothing to dispel her feelings, because he needs her help. He owes the money to the local gangster and makes a plan to steal from him, which will include the ability to read Karlasâ€™s lips. I think the main thing that pushes the film above the average voltage / drama is an amazing chemistry between two stars. Throughout the film, no matter what other characters on the screen, you can feel this amazing connection between Carla and Paul. I can't remember when I witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors. Emmanuel Devos gives a brilliant performance (she won the French Cesar for Best Actress). You never feel that you are watching a role, this is really Carla. The chameleon, like Vincent Cassel, is also wonderful. He makes a somewhat unattractive character, attractive and attractive. I liked this film because of these two people, and both times, when I finished watching it, I wanted to go back to the movies and get in touch with them again.
