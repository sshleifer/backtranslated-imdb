Whoopi was the only reason I watched Oscar this year. She is fun. Of course, the show had a serious and serious side. She was great not only because she was funny, but also because she said some things that had to be said at a public forum. White people need to be reminded that the awards ceremonies, employment and representation in Hollywood are NOT racially unbalanced. There should be no need for "black" show awards. Nominators and judges of white bread, milk heat should raise their heads in the sun and see that the magnificent material is not limited to “white” directors, producers, actors, etc. Woody Allen's thing on the air was the depth of bad taste. He had no business there. The fact is that this is the first Oscar presentation that I have watched since "The Color Purple" was awarded with awards. This miscarriage of voting upset me on watching the show until 2002. What should not denigrate other speakers. Billy Crystal is a riot.
