This is a dramatic film in the full sense of the word. The tail says that here, in Greece, we live as usual everyday life, not realizing how sad it is. Of course, he has some extremes ... but from time to time, real sadness surpasses art. It is deeply critical to the goals we pursue, and the whole social structure is built around them. The film has a deeper understanding of the Greek way of life, stereotypes and social structure. Unlike most Greek films that have a specific fast-food audience, this film is not focused on anyone specifically, but when you watch it, you feel like someone is picking the best words and pictures to describe your feelings. . I am also not a big fan of traditional music, but I would not like to hear anything else when it was played during the film. <br /> <br /> If someone told me to say something against this film, I would define the following, sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or somewhat abbreviated. I think that editing should have cut it to fit 2 hours and a bit for theaters. <br /> <br /> In any case, I could write more and more to express my thoughts on this, but I think you should see this and discuss it with a friend. Must see
