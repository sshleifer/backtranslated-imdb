At first you think another Disney movie, it might be good, but this is a children's movie. But when you watch it, you can't help but enjoy it. All ages will love this movie. I first saw this film when I was 10 years old, and now, after 8 years, I still love it! Danny Glover is great and can't play his part better. Christopher Lloyd is fun and perfect for the role. Tony Danza is as believable as Mel Clark. You can't help but enjoy this movie! I put it on 10/10!
