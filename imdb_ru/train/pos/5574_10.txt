Peter M. Cohen has a winner satire on the marriage game, turned inside out and turned inside out. Critical beating of the film in the main publications in the media as “offensive” and “rude” only emphasizes its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated distinction between people's sexual interests and passions. This is the tradition of what I call “reality-based” satire, following in the footsteps of “In the company of men,” “Chasing Amy,” “Your friends and neighbors,” and “Two girls and a guy.” Cohen's dialogue is very cheerful, and I was constantly intrigued by how well he caught the real pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zori Barber and Jonathan Abrahams are three excellent ruthless predator sex-obsessed, who along with the foil of their recently married friend (perfectly played by Judah Domke) are turned over by their own terms as a female predator (Amanda Pete). Under the satirical surface hides a romantic comedy, much more pleasant than most sugar coated studio products.
