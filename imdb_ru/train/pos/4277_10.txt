“Ko Tamo Peva” is one of the best films I've ever seen. Tragic comedy with very deep consequences for the fate of humanity, shown by the eyes of seemingly very simple and simple people from the abandoned Serbian province shortly before the outbreak of World War II. I saw it in a small cinema in Russia, where the film had a very limited distribution, and since then I have not had the opportunity to face it. It is a pity that this great film is almost forgotten. I searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it many times, and alas - could not find one. I would be very grateful to other fans of this little gem of filmmaking for suggesting ways to buy a copy.
