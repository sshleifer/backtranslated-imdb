This is a strange, cerebral, surreal, esoteric film. If there is such a thing as “intellectual horror”, then this is a movie. I began to be afraid and wanted someone else to watch me, and he hardly has a plot! I will have to watch this film several times before I feel that I really understand him. If you are the person who likes “My Dinner with Andre” and Godard’s films, or if you take a lot of drugs, you will surely love this movie. Wow.
