I just looked at this version of "Samhain", and although I still like it, it is nothing more than the "draft" version that I have. If you check the bulletin board, you will see an apology from the director for this trimmed version, 79 minutes, and he says that he has nothing to do with this trimmed editor with R-rating with a brand new spoiled ending. Christian doesn’t really need to distance himself so much, because the basic elements of the blood are still standing, although they are severely curtailed. It's a hell of a shame, because it could be one of the worst and best films in recent years. He still has a porn star, and inbreds, and some of the extreme gore can be at least partially visible. I am just glad that I have this “draft”, because for me it is a pearl for any mountain hounds library. Christian Wil definitely has the skill and vision to deliver goods, and hopefully his next project will be better prepared. The idiots in their hands were almost a classic, and they screwed up for everyone. Samhain may be one of the most controversial and poorly managed horror films in history, and too bad hounds did not understand what the director intended. <br /> <br /> *************************************** *** Just to let you know that you missed, this is my review based on the SAMHAIN "working print". <br /> <br /> The film lasts just over 90 minutes and has no chapter stops. There is absolutely no musical soundtrack, and some scenes have no sound in the dialogue, because I think they are meant to be repeated later. However, most of the movie has sound with sound effects, and when there is no effect or scene, the message appears as a signal to insert when the movie is completed. This is exactly what is written, “Rough Cut”, BUT the only uncut version of “Samhain” you can ever see. The reason, because the blood is extremely graphic, is much more than what the NC-17 would allow. Yes, there are some porn stars, but they are only there for the kill, and add some sugar and spices. The story is pretty standard; American tourists rest in Ireland and end up in the house in the middle of the forest. A region rich in folklore, including the ancient Druids and the celebration of the Samhain, or, as we call it, Halloween. (creepy) <br /> <br /> The film begins with a HUGE dose of blood as the camping couple is attacked by one of the local inbred mutants. This is a great scene when a guy finds his girl hanging on a rock, and she asks for help. All he sees is her head, hands and shoulders hanging in front of him, and when he pulls her up, she was completely divided into two parts. This is what I would call EXTREMELY LAYER, with viscera, blood and severed limbs everywhere. We are in the territory of Gershella Gordon Lewis, guys, except that the effects look much more realistic. I'm going to just skip this story, because this is your standard story about the pursuit and murder. <br /> <br /> The next scene of bloodshed can be seen, since the guy from the first murder is taken to a cave similar to the location. (TCM-2 material), and are tied to the table. Then this geek cuts off all his limbs (from the camera, using the cue to insert the scene), and then we see his torso on the barbecue pit slowly turning over the fire, and the torso has a hard switch (if you can believe it). Yes, very bad taste, coarse, disgusting, you find the right word, and it will probably also work. <br /> <br /> Then Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and everything else, is cut from the neck to the perineum, and all her insides are stretched out in graphic glee, and her blood flows into the pot. Yummy, real twist? Yes? <br /> <br /> But the best scene of bloodshed takes place in the house, and I must admit that this is one of the best scenes of bloodshed I have seen. This guy (no matter who) is caught behind the geek and cut from the hole in the ass. Then the geek puts his hands and pulls out all the insides of the guys, intestines and what the hell else is there, right from his asshole. This continues FOREVER as the guy screams and more and more entrails are pulled out, spreading all over the floor in the bathroom. It is so extreme, so exorbitant, that I suddenly laughed. Obviously, you will NEVER see this scene on your own DVD, IMO, along with most of the other really extreme bloody scenes. <br /> <br /> So, what to think about all this. Well, first of all, although I doubt that this film will ever be released in this completely uncut presentation, it makes this “Rough Cut” a rare bead decoration. Yes, at first it is a little difficult, without a soundtrack, a few scenes that still need to be inserted, and captions with missing names everywhere. But this is what makes it so unique, and I would not trade it for anything right now. Extreme blood, yes, yes, extreme blood. This makes "Haute Tension" look like a Disney movie.
