There is so much to say about this movie “B”. <br /> <br /> “B” may be related, but not commissionable. This is the best of the genre I've ever seen. Grade A by Universal. The script is well done, creatively and without errors. Writing credits: Howard Higgin's original story and Douglas Hodges story, John Colton (screenplay). Directed by Lambert Hiller did a very good job with a complex plot and plot locations. Do not save on loads and supplements. I loved Beulah Bondy (Jimmy Stewarts' mother is in the film “It's a wonderful life.” Frances Drake, the leading role of a woman, a beauty and with grace and pathos coped with her husband in Karloff. Lugoshes also beat correctly. it was there. As I said, there was so much good: the discovery of radium "X" in Africa, the thawing of stone statues ((somewhat reminiscent of the Ten Little Indians in And Then Not (Agata) Christie) (version of Barry Fitzgerald)) Karloff's glow in the dark. Karloff's mother played Violet Kemble Cooper with elegance And because of all these virtues, I believed in the science that she portrayed. I think this is a sign of a good work of art.
