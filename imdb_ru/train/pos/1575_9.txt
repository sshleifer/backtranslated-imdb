“Rosenstrasse” is the best film I have seen in recent years. In fact, I am not very interested in films with a historical past, but because of this she deserved my interest by this time !! <br /> <br /> The only thing that annoys the film is the scenes in New York and the impression that I was “trying to be as American as possible” ... which, I think, did not help at all. <br /> <br /> scenes in the back really came to my heart. German actress Katya Riemann fully deserved her award. She is one of the most impressive actresses I've ever seen. in the future I will watch more of her films. I am very lucky that I speak German =) and only for a year in the USA, therefore, as soon as I return, I will buy several Riemann DVDs. <br /> <br /> so everyone there who has not seen this movie: LOOK THIS !!! I think it would be too long to describe what it is still about, it is especially difficult to remember all the flashes and temporary changes, but just watch this, you will be piquant !!!!!!!
