This is one of my favorite movies ever, and although it may seem too slow for some, itâ€™s worth a look. A corporate lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is involved in the case of "urban" Aboriginal people, and this is not an ordinary case. Well, the man died, but it was not an ordinary murder. Recently, there has also been more than average rainfall, and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic and depressing. Natives hide a secret and refuse to spill the beans. This is largely due to the fact that white people make assumptions about the "urban" and "tribal" aborigines, and, of course, no one Abo in the big city will not practice tribal techniques. Yeah. Chamberlain had strange dreams, and he was somehow the key to what was happening, although, no matter how many times I saw it, I cannot understand the exact connection. This is a very creepy and creepy movie, and is a great example of Peter Weyr's ability to create tension from nothing. The ending is a little ambiguous, but I understand it literally, this is the easiest and most terrible way out. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
