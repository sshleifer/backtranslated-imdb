Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is a very lost player in the short-cartoons market. Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies dominate this market. But MGM can also release hidden jewels, such as To Spring, an amazing story about the most beautiful season of the year. /> <br /> In the medium shown here, spring is not caused by natural cycles, but is made. And by whom? Young male elves who live underground. Every spring, when the snow starts to melt, they start to work. They start by cutting rainbow stone columns, then turn them into rubble and use this rubble to turn it into colored liquids that will move to the ground and bring grass, flowers ... In other words, spring! The first half of the cartoon depicts the making of spring, but the second part is slightly different. The old man Winter is returning, and he is trying to prolong the winter, destroying the work of the elves. Thus, from this point on, we help in the battle between the elves and the Old Man in Winter. <br /> <br /> The music you listen to here is amazingly beautiful. Melodious pieces are stuck in the head like an ink stain on a piece of paper. Melodies of the second part excite and perfectly fit into action. It's fantastic, Giorgio! Animated sequences are also admired. The colors are well mixed, and every little detail is presented in a huge epic setting. The concept itself is brilliant. Elves attract characters, as does Old Man Winter, which effectively portrays the cold and ruthless feelings of the white season. <br /> <br /> There is also a strong idea here. It seems that the battle for the elves is eventually lost, until one of the late elves enters the battle and leads to the victory of the elves in the winter. So the bottom line is that only one person can make a difference. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "To Spring" is a wonderful lost classic of the era of short cartoons. What is even more remarkable, the director of this cartoon debuted here. And who is the director of "By the Spring"? This is a kind of William Hannah ...
