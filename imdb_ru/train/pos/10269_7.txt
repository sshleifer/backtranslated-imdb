In the spirit of the classic “Sting”, this film amazes where it really hurts ... in the heart! The dude, the real psychiatrist, thirsty for adventures, meets the dirtiest and rotten of scoundrels. Vulnerable doctor falls in love with the villain’s career and asks him to take part in his operation. As the film moves slowly, its climax and finale are just awesome! You will especially like how the doctor "forgives himself"!
