I love Tudor Chirila and maybe that's why I liked the movie so much. Two days before the filmâ€™s premiere, I went to see his concert. I saw the trailer and the video "zmeu" before the movie, and I thought I understood everything ... I was wrong: instead of a good movie, I helped a great one! I felt the movie. it was sad ... it was funny ... but most of all it was LOVE ... I can't even begin to describe the soundtrack ... so I won't :) I am not a film critic ... I can not describe it in a few words. My little vague description is all because the play left me silent. Thank God for the keyboard. Encore! :)
