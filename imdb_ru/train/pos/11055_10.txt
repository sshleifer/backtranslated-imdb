Well what can I say, except for these people Super in all respects. I really like Sharon Macready, I enjoy this pure nostalgic series. I have a boxed set of 9 discs, 30 episodes, I did not realize that they had done so much, I also think that it is a great shame that they did not do it anymore when they knock me off the cycle, somewhere, when they knock me off my feet, and then I wake up in a special hospital. Later I discovered that my body had improved. Like Richard Barratt. These stories are 50 minutes of pure action and are completely unknown. You cannot fight these three people, as they will defeat you in all types of weapons. The music is well written, and it seems to me that in my head there is a beautiful picture of three super creatures. The powers that champions possess are the same as those of our domestic dog or cat, Improved vision, Improved hearing and touch. and the strength of 10 men for Richard and Craig and the strength of 3 women for Sharon. Who I thought was beautiful and smart. When I was a boy, I was very in love with her !!!! Now I can understand why, on my DVD. The box is very beautiful and comes with a free booklet about the series. I also thought that Triman was a good boss, a firm, but he was successful!
