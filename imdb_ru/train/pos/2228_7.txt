The main problem I see in this film is his assessment, which screams with every note: "This is a movie with a cheap ass." There is nothing more to say. The score just sucks. <br /> <br /> The second problem, which I consider to be quite serious, as well as the plot promotion at the end of the film (one of the most successful, if you are a testament), is the dialogue between Martha (Adrienne Barbo) and the sunflower (Richard Siman ), in which Martha is the leader of the experiment. During this dialogue, the viewer is very well aware that he / she is listening to the dialogue of the film. In other words, the suspension of disbelief ceases here. The integrity of a plausible dialogue between two people is sacrificed in order that the filmmakers want to convey information to the audience. <br /> <br /> The third problem was the castration of Adriena Barbo. Although I truly believe that she was an incredible actress in her work, I feel that this part may have been too stretch. The main point of her performance, which seemed to not be combined, was the range in which the character moves through the film from a loving mother from a dysfunctional family to an almost Rambo-like woman on a mission. This aspect of the script, obviously, would have been strained for any actress, and therefore too much blame cannot be placed on Barbo. However, to the extent that she has played her role quite competently, I would call it only a moderately serious problem for the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film did an excellent job in the first half of the building. creep factor, especially during his flashes of horror. I feel that the film would benefit from a greater commitment to these flares as a mechanism to prevent the creep factor from splashing in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> What is my holistic assessment of this piece? I would give a firm estimate of C + for B-, depending on how many credits you are inclined to give the creators for the production of this film with a limited budget. Even with two serious and two moderately serious problems, the film is based on the solid plot of the Jungian side of Nazi mysticism. I do not see problems with the development of the plot or coherence; the dialogue, with the exception of the above, is absolutely brilliant in some places, especially the most important key scene between the mother and daughter at the beginning of the film; as already mentioned, the creep factor was well developed, although slightly hot-tempered in the second half; and Nicholas Brendan, who was also involved in the production, gave a wonderful performance. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is definitely worth seeing - watch it by the Nazi you love :)
