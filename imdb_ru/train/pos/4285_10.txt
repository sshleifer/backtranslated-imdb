This “tragicomedy”, written by the famous Serbian theater / film writer Dusan Kovacevic, is probably one of the best films ever made in the comedy category. And yet, his appearance as a theater play, turned into a feature film, has nothing to do with its value. A masterpiece that should not be missed (preferably with subtitles, not duplicated). <br /> <br /> In the old bus heading to the capital Belgrade, the approaching war decides the behavior of the passengers. Two gypsy musicians sing about their pitiful life, but also foresee the coming tragedy; their singing divides and connects the scenes in this unusual road film (the real brothers Kostichi are amateur actors, but together with Stanozlo Milinkovitch, as a farmer, who plows the road, gives a real idea). <br /> <br /> The range of characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing war, an understanding of the collective personality of a nation: everyone knows that war is just beginning, but they try to live their lives as best they can, hoping that ignorance can prevent tragedy, Using the simple language of films, director Slobodan Siyan paints a picture of society torn apart by the previous war (World War I), but also highlights personal portraits with success: the singer’s provinciality, the inexperience of the newlyweds, the seriousness of the Great War veteran, the cat ing is on his way to visit his son's newly designed and gloomy forecasts from a man who seems to be a German spy. <br /> <br /> Brilliant in his narration, with a memorable soundtrack (especially Gypsy songs) and a tuned atmosphere, well photographed and edited, this feature (Siyan’s debut) was only an introduction to the series of directors of bitter-sweet comedies that define Serbian 1980s cinematography: “Maratonci trce pocasni krug”, “How systematically it sounds like an idiot” and beloved by my other director “Davitel against the presser”).
