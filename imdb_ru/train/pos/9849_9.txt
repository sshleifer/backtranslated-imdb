When I saw the trailers, I just needed to watch a movie. And when I had a feeling, I felt dissatisfied. It was a great movie, do not get me wrong, but I think that there are great places in the trailers, if you understand my drift. Everything went very fast and went on, so I was never bored, and I liked to watch it. The humor was absolutely great. My first contact with a sloth (or something like that).
