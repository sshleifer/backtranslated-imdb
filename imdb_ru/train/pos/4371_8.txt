When Braveheart first came out, I was delighted and, admittedly, was one of the most rabid fans of the film. When Rob Roy came out, I was intrigued, and although I liked the movie, I did not think it was a great movie. Over time, however, my appreciation of Rob Roy increased, and my enthusiasm for Braveheart decreased. Of course, a brave heart is great entertainment, but there are also disadvantages. The most significant, in my opinion, is the unflattering image of Robert the Bruce, who, no doubt, was the greatest king of Scotland. The other is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which casts a shadow on the film in proportion to many historical distortions. I think that I am also worried about the fact that it is in this film, apparently only (at least by me) in retrospect, the beginning of Mel Gibson's egomania can be clearly seen for the first time. On the contrary, Rob Roy has grown on me over the years. Partly because it largely avoids the mistakes that I speak most about in Braveheart. But also because Rob Roy is like a good wine, each time becoming more mature and complex.
