The last great film of Gosha of the 1960s. A determined stylist with a great sense of dedication to his films, Gosha teamed up with Shintaro Katsu (from the glory of Zatoichi) to create this horrible accusation of thoughtless nationalist loyalty. <br /> <br /> “Tenchu” (heavenly judgment) is a word that loyalists shout to the emperor, killing enemies or “traitors” of the deed. Katsu plays along with his character's ingenuous devotion to manipulating politics in the name of patriotic pride. Anyone who asks questions to a politician is labeled as a “traitor” and becomes the target of the kill. <br /> <br /> One of the best films ever made, many of whose shots are incredible compositions of form, color and light. The fighting scenes are frequent, very bloody and cruel. The blood becomes part of the color palette that Gosh uses for his images. Great and anxious. Although personal history is easy to follow, historical background is difficult, and although a basic history lesson for this time in Japan would be very useful, you can get through the film without it. Several drawbacks of the film are the music track, the length and the occasional experiences of Katsu. He has a drunken scene that rolls over in the film, but in fact a very accurate description of the drunk. <br /> <br /> Sad, but one of the best films about Chambaras.
