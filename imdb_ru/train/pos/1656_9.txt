“Thieves and liars” give us a very naturalistic idea of ​​the levels of corruption that affect many Puerto Ricans and make them make difficult, if not impossible, choices regarding the lives of them and their loved ones. The cast is excellent, given that some of them are not professional actors; A great choice that increases the level of reality in the film. Photography promotes the story without interference, as it should be in this type of film. The script very deeply reflects the characteristics and attitudes of "Boricuas" Sometimes it seems that you are watching a documentary! Watching this film, you feel as if you have secretly entered into a real Puerto Rican society and stand unnoticed, watching it explode. I like it!
