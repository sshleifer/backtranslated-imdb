Such films are difficult to evaluate because you value them by production or just by fun? <br /> <br /> I saw this movie around 1988/89 or so when I was a boy, and I’m very sorry to say this started a ninja lifelong hobby. The plot is pretty awful, and the acting is, of course, terrible, but in this film there is some mysticism surrounding the ninja that creates a pretty good atmosphere. It is important that the battle scenes, although “small”, are really good. <br /> <br /> I must say that I was better as a child, only now I can see unbelievable stunning nonsense. in the film, but as a martial arts film “laze around with a few beers,” I can't blame him, it delivers and is much better than a mountain of rubbish in the style of “American Ninja” that shook in the 80s with hundreds of guys in black costumes, but not really very good fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> In an interesting note, Dusty Nelson, a writer and director of Sakura Killers, made another film about ninjas under the banner of the Bonaire movie called “White Phantom”. I have no idea if this was supposed to be a continuation of Sakura Killers ", but the Sakura clan is again the main feature, including the same logo and a similar story only this time, including the White Ninja. This is also, although mostly horrible, I had a slight sense of atmosphere, but the fighting scenes are even more rare and, frankly, quite terrible. <br /> <br />, if you are a martial arts fan, then kill a few hours!
