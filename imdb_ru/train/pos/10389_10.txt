I saw this movie when I was a kid. It blew me away. This was before the TV days, so a film of this magnitude could send a young child into orbit. It struck me so much that I went to watch this film for twelve days in a row. The special effects used at this time were far ahead of their time. Sabu was a real treat, as was Rex Ingram as Jin. I found myself singing "I want to be a sailor" for several months after the film left town. I would recommend this film to everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Weidt, who was as villainous as you might want to meet. In addition, June Duprez was never more beautiful than she was in this picture. The color was outstanding. Give this movie AAA!
