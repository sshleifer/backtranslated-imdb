After watching several films about Villarrag, I had a rather clear opinion about him - he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting about the rhythm of the film. That is why, despite good criticism, his films never attracted the attention of a wide audience. In ARo, he follows the same line, but really improved the rhythm, especially at the end of the film. Honestly, I overslept the first part, because, although the first part provides the necessary information, it is really slow. Nevertheless, the second part is absolutely amazing and makes the whole film the best film that Villarong has ever shot. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
