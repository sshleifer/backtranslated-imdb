My father grew up watching George Reeves in the role of Superman, and when I was little, he had episodes on VHS, and he let me watch them, including this film (distributing them in the family, if you like), and I liked it. <Br /> <br /> Clarke Kent and Lois Lane are sent to a small city with an oil mine, and moles, radioactive and haunted by the city, appear to be deadly, and Superman must stop this mess. <br /> <br /> It's just great and fun. Special effects and sound in the old style - the team took off such beauty with such a small technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was little, and I am now 16 years old, it just shows how endless and classic these adventures are.
