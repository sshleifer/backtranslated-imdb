Definitely in the top five best films of John Garfield should be the Pride of the Marine Corps. This is the true story of an ordinary Marine, Al-Shmid, who, at the cost of his own gaze, being injured, kept the crowd from storming the Japanese on Guadalcanal. <br /> <br /> The story is perfectly divided into three parts: Al Schmid's home life, where he is just a hardworking man who takes the woman seriously and loves nothing better than his bowling night. Pearl Harbor is bombed, and he goes to war, like millions of others. <br /> <br /> The second part is in Guadalcanal, and we see part of the action, where he is in an isolated machine gun nest, holding the Japanese troops. His actions did not allow him to capture the position of the Marine Corps, but there is a grenade in his vision. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the third part is his painful adaptation to civilian life and the belief that people do not just take care of themselves. out of pity, he most of all is the girl he saw at Eleanor Parker. <br /> <br /> This film was broadcast on TCM on the day of the 95th birthday of John Garfield, and his daughter shot a documentary about Garfield. One of the respondents said that Garfield was an actor, the most plausible in the role of the working class in having and having a trade union card. <br /> <br /> In this regard, he was lucky that he landed with Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Despite the fact that he continued to receive roles in gangster roles in the tradition of this studio, Garfield was amazing in these roles because of his past, because he came from the life that Al Schmid had, with the exception of Garfield's Jewish origin. <br /> <br /> In this respect, he perfectly played the role of the hero of the working class, such as Al Schmid, who took responsibility for the defense of his country. There is no superhero here, just a guy who would prefer to return to Philadelphia, but do the work that needed to be done. <br /> <br /> This is a great role for Garfield. This is a movie not to be missed. I wonder what ever happened to the real Al Schmid.
