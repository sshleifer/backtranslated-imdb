“This is a 70s show,” by far the funniest show currently on television. I started watching it about two and a half years ago, and as soon as I saw it, I realized that it was a great show. I like all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was a terrific character while he was there, I really hope that he will come back because he is funny. It's a classic when Fez says, “You son of a bitch!” And when Kelso screams “burn!”, It always makes me laugh. They are both wonderful characters and can always say something funny. Hot Jackie is another reason to watch the show; She began to be very beautiful, but, damn, somewhere in the 5-6 season she became very hot. I have seen most episodes more than once, some like 10 times, and it's still fun. This is one of the few shows that I can watch again and again and still laugh at the same as the first time I saw him. The cast is classic; almost all funny, where with many shows there are only a few funny characters. I will be sad to see that this show will end next year, but it will be on the air as one of the best shows ever.
