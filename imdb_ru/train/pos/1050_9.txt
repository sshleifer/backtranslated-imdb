This amazing documentary film gives us a glimpse of the lives of courageous women in the judicial system of Cameroon - women police officers, lawyers and judges. Despite the enormous difficulties - lack of funds, desperate poverty of people, numerous languages ​​and numerous legal precedents depending on the region of the country and the religious / ethnic origin of the plaintiffs and respondents - these bold, strong women make Difference. <br /> <br /> This is a rare thing - a truly inspirational film that restores a little faith in humanity. Despite the atrocities that we see in the film, justice is justified by these passionate, hardworking women. <br /> <br /> I only hope that this film will be widely distributed in the United States. The more people see this movie, the better.
