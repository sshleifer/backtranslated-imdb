Making a book in a movie following a page history is NEVER a good idea. When people read a book, they automatically start making their own “mental film” about how the characters look, where they exist, how situations develop. And everyone has a different opus, so when the film “REAL” finally comes out, you will always have a tick from viewers who are disappointed that it simply does not measure up. <br /> <br /> All that the writer and director can count on is their own vision of the film and the hope that it is as close as possible to what its audience expects. /> <br /> There is no better reason for this situation than movies based on the novels of Stephen King. When directors capture at least the essence of his stories, the results can be exciting and truly terrifying (CARRIE, "SALEM'S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE"), or they can be what fans consider to be a terrible mess (version THE THE Kubrick's THE THE SHINING; mini-series for IT and TOMMYKNOCKERS). <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this is not even close to King’s ideal adaptation, there are so many things in PET SEMATARY that cause deep, uneven skin that seemed to spill onto the screen right from the book, that you can largely forgive his faults. For this, we have to thank the director of the music video that became the film, Mary Lambert (she also shot SIESTA, not really a horror film, but another bizarre thing you should see on the list), working on the script for the Man-Human himself and, perhaps one of his best. <br /> <br /> Since most of you know the story, I will not put you to sleep with too many details. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) moved his family to the perfect cottage home. Well, almost perfectly, with the exception of two unpleasant small details: a dangerously busy section of the interstate highway in front and a large pet cemetery in the forest behind. Since Louis is a vet and has a small child for his son ... well, even if you haven’t read the book, do the damn math. In the end, this is the story of the king, so there is no mystery what this will lead to. <br /> <br /> Not only the destination is important here, but the creepy stops along the way. Some scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to a shivering, screaming life here: the terrible memory of Rachel Creed (STAR ​​TREK'S Denise Crosby) about her terminally ill, crippled sister; Louis encounters a deadly wounded runner, Victor Pascoe (Brad Greenquist), both before and after his death; a trip to the "other" graveyard behind the pet graveyard. And this third act ... if he doesn't give you some nightmares, maybe you should check your pulse. <br /> <br /> Good performances of all here, especially the late Fred Gwynn, as a good neighbor Judge Crandall, who received the best line in the story, which summarizes everything: "Sometimes the dead are better." <br /> <br /> The only issue with the film version is the casting of Louis' son, Gage. (Miko Hughes). Knowing that it would be pretty damn almost impossible to get the idea a child needed at that age to make a deal on this issue, Lambert and his team were still doing their best, and unfortunately, Hughes was too damn cute at that time “Sell” his alleged role as an evil demon-possessed zombie. It takes you out of the movie whenever it appears, although the scenes in which it is shot are still masterfully staged (especially the scene of Gwynn's death.) <br /> <br /> Besides, everything else is about as good as it becomes. Carrie still holds the title for King's best adaptation, as I understand it; but SEMATARY is right in the top five. <br /> <br /> Still, would something adapted for the screen based on the King’s book be as terrifying as reading the story? Not bloody, most likely ... for now.
