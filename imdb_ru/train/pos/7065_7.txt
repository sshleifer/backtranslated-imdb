A cute film about three lively sisters from Switzerland (who can often be seen in matching outfits) who want to bring their parents together (it seems the mother still carries the torch for the father) - so they go to New York to prevent the father from marrying the blonde gold miner whom he calls "Precious." Dad did not see his daughters for ten years, they (oddly enough) do not seem to mind and do not think that he is wonderful, and at the same time a Precious man seems to lead a life largely controlled by her powerful mother (Alice Brady), a woman who just wants to see her daughter marry a rich man. The sisters had the idea to push the Precious on the path of a drunken Hungarian earl, deceiving two gold prospectors to think that he was one of the richest men in Europe. But the case of an erroneous identity makes the girls think that the count is cute Ray Milland, who agrees with the scheme, because he is in love with Sister Kay. <br /> <br /> This movie is a nice, light fare, Barbara Read how Kay looks cute and cute, Ray Milland looks very young and beautiful here (although, unfortunately, sheâ€™s not given much), Alice Brady is pretty good as intriguer - but this is Dinna Durbin, a real charming and sweet as the button plays the younger sister Penny, who pretty much steals the show. With absolutely beautiful vocals, she sings a few songs throughout the film, although I would really like them to show it even more in this. The plot in this film is a bit silly, but, nevertheless, I found the film interesting and fun.
