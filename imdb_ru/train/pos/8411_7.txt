This early version of The Apprentice of Prague was made in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener (who was also in Golem a few years later). In this film, he plays a double role (technically impressive for a 95-year-old film to see them in one frame) after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a deal with him for the gold — the gold he needs to achieve the Countess, which he previously rescued from drowning. <br /> <br /> Moving at a fast pace (the film lasts just over an hour) and is pretty well written and characterized, “The Student of Prague” has echoes of the legend of Faust and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, starting with the pact with the mysterious figure of potential evil, and turning into the good and evil sides of the same person.
