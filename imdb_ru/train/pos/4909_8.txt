Most New Orleans films or his shootings turn out to be ridiculously bad and ridiculously inaccurate (for example: remember “The Savage Bees”? But I will make an exception for “Tightrope,” which almost understood everything). <br /> <br /> Here is one that is not always wrong. Accents are not so bad (yes, the accent is “Yat” here is much more Brooklyn than the southern one), the city of 1950 is shown as it was / was without mandatory “tourist” pictures, and they understand the drama well, not trying to make everyone "strange southerner". <br /> <br /> One of the few films dedicated to this city, and a good movie to download ..
