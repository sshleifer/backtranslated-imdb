This film is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave him 10 ratings. The story of the famous "Bush hackers" from Missouri, who fought on the side of the South during the interstate war. The clothes they wore were genuine, the story and why they fought were very accurate and well studied. In fact, there was one of the battles that did not take place, as they portrayed ... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well played and were either the most brilliant of the actors, or the director really knows how to get the most out of them. I suspect it was a mix of great directing, super casting to find the right people and great acting. Not just one or two ... this film is really stunned! It has action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual point of view) and the story - all in one movie. Even the future of Spider-Man and Jewelry. And she is good!
