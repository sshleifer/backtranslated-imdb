The first Lost series started with a bang ... literally and slowly declining at a pace. This may have alienated some of the viewers, and people who started looking halfway either got bored or just confused. <br /> <br /> I would advise newcomers in the world of Lost to just watch from the very beginning and not be distracted by slower episodes. The acting skills are excellent, but why are 5 episodes scheduled ... WHY ??? All this means that at least 4 years there will be no answers, oh, well, I will continue to monitor that tensions and dialogue continue.
