Like a film, it barely values ​​4, but for fans of cinema from the period of the 1940s, it is almost certainly necessary to see and rate 9 as a variety show! I was attracted to watch the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb, who plays the colonel in charge of this event. What surprised me was the amazing performance of Doris Day. With the exception of Calamity Jane, I have never seen her put a song better than she is here. Randolph Scott is also remembered, even if he does not see much time on the screen. It has been a long time since I watched the movie, but I was almost sure that Humphrey Bogart would appear. With many familiar faces it is difficult to track. If he ever appears on a television station near you, be sure to watch the Doris Day sequence, if nothing else! <br /> <br />
