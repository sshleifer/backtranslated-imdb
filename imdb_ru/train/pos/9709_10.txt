Once I first stumbled upon LoG while watching television: since then I have never missed episodes. <br /> <br /> This is humor, very strange, like a cross between the social commentary of Brass Eye, the excellent Fast Show, one line, and an amazing storyline that seems to evolve every week and is not going anywhere. The best example of this was the special materials of Hillary Briss - what is this all about? <br /> <br /> Not everyone will like the humor. Someone will say that he is too sick, and it is easy to understand where they come from. Try it nonetheless. If you don’t like it, don’t watch it, but if you like it, you will be very happy that you accepted my advice.
