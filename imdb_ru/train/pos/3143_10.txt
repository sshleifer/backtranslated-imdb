If any show over the past ten years deserves 10, it is this rare gem. This allows us to go back to the times when everything was easier and more fun. Filled with heart and laughter, this show makes you laugh through three decades of difference. The furniture was ugly, the clothes were colorful, and even drugs were tolerant. The hair was feathered, the music was accompanied by roller skating, and, according to Merle Haggard, "the joint was a bad place to live." Embark on a journey back to the greatest time in American history. Fall in love with the characters and feel the good essence of a small town where people were nicer to each other. This classic is on television as much as Full House. Do not miss it, and always remember to "shake your groove thing !!!"
