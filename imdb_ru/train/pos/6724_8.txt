As a popular sport, many people like surfing. Immediately after watching the documentary, I realized how dangerous it is. In fact, surfers are also afraid of big waves. Even someone was killed by this. But they continued to surf and had fun. This can only be done by brave people. <br /> <br /> Judging by what the surfers said, we can clearly know how they felt when a big wave rolled over them. You must adapt to your efforts and avoid the direct impact of a big wave. When you win it, it will surely bring you immense satisfaction. <br /> <br /> It is impossible not to notice the amazing cinematography. This is just visual enjoyment. <br /> <br /> Excellent sports documentary. 8/10
