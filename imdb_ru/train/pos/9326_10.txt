I have to be honest and say that I bought this film, not because of the content, but because David Cubitt is in it; I know ... finely or what? - but, come on, Mr. Kubitt is, to say the least, a fantastic actor. <br /> <br /> I really didn’t know what to expect from watching this film, I would read another article and these on other sites, but I must say that I was drawn into the world of the brothers almost from the very beginning. David Kubitt as Theo and Kolm Theor as Ryan are as believable as two alien brothers, the film goes through their relationship when they start trying to get to know each other again after the death of their fathers. The scene where Theo finds out that Ryan is gay was brilliantly played, he literally enters the scene and tries to leave without noticing Ryan - which, of course, he has. <br /> <br /> The film was very well researched and therefore incredibly sad, exciting, uplifting and the celebration of life in parts. I got rid of this sad feeling experienced by Ryan, as well as the realization that Theo's former drug addict gave him hope and unconditional love. I agree with another reviewer who finds the scene where Theo says he will be the father and said he actually voiced his thoughts in Ryan when he brutally told Theo: "What makes you think you can be a father," and Theo just says "You." Theo is leaving then, but this small exchange of dialogs speaks volumes with the almost wretched aspect of Ryan, which a simple replica sharply raises. <br /> <br /> Brilliantly thought out film on all counts, acting, directing, writing, etc. everything is so well done. I can’t find anything else to say about this film, except to say that it’s very hard to deal with the death of a loved one, but it’s done great, to an infinite degree. Respect for the subject and the outpouring of love (without being crushed and disgusting) speaks volumes in this rather selfish world in which we live today. Well done to all concerned. <br /> <br /> Few films lead me to tears and make me think about life in general, as well as enjoy all that I have, and not be sad about things I don't know, but this film did, it was incredible inspiringly, given the subject.
