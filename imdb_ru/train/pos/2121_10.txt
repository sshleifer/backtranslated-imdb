This is a wonderful movie in which all the players play beautifully. It will make you laugh and make you cry. The very end of the film makes me mistreat every time. If you want to watch a great movie, this is it. Jimmy Stuerth performs a surprisingly witty performance, and Frank Morgan as Mr. Matus is captivating. The diversity of Morgan's character is nothing short of amazing. William Tracy as Pepy is a stunning comic relief, delivering some of the films of the most important lines and performances. Felix Bressart demonstrates fantastic results, as Perovic, a stumbling, clumsy store worker, whose ambition is to please those with whom he works. This is a simple story about how close colleagues can become and how two people who have a strong hostility towards each other, fall in love with each other in unusual circumstances.
