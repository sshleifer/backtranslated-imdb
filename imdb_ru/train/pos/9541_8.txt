Wow, baby, this is really some beautiful Asian horror / blood and crazy crazy movie. This is a splattered Japanese festival that reminded me a little of Tetsuo, except that in this case, with all the blood and courage, there is a strange love story. It’s hard to imagine how they even came up with this visually stunning film with some unique alien creatures that infect people like parasites, turning them into partially automatic or, I suppose, cyborgs. The only thing that is wrong with these creatures after they captured a person is that they have to kill each other and eat the other. hmmm yum yum. It will probably be called “industrial spray” or something like that, with an excellent soundtrack that adds all the fun. The film also borrowed a little from Carpenter's "The Thing" in creature design and effects. I would refer this to the category of obligatory hounds, since there is non-stop slaughter and very fine blood. And this is necessary for stoners, because you don’t even need to read the subtitles, visual images alone are just a journey of the mind. The design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body, like a fetus, reminded me a little of the films of Frank Henenlotter, which is another tribute to some excellent films with blood and a sense of humor. The Meatball Machine is great fun for the hounds, there's no doubt about that, and I absolutely love it.
