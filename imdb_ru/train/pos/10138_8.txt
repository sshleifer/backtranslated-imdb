Well, it's time. I really gave up all hope that this season will be a special episode. Despite the fact that so far there have been too many dull recordings, at least this episode was successful. Funny enough, director Rob Schmidt, who only has a good Wrong Turn to his credit, and writer John Esposito, whose only routine work on scripts today included The Tale of a Mummy and The Cemetery Shift, should be who gives us the best of the written and the most thoughtful. provocative episode of the season. The movie "The Right to Die" tells the story of Cliff and the Abbey. At the beginning of the episode, the couple talks. The abbey found Cliff deceiving, and he was desperately trying to get her back. While they talk, they get into a car accident, where Cliff has only scratches and bruises, but Abby is thrown out of the car and lights up when a spark ignites, and gasoline dripping on her lights up her. And this is only the people who are engaged in customization. Once in the hospital, Cliff must decide whether the abbey is worth living in this state without skin and only with nerve reflexes. There is also a side effect. Every time she is stubborn, the Abbey goes like a ghost and causes trouble for all kinds of people. Hands down, this is the best episode of the season and is definitely considered one of the best episodes in history. From terrible effects to a tight script that added a few twists and turns that I had never seen, and a wait so tangible that you can almost touch it, Right To Die should have the right to live forever.
