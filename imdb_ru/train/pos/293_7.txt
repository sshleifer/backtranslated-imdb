What could be more courageous than the idea of ​​private detectives to mess with women to spy on? And most of the written dialogue is completely banal. <br /> <br /> But the actors turn the dialogue into something that makes sense. You can see real people behind unrealistic features. And the direction is beautiful. Each scene does what it has to, and ends without delaying for too long. <br /> <br /> I showed it to a few friends in the mid-80s because I was puzzled by how such bad stuff can be turned into such a good movie. Friends also liked it.
