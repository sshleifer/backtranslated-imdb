The original print of this amazing, uncensored film was discovered in 2004 at the Library of Congress and was shown in several specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to current reviews that I found on the Internet, the original contains all the nasty dialogue and untouched insinuations; they were later either removed or completely shot by the studio before the initial release in order to pass the censorship of the state of New York. I also read that the DVD is “expected in 2006,” and one can only hope! If we are really lucky, it will be a comparison of the two versions. Please note that the released censored version was originally available on the Laserdisc, which I saw. Stanwyck Rules!
