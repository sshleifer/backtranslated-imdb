I saw this movie when I was 10 or 11 years old, on Saturday evening in my parents' basement. He was shown at the Chiller Theater, an ordinary film about fear, for which I strictly watched how young. Now I’ve seen a lot of old horror movies thanks to Chiller’s Theater, but none of them have ever stayed with me like “Dans Macabre,” for example, The Castle of Blood. I am now 51 years old, and only last year I was lucky enough to find a relatively recent, high-quality DVD-edition of this amazingly amazing supernatural classic, thinking that I would never be able to see it again. I have already watched it four more times and it seems that I don’t get tired of it. <br /> <br /> They just no longer make such films. The haunted catacombs and mist-wrapped cemeteries just do not work as well in color as they do in black and white at the time. In any case, it has Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, delightfully dark, cobwebbed ghost lock sets, restless spirits reproducing their deaths ... and a wickedly ironic end. <br /> <br /> IMO, it's right there with Robert Wise's Ghosts, Innocents (with Deborah Kerr) and later Others.
