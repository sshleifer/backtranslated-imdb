This film is pure Elvira and shows it on her chest ... I mean the best! The story (written in collaboration with Cassandra Peterson, Elvira’s alter ego) inspires and captivates Elvira’s wit and charm. The viewer gets the opportunity to see Elvira in a completely new light, when she fights against the prejudices of the people of Falwell, Massachusetts (where she came from Los Angeles to attend the reading of the testament of her great aunt Morganna) and at the same time trying to help the long-suffering teenagers who were deprived of fun matriarchal chastity by the Pariah and the rest of the city council. She also has to deal with her attraction to Bob Redding, the owner of the local cinema, and another woman (Patty), who also watches Bob, but does not deserve his love as much as Elvira. And later in the film, she also faces difficulties stemming from what comes from the “main metaphysical celebrity” and the witchcraft accusations made against her, which means she will be burned at the stake. Elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable, street and naive in this film, while at the same time cracking risky jokes and creating unusual lines with double meaning. <br /> <br /> This film is inspiring because it gives the message never to give up on yourself and always try to follow your dream. In the end, Elvira's dreams finally come true, and this is the best that can happen to this amazingly unique and purposeful woman. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie countless times and never get tired of it! There are no unnecessary scenes, and I was fascinated throughout the entire film. The review does not do justice to the real film, so I can just tell you, PLEASE watch it, because it is one of the best films ever made! In the meantime, I wish you unpleasant dreams!
