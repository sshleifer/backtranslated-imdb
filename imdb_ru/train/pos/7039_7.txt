War inc - funny, but strange movie. The actors are cute, the film is also cute, but I don't know how to describe the plot. I'll go to the plot later. This is a film with a strange selection of actors. In addition to John Cusack as an assassin, whom we saw many years ago in the Grosse Point Blank, which I liked. <br /> <br /> Here we have Hilary Duff playing a Russian pop star named Yonika Babya or something like that. Her character is strange. There is a scene where she puts a scorpion in her pants. And hits on Hauser (Cusack). In the end there is a twist with the participation of two characters. It makes sense. <br /> <br /> This is the only choice of actors that I choose. Because it is just weird. The whole movie is weird. But sometimes it's incredibly funny, and I never got bored. Here we have some of the best actors. Except Miss Duff. She is not great. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. Do you understand what I mean? <br /> <br /> This is the story of a hitman named Hauser (Cusack). He is sent to some Middle Eastern city to strike at an oil man named Omar Sheriff (and not an actor). Trying to cope with his personal problems, he has to help the pop star's wedding (performed by Hilary Duff). And he falls in love with a news reporter (played by Marisa Tomei). Although there is something about a pop star. Hauser disgusted her. There is a scene where she sings a song to him, and then he will vomit. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, it becomes clear why. The point of the turn is that I really saw him approaching. But it does not matter. This is a strange, funny and entertaining comedy. I love most of the actors. So really, how could I not recommend it? <br /> <br /> War, Inc .: 3.5 / 5
