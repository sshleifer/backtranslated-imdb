I have not laughed so long for a long time - although the film also has some sad moments, especially when it changes from hyper-funny to honest and serious. Heroes in most cases are very realistic, sometimes juicy, but quite plausible. I'm not a fan of the Jerry Springer show - I feel sorry for the participants. This movie is satire instead, and it does an excellent job. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that all the curses were * heard out * while this film was broadcast on publicly available television, which gives a lot of pleasure. I will rent this movie to fully enjoy it. <br /> <br />
