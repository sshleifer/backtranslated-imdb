Opium den, dirty little boy (actually a dwarf), prostitutes in abundance, cruel scandal in the dive, motel for sexual machinations, poorly dressed kids with splitting, drunkard, falling down the stairs, mixed racially bar with Asians, Africans and Angloses equally, does it sound like a movie played at a local mall? Wrong. These are all scenes from the 1933 musical. <br /> <br /> The first half of the Parade of Light is the preparation for a musical extravaganza that occupies the second half of the film. Chester Kent (Cagney) is about to lose a job and lose his wife, an actress, because of conversational pictures that squeeze live musicals on stage. His producers invite him to watch John Wayne's popular chatter of the day at the Great Trail. Before each film is shown a dance number is presented as a prologue. Shorts, news clips, TV shows and cartoons will later serve this purpose. Kent comes to the conclusion that the prologue chain will be the road to saving the shrinking live music business. Kent is basically a man of ideas in the spirit of the choreographer Busby Berkeley. Could it be that Cagney's character is like Berkeley? May be. <br /> <br /> In preparation for prologues, Kent learns that his ideas were stolen by a competitor. He reveals the traitor, dismisses him, and then, without the knowledge of him, a new leak appears in the form of a dazzling seductress. His assistant, Nan Prescott (Joan Blondel - will soon become Mrs. Dick Powell), longs for Kent and is determined to expose the tricks of the seductress. A new singer from the Arkansas College appears in the image of Scotty Blaine (Dick Powell), who turns out to be a real find and paired with Bea Thorn (Ruby Keeler). The resulting three musicals with prologues that could not be presented at any of the cinemas of the day are as fresh and pleasant today as they were more than seventy years ago: Bridal Hotel, At the Waterfall and Shanghai. Lil. "<br /> <br /> Of particular note is the song and dance of tough guy James Cagney. Like Fred Aster and Bill" Bojangles "Robinson, Cagney's dance seemed natural and unimpeded, although the clock went to practice so that each step was correct. Not a good singer like Astaire, Cagney's singing, like Astera, sounded natural, unlike Kroung, which was so popular at the time, it's amazing that one person can be as talented and versatile as James Cagney. <br /> < br /> Most critics prefer the Shanghai Lil segment to the other two. Yet the kaleido The copy choreography “At the Falls” is amazing. How Berkeley managed to remove underwater ballets and create a chain of human snakes must have been difficult, because it never happened again. Close-up shots, brilliantly mixed with furthest corners, are sure to be seen. white photography is much more artistic than it was if it was made in color. <br /> <br /> Although not as socially conscious as the “Gold Diggers 1933”, the “Footlight Parade” itself is one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever out flown to the big screen.
