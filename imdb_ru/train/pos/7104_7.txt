Los Debutantes is the story of two orphan brothers who moved to Santiago from the south after the death of their mother. Confident and street Silvio, the elder brother, takes a job at the owner of a sloppy strip club after his naive Victor is there for 17 years. <br /> <br /> When Silvio flourishes under the care of his boss, both brothers are associated with the mistress of the sexual and manipulative mistress, Gracia. When the film unfolds, the characters are redefined, and we begin to see the subtle and explicit ways that each of them manipulates the next. <br /> <br /> The film is well made, with good cinematography and a fast pace. It's also pretty sexy, with lots of nudity and some pretty explicit sex scenes. He uses the currently popular technique of imposing different scenes from different points of view, out of chronological order. Many people hate such films because they do not understand what is happening - Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and many other good films use this device. The plot itself is actually nothing new, it contains elements of “Body Heat”, “Pulp Fiction” and many other good films of noir. <br /> <br /> As different layers unfold, our understanding of the characters and their motivations develop. Although the plot may be somewhat cliché, it is also smart and interesting. <br /> <br /> I would call it a pleasant movie, which is worth seeing, but nothing memorable. I have not seen many films from Chile, and it is always interesting to watch a film noir from other countries. In addition, rent it if it is available, but do not lose sleep if it is not.
