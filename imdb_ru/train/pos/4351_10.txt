Peter Falk is a diverse and experienced actor. The film is well written and the acting seems real life. For all fans, Colombo is an excellent piece. Because it shows what talent is Peter Falk. He does not play a detective, he plays a retired carpet dealer. By the time loans start playing a role, you already want to watch them again. The interesting part of the film is that the message will apply to everyone who watches it; the depth of its relevance will be the only thing that changes. It's a shame that liberals in Hollywood promote only mud and skin, because this is the type of film that people in business should be proud of. It would be a great movie to turn it into a live scene.
