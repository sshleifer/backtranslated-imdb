This police process is no worse than many of its other eras, and better than many others. Obviously, he follows in the footsteps of "Dragnet" and "Naked City", but becomes a pleasant programmer. The best thing about this is the undecorated look that it provides to a world that has long gone ... lower class New York late 40s / early 50s. Here he is in all his sinister glory, from old-school tattoo parlors to cheap hotels and greasy spoons. These old police films are like tales of a bygone era and very bitter-sweet for anyone who dislikes the disinfected, soulless cityscape of today. <br /> <br /> Also intriguing is the emphasis on the scientific aspect of problem solving. a crime ... in this case, killing a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car. Our main characters, detectives Tobin and Corrigan, do the work, but without the tiresome and painstaking efforts of the “laboratory guys” they will come to nothing. Although the technology is not in the same league, the police here use persistent insistence on C.S.I. investigator to track down their person. <br /> <br /> As some reviewers have written about this film, you think that he would be directed by Ed Wood and acted out of the extras from his films. What nonsense! I enjoyed John Miles when the gangster ex-marine turned into Tobin's policeman ... he had a careless, frivolous approach to the role, which is a welcome change from the stony-faced historiography of most filmmakers of that period. Patricia Barry is sweet and adorable, like his perky girl who helps solve a crime. Walter Kinsella is as hearty and funny as senior detective Corrigan. I rather liked the chemistry of these two, and it made something a little different from the kind of robotic approach "Dragnet". <br /> <br /> The mystery itself is not too deep, and, of course, the final chase and the shootout is not among the classics of the criminal film, but in a short time, “Tattooed Stranger” more than interested me.
