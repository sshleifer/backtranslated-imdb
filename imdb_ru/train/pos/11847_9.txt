The horse is really a beautiful animal. The picturesque images of wild horses and their graces would never have been more magnificent in an animated film. <br /> <br /> Animation is awesome. Beautiful animation forms the basis of beauty that horses promote through the film. Especially when the stallion crosses a variety of terrain, jumps over rocks and braves in the waters. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also very impressive. Excellent instrumental music beckons you to appreciate the movie. <br /> <br /> “They say that Western history was written from the saddle of a horse.” Well, the story of the beautiful horse was written from the western saddle. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is undoubtedly the best. This is one of the best animated films that I have watched. It would be a very good choice on a lonely night. Lightweight 9/10.
