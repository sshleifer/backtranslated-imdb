According to this board, I think you either love it or hate it. Usually, as it happens with all movies. There is no need to be irritable with others, though. Everything we do here is an opinion. I made this film last night, and I want to come and express my opinion in the mix. I was surprised at how many people beat it though. There is a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie fan. I'm a horror movie fan. Most ordinary movie fans don't like horror movies. These days there are so many low-budget movies that look like camcorders. It's hard to keep up. And stay in these films is difficult, because they are bad. I wanted to come and write a review of The Hood of the Living Dead, because itâ€™s damn good compared to the rest of the junk. There is nothing special about this, but these are the directors who are trying to be too serious to make a horrible horror movie in the end. I really liked this one. Are you telling me that there is no effort in this? And one more thing, I bet you all have all these huge DVD collections that you are so proud of, just Major Motion Pictures, right? There is nothing wrong with that, but you need to know how to appreciate low-budget independence. I knew what I was getting when I watched this movie. I'm not going to get upset because I thought it would be a $ 100 million movie. Some of you may have to keep watching the Matrix again and again and stop trying to compare everything with the Matrix. And if most of you are younger than 24 years old, that explains everything. Good movie people, check it out.
