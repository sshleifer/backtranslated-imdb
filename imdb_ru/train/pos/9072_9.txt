I remembered that this is one of my favorite books in childhood, and I have long wanted to read it to my 5-year-old daughter. I knew the movie was coming out soon, so we went to the library to get a book, and they gave us previews the next day! We rushed home and spent the day reading a book so we could compare. There was no need. The only common feature between the book and the film is the name of the main characters, the fact that there is a stake, and a lot of food worms. Oh yes, I almost forgot, the guy who cooks most worms loves to give his masterpieces with a French accent. As the children know each other, the number of children involved, how the rate appeared, the number of worms to eat, the time frame for which he should eat worms, how they are prepared, the progress of friendship, the culmination of the scene, etc. NOTHING is the same. But for some reason this did not spoil my movie. All the characters are nice and the movie didn't leave me disappointed. A word of caution for parents, there was one moment when you heard adults in a room collectively catch their breath, and that was when Billy's younger brother called his penis "a weak member." The awkward part came when my daughter asked those who were sitting around us: “Does anyone know what a stupid member is?” Lol. This and the occasional "shut up" is as dirty as this movie. My daughter thought that she could get sick from worm 3 and 4 (and just in case kept an empty container with nachos), but worm 6 is all right. She and I really enjoyed the film and had a great time sharing experiences.
