SOLDIER is not so bad as many have done it. I discovered that the film has some kind of sacred, cynical humor, similar to that in the Star Marines of Paul Verhoeven. Lack of dialogue and excessive action is deliberate and adds to the comic book atmosphere. <br /> <br /> One trifle stands out for me - Todd has the names of the tattoos of several space campaigns. ”I am on his chest, and one of these battles is the Gate of TANNHOUSER. For those who do not pay attention to them, "The Gate of Tannhäuser" is mentioned in the elegiac last lines of Roy Batty in "Blade Runner." Imagine that Todd could fight alongside android troops, like Roy, is at least incredible. Maybe screenwriter David Peples felt nostalgic? <br /> <br /> I will give it 3 of 5.
