I'm a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reasons. I think that Travolta and Winger performed at a higher than average pace, I think the sets were representative of the place and era, I liked the soundtrack and Charlie Daniels band. However, I think the photo was awesome! Because the interior scenes were filmed in the club itself, and Gilly had low ceilings — perhaps 10-12 feet high, and the smoke that was supposed to mimic a “smoke-filled bar” hung 2-4 feet below the ceiling. The camera managed to take pictures through the smoke and focus on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dances, the low light that was actually in the bar! What a feat! Of course, there was auxiliary lighting, but to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it had to be pictures in low light. Ray Villalobos (cameraman) was outstanding! He received several shots for which he had no hope, and their impact brought a sense of reality to the film. Thank you, Ray - Great job!
