Magnificent documentary on the lives of firefighters in New York during the worst terrorist act in history. This reason alone is why this should be a must-have item for collectors. I was shocked not only by the attacks, but also by the "high-fat diet" appearance of some of these firefighters. I think many Doctors would agree with me that in physical form, some of these firefighters MUST NOT reach the 79th floor, having over 60 pounds of gear. Having said that I now have more respect for firefighters, and I understand that to become a firefighter is a life-changing job. The French have a history of making a great documentary, and this is what it is, a great documentary .....
