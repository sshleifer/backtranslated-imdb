If any film style could be called my “guilty pleasure,” it would be such a general type of fantasy. Although the word "guilty" is not appropriate for this, as I am very happy from time to time to be an escapist. “Star dust” is a good stock fantasy, the like of which should be expected from Neil Gaiman (or, as it were, the adaptation of Guyman). This is not the visual dreaming of Mirrormask, these are not adult claims of the Pan's maze, and this is not an amusing classic of the Princess-Bride, but it contains only what the fantasy lover is quite familiar with being completely comfortable during the entire viewing. Fans of fantasy should be happy - work with special effects has finally become quite good and cheap, and now it's all in mass production. <br /> <br /> A young man named Tristan is involved in the story of Stardust, who, in order to get the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their little town of Wall, set off on an adventure to find a fallen star. However, in order to complicate the situation, Tristan’s fallen star is actually a woman named Yvein, and he is not the only one who is looking for her ... some witches have greedy eyes on immortality, which can give the heart of a star, and brother enmity over the Magic Kingdom leads killer princesses in her direction. <br /> <br /> Everything is pretty predictable from there, but it has some attractive fantasy elements, warm comments about the nature of love and the best part is Robert DeNiro. like a funny pirate. On this note, DeNiro's accurate game ... is not an excessive jester, which most actors use to portray gays, but surprisingly effective from someone who is used to be considered a rude and rude character type (thus, the ongoing joke surrounding his character , coinciding with DeNiro's own discovery of alternative forms of action). DeNiro has not been so unique to its image since the days of Brazil, and it says something. <br /> <br /> Stardust is probably the type of film that will long exist on shelves for children and fantasy lovers. I can not say that it offers something new, but in fact it is not. In fact, it is those who are most familiar with his paths, who will enjoy it most of all. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
