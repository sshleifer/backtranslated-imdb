Caution: spoilers may contain ... <br /> <br /> I saw this film 3 times, and I liked it every time. Seeing this again, I always remember how good it is. The HBO television film, very well made, like most of their films, would have won an Oscar for its performances if it were released for general distribution, and not for television. <br /> <br /> As I’m sure Anyone knows, reading other reviews here, this is the story of serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. For 8 years in the former Soviet Union, he killed 56 people. (3 victims were buried and cannot be found, so he was convicted of only 52 of 53 of his murders.) In fact, the story is more focused on the criminologist, Victor Burakov, who Stephen Rea played perfectly. A person who is tortured and obsessed with the search for this killer, despite the additional obstacles posed by party hackers, his role is very important. At the end of the film, there is a very touching scene in which it is mentioned that in America investigators regularly take down cases of serial killers after 18 months, whether they want to or not because of mental tension and frustration. According to this act, Burakov worked for more than 5 years before he received his first break. He brought the case to completion, after 3 years. In this scene, his boss, General Fetisov, played by Donald Sutherland, actually tells him that he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing that he should have given him a breather before. <br /> <br /> Rea’s play is so good, he doesn’t replay, chew landscapes or do anything that distracts him from the image of a man who is obsessed with finding his killer. He is a man with passion, but does not show it the way it is usually shown in detective films. He only occasionally gives flashes after calmly putting up with what most of them can withstand under such circumstances. Ree does so much with his face, his eyes, he does not need to replay. He's just * * * - his character, so frustrated after so long, at some point in time when he fell into despair, he actually says that it is better for him to find 3 at a time than none in a year. Of course, he does not mean that he wants more people to die, he just wants some people to catch this person. Rea makes us feel that person. He makes us understand, but catch a glimpse of what it means to live with such horror and futility. <br /> <br /> Mutant, to be sure, Chikatilo’s childhood was one that produced such “monsters”. Chikatilo's character is very well done by Jeffrey De Mann. He somehow (although it may seem impossible) causes at least some sympathy for himself. Perhaps he is the worst of us terribly wrong? In any case, his performance is very well done. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland as Colonel Fetisov (later appointed by the general) also does an excellent job with his work. He begins to seem a cynical worldly official who does not seem to be much interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking Burakova. But in the end he becomes not just an assistant, he is actually actively involved in helping Burakov. Max von Sydow is also very pleasantly surprised when a psychiatrist called him in to help create a profile and find out what kind of deviant they are looking for. <br /> <br /> Although this film is about a painful, grotesque and cruel story, it really is more about what you need to catch the killer than the killer himself. Around a very well-made film with great performances and a great script. The script allows you to do what is best in this type of film: show actual events and put them meaningfully in a dramatic frame that allows you to feel that you know the people behind the facts. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars
