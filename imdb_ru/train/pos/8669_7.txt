If, unlike some commentators here, you don’t arrange a class war and don’t mind seeing the lives of other people who are quite successful, extroverted, bohemian (suffocating) and not terribly British at a party and get involved in everything not a bad movie, closer to European cinema, and not to the imitation of the usual cunning American shit ... I think that a minimal sound design and a cheap camera is a conscious decision, and not a bad movie. I would say that as a result, the film is no worse, and it focuses on the cast, some of which are really good (Kate Hardy - I think this is her name, since the sarcastic drunkard is in place) The only exception is David Buddyel, whom should not be allowed to serious things! It's bright, and we won't go to such nonsense about anatomy of relationships in this country, but if you don't have real friends to go to a party, than you could do worse than sit and watch this one.
