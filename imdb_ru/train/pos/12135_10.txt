Every movie stars Bette Davis in is worth experiencing. Before Davis starred with Leslie Howard in "Of Human Bondage", she starred in a variety of films. Legend has it that Davis was “robbed” of an Oscar of 1935 for her performance as a cocoon-speaking waitress, an unmarried mother, and a manipulative boyfriend, Mildred Rogers. The story goes that AFI comforted Davis by awarding her 1st Oscar for the role of Joyce Heath in the movie Dangerous. I believe that Davis fans of "Of Human Bondage," who agree with the legend of the Oscar robberies, will have, in contrast to my criticism, the film of 1934, for which AFI did not award its performance, and the film of 1936 "Dangerous". for which she won her first Oscar in 1937. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch all the Bette Davis movies, television interviews, videos, advertisements for World War II and television appearances on popular TV shows. Looking back, it is easy to understand why this film On Human Slavery gave Davis the opportunity to be nominated for her performance. She was only 25 years old when the film was finished and is about to reach the red carpet of Hollywood. The public began to notice Bette Davis as a star because of her performance in "Of Human Bondage." This is what makes her a legendary performance. But the RCO saw her greatness in “The Man Who Played God” and borrowed it from Warners to play Roger. <br /> <br /> I'm going to go to AFI, looking back, 41 years after their Insightful decision to award Davis with her first Oscar-winning actress for Dangerous, 2 years later. Thus, AFI may have been instrumental in identifying the very best in one of the most talented Hollywood actors of the 20th century. Because, starting with "Of Human Bondage," Davis knew for sure that she needed to go deep inside herself to find the performances that had brought her the golden statue. Sure, she deserved more than 2 Oscars; perhaps as many as 6. <br /> <br /> “Dangerous” provides exemplary contrast in the depth of the current Davis characteristic. After all, in “Dangerous” (1936) she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century. Davis is as good as Joyce Heath, she is the center of attention on the red carpet. Whereas in “Human Slavery,” Davis is on the edge, still on the sidewalk and ready to begin his remaining part of his 60-year-old acting career. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, not awarding her this legendary Oscar in 1935 instead of the birth of a star, the actor had an incentive to go beyond his glory for the greatest work of a gifted actor. <br /> <br /> It is well known that Joan Crawford was her modern opponent; a star whose performances still do not match Davis. Even Anna Nicole Smith was a "star." Howard Stern is also a radio host. Many people on the stage and the silver screen are stars. Few have become great actors. The key difference between the two is that Bette Davis could feel: the difference between wanting to play great or becoming a star. <br /> <br /> Try to compare these two films, like me, and watch one immediately after the other. Maybe you will find out what AFI and I have done. Davis was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at the age of 25 and reached her goal by 27 years. She spent the next 50 years, setting the bar so high that she was not reached. , , yet. <br /> <br /> If AFI sent her a message saying that she had arrived in “On Human Slavery”, the story of Davis’s life as a great actor might have been brought to a stellar defeat.
