Gurinda Chady's semi-autobiographical film (2002) is a gentle, poignant comedy that takes place in an ethnically diverse community near Heathrow Airport in West London. <br /> <br /> Like the airliners that constantly arrive and fly overhead, we watch the highs and lows of the two main characters, Jess Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley), when they make incredible friendship based on their mutual passion for football and their technical passion for David Beckham. <br /> <br /> Much of the comedy stems from a misunderstanding of the families of these two talented girls, because they violate all the expectations and conventions of their very different family traditions. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the middle, as a mediator, peacemaker and stubborn athlete Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) - the team coach for Hounslow Harriers - intercedes during times of crisis, while remaining the main object of affection of both main characters. <br /> <br /> In the end, and not without many obstacles and triumphs on the way, we finally see that our devotees and favorite football heroines soar to fulfill their dreams. <br /> <br /> With great performances from Bollywood veteran Anupama Hera (Mr. Bhamra), Shahin Khan (Mrs. Bhamra), Juliet Stevenson (Mrs. Paxton) and Frank Harper (Mr. Paxton). This is really a film that reflects the urgent passion of youth and crosses all ethnic boundaries. <br /> <br /> Pinky Bamra (Archie Punjabi) and (Taz) Trey Farley fight for their own struggles, but nonetheless make a great contribution to our understanding of the main characters of the film. <br /> <br /> In its own way, this film tells an important story, which is pretty random football. It celebrates evolution in the understanding of ordinary people in ordinary families and the innate ability of young people to teach the elderly.
