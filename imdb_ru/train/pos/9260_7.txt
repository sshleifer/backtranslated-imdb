There are enough sad stories about women and their oppression by religious, political and public means. Not to diminish films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights, as well as inequality in pay and marginalization in society, all in the name of Allah or God or some other absurd excuse, but sometimes itâ€™s useful to just use a different approach and shed light on this topic. <br /> <br /> In the 2006 match between Iran and Bahrain, there will be a selection for the World Cup. Passions are running high, and several women try to disguise themselves as men in order to get to the match. <br /> <br /> Caught women (played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shaiesteh Irani, Aida Sadeki, Golnaz Farmani and Makhnaz Zabihi) and detained for prosecution provided a funny and illuminated look at the customs of this country and, most likely, of all Muslim countries. Their interaction with the Iranian soldiers who guarded and transported them, both in the city and in the villages, and the father who was looking for his daughter, gave funny moments when we thought about why they have such unwritten rules. <br /> <br /> This is basically a paternalistic society that considers it necessary to save its women from the rude behavior of men. Instead of educating the male population, they deny the privileges and rights of women. <br /> <br /> Seeing changes in responsible soldiers and a reflection of Iranian society, it is not surprising that this film will not play Iran. But Jafar Panahi has a winner for those who can see it.
