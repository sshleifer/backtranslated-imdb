<br /> <br /> I really liked this movie. One of those rare films that Hollywood doesn't really make anymore. William H. Macy is just as gorgeous as a hired killer with a soul, and Neve Campbell is just as incredible as a woman who puts her life on the path of redemption. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, see this movie. This is commendable.
