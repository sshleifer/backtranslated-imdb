A very well-made film of the early 60s of communist Yugoslavia. The five young actors who are teenagers in the center of the story, give strong, sincere and emotionally deep actions. A clear description of how you can easily manipulate the natural trust and naivety inherent in adolescents, and how it affected their entire lives. Highly recommended.
