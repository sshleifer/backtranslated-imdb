All the talents that Mr. Suraj Barjatya showed in his first 3 films, I thought they were all an accident, because his 4th film, Prem prem ki diwani hoon, was so bad. But I must say that it was not an accident. This guy is talented, and the way he did Viva is just great. Right from the first scene it affects you. The sequences between shahid and amrita are amazing. The chemistry between these two actors gives an idea of ​​what is between IBS and Kajol. As usual, Alok Nath, as a kind and loving father, is fantastic, as is Anupam Dick. But this is the film "Shahid Amrita". Amrita looks good in most scenes, although the shahid looks a bit young to marry, but he copes well with a shy, but at the same time morally strong fiancé. This film will especially appeal to those who have experienced such beautiful moments of their lives. Overall, a brilliant movie. hats off to Mr. Sooraj Baryat ...
