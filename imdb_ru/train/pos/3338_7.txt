Fever Pitch is quite a funny movie. There are many funny moments in it (including a funny and disturbing scene in the shower). As in most romantic comedies, there is a “dead zone” in the middle, in which all heavy things happen, “she breaks up with me,” but besides that she remains funny to the end. <br /> <br /> While the plot revolves around fanaticism toward the Red Sox, it’s not overwhelmed by sport. You don't have to be a fan of this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's easy for me to say: I've also been a Red Sox fan since I was a boy. <Br /> <br /> 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Barques
