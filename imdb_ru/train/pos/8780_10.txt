This is one of the greatest sports films ever made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett particularly interesting is that Mr. Corbett presented a boxing style that continues to this day. In this regard, James J. Corbett was really invented. But, returning to the film, all the performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. Indeed, she looked like Nicole Kidman. And although it is a historical play, the story stands the test of time; it did not become stale. The image of Ward Bond, depicting John L. Sullivan, should be one of the greatest images of a real sports figure in the history of cinema, and the boxing scenes are realistic, well posed and very effective. This combined with a great script makes this movie a must.
