Life Stinks (1991) was one step lower than other productions of Mel Brooks. He plays the role of a rich man who leads an insane bet with his "friends." Brooks claims that he can live like a homeless for a month. His shocked and surprised friends take this unusual bet. During his "stay" in the Bowery, he meets a bunch of strange homeless people, one of whom attracts his imagination (Lesley-Ann Warren). They make friends when she teaches him many tricks that she learned while living on the street. Can Mr. Brooks survive by himself without the luxury of being dirty-rich? Can he win this unorthodox bet? Who are his real friends? Find out when watching LIFE STINKS to find out! <br /> <br /> This film was unfairly littered. Of course, this is not a classic, as in his earlier films, but still nice. I liked how Mel Brooks pays homage to Charles Chaplin in this film. If you watched Chaplin's earlier silent films, then you also get humor. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of Mel Brooks.
