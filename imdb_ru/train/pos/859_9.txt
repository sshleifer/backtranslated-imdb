It is very rare to find a film in which there is a plot that is impossible to understand at every turn. Surprises everywhere delight everywhere. <br /> <br /> I cannot understand something, because here you have the main character, who plays a “good girl, hard worker”, and yet in the end she ends up being an antisocial risk. It was not enough to make me dislike, but it made me think. <br /> <br /> Another thing I couldn’t get is the old man whom the police pulled out a movie at the very end. I did not understand who he was and what problems he had. If anyone has any ideas, I would like to hear what they can be. <br /> <br /> The film was exciting and fun everywhere and always made me think. Very worth a look.
