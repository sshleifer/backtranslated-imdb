Will such romantic comedies be as cleverly performed as this? I never thought anything trivial, because a simple sale of a music box could make me take a breath from excitement. Margaret Sullavan becomes an amazing saleswoman, and she and James Stewart always bring out the best in each other. This film, in my opinion, is the most winning play by Frank Morgan, and “The Wizard of Oz” and “Tortilla” behind his belt, it says a lot. The way he finds a partner for a Christmas dinner left me frivolous with joy. Directed by Ernst Lubich, one might think that “Trouble in Paradise” is his favorite, but this one, of course, should be considered a triumph. With some of the most ingenious dialogues, American films of the 30s can offer.
