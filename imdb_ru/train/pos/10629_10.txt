Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, toaster and frying pan. If you do not mind the psycho-thriller or horror film genre, and you have a special place in your heart for the perverted, then this film is for you. In a surprisingly well-developed first film, “Hate by the Minute,” all the major hits, such as Silence of the Lambs, and iconic classics, such as Army of Darkness, are present. Editing and effects are well done, better than many movies in the genre. Kallio weaves a complex story of torment, relying both on the Bible and Poe’s writings. At a time when big budget, big-name films lack content, an independent film resurrected this dying trait. If you love Michigan, a good story or a worthy thriller, watch “Hate the Minute.”
