The memory of the “Last Hunt” has been stuck with me since I saw it in 1956, when I was 13 years old. This is a film that is far ahead of others at that time, because it talks about handling local people, the environment, and the constant contrast between the short-term and long-term effects of greed. This is as relevant today as in 1956, the cinematic discussion of the ultimate depth and relevance. To top it all off, the setting is beautiful and the cinema is excellent. The memory of this film will remain with me until the end of my days.
