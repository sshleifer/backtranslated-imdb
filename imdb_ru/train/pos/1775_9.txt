I often wonder why this show hit so hard. I thought it was brilliant and also very cleverly written and executed. I think that in time it will be seen in the light it deserves, that is, if they ever release it. There were a lot of young comedians here, and everything went to more. Perhaps this fact will make people realize its value, and it will have to be published. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinovich and last but not least Julian Rind-Tutt from the extremely successful Green Wing. The authors Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews are two of the best authors of the modern comedy. Anyone who can shoot comedies, for example, Father Ted, will not be able to write something that does not deserve publication. If it is released, I will definitely buy it.
