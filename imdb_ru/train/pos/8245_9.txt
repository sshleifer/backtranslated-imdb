Without even saying a word, Billy Connelly is as beautiful as a zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss as "Mama"? Even better. Zombie girlfriends? <br /> <br /> "... My father wanted to eat me ... I never tried to eat Timmy." <br /> <br /> And I thought Dawn of the Dead was good. It's like a plane meets (meat?) Night of the living dead, sponsored by Zomcom. <br /> <br /> And don't forget my main coffin <br /> <br /> And Fido in Aloha's shirt is just awesome! <br /> <br /> And yes, social commentary is too much to even comment on. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that everything really works!
