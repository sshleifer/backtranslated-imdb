Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take the post of secretary in the rich Hughes family to cope with her boyfriend, leaving her. Almost immediately, she is drugged and sent to the family estate in Cornwall. When she wakes up, they keep telling her that she is Marion Hughes, mentally ill and keeps her locked up ... but why? You can probably guess why, but you won't mind, because it's fun. <br /> <br /> Along with the “Narrow Region” and “Face Mask”, this is one of the best photos ever taken. (B-shots are low-budget shots taken quickly, with a small budget and no major stars). This is as long as needed (only 65 minutes), it is well directed, rapidly developing and exciting. It only stumbles at the end, which I find too implausible to buy. <br /> <br /> Foch (a good actress) is just in the lead, but Dame Mae Vitti is gorgeous, and George Makridi is gorgeous (and frightening) like villains. Worth catching. A great example of how you can make a great movie with a small budget.
