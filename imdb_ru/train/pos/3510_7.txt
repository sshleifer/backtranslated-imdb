True film fans will love this authentic movie. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the trolls who rate this film as one star and call it unreal. Although I have no experience with heroes, I have been working in low-income neighborhoods and working classes for many years and I feel that the game was very real and reflected the behavior of teenagers. I do not know what the comments of others are based on, that the film is “unreal”. The dialogue is great. <br /> <br /> Low budget cost of production did not bother me. I felt that natural light enhances the character of the film. All attention was focused on the storyline and character development, and not on the brilliant Hollywood scenario or melodrama. <br /> <br /> I was completely carried away by the motives and reactions of the character. Acting was believable and impressive for new and non-actors. <br /> <br /> If you think a good movie is Transformers or Fast and Furious, skip it. If you like good dramas, driven by characters, then watch them. <br /> <br /> (Regarding negative commentators that are "trolls": click on their names, and you will see that most of them have no other reviews or only negative reviews.)
