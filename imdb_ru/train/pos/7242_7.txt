The year 1933 seemed to be a great year for satire (for example, “Duck Soup”), and this year fits well, although this is an obsession with a contract bridge. The tone is similar to a humorous play from The New Yorker, appropriate because the film begins with the page “What is happening in the city” of this magazine. The only thing that is strange is casting. Made a few years later, William Powell and Myrna Loy would be perfect. However, after 1934 you would not have been able to cope with adultery so subtly, with young and beautiful Loretta Young in some haircuts and tight-fitting costumes, or with a group of prostitutes who listened to a bridge contest on the radio. Even if you know nothing about the bridge, you can still try a rare example of Hollywood satire.
