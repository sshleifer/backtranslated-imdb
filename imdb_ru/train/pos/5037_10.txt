This may be the most underrated film in its genre. I don’t remember that I’ve seen any commercials or commercials for this, which could be the reason that it’s not so good at the box office. However, Frailty is a great and truly original horror movie. I entered the top 10 most favorite horror films on my list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with snapshots of photos and news articles telling us about a murderer who calls himself "the hand of God." And then the person enters the police station and tells the boss that he knows that the killer is his brother. Two of them go together to the place where the victims are buried, which can help solve the case. During this trip, the person begins to tell the story of his brother, and we return at the time when the events began. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers who live with their strict and religious father, who once claims that he received a divine message from God, in which he asked to kill demons that seem to be ordinary people. He receives from God a list of the names of the demons that must be destroyed, and asks his sons to help him accomplish this divine mission. <br /> <br /> This is an absolutely horrifying and disturbing film that will keep you on the edge of your place. Tension is heating up, innocent people (or demons?) They kill and question religious experience. He has not one, but several very smart turns at the end. If you like this genre, I highly recommend Frailty for you. I have a DVD, and this is one of my all-time favorite horror thrillers.
