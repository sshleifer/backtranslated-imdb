It was the beginning of all this! Of course, this is not Friends at its best, but it was a show pilot, let's not forget a good one. We get acquainted with the gang and Central Perk, where our story begins. Even in this first episode, we see signs of a Ross-Rachel relationship that begins over the next ten years, when Ross says, “I just want to get married again,” and Rachel bursts into the wedding dress ... probably not intentional a time when the authors followed the Monica-Joey relationship, but fits perfectly now, looking back. Something else ... in this episode, Rachel meets Chandler, as if these two had never met before, but in later episodes, the so-called "memories", this is contrary to the way they met in the three previous cases. However, the point is that this is a great start to a great show. This episode may not be the usual “Friends,” as we are used to, as the cast is still a bit inexperienced, but in the next few episodes we will see why the show turned out the way it was! Keep watching, the first season is a blast !!
