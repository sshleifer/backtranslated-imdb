I watch most of the movies that make Nick Mancuso because, frankly, I love this guy, although with age he is usually filmed as a villain (old fans should notice that for some reason he is blond in this film). This is quite a familiar movie from the point of view of the plot (but then most of the films today are not quite original), but Rick Roberts is attractive as an imperfect husband, Martha Makisaak is equally attractive as a daughter, and Mitzi Kapur does a good job if it was her goal to be angry and sometimes quite loving. Nick still realizes that he is able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis. However, too much of the plot takes place behind the scenes — for example, motivation, prior behavior, good and bad times — and things that seem obvious to the characters never reach the audience (that is, me). The final scene leaves everything to be desired in the “but how about ...” category, and in general, I can’t say that I was very concerned about any characters. At the same time, it was what it was - quite an interesting way to spend the day - and I still love Nick.
