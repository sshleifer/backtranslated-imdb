Some of the comments here on IMDb have compared Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III films of the 90s, but despite the fact that it is undoubtedly cruel, cruel and very depressing, this film from Pou-Soi Cheang is not really too sneaky. angry or sensational to deserve this comparison. Nevertheless, he still has a blow that is worth looking at him, especially if your tough, tough action is your thing. <br /> <br /> Edison Chen plays Pan, a Cambodian assassin who travels to Hong Kong to kill a judge's wife; Sam Lee - Wai, a ruthless policeman who is determined to hunt him down at any cost. When Vai approaches his goal, Pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escape until he meets Yue, a rather illegal immigrant who needs his help to avoid her ill-treatment. <br /> <br /> Dog Bite Dog's relentlessly stern is drama with great cinematography, stunning sound effects, a spectacular score and solid performances by Chen and Li (as well as newcomer Pei Pei as Pang's love interest). along the line of the Chan-wook Revenge trilogy. Injections, shootings, merciless beatings - all of this happens regularly in this film and is firmly filmed by director Cheang. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a story that is doomed to an unhappy end for all participants, and, of course, almost everyone in this film dies (rather unpleasant deaths). Unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy, and in its final moments, Dog Bite Dog crosses it: in the ridiculously over-dramatic final scene, Pang and Wai are locked in a battle while pregnant Yue looks at them. In the end, after all three had received severe stab wounds during scandals, the injured Pang performs a self-made cesarean section (now dead) with Yue, delivering his children a few minutes before he dies. <br /> <br /> Although this film could not be a “classic” piece of Hong Kong surplus, with its insanely OTT-action and stylish visual effects, it’s still worth a look.
