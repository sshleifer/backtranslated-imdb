This is really a strange film - and this is NOT a bad thing. This is a combination of a neo-realistic film about homeless people and fairy tales. Iâ€™m sure that some might find this film too strange, but I liked it. Once again, this director collects great actors from ordinary people (not actors) and gets an excellent representation of the ensemble type. Although not as sad as Umberto D, both films have a very similar point of view - this one just makes it very absurd. Do not pay attention to crappy special effects - after all, they were made in the early 1950s, and in any case, special effects are not very important (or, at least, they should not be in movies). Instead, just relax and enjoy a very strange and stupid trip. If you are not a complete moron, you will have a ball. <br /> <br /> By the way, since the first time I watched this movie, I have seen another movie made in DeSica that you definitely need to watch and which Children are watching us. Although it is not a fantasy or light in the spirit, as MIRACLE IN MILAN, nevertheless, an excellent film.
