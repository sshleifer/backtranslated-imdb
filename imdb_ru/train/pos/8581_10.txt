This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. All of you who see this movie as absolute crap are not smart enough to understand all the subtle humor that this movie has to offer. This shows us that real life and “fictional” actions can lead to a winning combination. In addition, as a romantic comedy, she has one of the smartest ways to find each other. Tell me another movie in which you can see it all, and also Donald Sutherland, who sings a song like “They are going to find their anus on a mountain on Mars”
