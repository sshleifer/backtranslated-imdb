This funny and incredible film, more like the most popular movie star of all time than your typical long-running biopic, has the look and feel of an era with an excellent soundtrack and everything you would like to see in an indie-type movie. I think the trend will be depicting Betty Page as a kind of sexy fox, like Jane Mansfield. But if you really looked carefully at Betty's posture, she always looked happy. Not “you would like to get it from me” with a haughty look, nor “I just do it because my acting career didn't work out” kind of a porn star. So, the ladies involved in this film (three female producers, a female writer / director, a female co-author and the great Gretchen Maul, who, I am sure, helped shape this role with her own sweet influence) really captured the idea of ​​a sweet, somewhat naive , a southern girl who really loved being photographed and hoped that the good old man would not be too upset by her. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mole has achieved high results in her career (she is probably just the most beautiful breasts), and I am very glad because she had a curse. A few years ago she made the cover of Vanity Fair, when no one really knew who she was, advertising her as the next girl. And let's be frank, it was a little presumptuous. I mean, unfortunately, she never reached the status of Gwyneth, although not for lack of talent. When you're a pretty blonde in a fickle Hollywood movie, having made some bad films, I'm afraid you'll forget. If it does not return her to list A, I will be the monkey's uncle. <br /> <br /> Extremely private, Betty herself had not yet seen the film. Betty left a pin-up party on a high note and fell in love with her old flame, Jesus. Whatever your boat floated, dear. You were one damn woman. Hope you are happy wherever you are. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, Mary Harron, you have achieved our iconic idol.
