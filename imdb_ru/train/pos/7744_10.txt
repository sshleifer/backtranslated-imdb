Be sure to watch a movie with great dialogues, great music, great acting and a great atmosphere. <br /> <br /> In the film you will follow 8 people in one day in the city of Antwerp, they are all individual and sometimes just weird (that's how I love them!) <br /> <br /> I'm not going to say anything more, just go and enjoy it.
