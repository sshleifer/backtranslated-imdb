It was a life change, THIS WAS REALLY !!! "Man on the Moon" is an exciting experience to watch him. The game was awesome, the storyline was great and it was the perfect start to Reese Witherspoonâ€™s career. See how no one can love this movie. Of course, this is not the best film, although he was close to him, but it was very funny to watch him, and I even laughed at one of the jokes and many other small laughter. Of course, there were moments that made you remember, but this film was instructive, and it brightened up your day, although you need to get depressed from time to time. I can I do not believe that this film did not receive at least one award, and I also can not believe that so few people have seen it on this site. Watch this movie, if you haven't done it, it's definitely touching.
