Wow ... I don't know what to say. I just looked seven pounds. No one can make me cry like Will Smith. Man is in harmony with a wide range of human emotions. This film was skillfully and beautifully made. It is rare to find such intense humanity in Hollywood today. I would compare it with “Pay it Forward” and “Crash” as much as the rough show of light and darkness was. Definitely stays with you for a long time and gives you a lot of thinking. I have a deep love and passion for films like this. Usually not for a “bad ending”, but rather for a seeker of truth who embraces emotions, raw life and something more than superficiality that exists in abundance around. Therefore, I do not mind a little pain in the end. For life it is true that not always happy endings. Sometimes this is just not a happy ending, you think it should be. Many people could live a happy life, although the love and life of one of them was lost. If you're the one who looks a little deeper than the rest, you will love this movie!
