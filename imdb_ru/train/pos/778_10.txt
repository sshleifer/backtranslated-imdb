I do not really understand the acting skills or other details of the film, but this film just hit me. I don't think I'll ever forget that. Especially one scene (I think that anyone who saw the movie finds out what I'm talking about) was imprinted in my brain. <br /> <br /> I also watched a similar film "Lily 4" (as mentioned by the previous commentator). It was also very touching, but not quite so direct and accurate. If you are sensitive at all, any of them will cause tears in your eyes, but Anjos Do Sol (Angels of the Sun) can stay with you forever. <br /> <br /> This is a very depressing subject, but I think not, I hope that the film will be able to attract more attention to it. <br /> <br /> More people should see this movie !!!!!!
