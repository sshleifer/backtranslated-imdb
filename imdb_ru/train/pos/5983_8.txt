I first saw this movie as a teenager. It was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world. Trick Or Treat has all the elements for a movie that is awesome. With an actor like Skippy from Family Ties, Gene Simmons from Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne as a preacher, how can you be wrong? Reverse wicked messages are played on vinyl! Yeah, right, they use the recordings in this movie. In one scene, Eddie (Skippy) listens to a message from an evil rock star on his record player when everything gets scary. Monsters begin to emerge from his speakers, and his stereo becomes obsessed. As a teenager, I tried to play my notes backwards, hoping that this would happen to mine. Almost 20 years later, Trick Or Treat still remains one of my favorite films.
