Eileen Gonsalves, my friend, plays the secretary in the bank of the main character in this film. She has a beautiful scene with Roshan Set in a restaurant. There is more information on her website:> Having stated my personal interest in the film, I must say that I think this beautiful film is touching, fun and beautifully made.
