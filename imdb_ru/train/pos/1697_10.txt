In fact, this film is one of those rare films that you either hate, and think that suicide borders on the next best thing, and not to sit in it for two hours. Or, as in my case, you see it as a cult hit, one of those films in which humor, plot, acting is actually very hidden, but for those of us who want to go for it, trusting the director well, the reward such is: you laugh! The fact that you need to find the things mentioned above actually makes the movie even more fun, because you get the impression that the director doesn't even know how funny the movie is, which is unlikely, and this is where the intelligence at the helm lies. a grand project called: Spaced Invaders !!
