This film is a great motive. He follows the rap group NWH, consisting of Ice Cold, Tasty Taste and Tone Def, thanks to its unique way to gangster rap highs, lows and back to highs. Because of problems with women, egos, cops and whites, this group gets to the top of the gangster rap world, as this film goes to the top of the movements. I know that everybody’s favorite driving force is Spinal Tap, for a very good reason, but I think that if the mood is good, this film is simply better. Laughter never ends, not even for someone who is not a rap culture. <br /> <br /> I'm a white guy who is not interested in rap music, culture or anything else related to this, however I like this film, Rusty Kandeyf, who wrote the script, songs and starred in it, showed a lot of potential, and it’s a shame that I didn’t see him after Fear of the Black Hat. However, I saw him again than you, and that is why I recommend you “Fear of the black hat” for a quick laugh. <br /> <br /> Remember: “Do not shoot to see whites! .... their eyes? No, do not shoot to see whites. "<br /> <br /> FYM and enjoy the movie.
