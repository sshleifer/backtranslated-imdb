THE ODD COUPLE (3+ out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like most people, I will always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are a certain “Weird Couple.” Their incredible work on serials from the beginning to the mid-70s was the high point for television of that time ... easily surpassing the stage and the film version of this story. However, how can you go wrong with a pair of Jack Lemmon / Walter Mattau? Mattau is in a particularly good shape, like Oscar, a slob. Lemmon needs a bit of getting used to Felix, especially if you've previously seen Tony Randall's outstanding performance. The script is good ... definitely the best Neil Simon. (I’m writing here as arguing that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst, most overvalued playwrights of the American theater.) to save money on alimony payments. Their lifestyle becomes very similar to marriage, which ends with funny spats and tiffs. Lots of fun and great odnostrochnnikov.
