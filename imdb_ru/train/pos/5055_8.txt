I did not expect much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as the Gray Owl? <br /> <br /> Ah ... but then the story unfolds in a beautifully photographed and filmed movie. I was surprised and delighted with this (mostly) real story. He made me want to know more about this fascinating character, which means that the director completed his task and the film was a success!
