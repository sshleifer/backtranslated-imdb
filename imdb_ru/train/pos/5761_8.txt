I swear, this zombie was killed like twice, and kept coming back. I gave this film 8. Let's face it, guys, this is exactly what other reviewers are saying, i. E. The film “with the camera”. Hey, hey, hey, welcome to the indie film. The fact that Todd Sheets got over 700 zombies to appear in this film is a tribute to his talent. Yes, there are gaps in history, yes, we see the same zombies again and again, but who cares? Take it for what it is, a funny and bloody horror movie that you share with your friends, or seduce people you really care about: lol Twister. Peace and support for independent filmmaking !!!
