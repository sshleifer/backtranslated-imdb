This is a strong film from a historical and epic point of view. Although the story is simple, it is clean and straightforward. In truth, this is the standard story of a simple, noble man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthy people of that period. <br /> <br /> Poor versus rich, noble versus dishonest, classic but well-told story without the special shine of Hollywood stench on the screen. <br /> <br /> Extra points just because you almost smell people on the screen. :)
