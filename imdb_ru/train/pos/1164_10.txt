I saw this movie when it first came out. It was the official selection for the Temecula Valley International Film Festival, and I voted for it for the best photo. <br /> <br /> Justin Priestley is hot, psychotic, but complex Amanda. This is no ordinary psychopathic film. A lot of interesting and original schists by genre. Like "Fatal Attraction" for the younger set, which blends some great blues music, since Amanda's love object is married to an aspiring blues singer who has less time for her husband, since her career begins. <br />
