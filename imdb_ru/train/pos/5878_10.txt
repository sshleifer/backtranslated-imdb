“Garam Masala” is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Akshay Kumar is excellent as a womanizer, dealing with 3 girls and busy at the same time. John Abraham is funny from time to time, and this is still one of his best works. Paresh Rawail, as usual, is great in most of his films. Director Priyadarshan has made great films in the past. Hera Feri, Hunama and Hulchul are among the best. Garam Masala is his funniest film he made. Three newbie actresses are average. In this film, Rimi Sen gets no special attention. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a film with a simple storyline about a guy who has an affair with 3 girls at the same time. All three girls have a day off on the same day. Saturated with lots of laughter, this is one nonstop entertainer.
