Around March 5, I was in France, and I love going to this film festival. I knew about this Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but I never visited it. I decided to go, and then caught Cero y van 4. <br /> <br /> The movie is awesome. It did not affect me as Mexican users, because it was with French subtitles, but still shocking. <br /> <br /> This film is a satire about urban violence, kidnapping and crime in the streets. in Mexico. This is a rough portrait of the city. Metropolis. Secuestro Express, with a terrific Mia Maestro, which was also a satire of abduction, almost, but with a more serious tone, and I think something like a connection with Cero y van 4. A, sort of, a ransom story and how much is too much ? The man in the fire, who was incredibly strong, was also not a satire, but a rough portrait in the streets of Mexico. Or is it like Brave. The film, which is very shocking and amazing. This is similar to “Ordinary Suspects”, it has some plot twists, but it makes it even more believable. Verdict: a film that shocks and makes you believe that there is no more security on the streets. Awesome dialogue, impressive direction and amazing performances. Cero y van 4 is a movie that you will not forget soon. Leaves you to shiver and bemused.
