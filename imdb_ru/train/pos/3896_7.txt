Some people loved the “Aristocrats”, while others hated him, often leaving in the middle. The reaction to Eddie Izzard is unlikely to be so extreme - if you cope with the transvestite comedian (who says he loves girls) and you have a vocabulary that, let's say, uses the word “f” enough, his program will be one long beep if presented on network television. Many of Izzard's fans are so devoted that they see no flaws in his speeches. On the other hand, I thought that this show was sometimes flatter than Izzard's chest, but also more often than not funny and, in some places, absolutely funny. He has a way to connect the links from the procedures at the beginning of the show with his later procedures. He is not a storyteller. He is not a prankster. He is not a mad dreamer like Robin Williams. He plays with ideas, some of which work, and some - for example, the cable car routine in San Francisco and Alcatraz - are completely unfunny. He has a way, however, to gracefully go past the floppy rutin and expand those that connect. I gave this play 7 and could convince him to raise to 8. But 10? Never.
