Since this film was based on the real story of a woman who had two children and was not very well-off, it was just scary how real it really was! It was the acting that pushed the film to greatness. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton portrayed the protagonist, Patsy McCartle, who had two sons whom she adored. Her performance is what made the real story come to life on a television screen. It was very difficult to watch some of the scenes, because they were so real that they happened when someone became addicted to drugs. <br /> <br /> It was just hard to watch this very loving mother moving from a sweet to caring life. but so true. I know people who survived the dismissal, and it was very similar to what happened in this film, from what I remember. <br /> <br /> I also thought that it was very risky for the director to want to make a film of what happened to this woman. Yet it was done so well. I applaud the director for making this film. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this to anyone who knew someone who was ever addicted to drugs, or just to find out what can happen to you if you become addicted to them,
