Having the opportunity to see some of the shots in the Slavic village of Broadway, I could not wait to see its final version. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie at the Cleveland Premiere last Friday, I did not laugh out loud at the comedy for a long time! This is a great farce. Russian brothers did a great job managing. The whole cast plays his best comedy acting ... No slow or dry episodes ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors, and he's great as a crippled safe breaker in this film. I was most annoyed by William H. Macy in the role of the Riley trickster and Michael Jeter in the role of Toto, they kept you in the seams. I think they have the funniest roles in the whole movie.
