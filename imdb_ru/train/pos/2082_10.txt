I first read the magnificent novel by Pearl S. Buck in a ninth-grade history lesson, and I liked every exciting page of it. It was almost inevitable that Hollywood would take possession of it, and given that it was done in 1937, the results are excellent. <br /> <br /> Some things must be taken: in 1937 there was no question of casting around Asia the actors in the main Hollywood film. In a sense, this makes the final product more interesting than if they could use a more authentic cast. <br /> <br /> Overcoming this obstacle, executive producer Irving Talberg and director Sydney Franklin (among others) took the trouble to manually select the magnificent and star cast. Paul Mooney plays Van Lung. Muni was at the peak of his abilities as an actor during this period and could almost play whatever he wanted. As soon as you finish your makeup (this is good, but no one is going to really take him for the Chinese), his performance has all the credibility of his best work. <br /> <br /> Then Louise Reiner appears. Last year, winning an Oscar for performing at THE GREAT ZIEGFELD, the star of the Vienna actress grew, and she was assigned the role of plum O-Lan, despite the lack of experience in Hollywood. Her performance brought her the second Oscar in a row, for the first time in the history of what happened. <br /> <br /> A lot of criticism was directed to Rainerâ€™s performance, and her Oscar won here. It was called wooden and one note. There is a small amount of truth in this. HOWEVER, as they say, all you have to do is return to the book. After all, Rainer, though not Chinese, played O-lana almost the same way Buck wrote; in fact this is a great presentation and one of the best translations from book to screen I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, it was MGM. They had the biggest list of stars and actors in Hollywood at the time, and they had a big budget to pay for the best, and in the end they got the best. <br /> <br /> The film softens Van Lung's marriage with O-lan a few. In the novel, with the riches come the lusts of the flesh, and he takes a concubine, a step that devastates his wife, but her feelings as a simple woman do not concern him. In the film, the crushed Van Lung returns two pearls to his wife on his deathbed, which he took from her many years ago, realizing too late that she was his true love. <br /> <br /> Roots, yes. But this is Hollywood. Given the obstacles they faced, the film could well open with screams of laughter. But, despite the noticeable lack of real Asians in the cast, this film is surprisingly well worn over seventy-three years. In fact, the most amazing thing about this film is how good it is when it could easily be a disaster.
