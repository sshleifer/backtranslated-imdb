A simple movie at the beginning, a simple movie at the end. He has this infinite and feigned cliché, but most television films have such ways. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve does a good job at being a former con man. It seems to me that the marriage between her and the woman for whom he works is a bit strange, but I believe that for a set period of time this is quite plausible. <br /> <br /> Now I saw an edited version of “TV”, even when the movie was filmed and shown on “TV”, I find it a bit strange. But I feel that if I saw the whole play as a whole, I would most likely give it the same rating. <br /> <br /> J.T. Walsh does a good job, not the best role, but still .... good work. <br /> <br /> 7/10
