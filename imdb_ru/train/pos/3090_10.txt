I'm so upset that ABC refuses another show, which has a chance to become a real winner. This show is so good that the script and storyline were great, a real original idea for the show instead of another boring reality show. Casting was spectacular! Not only did the characters and actors excel, but this is a very talented set of actors. The concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a TV show, many of us share this idea of ​​“connections”. I really love the characters Stephen, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest, there is not a single person associated with this show that I didn’t like, even those who were only in a few episodes (for example, Cherie Appleby). Acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented! I would like ABC to give this show more chances and not interrupt it halfway through. In addition, it is not enough advertised. Really unfair! to each!!. This show showed a great promise. I, for example, will let ABC know how I feel, and will continue to send emails to support this show. Please join, I know we can do it. It worked for Jericho. (By the way, where is episode 13? I want this last show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC, we can do it !!! This show is worth it !!! Petition online to save six degrees: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html WE CAN DO IT !! SIGN THIS PETITION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE !!!
