I give this film A + for a clean life! As Maria Riva’s daughter, Dietrich, wrote in a book about her mother: “If you see the Garden of Allah in the context of a high camp, it can be very funny.” And How! I laughed with delight at the dazed account and the startling, ridiculous, fantastically melodramatic dialogue. Viewers who read stories about Boyer's wigs (he continued to peel off in the heat) will giggle every time he appears. <br /> <br /> Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other, giving their lines — instead they look dreamily into the distance, apparently so that their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most favorable light (if you you play a major role in turkey, you can also look good!). Dietrich's costumes are not from this world. As Riva notes in his book, Dietrich managed to steal Travis Benton from Paramount and make him create some of the most divine dresses, such as a chiffon beige dress and a raincoat. <br /> <br /> I wholeheartedly agree with others enthusiastic about Technicolor. It's hard to believe that the film was shot in 1936 - the color is fantastic. <br /> <br /> In short, if you look at the Garden of Allah with a gentle attitude and accept his folly, you will not be able to help, but enjoy
