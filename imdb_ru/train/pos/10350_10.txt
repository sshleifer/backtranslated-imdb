I believe that they were telling the truth all the time .. You cannot trust anything in the wild ... Their family went through hell. These poor boys are too young to understand what is happening around them. But you still have to deal with the rumors. And also cope with the loss of his younger sister. I can not believe that this business lasted so long. It seems that the jurors could not see the truth, even if they bit them on the ass. I feel this family, and if I can let them know, I hate what happened to them, I would. I have no idea what they went through, I can't even imagine it. After watching this movie, I was in tears and had to check my little girl in bed ... I think everyone should watch this.
