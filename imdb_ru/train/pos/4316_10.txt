I have to say that the Grand Canyon is one of the most exciting films I've ever seen. I watched it several times, and still feel the same as the first time; that this film in itself can constitute the entire graduate school curriculum in the direction of the film. <br /> <br /> Long ago, movie trailers promised: "It will make you laugh, it will make you cry." This is a very commonplace and brief method of describing what the Grand Canyon does. He will take you to the best places of human experience, and the next moment you will enter the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is moving back and forth in a circle between people close to happiness and the same people close to horror. It is always a short step too. Simply controlling this oscillation with grace and without it looking false or exaggerated is the genius of the director. <br /> <br /> A spoiler is approaching. After the audience is accustomed to swinging back and forth across the emotional spectrum, the film throws a curve with a sequence that does not go from good to bad and back, but instead outgrows the usual marital quarrel through an accidentally self-inflicted wound knife, which can Do not require stitching, for an earthquake in which characters run from home. At the moment of their relief, the argument is forgotten, the cut finger is forgotten, the earthquake survived, the neighbor shouts that her elderly husband has collapsed. A couple rushes to the rescue. I cried when I saw this sequence. I cried every time I saw it. I am crying now. It is not the sadness that does this to me. This is not a particularly sad sequence. What breaks me off is that these few minutes of the film were IDEAL. It's perfect! Amazing. (end of the spoiler) <br /> <br /> So much can be said about the Grand Canyon. He portrays relatively ordinary people who experience insights, and allows the viewer to test them for himself. They are not spectacular or bloated, and there is no long pause to carefully examine the moment. The film moves at a pace of life. Even when the characters try to understand what happened, they are not sure what can be learned from their experience. <br /> <br /> The Grand Canyon is a very human film.
