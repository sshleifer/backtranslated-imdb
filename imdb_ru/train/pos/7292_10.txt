I only saw this last Friday at the Los Angeles Film Festival in Lamley on Beverly. This film received the most applause of all the films that evening. Given that the two music videos were opened first, I did not know what to expect, as they were very fast and attracted attention, I was not sure that I was immediately ready for a short performance. But to my surprise, I really enjoyed it. I thought the main actor demon demon was really good. I was so impressed with his game that I checked his name. I was surprised to see that it was a sorcerer guy. He has become really good, especially since! Either this, or he was given lousy roles, or the director pushed the director for this short time. The girl did a good job. I think it's hard, because it was her first performance and being so young. Dad did a good job too. For short work there was a lot of really good work cg, both for this and for a short game in the next Mexican Hat, which was also nice, but I liked it most because it had more depth and emotions, and I really cared characters. The other was a very simple story. The story was rather telling and dark! He touched on real topics using a more fantastic approach to interest ADDITIONING people like me. We will not even talk about the last film in the block I left. My only complaint is that I would like me to see more of the demon character and start a little less, so I gave him 9 out of 10. I also thought that the final credits go a little slower. Otherwise, it was beautifully said, directed and edited. The time was very enjoyable with a complete change from the fast editing of MTV, done in everything at the moment. There will be more from this director in the future, as well as from the actor. Now I will think of him as the actor of the Lost in Sorrows, and not of the Arcane Blade.
