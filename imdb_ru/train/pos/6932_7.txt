“Winchester 73” is a story about a man (Jimmy Stewart) who is obsessed with regaining his valuable possession, a repetitive rifle made by Winchester. The rifle continues to pass from hand to hand, and Stewart stubbornly watches her. This 1950s black and white film by Anthony Mann is more of a crime than a traditional western, and cowboys often seem like modern-day gangsters than old-fashioned cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a woman of dubious dignity who goes to the ranch with a man (Charles Drake) whom she can marry. In the end, she falls in love with Stuart, but not before she gets around a little. Winters is the most complex character in the film, filled with unusual characters. Watch out for the young Dan Durea in the role of the crazy killer and Tony Curtis in a very small role. Awfully mistaken Will Gere plays Wyatt Earp.
