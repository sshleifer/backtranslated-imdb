I first saw this movie about 4 years ago, and I was expecting something ridiculous, similar to CB4. I was shocked. I was on the floor laughing, my ass from this movie is so cool. Much better than CB4, characters, songs, plot, everything. A first-class independent film given by Two Thumbs Up by Siskel and Egbert (and if two old white guys can understand the humor in this movie, you know, that's good)
