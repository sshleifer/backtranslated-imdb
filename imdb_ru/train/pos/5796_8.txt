Moonwalker is a film about fantasy music featuring Michael Jackson in various roles. I will evaluate each segment separately. <br /> <br /> Segment 1 opens a movie with a music video. The music video is a concert of Michael Jackson, performing the song "The Man in the Mirror". The music video also features a montage of historical figures such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King, J. R. Lennon, and others. The first segment was a good choice to open the film, I liked the song, and also liked the montage of historical figures. I even liked the message in the song. I give the first segment 9/10. <br /> <br /> Segment 2 shows a montage of Michael Jackson from the top five Jackson to his solo career. The montage I thought was well done, I liked the animation they put into it, and I also liked their choice of songs, such as “I want you to come back, win, Thriller, you feel it and what you make me feel. " The only thing I would like them to do a little better in one of the songs on the montage is “We are the world”. The reason that all you see are drops of rain, and in these drops are images of Michael Jackson and a celebrity choir, but the chorus is a bit difficult to see. Other than that, the segment is still good. I give it a 9/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 3 is the song Bad. You probably think that this music video of Michael Jackson is bad, but yes and no. This segment is a music video, but it is remade by children. The segment was pretty, but it wasn’t as good as the other segments. I give it a 6/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 4 is a short Claymation Music movie that comes after a children's bad version called “Speed ​​Demon”. The bottom line is that Michael Jackson is chasing his favorite fans and the press, he disguises himself as a rabbit and rides a motorcycle, trying to get away from them. The chase sequence in the chase sequence was gorgeous, but some parts of the film, the Slave characters, looked a bit fake when they interacted with real people. Also at the end of the clip, the costume of the rabbit Michael Jackson comes to life from nowhere, and he dances with him. I liked the dances, but it was as if from nowhere. I give it 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 5 - this is Michael Jackson’s music video “Leave Me Alone”. A music video about how the media shoots its nose into the personal life of Michael Jackson, and Michael Jackson feels that they will not leave him alone, no matter how innocent he is. The music video really speaks (but keep in mind that this happened before the child began to corrupt, these are just rumors about him in the 80s). But I did not feel that this video should be in this film, because it is a children's film, and I do not think that the child will understand what he is singing about. I give this music video 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 6 brings us to the main story of the whole movie called Smooth Crime. Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his wishing star abilities as a crime figure to protect children (including John Lennon’s son Sean Lennon) from an evil gangster named Mr. Bigg (played by Joe Sands). The segment I thought really brought the film, especially when he danced and sang the song "Smooth Criminal" with a group of criminals. I also thought the special effects were good. The weird thing in the Segment is why children hang out with an adult man, it never explained why. Also, the character Joe Sands talks about drugs and what he plans to do with them. I mean, why are you talking about drugs in a children's film. Otherwise it was good. My rating for this segment is 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 7 is the last segment of the entire film. The film ends with Michael Jackson singing a cover version of the song "Beatle" "Together", and then during the title we see Michael Jackson singing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael made a good cover of Come Together, and I think it would be nice to include a group of good singers with a talented musician like him. My rating is 9/10 <br /> <br /> This film is a good Michael Jackson film and I think it really evokes the imagination of children. The film is almost as creative as the Beatles animated series The Yellow Submarine, if you like Michael Jackson and you are ready for a film with great creative potential, this is a film. My overall rating for this movie is 8/10
