I like this movie. I knew it would be crowded and stupid like the original series. I was very pleased to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin and Julia Newmar together again. Anyone who loved the Batman series of the 1960s should have enjoyed The Return to the Cave. We can say that the actors had a lot of fun in this movie, especially Adam West. I bet he would happily jumped back into his Batman costume if the script demanded that of him. I told a few friends about this movie who decided not to watch it ... now they wanted them to watch. I have all the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this film will be included in my collection. Thanks for the reunion of Adam and Bert.
