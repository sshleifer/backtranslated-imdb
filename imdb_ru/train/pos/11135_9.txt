What makes Midnight Cowboy a successful film is how Joe Buck gets involved with Ratso Rizzo through a series of difficulties that affect both of them. In fact, in this film there are not many glimmers of hope for both characters, but the harsh realities that surround them both give the film its own type of optimism that these people, at least, can find humanity in each other. <br /> <br /> This film features the best performances of John Voight and probably Dustin Hoffman. The rest of the cast is composed of unknowns, although it is completed by an excellent series of characters, including the cow in the bus at the beginning of the film. In addition, for those who are interested, Andy Warhol's student Paul Morrissey briefly appears at the party. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, it is very important. Check this.
