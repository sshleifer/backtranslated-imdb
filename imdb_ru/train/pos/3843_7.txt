When I first saw this film in a theater at a foreign film festival, I thought that it was an intriguing, fascinating, sensitive, and a half-sex artist. Very European, very Dutch! I recently rented it for a second viewing and could barely stop laughing at this overwhelmed topic of a crazy writer with a set of religious-sexual persecution. Get control! This guy is a freeloader who lives outside society. I suspect that the real reason he is experiencing these fantasy nightmares about the "spider woman" is that his guilt complex begins to take effect a year after ignoring the mother's advice on how to get into cars (and sleep) with strangers ! Not only does he make outrageous amounts of (possibly tax-free) loot for inventing stories (a false trip of guilt), but he is too cheap to pay for a haircut, so he pushes the owner of a beauty salon. Then he has the courage to complain to the account! But I also suspect that the world has changed a lot since this movie was made. On a serious note, it was interesting to see some of the camera work of Jan de Bont and one of the earlier films of Paul Verhoeven. Hmmm, maybe the world hasn't changed so much?
