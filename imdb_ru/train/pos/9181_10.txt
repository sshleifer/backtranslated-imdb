I had no idea what Jane Eyre was before I saw this mini-series. I read and watched a lot of classic works before, and I believed that most classic works were boring, paraphrased and overpriced stories with moderately interesting stories at best. This mini-series Jane Eyre completely changed my views. <br /> <br /> Zela Clark is an amazing actress, and she perfectly demonstrates Jane Eyre. Her accent is delightful, and her calm, but firm nature exactly matches the character of the young governess. Timothy Dalton - stunning Rochester. His passion and energy in the film make me believe that he was born to play the thoughtful master Thornfield-Hall. I could not sleep all night after watching this mini-series. The plot is haunting and inspiring. The characters are masterfully executed, and the story is incredible. This is the best version of Jane Eyre that has ever appeared in a movie. <br /> <br /> I read the book later and was amazed at how closely this mini-series followed the writings of Charolet Bronte. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life, see Jane Eyre's version for the BBC in 1983.
