Please note that all those who did not like or enjoy this film, noted that it is not as good as the book, or that it is different from the book. <br /> <br /> I do not understand such criticism. Books and movies are different media. While books have hours and hours for character and storyline development, films have about 120 minutes. Nevertheless, the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses: visual, sound, and also imagination. I don't care how good or actually the film has any similarity with the book on which it is based. What's the difference? I judge by what it is. <br /> <br /> This TV movie was fascinating. An old and frequently occurring story, prone to clichés, could easily be embarrassing. However, Riffen and Reeves cope. One reviewer found Riffen far from the old. I would never have guessed that she was 40 when she made this film. It is her merit as an actress that she played a 23-24-year-old child surprisingly well. I also think this is the best thing Reeves ever did. The story could have been stronger, and I agree that the script could use a “toughening”. However, it is worth a look; obviously not a strong love story, but rather a charming romance that will leave you satisfied that love is a strong emotion, and good triumphs over evil. And it's nice to see a “love story” without the obligatory word f # $%, bare buttocks or a few hours of kisses that change saliva. <br /> <br /> Finally, the musical score is excellent.
