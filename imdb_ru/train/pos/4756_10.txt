This is one of the most amazing episodes of the Twilight Zone with a funny dialogue and funny characters to relieve the tension in some creepy moments. There is the usual blond vampire "dancer" (what happened to Serling's love for such a character, so she continues to appear in different episodes?) And other different characters, but this is the "old man" Jack Elam who completely steals the show, I find it funny a carefree version of Monsters on Maple Street - or perhaps a 20-minute travesty of The Thing Twilight Zone. On another note: I thought a young episode lover might be someone who eventually moved on to other things — he looked familiar — but it seems that Ron Kipling disappeared after just two television titles to his name.
