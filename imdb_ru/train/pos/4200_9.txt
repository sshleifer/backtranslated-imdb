Samuel Fuller's pickup truck on South Street is anomalous: the film “Red Panic”, devoid of hysteria, in which the communist threat is nothing but McGuffin, stirring up the plot. Pickpocket Richard Widmark frees free woman Jean Peters from her wallet with a strip of microfilm; Unbeknownst to any of them, he harbors secrets vital to the cold war. As it turned out, Peters was under the supervision of FBI agents who were just as puzzled by theft as the person controlling her, cowardly commissioner Richard Keely. Trying to find a precious film, both parties enlist the support of Thelma Ritter, Jane's old street-guard, who is always well-known and ready to sell what she hears. <br /> <br /> Fuller draws from a lush palette of tempo and tonality in a story telling, which becomes a time trial of increasing cruelty. From the subway to the waterfront of his mid-summer, Manhattan gets sweaty shine that is almost sharp. The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mix of violent and gentle, and they sound like “Again”, the song presented by Ida Lupino in Road House, also with Widmark in the lead role. The pace is slowing down for the perfectly written and played scene of Ritter's death - among the sharpest vignettes in all noirs, and a kind of mirage-oasis in the film consisting of sentimentality. This is the only work of the writer / director Fuller in the most rigorous framework of the noir cycle; his later studies of American pathology (“Crimson Kimono”, “Naked Kiss”, “Another World in the USA”) never led to such a synthesis as Pickup on South Street.
