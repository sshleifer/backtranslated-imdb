Wow. A truly fantastic film “Journey”, in which tons of super-surrealistic images, dark intentions and black, a rather strange feeling of how animated animals should see the world. It is filled with a very cute extraterrestrial group of characters that bend and flow with a distorted background. As with all other fantasies, the wandering plot is secondary to mind-blowing visual effects, and we follow the little cat and its zombie sister when they meet death, deluge, water elephants, samurai swordsmen and pigs who fish . I have never heard of it, but now I love it - probably because it reminded me of a surrealist pencil job with an American cartoonist; Bill Plympton This is a crazy delight for fans of strange, beautiful things, and it made me stick to the screen for fear that I would miss something amazing. Simply put, this is “Hello Kitty” without “o”.
