“Inviting to Hell” is better than the typical “Made for Television” film, endowed with great casting (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, Pre-Murphy Brown Joe Regalbuto, Soleil Moon-Fry) and a renewed concept of the familiar Faustian plot. Urich, as always, is pleasant, while Lucci is especially attractive and devilishly excited as the mother of all fatal women. Like the hybrid version of STEPFORD WIVES and THEY LIVE, the film confirms Milton’s apocalyptic vision early, and horror fans most likely will not have many complaints before juicy, depraved depravity. 7/10
