This is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue. what dialogue appears in the words of balls, as in manga. The plot of this exists, but only vaguely explained. There is a problem with the manga on which it is based, available in English in the Combustion Underground Books collection, Comics Underground Japan, and it has a dialogue with subtitles that explains the story a little more than here. I recommend checking out this volume if you like it, as it explains some of the “plots” of the film that are otherwise inexplicable. in terms of animation, this is pretty decent, good unobtrusive use of computers, and the images are mostly well implemented. he jumps and leaves episodes when the characters, the cat and his mentally retarded older sister cat wander and leave a number of strange images: a boat, a circus, a desert. in just half an hour, they go through several plots and settings, which allows me to believe that the director chose a number of long manga questions for random adaptation, but mostly chose visually. knowing what is going on may increase the score somewhat. it reminds me basically that they played on the mtv show, cartoon sushi, in particular a short film in which the cat pursues the severed ass of a man throughout the house. only in this case, the cats are more like hello kittens, and their adventure expands to include death and reincarnation and a number of other topics [although it's not so simple to say what is happening]. The DVD has director comments and “create” functions, but I cannot comment on them because I have not reached them. Now I give 8/10, there is not so much to compare it in anime, and I hope for more.
