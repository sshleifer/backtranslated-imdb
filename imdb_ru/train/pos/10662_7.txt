Leonard Maltin must have watched some other movie. (Although I consider his Guide to be a very valuable resource, please disregard his comments on this issue.) He states that "it starts well, then faints," when everything is really the opposite - "it starts cool, then it lights up." The plot is as simple as it turns out. “Happy Mom”, “Happy Dad” and “Happy Son” rest on a secluded beach, dad failed in an accident, mom escapes for help, meets a convict with a dangerous escape. Mom is trying to fraudulently get the convict to help, while Dad is waiting and holding on to his dear life. <br /> <br /> A good snow-white man experiences Ralph Meeker's electric push, suddenly appearing (director John Sturges shoots him in a clever way that will make you gasp) about halfway as a sly, desperate criminal. Miker is an unusually frivolous, reckless actor (at least here in the classic “Kiss Me Deadly”), and he happily grabs the keys to the film's narration and accelerates with the top down. His character has a childish habit of smiling and saying "Pretty neat, eh?" when he is especially pleased with his misdeeds. When they get a flat tire, an amusing break occurs, and he briefly instructs his hostage Barbara Stanwyk: "Don't go." She replies: “Where am I going?” (They are off the beaten path), and he understands the sitcom “Yes, that’s true.” The friction between them is a cry. <br /> <br /> There are flaws, somewhat ridiculous. There is one scene where the police, who for some time chased after Micker, stopped the machine of Stanwyk and evaded detection. Miker lays her head on her shoulder, as if she were a loving husband, and pretends to be asleep when she is interrogated. A. He looks clearly masculine in this position, and B. I think it can be said with confidence that any adult who seems to be sleeping during a meeting with law enforcement agencies will surely be suspicious. <br /> <br /> Still a tough thriller that builds on exciting and edifying imprisonment. <br /> <br />
