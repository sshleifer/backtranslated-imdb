This movie was great! It was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth. The animation was a bit strange, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for the Disney movie without singing. <br /> <br /> The background animation was magical. It was a different level of work for the Disney people. Some of the characters were a bit square, but this was more than made up for by the beauty and pomp of the landscape. The music was largely instrumental, but it was ideal for the film. It was definitely not the movie the characters needed the song. <br /> <br /> Great. 10 out of 10.
