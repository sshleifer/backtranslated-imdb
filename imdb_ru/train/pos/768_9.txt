Cinematically this film stinks. Just like many actors. But I <br /> <br /> don't care. If there is a clear idea of ​​how the 80s were <br /> <br /> (in any case, for many of us living inside the city), and what hip-hop is, Zulu <br /> <br /> the nation and the gap Dance was really similar. Great music, great dancing! It almost looks like a documentary about the time that <br /> <br /> had when hip-hop was a way of life. It is also interesting to see how New York looks like the epicenter of a nuclear attack. Some viewers <br /> <br /> may be too young to remember that it was a poor, dilapidated city <br /> <br /> in the 70s and 80s. This is the best of all hip-hop dance films / break <br /> <br /> that appeared during this period. Of course, now the <br /> <br /> 80s are considered a joke with all the bad TV shows and movies <br /> <br />, but those of us who survived this will always be remembered <br /> <br This is naive when music, dancing and graffiti were fresh, hey!
