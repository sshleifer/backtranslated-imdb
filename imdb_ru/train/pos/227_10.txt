Robert Duval is a direct descendant of Confederate General Robert Lee, according to the IMDb.com movie database. After watching this film, you might think that Duvall's appearance is reincarnation at best. One of my favorite movies. I would like the composer Peter Rogers Melnik to have a CD or have a soundtrack available. Beautiful landscapes and music, and “everything is too realistic”, especially for those of us who live or have moved to the south. This is the “present moment of time” Life moves slowly, but "we have no strangers left."
