This great film could not register a higher rating than 5! Why not! This is an excellent depiction of the life of Christ without the ruthless sensational film "The Passion of the Christ." Johnny Cash did great things for God, which are surprisingly avoided and neglected in areas where they should be most important, for example, in our churches. It took the film itself less than a month to make the film, because Johnny felt the strong presence of God directing him through it. Many thanks to everyone involved in this extremely sincere film, who will always cherish at least the Billy Graham Crusade rated him high enough to use it as a primary source of education for new Christians. Thanks to Fox for his production. As Walk the Line proved that it was strange that this man survived, but he alone produced such an undervalued masterpiece. Films are not canonized by popular vote, as this production proves! Thus, I believe that this film is one of the greatest documentaries in the world, as it is directly, honestly depicted and is a great testimony of the Christian faith!
