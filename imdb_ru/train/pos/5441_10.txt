Anyone with a little boy in the house who will not watch black and white films should put it on their TV. When a child passes by, wondering what everyone on the screen is shouting and shooting, tell him that this is a picture for adults, and that it is not yet big enough to look at it. It will keep him there for a few minutes; director George Stevens and his team will bring it to the end. <br /> <br /> I think my father did this to me anyway, and I am the best person for this. This classic adventure yarn, established in India during the British occupation, is a trio of army sergeants who are faced with a divorced alliance in the face of decay when they are preparing to marry their lover. Help comes in the form of a vicious uprising of the Bandits, against which the soldiers are united. <br /> <br /> “Gunga Dean” was one of the best films that came out of the best Hollywood year of 1939. Even more than most excellent films of that golden year, it is very exciting and accessible. The theme of the music is instantly humble nirvana. Called in California, cinematography (the only thing in Gunga Din that got as much as an Oscar nomination) has an amazing magnificence that is very similar to the Rajah hundreds of years ago. The battle scenes are shot in a very realistic way, not too cruel, but very dirty, as people fall, shoot and run around all corners of each frame in a way that looks real, and not in the setting of the biblical festival Cecil B. Demil. <br /> The script not only creates battle scenes, but also develops the relations of three sergeants with an excellent sense of humor. Focus is on the sergeant. Cutter chasing after fairy tales of golden treasures. This is a rare actor for Cary Grant, and his lightness is just right for a film that never takes itself seriously, even though it develops tension. <br /> <br /> Anchor trio - sergeant. McChesney (Victor McLaglen), who loves his elephant Annie and tries to protect Cutter from his own brain-hare. He is also funny in his own way, leaving the sergeant. Ballantyne (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., demonstrates Errol Flynnish's pretty trait) as a person with love interest and reason enough to know that he needs to leave his boyfriends buddies and grow up. <br /> <br /> If “Gung Dean” This was a lifelong film, he talked about Joan Fontaine’s attempts to save her man from his two unfortunate friends and their crushing skulls. But since this is a film for guys, the emphasis here is on the fact that the troika must stay together and save Ballantyne from a fate that is worse than death, not only marriage, but, as Cutter exclaims several times with indignation, the tea business too. <Br /> <br /> The political correctness police are working hard on this film, and not so much on the gender issue, but on the idea of ​​British soldiers who are saving the poor Indians from vicious bandits. It smells of colonial apology. Fortunately, this film was made when the producers did not feel the need to explain the obvious liberalism that underlies the film that these three sergeants, so full of recklessness and false racial pride, should be saved along with the rest of their army — humble bhisti, of which only one of the three had at one time, when he sought their approval. In the end, despite all their fame, the real victim of the film includes the title character, which Sam Jaffe played so heartbreakingly. <br /> <br /> When this film was shot, the film mogul Jack Warner had a saying: You want to send a message, use Western Union. Nevertheless, it seems that the messages in “Gunga Dinah” flew quickly and violently. Now I am watching a movie and wondering if the audience didn’t even think about what Gunga Dean had in mind when he brought Cutter to the golden temple. Was he really plotting revenge against his British overlords? Would he be justified in this, especially given McChesney's cold attitude towards him? When Colonel Weed utters this praise, the poem by Rudyard Kipling, on which the film is based, was it tilted towards the stupidity of imperialism, imposing it on someone who turned out to be “better than me” to the end? What they did from the great speech of the Guru, delivered in perfect English: “You took an oath as a soldier to possibly die for the faith that is your country, England. Well, I can die for my country and my faith as readily as you ... India, goodbye. <br /> <br /> Of course, the same character also teaches his cruel followers: “Kill for the love of killing! Kill for love Kali! Kill me Kill me Murder! ”This means that we are allowed to hate him and cheer for the British, and keep asking what all this means for the future. <br /> <br /> What“ Gunga Dean ”means to me most likely fast The most reliable 90-minute thrill on video.The cutter never found its golden temple, but for all of us there is one watching “Gunga Dean.”
