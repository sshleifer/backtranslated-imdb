I am only 11 years old, but I discovered Full House when I was about five years old, and I constantly watched him until I was seven years old. Then I got older and thought that Full House could wait, and that I had “more important” things. In addition, there was also the fact that my younger brother, who sincerely watched me during these two years, did not like the fact that he was too “girlish.” <br /> <br /> Then I realized that every day at five o'clock it was 23, and I again became dependent on it. The full house made me laugh and cry. It made me realize how good it would be if our world were like the world of Full House plus Mom. I heard people say that Full House is stupid and incredible. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mother was killed by a drunk driver. The sisters swear and hurt their feelings. Three men who live with girls can sometimes quarrel. What could be more real than that? <br /> <br /> In any case, the show raised me when I fell, and raised me even higher when I thought I was on the verge of complete happiness. I howled like a hyena on the show and gained a huge obsession with Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course, Hilary Duff has now taken this place, but they were literally the cutest children I have ever seen. They are wonderful actresses and, it seems, very nice people.)
