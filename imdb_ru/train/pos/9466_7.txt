Dan, the father of the widow of three girls, has his own advice column, which will probably go into syndication. After the death of his wife, he took the time to raise his daughters. Not romantically known for a long time, nothing prepares him to meet shining Maria at a local bookstore in a small town on Rhode Island on the ocean, where he went to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his large family. After Marie fell in love with him at first sight, he was little prepared when a gorgeous woman appeared in the family complex. After all, she is the date of Dan's brother, Mitch. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning it is clear that Dan and Marie are made for each other, and although we feel the result, we are aiming for a fun trip that Peter Hedges, the director wants to give us. Mr. Hedges, the author and screenwriter himself, gave us two excellent novels “What Eats Gilber Grapes” and “Ocean in Iowa” and the amazing indie “Pieces of April”, which he also shot. It’s just a coincidence that both films deal with families during Thanksgiving Day reunions. <br /> <br /> The best thing in the film is natural chemistry between two stars, Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche. In fact, Mr. Carell is getting better all the time. In many ways, he reminds us of Jack Lemmon in his comedy and serious material. What can be said about Ms. Binoche, a clever actress and a bright presence in any film. She proves she comes to a comedy, convincing us of her Marie. <br /> <br /> The only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture. John Mahoney, Dianne Wiest, Norbert Leo Buts, Jessica Hecht, Emily Blunt Allison Pill, Amy Ryan, have nothing in common. They just play the role of music for decoration. Dane Cook, who has been seen with Brother Mitchum, is better because he reads more lines than others. <br /> <br /> “Dan in real life” is an amazing movie that everyone will like.
