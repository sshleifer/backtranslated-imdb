** Warning - this post may contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I received the Gamecube only in September 2005, and the first two games I bought were games about James Bond, a decent Under Fire agent and a dull Goldeneye Rogue Agent. The next game I was planning to get was “All or nothing”, because my friend told me that this is better than the two games that I already had. I have to say, he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought it for ten at HMV, and when I got home, I bumped it into my cube and played for hours on end. It was much better than in my other two games, and the plot was much better and more interesting. The graphics were one of the best I've ever seen (but now that the XBOX 360 was released, the best graphics known to man have appeared in Farcry Instincts Predator). The storyline was smart; The madman (Willem Defoe, named Nikolai Diavolo) and the beautiful henchman (Heidi Klum, named Katya Nadanov) are trying to destroy the world with tiny nanobots, which you, James Bond, must destroy at the beginning of the game by train. The bad thing is that one of them is hidden in Kati's boobs. Then you need to thwart their plans and save the world. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this game is that it has actors voicing characters, for example, Clezie voiced by Q. There are 27 levels, some of them are short and some of them are quite long and complex. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Playback value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> I give this game a total of 90 %
