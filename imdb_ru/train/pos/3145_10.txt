This 70s show is the best TV show ever created. It's there with the Andy Griffen show, Saturday night live and the Simpsons in my book. The 70s show lasted for 8 seasons, and all of them were devoted to a group of teenagers / young people who were engaged in relationships, separation from their parents and a common future. <br /> <br /> Two main characters, Eric and Donna, two teenagers live next door to each other. They lived next door for most of their lives, and just begin to have more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season. Most of the show revolves around how their relationship works. <br /> <br /> The other two characters, Red and Kitty, are Eric's parents. Red was in the service, so he pushes Eric. Kitty is just the opposite. Despite the fact that she drinks heavily, she is very caring about Eric and his friends. Bob, their neighbor, is obviously Donna's dad. Bob giggles with several different women in the rough story of the show. Bob also annoys Red to the full. <br /> <br /> The remaining characters, Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie, are friends of Eric. They also play an important role in the history of the series. <br /> <br /> The first season is great. This is when characters start feeling new things for each other. The first season is original, fun and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The second season is good, although not as good as the first. This is the main continuation of the First. Eric and Donna together, and everything works fine. <br /> <br /> The third season is my favorite. It came back and captured the feeling of the First Season and humor. I also think that the chemistry of the characters has improved, making the series even more fun to watch. <br /> <br /> The fourth season is not so good. Eric and Donna Arne do not participate in this, making the show a little less enjoyable. It’s still fun, although I didn’t enjoy it as much as the previous seasons. <br /> <br /> The fifth season is the last season I have enjoyed all the time. This is the senior year of the gang, so it really helps in the story. The fifth season also had the best ending of all the seasons. <br /> <br /> The sixth season is good for the most part. It is very funny, although it does not reflect the sensations experienced by other seasons. The gang came out of high school, so I believe that this did not hit the teenager, as in previous seasons. I also did not like the last three or four episodes, given that they had a serious sense of drama. <br /> <br /> The seventh season reflects the same feeling as the 5th season, although it doesn’t do it completely I enjoyed the seventh season just like everyone else, and the final is great. <br /> <br /> Last season was off. Erica was not in it, which destroyed it. Kelso also did not participate in this, which did not help. I hated the eighth season down to the last episode. I thought the last episode was really good, and the appropriate ending to the series. <br /> <br /> In general, if you like comedy, try the series “Thirties”. They stopped making new episodes, but it's still a bunch on television. I also recommend buying seasons 1-7. It is up to you if you want to buy season 8.
