This Raggedy Ann and Andy Movie is simply amazing. We like to watch Ann and Andy sing and dance along with a camel with wrinkled knees. It is thanks to this film “Camel with wrinkled knees” became so popular when he sang his song “I am nobody, I love you”. If you love Raggedy Ann and Andy, watch a movie and you will understand why this is a movie that kids and adults love!
