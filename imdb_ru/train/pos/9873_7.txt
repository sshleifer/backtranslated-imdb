Lily Mars, a girl from a small town living in Indiana, wants to succeed on Broadway, and her aspirations inspire when successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to her hometown. Lily tries her best to make Thornway notice her, but he is just annoyed by her antics. When Thornway returns to New York to stage his show, Lily follows (unknown to John, of course), and Thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show, only as a favor to her family, but Thornway begins to fall in love with this young and romance are blooming, which makes the leading lady of the show Isabelle Recky jealous. When Isabel is fed up with John-Lily's novel, causing friction during the show, she leaves, and John decides to make Lily a star. Isabel returns later, and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she has returned to her small role in the play, which can also jeopardize the romance. A very charming film and a refreshing change to see how Garland brings comedic touches to her role (her reading of Lady MacBeth, although it should be humorous, never threatened her singing career). I liked Heflin's (Thornway) character more when he was annoyed by Lily, rather than be a romantic. The film was supposed to be somewhat predictable, and the scenes were not put together, but a very pleasant film. Rating, 7.
