I watched this film so many times through my children's cap, that even to this day I can largely reconsider the entire dialogue. And when I watch it now, it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laughing. I think it is amazing how they managed to train animals, especially a cat, to such an extent that they are able to play a major role in a feature film. However, watching it now, I also, unfortunately, can notice that this is not a masterpiece that I once thought. But I prefer to remember what I felt about this when I was younger, when I watched it on VHS on my first TV, which dimmed the image in yellow. And given that this is a children's film, so I would definitely definitely give him 10/10.
