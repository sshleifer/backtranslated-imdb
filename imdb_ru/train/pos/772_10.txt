Love is stunning ... In all its manifestations ... Gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous ... Tudor Cyril, Maria Popistas and Ioan Barbu, one truly dramatic story about love in all its manifestations, a story about indiscriminate ways of young hearts about life and lost innocence everything is directed by the skillful eye of Tudor Giurgiu. With a great soundtrack featuring Faultline & Chris Martin and Vama Veche, this is surprising in every way, leaving behind the sour taste of not understanding love ... Really great ... Is it me or the Romanian cinematography that is slowly but surely advancing and gaining respect? This is a brilliant film ... Two fingers to all participants.
