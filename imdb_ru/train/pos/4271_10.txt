This is the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I saw the film on Dutch television in 1988 (?). <br /> <br /> That month they showed a Yugoslav film. Every Sunday evening. <br /> <br /> Another great film came out next week (with the train, not the bus), whose name I don’t remember. If you know this, please let me know! Anyway, how can I see this movie again? DVD of this movie, where ?? Please tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nl <br /> <br /> Another great movie came out next week (involving the train, not the bus), which I don’t remember. If you know this, please let me know!
