Peace in War is one of the best documentaries about World War II. <br /> <br /> 24 episodes tell about the war and how it happened in the countries involved in it. The first episode tells us how Hitler came to power and how he managed to create one of the most powerful armies in the world. They are also outraged by the hostilities undertaken during the war and the Holocaust. One of the strongest and best documentaries ever made. All of you should watch this. Perfection! 10/10 <br /> <br />
