Big surprise, probably because I expected it to suck. The reviews were rather dismissive to this, although they all seemed to agree that the concept was golden: the man finds out that his new girlfriend is a superhero, and finds when he wants to break up with her, that sheâ€™s kind of crazy. I kept expecting it to fall apart, but it never happened. Sure, it does not make as much of its amazing premise as it could, and chooses to be short, when it might be better to expand the universe of the film. But I can't blame it for that. Uma Thurman is gorgeous as a bipolar superhero, the G-Girl. And I discovered, after a few years of hostility towards him, that Luke Wilson can be absolutely perfect when he is removed as a club. He received two of the best comic performances of 2006 (the other in a rather unpublished idiocracy). I absolutely did not pay attention to the expressions of his face when he and Thurman first had sex. This is one of the funniest sex scenes. My only real complaint is that they make the G-Girl too crazy, almost unbelievable. Maybe with some background I could take it better. I can forgive his shortcomings, because I had a really good time watching this. Undervalued, for sure.
