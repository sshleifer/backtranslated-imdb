This documentary was nominated for an Oscar, and it's easy to see why. Even after 45 years, this is a pretty impressive job. Why this is not printed is a mystery that only Disney can explain. It is good to use live frames and animations in tandem. It used to run as part of Disney's Refuge every few months or so, but I havenâ€™t seen it on the list for a long time. * sigh * Most recommended.
