At the beginning of the film, we see May and Toots preparing for a trip to London to visit their adult children. It is evident that Toots is not in the best health, but he agrees. When he dies suddenly, May's world begins to spin out of control. <br /> <br /> The film directed by Roger Michella, based on the play of Hanif Qureshi, is a study of how this figure of the mother comes to an agreement. with her new life status and her awakening to a world about which she did not even suspect that he existed until now. <br /> <br /> May's life as a wife in the suburbs was probably boring. Obviously, her sex life was almost nothing. We learn that she had a short extra family business, and then nothing at all. When Mei loses her husband, she cannot return home, so instead she looks after her grandson in her daughterâ€™s house. It is in this setting that May begins to crave a young and healthy Darren, her daughter's random lover. <br /> <br /> Darren in May awakens a passion she never knew. May responds by transforming herself before our eyes. May, who is vigorous at the beginning of the film, suddenly begins to dress up, becoming an interesting and attractive woman. As a result, she falls from head to toe with this young man, who makes her satiate herself with a passion she never experienced. <br /> <br /> Knowing a couple of cases similar to this story, I was not surprised to follow the reaction of May. Her own chance of a normal relationship with Bruce, a widower, disappoints Mai, who understands how good her sex is with Darren. We believe that the young man is engaged in this business only in order to satisfy himself and get the opportunity to extort money from May. Finally, daughter Helen finds out what mom was doing behind her back when she discovers the erotic pictures that her mother made. <br /> <br /> The film is a director's triumph. In "Ann Reed," Mr. Michell found an unusual actress who brings so much into the role of May. Also amazing is Daniel Craig. He knows how Darren will react to the situation. Anne Wilson Jones in the role of Helen is also vital for this story, since it is she who has to deal with the mother in what is happening behind her back. Oliver Ford Davis plays the role of Bruce, Helen's older class, and is very effective. <br /> <br /> The film is useful to those who see it unbiased. <br /> <br />
