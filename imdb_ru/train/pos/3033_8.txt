Good old black and white Graham Green based people in dangerous times, performing heroic and mysterious deeds. Hardly a shot, or a blow, and a hundred times more interesting than the cast that minted Hollywood today. Bacall, of course, lights up the screen, and Boyer is fully occupied. They no longer make such films.
