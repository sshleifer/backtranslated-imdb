I first saw Enchanted April about five years ago. I liked it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy for the next Christmas. We are talking about two women who decided to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, leaving behind them their nasty life. They are very sad women at the beginning of the film, and you cannot but support them, as they plan this trip with the two other women they invite to share the costs. This is perhaps the most enjoyable film I've ever seen. It is pure and simple, without chasing the car, without enmity and death. It was made with care and very good taste. You can not help but smile, despite all this - except when you are crying happy tears!
