Historical drama and the history of adulthood with the participation of free people of color in the pre-civil war in New Orleans. It starts slowly, but is gaining momentum as soon as you know about the main characters, and the real action can begin. This is not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because they were free people. They may not have all the rights of whites, but they certainly had more control over their fate than their slave ancestors. Young men and women in this story must make their own choices about how to live their lives, whether to succumb to the depravity of the system or live with optimism and contribute to their community. I liked all the characters, but my favorites were Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel.
