On the night of his bachelor party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets the magnificent dancer Becky (Julia Stiles) at the bar, they drink a lot together, and the next morning he wakes up with her on the bed. His future mother-in-law calls him and reports that his bride Karen (Selma Blair) may arrive at his apartment, and he desperately asks Becky to leave his place in a hurry. Soon he discovers that she has crabs, and later, when preparing her wedding dinner, he realizes that Becky is Karen's cousin. This is the beginning of a very funny comedy with funny situations. The first attraction of this film is definitely the central trio of actresses and actors. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who are great actresses and extremely gorgeous, and Jason Lee, who is amazingly funny, have good performances. I laughed a lot at the story, but there are some scenes that are really funny. For example, when Paul finds Becky in his bed; when he finds her paint; his imagination in many situations; in a pharmacy, trying to buy and get explanations about crab medicine; most scenes of his neighbor, the minister; when Karen calls the department store; or when the police find a suspect in the assault on Paul. I could list many other scenes, but itâ€™s better to rent or buy this film to enjoy it. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ("Mad for them")
