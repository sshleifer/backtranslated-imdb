This is a very catchy western spaghetti. He has a great storyline, interesting characters and a great acting game, especially from Rosalba Neri. Her role as an evil villain in this film is truly classic. She steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she does not speak. Her performance is very believable. She manages to be simply fascinating, not being excessive (not that there is something bad about being excessive). Mark Damon is amazingly good in this movie too. <br /> <br /> An excellent musical score, and it is this song that will sound in your head constantly for several days after watching the movie, regardless of whether you want it. or not. There are a couple of details that are very fun. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri is undressing in front of a parrot. There are also many deft shots that are very well made. <br /> <br /> I would probably give this film 8 or 9 stars if it were not for two things. The first one is a silly bar fight that takes place about 25 minutes after the movie starts. This is one of the funniest fights I've ever seen in a movie. He is very poorly posed and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any real fight. You could have missed it if it was a comedy with Terence Hill / Bad Spencer, but this is a more serious western, and the fight really should have been more realistic. Another thing that annoyed me in this film is Yumaâ€™s sneaky Mexican sidekick. I guess he was supposed to be a comic relief or something, but the character was just stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he was not at all funny. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him? <br /> <br /> After all this, let me assure everyone who reads this that Johnny Hume is a classic spaghetti western, despite the flaws I mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to watch this movie.
