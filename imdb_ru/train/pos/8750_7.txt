Brokedown Palace is the story of two best friends, Alice and Darlene, who spontaneously go to Thailand and go to prison after being caught with drugs in their luggage. Thus, the film could turn into a serious and touching film, such as “Return to Paradise”, but instead he decided to focus a little on the position of the girls and more on their friendship. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both perform in excellent performances, and the film is much more about the interaction between them - suspicion, jealousy, questioning and checking their friendship and, ultimately, sacrifices made in the name of friendship This film chooses not to go deep into politics or even into the severity of prison life (which is a bit embellished) and focuses more on these issues of friendship. <br /> <br /> There were some gaps in the plot, and some parts that simply did not seem believable or realistic. We did not feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as we could. And we have very little life outside the prison walls, when Bill Pullman plays a supposedly sloppy lawyer who really has a heart of gold. In short, the film was supposed to be much darker than it was. <br /> <br /> But in general I liked him. The game was good, the soundtrack was perfect, and the storyline had enough twists to stay interesting. Worth seeing.
