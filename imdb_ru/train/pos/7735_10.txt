Excellent interpretation of the novel by Jim Thompson, this neo-noir-thriller has all the necessary elements: an abnormal ex-boxer who has become a drifter, an alcoholic widow with sinister desires, an ex-cop who has become a petty crook, and a conspiracy to steal. However, the film never crosses a clich√© country, but remains new and intriguing. All the performances are great, especially the role of Bruce Dern in the role of an evil pony, Uncle Bud. In the film's motion, there is intense uncertainty, which, deliberate or not, adds to the dark process. Highly recommended.
