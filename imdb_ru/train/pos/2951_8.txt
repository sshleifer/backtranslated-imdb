Yes, this is a click of a chicken, and it moves rather slowly, but in fact it is quite good - and I consider myself a courageous person. You have to love Judy Davis, no matter what she is, and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural, convincing idea. <br /> <br /> The landscape of a small coastal summer place is beautiful and blends well. The main theme of the film. Unknown (at least unknown to me) actors and actresses give a realistic film that attracts you and holds your attention. Overall, I give 8/10. Go look.
