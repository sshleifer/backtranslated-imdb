Modern viewers know this small film primarily as a model for the remake of "The Pit of Money." Today, older viewers watch it with nostalgia: Cary Grant, Mirna Loy and Melvin Douglas were “superstars” in an easier and less complex era. Or was it? Time, of course, has a way to change perspectives, and with so many films that today are sarcastic with social and political commentary, there is a natural curiosity to wonder about the contradictions in old, seemingly less provocative films. Therefore, in “Mr. Blandings is building his dream house” can be more than what the audience was looking for in 1948. There is a political comment, albeit thin. Finding a home in the late 40s was a truly annoying experience, only slightly softened by the arrival of the Levitts and the like. Politics in the film? The children of Blandings always seem to talk about progressive ideas that they are taught in school (which in real life can blame teachers for communism). In real life, Mirna Loy was also an activist, a democracy and a feminist. Melvin Douglas was a no less ardent Democrat: He was married to Congressman Helen Gagagan Douglas, whom the young Richard Nixon accused of being partial to communism (and who destroyed it). Jason Robards, Sr., plays a small role in the film, but his political activism was no less noticeable. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards Jr., would have been a very active liberal democrat for many years. Almost strange was Cary Grant, whose sharp conservatism reflected the political sentiment of the majority in Hollywood, which already eluded. But it was 1948: Communism was a real threat, and the blacklist is not far off. It will take another decade before political activity will reappear in major films, and then not so subtly.
