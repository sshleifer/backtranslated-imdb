John Travolta, the world's biggest honkeytonk and mechanical bull ... what more can you ask for! Yes, you probably won't get many surprises or a deep sense in that. Nevertheless, I always found it rather pleasant to watch this novel of the redo. Bad (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet with Gilly and fall in love. They have all the difficulties that you would expect from a tough pair of rednecks. Scenes from honkytonka - it's dancing, mechanical riding on the bulls and, of course, the necessary fights. He has a good 1980 soundtrack, including “Looking for love in all the wrong places”, “The Devil went to Georgia” and “Hello Texas” of my beloved Jimmy Buffett. Smash your cowboy boots and get boogie boots! <br /> <br /> *** (of 4)
