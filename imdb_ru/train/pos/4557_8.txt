I thought Hugh O'Conor was as striking as young Christie Brown, and really deserved more recognition for his role. I could not believe how well he played the role. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was great too. My favorite scene is where the boys play football, and Christie uses her head to stop the goals, and then punches the free kick! Amazing performances of two Christie (and others too).
