This film probably never showed up on the radar screen, but it turned out to be quite high-quality. This is pretty realistic, but you think: "This is just a movie." Duval and Close portray ordinary people, and you would never even understand that they are now famous actors. It seems that the moron in this story is too old to pursue the girl Eugene, but I think it is possible. It seems unlikely that the child himself would go from Montana to Nevada, but I think it is possible. You may think that family problems in this film will never happen in your own family, but I think it is possible. I remember Glenn Close saying something like: “You think that the work you do is the hardest part of your life, but it’s not.”
