Esther Williams gets her first role in MGM in the lead role and gets a good start <br /> <br />. This film is a well-played entertainment uncertainty <br /> <br /> with a mature theme that will be repeated a million times more in the future - an innocent girl chased a terrible hater. Esther <br /> <br /> looks great, and if she wanted, she could probably continue to make more and better films, but according to her autobiography, <br /> <br /> pretty much quit working on marriage. In any case, she is so attractive and attractive that it is nice to see her in a completely different role <br /> <br /> outside the “swimming musical”. Universal was incredible for <br /> <br /> making films with former MGM stars after the studio started <br /> <br /> to cast off its biggest names when it began to roll down the slope. Stars <br /> <br />, such as Lana Turner, June Ellison and others, were the first to make high-quality films <br /> <br />, evaluating them at Universal, since they obviously still had traction in <br /> <br /> ticket office. I would like Esther to do more, but since she did not, this makes him even more special.
