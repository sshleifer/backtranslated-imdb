One of my favorite home movies. I do not know if there is a person in our country who has not seen this film! It’s funny and sad at some moments ... I don’t know how people all over the world (who had the opportunity to watch it) accepted this film, because you should know some moments from our Serbian history and the character of the Serbs in the first half century to be able to understand it! But, as I see here, there is someone from Canada who watched it ... and he liked it. <br /> <br /> I think that I will try to place all the good quotes from the movie on this site, but first find out how to do it ... <br /> <br /> Hurray.
