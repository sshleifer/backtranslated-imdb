This film took Jerry Springerâ€™s approach to superhuman strength. Wilder Napalm is a type of thematic film that I like, and it explores the idea that geeks in America are determined either by their gifts or by trying to hide them. At the same time, the film notes that every child prodigy is only a man, and he should not be afraid or worshiped more than any other person. It was a great comedy, fun and humane with this light satirical point.
