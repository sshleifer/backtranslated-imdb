As if the film itself has no value, this is a great way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it. In the summer of 1968, I saw a film in New York; I read a book for the first time in graduate school that autumn. Some of the pleasure of reading the novel was my memory of a meticulously detailed film. And for better or for worse - and I now read and teach a novel for more than three decades - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
