I visited the Chesapeake camp. It was located at the beginning of the Chesapeake Bay in the northeast of the river in Maryland. It was a summer camp of this type with houses. It was established by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started out as a young tourist, and then I became a junior, senior adviser, and then director of the Waterfront. If the camp had continued, I would have done everything in my power to become the director of the camp. Alas, the YMCA forces decided to close the camp and sell it to the state MD. A few years later, I visited a former boat camp and was shocked at the disregard for the state of MD and natural destruction from mother nature. The 350-acre site has served many with all the benefits of dealing with nature's offerings. A black man named Curtis Ford and his family were residents and caretakers of property. Mr. Curtis was my friend and mentor. I worshiped him every creature. Despite the fact that he could not swim, he was a water guide. If I asked him where the fish bite, he will appoint a place, and I will have a ball. At the end of the summer there was also a family camp. These memories will be with me forever.
