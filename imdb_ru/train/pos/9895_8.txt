A group of popular schoolchildren plays a cruel joke with the all-knowing Marty (Simon Scaddamor's sympathetic speech), which leaves him ugly disfigured. Five years later, the gang returns to a destroyed and abandoned high school for reunification. Of course, an angry and vengeful Marty appears, dressed in a jester's suit, to brutally revenge his tormentors. Writers / directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale demonstrate all the strikingly commonplace clich√©s that make these 80s cuts and body pieces cause so much fun to play: fake frightened jumps, sneaking steadic shots, a violent storm, insanely cool soundtrack - Roku, pleasant melancholic female undress, completely ridiculous "what the hell?" supernatural climax, f / x gooey makeup, and one of those attractive slop "it was all just a terrible dream", made up without end. In addition, the carefully crafted details of the killing set deliver horrible goods: Gori has a stomach that explodes after drinking a poisoned beer, a woman taking an acid bath, a guy who was crushed under a huge tractor, and two people who were hit by an electric shock. in the middle of wild passionate sex. Thirty-year-old British cult horror siren Caroline Munro ridiculously wrong, being an American teenager in the first third of the film. All the actors give solid performances, with a particularly outstanding work of Carmina Yannakkone as the avid leader Skip Pollack, Billy Hartman as the faded macho Frank and Donna Yeager as the dirty whore Stella. Co-producer Dick Randall has a funny cameo as the grubby agent Munro Manny. The gloomy, rattling music of Harry Manfredini shamelessly repeats the remarks from his Friday 13th score. Smooth cinematography by Alan Pudney does his job. Good, cheesy fun.
