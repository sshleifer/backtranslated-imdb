Yes, this is another great Muppet magic film, and I adore them all; characters, movies, TV show episodes (this is the best comedy or music TV show) and all the artists. But here they made such a rare fatal mistake, and I, of course, am talking about a strange ending !! <br /> <br /> I think it’s very dangerous to involve so much in American drama and end love in marriage !! We, like all poor viewers, feel so free or maybe happy because of the absence of irritation, irritability and suffering! So we all enjoy these stories that put together two cute characters like a couple in love without legal connections, such as Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess, etc. You feel safe, calm and peace. So when you look at what the creators of this film have already made, you will be as mad as I am! <br /> <br /> They made a weak, pitiful creature (Kermit) marry his daily nightmare, the most annoying female in all of history (Miss Piggy)! This is a historic change by the American entertainment industry! And it was quite normal to have a negative impact on an audience that simply refused to bless or believe, or was satisfied with this sudden marriage (even the pitiful frog had neither the time nor the appropriate opportunity to think or solve anything!), Therefore it is not surprising when You will find out that this film is the most unfortunate in their cinematic respect, and only 25 million were earned on the first film (“The Muppets Film”, 1979) five years earlier !! <br /> <br /> Just in this film they took Manhattan and my rest too!
