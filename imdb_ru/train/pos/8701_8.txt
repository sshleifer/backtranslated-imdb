For anyone who expects a traditional superhero movie, this can be an unpleasant surprise. This is definitely more drama than action movie. He focuses mainly on emotions and is a bit like a Greek tragedy - no matter what the main character does, he always somehow goes wrong. <br /> <br /> Because Sasha, like every superhero, takes the law into his own hands, and society does not appreciate it. Sasha becomes a criminal. While on the run, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love, so things get even harder for him. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic, but the film lacks dynamics. It reminds me a little of the story in recent films by Rama Gopal Varma. Everything happens very slowly. However, when there is an action scene, it becomes so dynamic that, before you realize what is happening, it's all over. But the director does not want to surprise us with bright and spectacular actions. What is more important here is the result of Sashaâ€™s actions, which for the most part are very radical. The rating is very poor, which also makes it difficult to concentrate on the film. So basically you need to be very patient to watch it. <br /> <br /> Is the film worth it? This question is very difficult to answer. I do not think that this experience has enriched me so much, but for some reason I continue to think about this film and I want to watch it again. Mainly because of the atmosphere, which is really dense, but not suffocating, because Sasha and Katy have hope all the time. In the end, these are young people who need to live their whole lives. Therefore, no matter how hard it is, there is always a light joyful melody when they are together.
