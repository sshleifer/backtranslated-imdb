I usually find Loretta Young difficult to understand, too concerned about her appearance and too feminine in all respects. But in this lyric novel by Frank Borzazh, and even though she plays a crazy self-esteem that suffers too much abuse from her spouse Spencer Tracy, she is direct, honest and irresistible. It is a strange little film, played mostly in a hut in the same room in Gouverville, unusually frank about the Depression, but romantic and idealized. Tracy, who played the rude, impassable "ordinary guy" who would be a terrible chauvinist and hooligan by today's standards, softens the sharpness of his character and almost makes him attractive. There is good support work from Marjorie Rambo and Glenda Farrell (which never achieved what she should have), and Joe Sverling's script is modest and effective. But the real heroes are Borzaj, who always loved to dramatize true love in a lyrical close-up, and Young. You kind of want to slap her and tell her character to be able to, she’s too good for this guy, but she’s so clever and convincing that you’re content to see their story unfold to a satisfactory conclusion.
