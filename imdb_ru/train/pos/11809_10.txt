Dick Tracy was not the best for many comic book fans, because they wanted something with blood like Batman. Dick Tracy plays innocence, just being a comic with villains who have a serious upset appearance and are fun. Warren Beatty directs and plays a major role in the role of the protagonist who fights crime without even using super powers. I liked Dick Tracy since childhood, because in the comic atmosphere the main colors are red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is the perfect movie for anyone to watch with their children. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays the Big Caprice with a twist. Madonna, as the baby, who is the second villain in this film, does not play the toy that she represents. As I said, no blood, no curses, no sexual hints, or anything that might offend anyone.
