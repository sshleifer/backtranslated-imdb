One of the best comedy series ever to come out of Britain. Mark Gatiss, Rhys Shirmsmit and Steve Pemberton are amazing actors and performers who seem to be at home with drama like comedy. Cleverly supported by their writing partner Jeremy Dyson, they populated the series with the most memorable characters of recent years. Little Britain pales as an insignificant imitation of their ideas. Constantly original and innovative, I am sure that so many people hate these TV shows as they love them, but I am also sure that no one can have any opinion about LOG. I haven't watched the full-length movie yet, but I heard good and bad things, so I will reserve the right to judge. The original radio series from which LOG came out were as innovative as the TV shows. I donâ€™t know if there was a TV series before the USA, but I would have been delighted to see how the American audience found a strange English woman of humor
