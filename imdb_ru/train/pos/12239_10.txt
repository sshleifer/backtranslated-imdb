Great farce! Which, of course, is all he had to be. Fortunately, there is neither a social, nor a political message, nor the slightest attempt in this direction. Can the plot actually take place or occur at any particular time or place? It is unlikely, because in the end, it's just a film, and films are born out of imagination, not out of reality. The sole purpose of this film is to entertain, of course, not to teach, and to entertain it, with reality, delightfully and carelessly thrown to the wind. I think most would agree that we expect enlightenment and authenticity from documentaries. But for fun, I want what is nowadays described as an “easy task,” which in all respects is the game Mating. For a few laughs and frank laughs from time to time, this is a great toll fantasy.
