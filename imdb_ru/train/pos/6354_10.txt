Jim Carrey can do anything. I thought it would be some kind of silly kids movie, and it was NOT COMPLETELY. it was incredibly funny for ALL, adults and children. I saw it once, because it was almost not in the cinemas, and now it finally comes out on DVD this Tuesday, and, as you can see, I am very excited. You should definitely see this, if you haven't done it yet, it was so great! <br /> <br /> Liz
