I.Q., in my opinion, this is a cute, charming and cheerful romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was really a boring guy. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more suitable for Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James. In any case, all the participants in this film have done an absolutely outstanding job. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this sweet, charming, and funny romantic comedy about finding the right person for any Tim Robbins fan or Meg Ryan who hasn't seen him. A lot of laughter awaits you, so go to the video store, rent or buy it, relax with a friend and watch it.
