A wonderful story and music (George Gershwin!), Like the Levant, Guberial, Foch and, of course, Kelly. One thing is missing, and this thing is a good leading lady. Sorry Leslie Caron is bothering me. In any case, despite it, the plot goes well with the famous (and deservedly so) ballet. Oh, colors, dazzling red, blue, green and yellow. Do not forget about beiges. ; I just adore the contrast between the Ball of Fine Arts (completely black and white costumes) and a very brilliant ballet. <br /> <br /> I suppose I'm trying to say the following: Please, by all means, see this and enjoy it, because, although it’s not the best, it’s WONDERFUL. But don't forget that another Gene Kelly musical with a 20-year-old girl who catapulted to fame right after that.
