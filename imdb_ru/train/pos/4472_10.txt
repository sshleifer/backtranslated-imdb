From the very beginning, you see that “Anchors Aweigh” is a great comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a fun team! The songs they sing together are pure entertainment. Catherine Grayson is gorgeous and very sweet. Dean Stockwell is the cutest childish actor I've never seen. If you love the piano, you will be amazed by José Iturbi. This film was the first in which the animation was combined with real actors, and it was wonderful in an unforgettable dance performance. Undoubtedly, one of the most funny movies Kelly.
