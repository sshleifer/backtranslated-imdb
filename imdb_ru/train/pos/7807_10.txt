The performance of each actor and actress (in the film) is excellent NATURALLY, as it should be in the movies; and the director's skill is so brilliantly worked out in every detail that I do not get tired of seeing him again and again. However, I am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and the director, the merits of Attenborough, which puzzled me: are they really not proud of having made such an excellent, lengthy film for the audience? I hope to get some answers to my riddles from someone (perhaps from one of the "knowledgeable" employees (insiders) of the film.
