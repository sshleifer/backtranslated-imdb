I thought Baseketball was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! This witty humor made me giggle all the time, and the fact that Trey and Matt are so cool reinforces the comedy of the film. <br /> <br /> I just bought Baseketball on DVD, and this is just one of those movies where you never get tired of watching it. I have a very short attention span, and I think there are some funny moments in this movie that make me have fun everywhere. Humorous quotes are remembered and can make me laugh for hours if I remember them later. <br /> <br /> In general, I believe that Baseketball is a wonderful film that everyone should watch, especially if you are young, as it will keep you laughing for a long time afterwards. <br /> <br /> P.s. Does anyone find it odd that I love them both? hehe
