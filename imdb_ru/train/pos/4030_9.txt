This film was absolutely wonderful. The time and culture before the section was beautifully recreated. Urmila gave another brilliant presentation. What I really admire about this film is that it does not resort to Pakistani attacks, which are widespread in films like Gadar and LOC. With the section as background, the film is not distracted by political issues and does not focus on violence or on what is right and what is wrong. The film always tells about the tragic life story of Urmila. Her fragile relationship with Manoj Baipay was beautifully depicted. In fact, the film shows how people, both Hindus and Muslims, suffered from this section. The theme that there is only one religion is really common in this film.
