Or I love the suspension of any formal plot in this film. I have visited him many times, and he always justifies himself. Too stylized for some, but it seems to me that any lover of the opera will like it. Norman Javison, another Canadian, risks tremendous chances with his films and his casting, and it almost always pays off in films that are not in the center and are somehow amazing like this one. I often wondered about the lack of acting roles for Cher, if she chose to minimize this part of her life or if she doesn't get enough good roles to chew on. I found that she is a great actress who can go into the role, as in this particular, or to be loud, bold and brutal, as in "Mask". From time to time I found comedic strokes wide (a hairdresser called Cinderella), but this was the goal of both the author and the director. Nicholas Page plays a passionate opera tenor with all extravagant gestures, at some point requiring a knife to cut his throat. Brooklyn scenes are magical, this is Brooklyn in the moonlight, romantic and dramatic, like in opera. In general, a very pleasant film, which not everyone likes, I liked the finale, everyone gathered like a Greek choir, each part is subtly shaded and mixed with the rest, the camera moves down the corridor, leaving the players to speak. 8 out of 10.
