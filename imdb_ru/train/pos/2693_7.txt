Although the story is essentially ordinary, and the “unexpected” finale is just a cruel joke with the audience, you can see what attracted these good actors to the project - they offer them roles in which good actors can manifest themselves, and they shine. The film is immaculately made - for its time. It was remade in 2000 as “Under Suspicion,” and if you want to see only one version of the story (that's all it deserves, in fact), I recommend the latter, with modern Hopkins guidance and more explicit references to plot points, which the original could only hint at. The ending, however, is still blowing. (** 1/2)
