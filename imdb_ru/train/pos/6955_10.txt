My Super X-Girlfriend is a damn cool slide. The special effects were excellent, and the costumes that Uma Thurman wore were Hubb Buba. Uma Thurman is an underestimated comedian, but she proved that everyone is wrong and pinned her role as a crazy friend. She was simply INCREDIBLE !!! Luke Wilson was also good as an ordinary Joe, but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time. The cast was also excellent, especially Anna Faris, who was very good (much better than the Scary Movie franchise). <br /> <br /> Ivan Ritman did an excellent job with directing this film, because if it had not been for him and Uma Thurman this film would not have done so well. This film is clearly 10/10 for its actors (Uma Thurman), its director, script and original storyline. This film is highly recommended.
