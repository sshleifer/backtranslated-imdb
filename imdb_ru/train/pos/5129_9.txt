I understand why this film was nominated for an Oscar in the nomination for “The Best Short Video”, since it was designed masterfully. Even if you don’t particularly like the blues (although for me it sounds a lot more like jazz), you can easily appreciate this movie. It's just very well done, although in my whole life I don’t understand why director Gyon Mili made only one film - this one. In other words, the film is nominated, but the director has not received any career growth. As for black performers, I could understand that this does not force their careers to move to higher rates, because, unfortunately, the majority of white society is indifferent (or worse) to black or “such music”. <br /> <br /> If you really watch this film, if you don’t particularly enjoy the previous part, go to the mark of 5:50, where it increases significantly. When the lady stopped singing, and the performers began to improvise, the tempo improved a little.
