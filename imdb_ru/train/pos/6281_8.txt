I had the opportunity to watch several films on BluRay and HD DVD. This film remains a wonderful action and a great story. Although, if you are looking for a movie with a great picture, it is not. The absence of this movie on DVD helped to make the purchase easier. I always liked intense action and a great game, which are not always combined with each other. In general, this is what makes this movie excellent for viewing. Now on the blu ray scale. In many Blu Ray movies, you either get two things. An image that is almost crystal clear without distortion, or a high-definition, grainy picture. I was disappointed when I made this, my first movie Blu Ray. I almost started to think that it was the standard Blu-ray. Although after watching other films, I know better. I do not believe that they spent as much time as they had to transfer this movie to HD. This is generally a problem with some movies. And for the price of Blu Ray players and Blue Ray discs, you should have only the best picture. Therefore, I believe that this is a profitable investment for people who have never watched a movie or have not bought a DVD version.
