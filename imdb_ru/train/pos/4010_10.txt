In my opinion, it remains one of the best images of Superman on television, as well as one of the most faithful comics in a certain period. <br /> <br /> This series paid tribute to both the Superman films of the 70s / 80s and the 1986 series of superman reload comics and beyond (“Man of Steel”, “Superman, Volume 2”, "Comics on the actions", "The Adventures of Superman", etc.). The initial rating and titles were shocking, based on the score of John Williams from the movies, updated for the Saturday morning action movie. Marv Wolfman, one of the main participants of the comic book reboot (author of Superman Adventures), was the perfect choice to participate in this cartoon series. In general, the series looked more mature, but at the same time remained very friendly to children. <br /> <br /> Superman was presented as a believable, powerful and symbolic His returning sworn enemy was Lex Luthor in his embodiment of megalomania / CEO. The characters of the Daily Planet Lois, Jimmy and Perry were portrayed well. One of my favorite shows was from Wonder Woman, and the story revolved around her home island of Temissira (“Paradise Island”). Both her design and her mother Hippolyta’s design were in keeping with the similarly reloaded comic strip series “Wonder Woman” of that era, and it seemed that an equally well-made animated series could have been developed for her if it were treated the same way. <Br /> <br /> Hard to believe that it was not released on DVD / Blu-ray! It deserves to be.
