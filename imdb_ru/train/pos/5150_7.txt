Although Ian Kershaw distanced himself from this project due to inaccuracies regarding Hitler’s life, yes, it’s dramatized, but important. Robert Carlisle plays Hitler in his later years, during this documentary film, which deals only with Hitler from childhood, until he became German chancellor, including The Night of the Long Knives. This television film (also a two-part mini-series) shows how a number of factors allowed Hitler to come to power, for example, the financial disaster of 1930. <br /> <br /> The series is dedicated to Hitler and nothing else but the lives of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl. All in all, valuable and filled with interesting actors, yet I feel that it should have been more rigidly directed with a stronger cinema; most of the actors are depicted in half-body frames, which (for me) makes a theatrical position, not a cinematic one. The pace is sometimes sleepy, and the film suffers from it, its duration is about 2.5 hours.
