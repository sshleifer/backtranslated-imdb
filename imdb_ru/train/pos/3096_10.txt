Six degrees hooked me. I was looking forward to when this would happen, and was completely disappointed when “People in the Trees” replaced this time. I thought it was just a break and will be back in early 2007. What happened? All my friends were very surprised that it was over. We could relate to characters who had real problems. We talked about each episode and had our favorite characters. There was no one in the series who I didn’t like, and I felt that the game was great. I always liked to see programs taped in cities where you can identify local areas. For example, I would like to protest the cancellation of this show and ask you to return it and give it one more chance. Give him a good time frame, do not continue to transfer it from that day to that day and advertise so that people know that it is on.
