I may well be one of the few who really stuck to this film. I also saw this movie when it came out, and I agree with the last post that Up The Acedemy was well ahead of its time. Humor in the film itself is pure MAD magazine. I do not understand why MAD supports this feature. It was also one of the few films of the early 80s, in which the soundtrack was accompanied by a killer punk and new wave groups that appeared in LA at that time. I have a soundtrack, and I play it constantly to this day. What can I say? There are definitely the worst films. I don’t find Porky as funny as Up The Academy, there’s really good laughter throughout the whole movie, and the jokes fall either on stereotypes or on stage. Hey, no one said it would be the Maltese Falcon.
