This is definitely my favorite movie of all time. This is mainly because he is not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as flogging and female submission) that other mainstream films are too timid to touch. Nothing seems to be prohibited in this film, as the director freely develops the plot, not caring about possible insult to the viewer. However, I do not think that something was done here solely for the sake of shock or for deliberately insulting someone. Sean Young turns into a great and bold performance. Most famous actresses would not assume this role or ask for some significant changes to the script before accepting it. Other actors also do an excellent job. <br /> <br /> Did you notice that this film did not appear on cable television after a mandatory short run a year after it appeared in movie theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it simply does not match the current political atmosphere. It seems rather ridiculous to me that some premium channels now carry erotic porn (which is getting closer and closer to hardcore porn), but will not carry the main film, like “Love of Crimes”. Unfortunately, although this film is only 11 years old, it probably could not have been made today. <br /> <br />
