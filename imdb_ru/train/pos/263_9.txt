It was a strong Poirot / Suchet, a mysterious television choice. The characters were bright and well acting. The plot and the main setting - the student hostel - were excellent. Jupp was not special, but for me he did not distract from the story. One important point, many Poirot observers do not recognize a good game or a good characteristic. I also think that they are rather harsh in their judgments about some of the secrets of Poirot. Finally, I read Christie’s several novels - not one in recent years - and I find it annoying that so many viewers are upset by the changes in the novel. Please, the audience, think about what is presented to you on the tape, and not what you think should be there. However, Poirot's secrets vary in quality, but not as much as you could believe to reviewers and evaluators. With the exception of “Five Little Pigs”, which were incredible in plot, character and theme, Poirot’s longer films are not so good or bad. For the record, I have seen all the longer Poirot / Suchet films. Finally, movies without Lemon, Hastings and / or Japp are neither good nor bad due to their absence. There presence, however, is either intrusive (almost always with Japp), or not related to Hastings. Lemon in the middle.
