Has al pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for a high-class movie This is as good a presentation as he ever gave. Pacino - American Olivier. And this is a political thriller, as good as they get. No good guys and bad guys. But the system has an inexorable impact on people who think they are working. Not only that, the performance of Pacino is convincing - the praise at the funeral of a dead child is incredibly powerful - the film has swift, tough realism that enhances the beautiful performances without resorting to tricks. This outstanding portrait of the politics of the big city is also able to provide two hours of great watching movies without excessive violence, overheated sex or profanity. There is a murder. There are bad people. But they collide effectively without crossing the line. Such a film restores my tormented faith in Hollywood. I do not award many dozens. This richly deserves it!
