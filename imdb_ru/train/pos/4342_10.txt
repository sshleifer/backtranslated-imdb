This film did not surprise me, so that it became better and better. I thought, “Paul Riser wrote this, huh? Well ... let's see how he does it ... ”Then I saw that Peter Falk was in it. I appreciate Colombo. Although I have never been a big fan of the show, I always liked to watch Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> Peter and Paul’s speeches were so natural that I felt like a fly on the wall. They played each other so well that I felt a little dizzy with pleasure! ... and I didn't even drink! <br /> <br /> This film was so well made that I wanted to directly call Paul and tell him how I liked it! but I could not find his number. It must be not on the list or something like that. <br /> <br /> It was one of those films that I had no idea what was going on, who was in it or something else. It just came, and I thought, “Oh, why not? Let's get a look. If I don’t like it, I don’t need to look at it ... ”... and in the end I just loved it!
