Well, there are a lot of reviews, what can I add? <br /> <br /> I'll try anyway. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is my favorite Scrooge, because of ALL. Sets, open areas, costumes are so beautiful and authentic. The music is sweet. The supporting cast is very well made. One of my favorites is the storyteller and nephew played by Roger Rees. His understated sincerity is touching, and his voice sounds like Christmas to me. David Warner is also an absolutely believable Bob Crunches. His difficult life, but he remains positive and worthy. <br /> <br /> The best part of the course is George S. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some consider his image too rough. I could not disagree more. His exchanges at the beginning, while cold or abrupt, did not fail. He is a terribly disappointed man, whose heart is hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own thirst for wealth. <br /> <br /> During the memories, it is obvious that he is not so rude. Here we see that there is hope for him. If he had been completely gone, his partner Marley would never have come for him. And in the end, we have not lost hope of anyone. I think this is a HUGE part of what Dickens was trying to say. When Scrooge watches his dance at his employer with Bell, you see how he smiles with regret when he tells Bell in the memory that he will go through life "with a smile on my face." Clive Donner was smart enough as a director to allow these moments to shoot. Sometimes they are left on the editorial floor. <br /> <br /> Finally, his appeal is so full of joy that it makes me cry from tears of joy EVERY time I see it. His apologies to Fred's nephew, such sincere, so touching, is the spirit of not only Christmas, but also of humanity itself. The joy he brings to Fred, his wife, is so obvious. And the line that gets me every time is, "God, forgive me for the time I spent." <br /> <br /> Bravi, tutti!
