Definitely one of the smaller Aster / Rogers musicals. It's just very poorly prepared and built. For example, it only lasts a few minutes longer than Swing Time, but it feels much longer. This is partly due to the secondary romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is rarely interesting. I like Hilliard. She's cute, and I love at least one of her songs, "But where are you?" (“Get Satan behind me,” her other number is the weak remnant of Top Hat, luckily carved from this masterpiece). “Follow the fleet” would actually be a bad film if it were not for the three brilliant dance sequences between Astair and Rogers. Dance competition fights for first place in any of their numbers. The dance is fantastic. “I put all my eggs in one basket” represents two dance rehearsals that they haven’t finished yet. Its flaws make it even more perfect. And “Let's Face the Music and Dance” is one of the best songs of Irving Berlin. So the film is worth seeing for its wonderful moments.
