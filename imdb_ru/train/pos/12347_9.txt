This is a wonderful film about a brothel in a fishing village that can best be described using the constellation of the scene and the direction of the works of the old Kurosawa in combination with the themes of human psychology of Dostoevsky (O-Sin - Sonya Marmeladova), Shakespeare's drama and Hans Christian Andersen tragedy and cheerfulness. The scenario is striking, the scenes are bright, and some beautiful ones remain in my memory. The plot is interesting and unpredictable - each of the characters is very well developed and interesting - there is also a small action here, so if you don’t like all the senses, you will also come to your expenses -. This is not about the mysterious geisha and proud samurai with their bushido, pouring everything on them, but about life, work and people who can be found everywhere at any time. Kurosawa’s beautiful and exciting tribute is definitely worth a look.
