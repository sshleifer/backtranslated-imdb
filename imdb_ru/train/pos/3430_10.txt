I caught it in a show at the Sundance Film Festival and was delighted with the absolute power this film has. This study of the psychological impact on our brave soldiers who join the armed forces in the hope that they will protect our country and serve it with honor, as well as take care of it from our government. The film describes in detail the psychological changes taking place in the training camp, when the soldiers turn into "murderers for their country" and enter the war and the consequences after they return home. It also shows the effect that killing has on the human psyche. He pays tribute to the soldiers and never criticizes the soldiers, unlike other films, instead criticizes a system that is not ready and does not care about all the physical and psychological needs of the returned veterinarians. <br /> <br /> This film is powerful, moving, emotional and thought-provoking. This is a call to arms to support our troops, not only buying stickers and going to parades, but actually listening to them, and helping to support the change in how they care about their health and well-being after the killing. <br /> <br /> Best Festival Film **** / ****
