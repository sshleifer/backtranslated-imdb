The latest film in Lucas's saga is a splendid, spectacular production. He is often considered an ugly duckling in the original trilogy, but I think that this is a step above episode IV (and just a mark below episodes III and V). In fact, I think this is the third best film in the 6-part saga. As I understand it, this is still a hugely entertaining movie. This is not a movie with a start, climax, and ending; The mechanism of the film works with only one purpose: to bring the idea into the universe of Lucas. In general, an atmosphere of completeness is attached to this, which makes the film a little too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. In addition, it is very fun. New characters are presented, and old characters face new, unexpected problems. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as usual) a great comic relief. Leia and Solo are a wonderful romantic duet, and Luke is still a great character to identify. Again, it is Luke’s (and Vader’s) internal conflict that gives the saga a foundation. Lucas's aggressive imagination is still very obvious, and the themes of the film of loyalty, hope and redemption resonate strongly. I'm glad that Lucas finally abandoned the idea of ​​creating episodes VII, VIII and IX, because this film is a great gift for a long, exciting and exciting saga. Not a perfect movie, but fun in the best morning style.
