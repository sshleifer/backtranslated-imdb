Besides the fact that my list of favorite filmmakers is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Almighty 3) the rest ... this film is actually better than the book (and the television mini-series, although this is an easy feat given the director). Impeccable style of filming, acting skills and (Kubrick's skill all the time number one) music - make it a masterpiece of horror. I watched a mini-series on TV a few years ago, and I liked this story, and I had hopes for it when I got it. THIS HAVE KEEPED ME !!! This is much better than I could have imagined. It begins slowly (Kubrick trademark) and has a lot of downtime, which creates uncertainty. The opening scene is a classic in all respects, and I watched it about 20 times just because of the shift atmosphere that it creates for the entire film. In addition, the film does not offer a lot of blood (it has enough, and it is by no means tasteless) a trend that I hate in recent horror films of the day. Just look!
