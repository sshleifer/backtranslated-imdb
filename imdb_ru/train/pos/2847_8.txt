As you know, anthological films do not look very good in the American audience (I think they prefer one standard storyline). New York "I love you" is the second stage of a series of anthological films devoted to cities and people who live and love in them. The first was “Paris, J'Taime”, which I really liked. The film consisted of several parts, each of which was written and / or filmed by the director (most of which were French, but there is a very funny part, shot by Joel and Ethan Cohen). Like “Paris,” this one is also an anthology, directed by several different directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shaher Kapur, etc.), as well as “Paris deals with New Yorkers”, and why they like the city in which they live. It features top-class actors in which people such as Natalie Portman, Shea LaBouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hoki, as well as experienced veterans such as James Caan, Cloris Leechman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie participate. Some of the stories really fly, while others do not (although I believe it will depend on individual tastes — I won’t spoil it for anyone else, revealing which ones worked for me and which ones did not). They say that the next entry in the series will be Shanghai, China (is there no question of Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece?). They speak mostly English, but it has Yiddish and Russian with English subtitles. Rated 'R'by MPAA for strong language and sexual content
