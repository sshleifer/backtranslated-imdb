This is the best Emma in my opinion. Having seen another version (1996), which is also good, and after reading the book, I can say with confidence that this is a true interpretation and the most faithful Jane Austen masterpiece. The 1996 film with J. Paltrow is also good, it’s just like a different story. It is very light and fluffy, you don’t see the darker edges of the characters, and if you just want to get a nice movie, everything will be fine, but the subtleties of some plot points, such as Churchill / Fairfax confusion, are as follows. much is hidden to be practically non-existent. But if you want the characters to look a bit more realistic and multifaceted, the 1996 TV version is superb. Emma is a wonderful person, but she is imperfect. Kate Beckinsale masterfully displays the character's little quirks. You see that her gaze casually casts aversion on some simpler talk about Harriet Smith, but she shows no remorse for spoiling Harriet's offer until this action destroys her own family happiness at the end. You see her narcissism, and it reflects Frank Churchill’s view that they will harm others in order to achieve their own goals. For Emma, ​​this was a matchmaker and had a new friend to pass the time after losing her governess to marriage. For Frank Churchill, he delivers the promise of a woman he loves by treating her and others disgustingly to keep a secret. In the book, she understands all of this in a crushing awakening to all the mistakes she made. Both Kate Beckinsale and Ginet Paltrow are convincing in their repentance, but Paltrow is more childish and stagnant, while Beckinsale’s awakening is quite real and serious, and you see the transition from childish, selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult. Both versions are very good, but I prefer this one.
