At first this film seems so bad that I almost fell into a trance when I first saw it. It was like a bad dream. Space bore. But I gave him a second chance, then more and more, and so on ... I was finally addicted to this film, because of its fabulous slow pace, wonderful natural scenery, flooded with soft autumn light and especially the musical score, which made from progressive rock of the 70s and absolutely refined folk songs of actor / singer / songwriter Derek Lamb (Troubadour). You should notice a song about hazelnut, silver trout and a lady disappearing into the air ... heard in the middle and at the end of the film. In the beginning there are several carnal scenes that let us appreciate the natural charm of Elizabeth Suzuki. If this film were filmed by such repertoire directors as Bergman, Lars Von Tries or Jean-Luc Goddard, critics would roll on the floor, raving about this film as if it were a space masterpiece. I personally think that this film is a million times greater than any Cinematic Fellini sh # @ t! Definitely not for the pretentious.
