First, this is really my favorite movie. I do not need to give anyone a description, because every ** hole makes it. I am literally obsessed with this almost bloodless, trashy, settling effect, having a “staccato show,” a poorly edited masterpiece of horror metal from the 80s. The director (I heard) was hoping to get into the cashier so that he could make the prequels and make a deal like FREDDY / JASON for himself. Damn, I wish it was the end of it! Soundtrack knocks. The acting is good ... CHECK THIS MOFOF and any die-hard fans out there, feel free to write and communicate sometime. Midgetorgy .... I can be found in YAHOO.
