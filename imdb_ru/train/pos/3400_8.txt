Dominus Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) spent most of her life caring for her father. Now that he is dead, she is free â€” but she does not know what she wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) - a monk who left the monastery to try more life. They meet by chance in Algeria, fall in love and get married. But he cannot leave his past behind, and she cannot live without him ... <br /> <br /> WAY overdid it in a novel full of hysterically bad dialogue and situations. Dietrich and Boyer do their best to achieve good results, but NO ONE can get away with some of their lines! However, in a sense, it is a classic. It was shot in the gorgeous Technicolor (try it on DVD), where every shot is stunningly beautiful. Dietrich is always dressed in 9 (even in the middle of the desert) and takes hysterical poses to show clothes and his body. Bowyer just walks around, looking startled (without shock). However, I have never been bored. It was wonderful to look at it, and the non-stop, stupid dialogue kept me at the seams. The end almost made me fall from my chair, because I was laughing so hard! Now I love banal novels and give them a lot of space, but really - this is incredible! It also lasts very little 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> As a classic for the camp, I put 8. As a serious film - 1.
