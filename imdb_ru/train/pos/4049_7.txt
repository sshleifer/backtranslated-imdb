Erich Rohmer's "L'Anglaise et le duc" is the perfect complement to Peter Watkins's play "La Commune (Paris 1871)". Both films shown this year at the Toronto International Film Festival ironically illustrate how the narrators tell the story. Ironically, given the tragic events that occurred in the United States during the festival. <br /> <br /> Filmed in Paris during the French Revolution, a film based on Memoirs by Grace Elliott (Lucy Russell), is a first-hand account of how she lived through those rash but dangerous days. She also talks about her relationship with the Duke of Orleans (played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus), who, unlike her, is a supporter of the revolution. <br /> <br /> True form, you do not know on whose side of the story will Romer go? One of the first French directors of New Wave, Romer was often criticized for being too conservative. In the end, at the height of the youthful uprising in the late 60s and 70s, he shot romantic little sweets, such as Clare's Knee. But don't sell this little boy, guys, he was always a student of human nature, not an ideologue, and L'Anglaise et le duc goes on to confirm this. <br /> <br /> Rohmer’s characters are never “bad guys” or “good guys,” they are primarily people who can demonstrate the full range of human capabilities and limitations. That is why his films are always provocative, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> Now about technological nuts and bolts. <br /> <br /> Romer, although he makes his way into his 80s, is still at the forefront of cinematic innovation. L'Anglaise "is something you have never seen before. As you may have guessed, the old man - like several festival directors this year - has become digital. <br /> <br /> All the external scenes of the film look like they are take place in their original Parisian environment of the 1780s. In fact, you may be so distracted from the surprise of the authenticity of the film’s appearance, you must return to the second viewing in order to catch the subtleties of the psychological film - yes, I will say this - political views . <br /> <br /> This year in Toronto some of them are participating s brightest young directors, as well as some of the oldest in the world. And the old masters are there for advanced cinemas, close to the young. Long live the young people. Long live the old age. And long live Erich Rohmer. <br /> <br />
