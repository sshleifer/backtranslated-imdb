This film speaks a universal language; You can associate it with yourself, society, society or the wider world. He has a way to not only open a few questions, but also to ask one in finding and asking the right questions in order to reach the point of self-conviction / ownership. The image of stereotypes in the film appeals to the archetypes around us, which should be recognized as a recurring cycle of destruction, the opposing force of innovation, creativity and growth. Factors that disrupt the natural flow of things should be obvious and eliminated. The idea is, of course, a film that needs to be experienced, and not just a look, as it penetrates the inner voice / conscience through the gaze, it makes a person feel not just looking.
