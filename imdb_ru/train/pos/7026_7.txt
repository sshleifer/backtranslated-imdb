When I was 17 years old, my high school put on a Bye Bye Birdie - which is not surprising, since it is an ideal material for high school, and it is considered the most staged musical in the world. <br /> <br /> I was a student of music and retained strong memories of the play and his songs, as well as the long-term disregard for the version of the film by Dick Van Dyck, which (deliberately) eclipsed the mention of Elvis and pushed him to a fluctuating 60s audience. <br /> <br /> So, when the 1995 version with Jason Alexander in the lead role got on the screen of my cable television, I was delighted with what I saw. Alexander turns into an exceptional performance in the role of Albert, which contrasts strongly with his more famous person from a certain television series. The rest of the cast is entertaining and convincing in their roles (Chinna Phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look at her role, a supposedly naive and innocent schoolgirl). <br /> <br /> But best of all, the musical, all the numbers familiar from the stage show, are stored in this film and performed the way the musical stage compositions should sound (taking into account the absence of the stage). <br /> <br /> So, if you know the musical (and few are not), then check out this telemovie. This scene shows justice in a way that probably cannot be improved, which is good enough for me. What could be better than rendering a literary work truthfully, with color and style?
