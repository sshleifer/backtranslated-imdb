I happened to see "Feverish pitch"; He played on a plane flying to Europe. In fact, it was not half bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the world's largest Red Sox fan, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) can sharpen this. The film is quite an interesting look at how world events can affect people's attitudes. Particularly striking is the fact that the Red Sox ended their losing streak by more than 80 years. I think that such things happen all the time, and we just donâ€™t tend to notice them. Not so bad. <br /> <br /> Another film with an unusual attitude to baseball is the 2000 Frequency. Check them out both.
