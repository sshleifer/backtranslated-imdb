Stars of Men of Honor - Cuba Gooding Jr. in the role of a naval diver Carl Brashir, who challenged the navy, becoming the first African American naval diver. Sometimes, next to him, and sometimes his opponent, there was one person whom Karl Brashear really admired. His name was Master Chef Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro). Sunday pushed, aggravated and helped Karl to become what he wanted to be. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this film. His image here is as liberating and as powerful as Denzel Washington in The Hurricane. In each scene we see his passion, motivation and perseverance in achieving his dream. We see a struggle in him when he tries to be proud of his father. I also liked how the director created and caused a lot of stress in some key dive scenes. Meeting Brashear with a submarine during a rescue mission is stunning and brilliant. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I could see was a lie in a prop. The characters of Cuba and DeNiro are very tangled and exciting. What makes you a little sad when they have to deal with such two-dimensional characters. The wicked lieutenant commander Hanks, the Sunday wife (Charlize Theron), the eccentric colonel of the diving school (Hal Holbrook) and the love interest of Cuba are characters that I discovered are not very deep. What could make these characters more substantial and more effective is a little more time for their development. Why was that colonel always in his tower? Why was the Sunday wife so bitter and always drunk? <br /> <br /> Another interesting question. What happened to the wedding of Karl Brashir? I mean, if this film chronicles this man’s life, wouldn’t his wedding be an important event? Maybe it's just me. Honest people, however, are an excellent example of triumph and faith that encompasses the human spirit. This film will inspire and make you feel the struggle of this person. I believe that is why this powerful story was told. My hat is taken with you, Karl Brashear. I really admire your strength. <br /> <br />
