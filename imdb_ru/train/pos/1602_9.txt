I bought the video quite late during the collection and probably would have saved a lot of money if I had bought it before. It invariably replaces anything else on those nights "Luna Cosmo." Cher and Olympia certainly deserve their awards, but this is really an impeccable ensemble of superb script. What kind? You do not know what "cosmo moon"?
