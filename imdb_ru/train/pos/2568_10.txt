In this continuation of the 1989 classic comedy thriller, K-9 Detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to fight crime, but this time they teamed up with another detective [Christina Tucci] and her partner, an evil Doberman named Zuez, who doesnâ€™t get along well with Jerry Lee. Dooley didn't get along well with her new partner either. This all changes as the film progresses. The film is intense because this is the guy who really wants to kill Dooley for the way he treated him in the past. There are some dramatic scenes related to the death of Dooley's wife, which do not really correspond to the tone of the film, because the rest of the film is action films, jokes about dog poop, farting jokes and jokes about dogs biting the bad guys. in a specific area. I know it sounds like very low humor, but some of them are actually very funny. I have not seen this movie for jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is that I am a big fan of James Belushi, and the second is in the sequence of actions. James Belushi is funnier than he was in K-9, and the sequence of actions is also better. It would be nice to see more K-9 characters to come back, but this is still a funny movie. If you are a fan of James Belushi, you will love this movie.
