The “Lion King” series is a major achievement in Disney animation. The original Lion King - the greatest masterpiece in the animation of people. Lion King II: Simba's Pride is BY FAR, the best sequel to the video that Disney or any other studio has done for the animation function. It deserved a theatrical release. The same can be said about the film. It has the original cast, Elton John songs, a funny story, exciting action and touching moments of character. Everything you expect from this series. Not so much a new story, but a filler and an extensive background about Timon and Pumba, and their place in this story. Most of all I was struck by the concern for animation. Disney often has to talk about the quality of the animation of his videos and television works. But here they smoothly mix the new animation with frames from the original film. Scenes never seem inappropriate. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing, like Timon and Pumba. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillaume, and Moira Kelly again perform their roles of Simba, Rafiki, and Nala, respectively. As hyenas, we even meet with Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin. In this movie, a LOT of laughter. So if you love Lion King, you need this movie. The story is simply not complete without it.
