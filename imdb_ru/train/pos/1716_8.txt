Abhay Deol meets attractive Soha Ali Khan and greets her "Hello Sister" !!!. This sets the tone for the wonderful debut film, Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle-class girl, ran away from her home in Nainital and came to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shian does not appear, leaving Sohu heartbroken and lonely in a big bad world. Abhay, a neighbor from a lower class, protects vulnerable Sokha and helps her find a job and shelter in a nursing home. Romance slowly flourishes, and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan re-enters the life of Soha. <br /> <br /> A sensitively made film with a very unusual story, shot with love in Delhi, revolves around the tender Sokh. Does this well-made film have moments that will forever remain imprinted in your memory? the first awkward kiss and quick apologies of Abhay; Abhay, describing Sokha as “class of wali ladka” and hastily added that “he does not love her”; He presented Khuridar Soha and invited her on a date. <br /> <br /> The music is good, and the background music is great. In the scene where Soha rushes and hugs Abhay, the sound track disappears. Silence conveys awkwardness and tenderness of relationships. <br /> <br /> Sharp finale creates a bitter sweet film, memories of which will last for a long time. <br /> <br /> Must see, I will rate this 8.5 / 10
