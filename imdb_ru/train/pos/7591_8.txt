A mess of genres, but this is mainly based on blending Stephen Chow's genre for his inspiration. There is a magic Kung Fu, student romance, sports, gangster action films and some kind of sad melodrama. The production is excellent and the pace is fast, so it is easy to overcome many of the shortcomings of this film. <br /> <br /> Child is thrown near the basketball court. A homeless person leads him to the Shaolin monastery, which is located in the center of the city, along with a special Kung Fu guide, which the homeless person somehow has but cannot read. An old monk teaches a boy, but expires when he tries to master a special technique in the manual. The school is captured by the fake kung-fu master, who is assisted by four stupid monks. The new master is angry at the 20-year-old boy for not pretending that he was wounded by the master's weak blows, and throws him out for the night. The boy is thrown into the trash from an incredible distance by the man who leads him to the gangster club to play darts. This leads to a big fight, the expulsion of the boy from the monastery and the decision of this man to turn the boy into a basketball sensation in college. <br /> <br /> All this happens in the first 20 minutes, and most of this happens in the first 10 minutes. In addition to the extreme storytelling, the first problem is how little we recognize the main character before the movie itself. The man who uses the boy is more clearly defined by the end of the first third. The plot does not follow the new ground, except for the climax of the insane action of the film. I am sure that you can easily imagine how stupid monks will appear near the end. The effects, photography and stunts are all top notch and compensate for the boring plot. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow has a lot of plot and comedy, and this film will live in its shadow, but this is not a good reason to ignore. him. This is quite interesting, even with the final Scatter-Shot. Featured.
