This film is a sterling example of the state of erotic B-movies: bad porn movies without hard sex. The plot in this is not as bad as these things go; it involves a female lawyer trying to prove that her lover is innocent of killing his wife. The rest of the film, however, leaves much to be desired. Bad behavior, bad leadership, bad looking woman, bad scenery, bad cinematography, bad sound and bad sex scenes. The filmmakers must understand the difference between obscene and erotic. They don't even have the common sense of having Gabriella Hall naked or in a love scene. <br /> <br /> How stupid is that?
