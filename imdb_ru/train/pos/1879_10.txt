I was too young to remember when I first saw this movie. But I saw it as the second time around 7 years ago. My sister told me that I had to see it. Now my whole family remembered it. We quote this at least once a day. I am madly in love with this film. I'm still laughing after all this time. Of course, this is a really very drunk millionaire who is irresponsible. The thing is, he still lost humanity in other people we see in the film. And that he is ready to give up all this for the sake of love. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh. Much laughter. That's decent, cute, and if you're a movie buff, this will really change your idea of ​​Funny. Look at this with a group of your friends or your family, and I promise that you will never again have anything to say with some lines of Avtur in your head. It will make you laugh for many years. <br /> <br /> In my family it is very difficult to find a film that everyone likes. But this film, I feel, made us closer. And I know that it will do the same for you!
