Overall, I was pretty impressed with the pilot. The first fifteen minutes were alarming, as the creators felt that they were trying to create a science fiction version of OC, but this fear is eliminated when a terrorist act occurs, and from here the show steps into topics and situations that I very rarely see. television stories. <br /> <br /> BSG dealt with topics such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death, and terrorism, but they were mostly a subtext for viewers to think about or ignore if they so desired. Here, on the other hand, these topics are the focus of the show, and I personally found that I use such works as Ghost in Armor and The Matrix as landmarks, watching and wondering how well the topics were discussed. I think that if you are a fan of the two I just mentioned or other films / television shows that relate to the items to which I referred, I think you will find something at least here. <br /> <br /> In terms of starting point for explaining how the situation arose, known to us in BSG. It seems to me that they coped with this very interestingly, I especially liked how they explained where the faith of the Cylons in the one God came from and the creation of Caprica was fairly advanced and modern. Technologies that emerged in the future, but not entirely alien to the audience. <br /> <br /> The only real weaknesses I noticed were the relationship between Greystone’s parents and the actress who plays Lacy Rand. Although I like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson separately, their scenes seem to lack chemistry, at the moment everything can be reduced to the development of their characters, but I think it needs to be worked out. I also found that Magda Apanovich is unconvincing in her role. Again, this may be related to the experience and time required for development, but throughout the entire episode, its actions seemed forced and not quite sure. <br /> <br /> Proceeding from the pilot's experience, I look forward to when the "Caprica" ​​will appear in the future and, I hope, it will touch the greatness that BSG once did.
