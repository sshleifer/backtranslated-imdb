* Possible spoilers * Although it was done earlier (and better) in the Midnight Express and Return to Paradise, the Brookdown Palace still resonates in me. <br /> <br /> Here we talk about two young girls who travel around Thailand and be arrested on drug trafficking charges. Was it Alice Claire Danes? Was it Darlene Kate Beckinsale? Was this the beautiful stranger they met on their journey? None of this really matters, because it is a story about friendship and trust and the boundaries on which they can be stretched. Add Bill Pullman as an enthusiastic lawyer, and Jacqueline Kim as his Thai bride (and better attorney than he), and we have a cute little story that captures the attention of the audience. <br /> <br /> Brokedown Palace is nothing out of the ordinary, or notorious for any reason - it’s not an original concept, it doesn’t show sensational violence that leads to a crowd of avant-garde imitators talking about its “hard realism” or "hard shock truths" is just a good story with some great performances. Bill Pullman is the weakest because of his lazy talk and rudeness in conversation - I was rather bored with this character. <br /> <br /> Kate Beckinsale, though decent, is nothing special. She behaves well, but this is not a completely memorable presentation. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Kim, however, is in great shape, creating a pleasant and definite character, with whom, in fact, there is nothing special to work with. <Br /> <br /> But make no mistake - this is the Claire Danes movie. I have long been a fan of her work, and this will not change. She is fascinated in every scene where she appears, and if not for her, the film would probably have turned into a boring fare. I especially welcome her performance in the scene between her and Father Darlene. <br /> <br /> The film also has a great soundtrack. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
