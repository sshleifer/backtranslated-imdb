It's just the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. Bad game, bad script, bad scenery, bad suits, bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you start to shudder with laughter. <br /> <br /> So, winning an Oscar won't work, but if you have a beer and friends, then you can't go wrong.
