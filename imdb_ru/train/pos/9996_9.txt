I have not read the other comments on the film, but judging by the average rating, I see that they are unlikely to be very additional. <br /> <br /> I watched it a second time with my children. They absolutely loved it. True, adults did not roll on the floor, but from the pleasure of children it looked like this. <br /> <br /> This is a real farce of Mel Brooks with a lot of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money, not for who we are, and how unstable our friends and colleagues are. There are many other films on a similar theme, no doubt many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults. However, it is difficult for me to imagine such an impact on younger family members. <br /> <br /> Therefore, for children - 9/10 from me.
