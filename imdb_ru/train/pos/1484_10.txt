CASOMAI was the last film I saw before marriage just last year. <br /> <br /> This was also the first film I was looking for after I got married, because we promised to offer a copy to our priest. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the reality is not like that except fiction. To all those who wrote that such priests as “Don Camillo” do not exist in real life, I would recommend them to visit my priest Pe. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> To everyone else, I would recommend them to watch this movie before and after “I'm doing it!” Portugal
