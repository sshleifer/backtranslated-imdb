I'm a fan of animal films. If you can take the plot and put animals as the main characters, you usually conquer me. Homeward Bound did exactly that. They took the plot, which was as old as time, and added a new turn to it. It was a complete success. This is a very archetypical film. You have the experience of a wise and logical group (shadow), you have an attractive, but swift and incredulous chance, and a princess who believes she needs to be pampered and praised. These three personalities rebound very well from each other. I also like the way they made Chance and Sassy such dynamic characters, and they were not late with it. Most people say that it can not be good, because it is too much for a children's film. However, they forget that this should be a film for children, and it still does not take away from a real film. This is a good movie to watch when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie. This is a Disney movie without cartoons, air bud with the best story. I would no doubt advise you to watch it.
