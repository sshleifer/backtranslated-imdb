This interesting Djallo reinforces a typical, but still fascinating plot and a truly sadistic murderer, who obviously likes to hunt down his victims before killing them in horrible ways. <br /> <br /> Directed by Emilio P. Miraglia, who also made a very interesting “La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba” a year ago (see also my commentary on this subject), the film begins a little slowly, but overall, no time is wasted with unnecessary auxiliary plots or sequences. /> <br /> This film is a German-Italian co-production, but it was released in Germany on video only in a version shortened by a 15-minute plot under the silly title “House of Horrors”. At the very least, the murder scenes that will satisfy every greyhound are completely preserved, and the viewer still receives the killer motive at the end. But the Italian version, which contains all the frames, is still, of course, the one to be searched for. <br /> <br /> Persuasive Jallo with mandatory turns and red herrings, “La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte”, is highly recommended by Jallo. fans and slightly superior to the other thriller Miraglia.
