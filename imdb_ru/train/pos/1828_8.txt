The film, based on the Robert Louis Stevenson film Saint Ives, talks about the dashing young French hussar captain (Jean-Marc Barr) during the Napoleonic Wars. Captured in battle, he is sent to a prisoner of war camp in the Scottish Highlands, led by Major Farquhar (Richard Grant). Soon he falls in love with a local girl (Anna Friel), makes friendship with a major, and discovers that his long-lost grandfather, who fled from France during the revolution, lives just in the future! Lively performances of all the actors and some memorable lines make this sentence above average.
