Zodiac Killer (2005) was an interesting film by German director Ulli Lommel. He directs, acts in film and acts in this last statement. He not only shoots an interesting film on the cheap. But he reaches a new low when Herr Lommel shoots footage from almost his entire movie catalog. I have seen clips from the films of Boogiman I and II: “Birds of War”, “Tenderness of the Wolf”, “Brain Waves” and “Cowboys with Cocaine” (even Andy Warhol is filmed in a cameo because of the serious courtesy of this film). Despite the fact that he uses a lot of old videos, he handles them well (and, perhaps, will add very creatively). <br /> <br /> This film is about a young man who copies the original Zodiac Killer. he also corresponds with the writer (Ulli Lommel), who originally wrote about a serial killer in the late sixties and early seventies. A friend of the writer (David Hess) helps him find this zodiac imitator. Can this killer be stopped? Can a writer add two and two and reclaim his old glory? Is David Hess still a man? You will have to find out for yourself and see the killer of the zodiac. <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT about the original killer of the zodiac. I also heard people whining that this movie was being filmed. So what. The artistic style of the school principal eclipses the fact that he was filmed. My only complaint was the excessive use of video from Herr Lommel's earlier films (but I understand why “wink”, “wink”.) This is a sandy and horrible street-level horror film. Like the disclaimer in the initial states, this film does not praise murder. You should like this statement. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Ulli Lommel fans.
