Nice idea ... the saleswoman Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherited the tiny little county of Lampidorra. This country, which was not even in North America, became the 49th state ... (of course, at that time there were only 48 states, since it was done in 1952 ...) Linda travels around the country that she has there is an inherited one, and we follow it, while it tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even stranger people. At some point, she sings a song that, she claims, from her people, Navajo, and from there she becomes even more stupid ... although the heavy lipstick and ubiquitous smile of Yolande Donlan is never annoyed or offended. There are other songs scattered everywhere, as citizens sing to greet their new princess. Filmed in the magnificent British version of technicolor or in some similar equivalent, about the only known name here - Dirke Bogard as British subject Tony Craig, a seller of cheese. Bogarde made a big splash in the British film industry after serving in the war, and was even knighted by QE II. Craig and the "new princess" continue to face each other, and their adventures are becoming increasingly intertwined as Lampidorra's financial problems escalate ... Funny little farce ... in the spirit of the film "Marx Brothers." Also note that Donlan later married Val Guest, the writer and director of our little project, and remained married for 50 years! The guest was better known for writing and directing his science fiction films in both the UK and the USA.
