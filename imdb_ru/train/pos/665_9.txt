"And all through the house" - this is a special episode of the crypt, not only because it was from the first season, but this episode was the first one I saw! I remember a young man who was on vacation with my parents, that summer of 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on the HBO channel I saw this episode and was buried in the Crypt right then and forever! I've always been a horror movie fan and I liked monster movies, and with this HBO-launched series, I felt terrible pleasure again. This episode, which I saw for the first time, was remembered to me and one of my favorites, just by a pleasant and pleasant turn. "And All Through the House" has a nice cozy atmosphere on a snowy Christmas Eve, which is an ideal way to relax while relaxing! Well, in any case, Mary Ellen Treinor (who, incidentally, plays in several of Warner Brother's works, usually in small batches) as the greedy flirting wife who takes care of her hubby, waiting for money and a new romance. Only, as in most horror TV shows, things are about the worst, and bad people get what they deserve. Chances increase significantly when a maniac in Santa costume escapes from a local awesome house, preparing for a late holiday hack on Christmas Eve! As in the old comic book lessons, you will learn that bad people get what they want! Well, this tale ends with a beautiful holiday scream! Also this story was in a 1972 film featuring Joan Collins, this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic episodes of the crypt of all time!
