I remember when this film was an Oscar and did not win in any category. As for my life, I can't remember what it was with, but I can say one thing: it was one of the best films I've ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg made a film did not convince me of anything. <br /> <br /> In essence, we are talking about the experiences and misfortunes of a dark-skinned woman when she turns from a girl into a woman. There are many insinuations that disturb and terrify, but they are all needed to see how much this woman has resigned. Along the way, we see other women who had to put up with their difficulties and go with them to redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives her the best performance in this film. Danny Glover should also have been at least nominated for a role in this film. <br /> <br /> And the best part of this film is that he treats his subjects humanely, and not to some kind of show-show, as in the recent “Lover” I urge all people of any race to watch this movie. 9/10
