The American in Paris is a wonderful musical about an American artist living in Paris for inspiration. He meets a rich woman who admires his paintings on the street, and she believes that she can make his work even more popular with the public, for example. in the museum. Ginri Mulligan, nominated for a Golden Globe by Gene Kelly, is simply amazing in singing and especially in dancing. He also meets the main girl, Lisa Bouvier (Leslie Caron), who is engaged to her best friend. He cannot help his feelings for this girl, even after he finds out who she is engaged to. This is a very good musical film, filled with pleasant romance, beautiful song and dance. This may drag on a bit with his dance dream sequence, i.e. With the ballet “Americans in Paris”, but they have a good happy ending. He received an Oscar for best artistic decoration, best cinematography, best costume design, best music, sounding a musical picture, best composition, plot and script and best picture, and was nominated for Best Director Vincent Minnelli and Best Editing, he was nominated for a BAFTA award for best film from any source, and received a Golden Globe for best musical / comedy film, and was also nominated for the best director Vincent Millenny (Lisa's father). Gene Kelly was number 66 in the movie “100 Movie Stars,” and he was number 15 in the movie “100 years, 100 stars are men”, “I Got Rhythm” was number 32 in the movie “100 years, 100 songs”, the movie was number 9 in the movie "100 years of musicals."
