I was about 7 years old when I first saw this film. Then it was not special, but a few years later I saw it again, and then it was a lot of fun :) <br /> <br /> I think that the best parts of the film are: Yeti body language and also “special effects”. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this film, do not wait for a blockbuster made in Hollywood, even this film was shot with approx. 1000 dollars :) <br /> <br /> I have a copy of it. Movie and video version (but I don’t think it was ever shown in cinemas) <br /> <br /> Watch it, enjoy it !!! Yeti forever !!!
