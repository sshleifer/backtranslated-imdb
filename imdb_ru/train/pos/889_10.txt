This is one of the best Hong Kong (action) films with a tense and exciting storyline, as well as great fighting scenes. In this film, Sammo has it all: romance, drama, excitement and a great hero. This is the only film about martial arts, which interested me with the plot, and not just with the expectation of fights. Sammo's fans are a must-see (see also Eastern Condors, Shanghai Express) (Yuen Biao is an ace!), Dragons Forever and Enter Fat Dragon
