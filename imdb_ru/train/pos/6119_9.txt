Good, but just dumb. Not bad for a horror movie / comedy. I read how people switched it with Michael's version, and this, in my opinion, is a good trick, because some adults hate horror, and when they see this film, it will interest them in horror films like this one or maybe (never I have not seen) Horror (perhaps comedy) Uncle Sam, I have to look at the rental or purchase of this film, but the second is better than this, but I bought this one on Amazon VHS and received it on November 21, the day before Thanksgiving. It costs four dollars, l.o. on this movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
