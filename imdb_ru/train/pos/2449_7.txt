when I saw the ad for this, I thought: “THERE IS NO THING NOBODY ON THREE MADE!” because he occupied the slots “Fresh Prince”. well i still love the fresh prince. but George Lopez is an amazingly good show. I love, if not stereotypical Benny. Carmen is a pretty good character, very funny to see how stupid and overly emotional she can be. I feel bad for the guy who plays Max, he looks much younger than he really is! but Max is a funny character, and acted well. and yes, Angie is a bit stereotypical, but she has her funny moments. ha ha george really has a big head! No, but he can also be a very good fun show! This should definitely be more common than home improvement.
