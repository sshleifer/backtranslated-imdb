Very few so-called "remakes" can be as good as the originals. This one crosses this border with flying flowers. Just a remake, I don't think so! I saw it theatrically at the age of nine, and was completely fascinated and delighted with the film. <br /> <br /> The film certainly offers a comparison with his 1963 colleague. An earlier film is also a pleasant and interesting film, but admittedly it tends to be more like a nature documentary than a film. This update is more epic and cinematic. However, I highly recommend both films. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely a must-see for an animal lover. We have a wise old golden retriever, Shadow; sharp, sarcastic Himalayan cat, cheeky; and a young, cheerful American bulldog, Chance. The animals are brilliantly voiced by Don Amech, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox respectively. <br /> <br /> There is nothing offensive about the film. Here is a bit of scatological humor, but nothing extreme. No violent violence, with the exception of a few tense scenes involving a falling waterfall, an angry porcupine and a dark railroad bed. <br /> <br /> Cheerful, scary, touching and, above all, real, I was surprised that this film did not receive a single award, or one. However, I must say that this is as good as some of the nominees for the best picture at the moment.
