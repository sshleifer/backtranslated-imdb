First of all, it was not a three-hour film - two hours, ten minutes ... the last time I checked commercials, they really are not part of the movie! Perhaps, however, it should have been two participants in a total of about 3 hours? Yes, I would get more, I could explore more emotions. Overall, although it was an interesting look at the life of Lucy and Desi. I look, I love Lucy from time to time and I love it, but I never read or see a biography, I never knew anything about their lives behind the scenes. Because of this movie, I'm filming now, but I'm not sure that this is good. Everything here nobody should have known. In fact, it was a film that did not need to be shot. But this was done, and the reason is that Lucy and Desi are still such huge stars, and some people in American society feel that the rest of the society should know EVERYTHING about our viewers and movie stars. This is definitely so untrue and very, very sad. <br /> <br /> In any case, what was shown here in Lucy was pretty good. Two complaints - the actress who played Viv Vance is not a very good casting. And the transition from Madeleine Zima to Rachel York .... uh, as if Lucy had undergone plastic surgery, and suddenly she is a completely new person !? It was not too great. But the story continued and focused on the precarious relationship between Lucy and Desi. No, the children were not shown very much, and this was not necessarily the disadvantage of this film, because, as I said, it was mainly focused only on Lucy and Desi. If there was more time, if the story was more about the whole life of Lucy, then perhaps the children would be more there. But they were not so that we could see such as Gable and Lombard, Red Skelton and Buster Keaton. Wow, that was one thing in this story that, in my opinion, was really cool: his presence and influence in Lucy's life. Really neat and it is too bad that it was not investigated anymore. Well. What has been researched has been done for the most part well. Honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever see it again, and I don’t think this film will be so memorable. For those who dig "I love Lucy", but not a big fan of Lucille Ball, this should be an interesting watch. My rating for this is: B
