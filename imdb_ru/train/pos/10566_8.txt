I have never watched this movie or enjoyed singing and dancing Cagney and other actors, namely Dick Powell (Scott Blair), who had an excellent tenor, and Ruby Keeler (Bea Thorn). James Cagney plays the role of Chester Kent, who writes musicals and eventually starts producing Prologues, which are shown between feature films shown in cinemas in the 1930s. Chester has problems with people trying to steal his ideas for his show. This is a very interesting film with a lot of comedies and lots of laughter. Joan Blondell (Nan Prescott) played a great secondary role, which was also very young and beautiful. Dick Powell was a great singer and dancer and was just starting his long and successful career on the screen. Enjoy.
