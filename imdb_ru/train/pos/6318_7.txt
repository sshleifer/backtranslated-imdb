I tried to shoot it in many cases, but I was always with a friend who, as a rule, usually rejects the robberies and comedies of the ensemble with the comment “Hmm ... looks good, but I'm not in the mood for this film." in the “Evening of a solo film about the omnipotent!” I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and usually watch movies We’re trying to ignore this fact, and in any case I look at them essentially. George Clooney sets a humorous and short cameo as a safe burglar on wheels, who, for the most part, makes me think about two things ... 1. Will not Every comedy is better if Mr. Clooney makes a strange 5-minute cameo? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easy is it to wash them off? The actors, all the wonderful actors themselves, did an excellent job with their work, and you got the impression that they had a good time working together, which is quite important in a movie like this one. Needless to say, everything is not going as planned in this film, both in a plot and in a humorous way, but it made me check the features and consider the possibility of viewing the original, so I think this is a success! Rent it for a good time, perhaps take some friends and a pizza. You will have a good time. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the soundtrack is impressive. It's nice to hear that Paolo Conte underestimated, and this left me with a buzzing excerpt from the score long after the captions ran out.
