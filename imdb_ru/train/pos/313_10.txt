I am a black American and I loved this soap opera. I watched it on Telemundo in Spanish almost 5-7 years ago. The story was the TRUE story of a black slave, whose love affair with the white commander led to her leadership and frank, bizarre lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Many of us could learn a lot from XICA. She took what she had, nothing, and saw her possibilities. Many claim that she sold herself, but she tried to secure her future and the future of her children. <br /> <br /> It was such a great soap opera that I thought it would be released on DVD, but it was not released. This soap opera was the best soap opera EVER. We need it to be released on DVD or re-broadcast on television. He is playing on Azteca America right now, which is available only in Mexico or in the USA on a pay cable. We need to be released again to Telemundo.
