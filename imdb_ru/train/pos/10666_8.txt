When I really became interested in films, at the age of eleven I had a large list of films that I needed to watch, and I went to Blockbuster and made two or three on weekends; some of them were not for all viewers, and my mother went crazy. I remember that one of the movies on this list was “A Chorus Line” and could never get it; so now to see that this dream has come true. <br /> <br /> Of course, I lost the list, and I will do everything to get it back, because I think there are really interesting things out there that are worth seeing. I mean, take “A Chorus Line,” theatrical production turned into a film. I know that this is what we see nowadays, but then it was a little different; and there is something special about this movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the musicals shot at the cinema today use the chance that the camera gives them for free to create different scenes and move the characters to different places; The Choir Line was born on the stage in the form of a play and dies in the same place as the movie. After a great audition, conducted by recognized choreographer Zach (Michael Douglas), Richard Attenborough directs a large number of dancers who are trying to get a job. <br /> <br /> Everything happens on the same day: tension of ignorance, stress of having to learn numbers, quiet competition between dancers? And all this happens on stage, where Douglas puts every dancer in the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal lives and their most terrible experiences. There are hundreds of dancers, and they are all fantastic, but their list is shrinking over time. <br /> <br /> Like a film that I recently saw, “Home Companion on the Prairie,” a radio broadcast, here Attenborough deals with the problem of continuity. On the stage or outside, everything happens, and time does not seem to stop. Again, I do not, if Atenborough cut a lot to shoot it, but it definitely does not look like it; and in any case, this is a great directorial and editing work (John Bloom). But at this small stage, you wonder what to do with the camera? With just one setting, Ronnie Taylor's cinema finds a way, making close-ups of certain characters, zooming in and out, showing the scene from a different perspective and also gives us a beautiful view of New York. <br /> <br /> At one critical moment, Douglas says to the rest: “Before we begin to eliminate: you are all amazing, and I would like to hire you all, but I can't.” It made me think about reality TV today where the only thing that matters is singing or dancing talent, and where the jury always says the exact words to the participants before some of them leave (even when they are not good). It’s difficult, you have to imagine; at least here where all of them are really awesome. <br /> <br /> To tell some stories, heroes and they take songs, and in one second the scene takes a new life, and it is literally a “dream” to come true. ”Marvin Hamlish’s music and Edward Kleban’s lyrics make the film’s transition to a film without flaws, showing the feelings of these dancers and allowing them to do these wonderful choreographies of Michael Bennett. The book in the theater also becomes an impeccable and very short script by Arnold Schulman, which is very touching at times. So, if it is not with a song, it will be with the word; but in "A Chorus Line" it is impossible not to be moved. <br /> <br /> During one of the rehearsal breaks during the auditions for Cassie, a special dancer performed by Alison Reed takes the stage to convince Douglas that she can do it. The words “let me dance for you” never sounded more honest and beautiful in music and lyrics.
