Back in school years in Salina Kansas, they filmed something called “Brave Young Men from Weinberg,” and the crews were quite noticeable for several weeks. in the end, we found out that the film was “Up The Academy”, and was a bit umm, “lower eyebrows” than we used to believe. <br /> <br /> I had to see it, since I was there, and the local audience looked less than pleased with the show. I was 17 years old, and I thought that it was a rather unsophisticated attempt at a comedy in the style of "Animal House", even jokingly. <br /> <br /> Since then, I have watched it many times, and my opinion has softened a bit. it's silly, but sometimes it catches the magazine’s “insane” humor, at least as much as most of the “Mad TV”. Ron Liebman may hate it, but he is almost perfect and unforgettable. For me, my favorite moment would be a short scene on Santa Fe Avenue, where I parked my car while I was buying guitar strings. It is a pity that the short appearance of my Pinto, as a rule, seems to be curtailed for television. I have not seen the new DVD, but if my old pinto is visible, they have a sale.
