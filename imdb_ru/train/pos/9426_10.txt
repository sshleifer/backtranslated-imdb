This is one of the funniest episodes! I laughed until my sides split and rolled on the floor. If only someone would have released in America. Region 0 or 1 is not PAL, please. <br /> <br /> I know that it will be released in the UK, but other than that it is Region 2 and PAL! Let's give this series a fair push. America should know this series. Moffat is a genius. I liked Tracy Bennettâ€™s bizarre, stupid role in this. Of course, I liked Fiona Gillis! But Tracy was a treasure! <br /> <br /> Run this show in America! or show it again at PBS stations. I need to laugh and laugh again! Please treat us please! You are welcome! <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
