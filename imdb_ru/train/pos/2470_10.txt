After the initial shock of knowing that Mr. Brana was shooting this, I was literally shaking with the excitement that this epic was right in front of me. I was not disappointed. So true for Shakespeare and yet so accessible. It blew my mind. I always enjoy watching or, rather, listening to Bran, and it makes me think ... is this film dubbed in other countries? It would be like drawing a mustache on Mona Lisa.
