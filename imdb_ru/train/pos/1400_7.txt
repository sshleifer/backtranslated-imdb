Bogmeister and others pretty much nailed it. “Shore Leave” is really the first attempt at TOS in a light science fiction genre (which they would have later refined in the classic “Trouble with Tribbles”). This gave both the Enterprise team and its viewers the necessary respite from the consequences that threaten the universe, for example, the Corbomit maneuver. <br /> <br /> In search of a place to relax, the Enterprise takes place on a seemingly idyllic planet of class M, and sends the research team down to take a closer look. Soon all sorts of absurdities begin to occur - some seemingly dangerous - but all this seems like a morass of human emotional extremes, played in a strange mixture of fantastic mystery (McCoy went through the mirror), a psychological thriller (pursued by Kirk) and a tireless bully from his past) and a romantic comedy (No comments). <br /> <br /> TOS was the least serialized of all the TV shows in the Trek franchise, so it's easy to forget how many episodes in the first season were focused on the cruel, potentially disastrous drama. Unlike the later authors of the franchise series, the TOS production team was not afraid to literally go where previously there were no TV shows. And Coastal Vacation, despite its occasional problems, is an example. My only criticism of this episode is that the actors (especially Shatner - ironically, given his legendary sense of humor) did not seem to know how to cope with this new wrinkle on ST themes. The last scene is probably one of the worst scenes that I can recall for the entire TOS run, both in composition and in action. <br /> <br /> - said Nuff. My recommendation is to see it while watching the entire first season, as it should have been, order it.
