I can honestly say that I never expected this film to be good. I do not like family films. I am not a fan of Shahid Kapoor. The last film of the director (MPKDH was a complete nonsense. And the music was very boring and soft. But there was Amrita Rao, who became my favorite after Main Hoon Na. There were also Sima Biswas, Alok Nat and Anupam Kher who are very Talented. So, several advantages . <br /> <br /> I finally watched the movie, and I was very impressed. It brings us young lovers in IPC with a little HAHK wedding, and we have a winner. The outline of the story is similar to HAHK, frivolous at the beginning and serious mode at the end. The director also created a character to which you could relate Stay. At HAHK, I didn't like the fact that the characters were too eccentric, his perfection. Shahid Kapur surprised me with a good game. This is a serious improvement, and most importantly, it fits the role. Best of all, it is easy for Amrita Rao. This is her best game. Her presence on the screen is so electrified, you will love her performance. Samir Soni, Amruta Prakash, An Upam Kher, Alok Nath and Sima Biswas are terribly abandoned. No actor feels out of place. <br /> <br /> The songs were pretty disappointing, but after watching they will sound better. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are good ballads. Milan Abhi Aad Adhura Khai also looks good. The songs are not colorful and not dancing, but more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein, which will surely remind you of HSSH and HAHK. So what was the drawback of the film? The film is getting quite slow, and the ending is quite stretched. But the film is still going at a good pace, making it the perfect family movie.
