I have not read the novel or anything else from Kurt Vonnegut, but now I am going to start. It captures you from the very first frame and does not let go until the end credits begin to work. Taking you places that you do not expect, the plot is interesting in all. The step goes exactly, nothing lasts too long, and it makes the perfect balance between unexpected turns and allows the viewer to process what we saw. This is well said and well thought out. I never watched a movie that I feel could especially compare it. It is intense and entertaining, as well as funny and sad. The game is excellent, Nolte is absolutely brilliant, Goodman again proves that he does not need to laugh, and Li and Arkin are fascinating. I could go on, in fact ... no role belongs to the less stellar rendition. Editing and cinematography are amazing, and all the visual effects are great, with a couple of unforgettable and amazing. I will go to other films directed by Keith Gordon, as well as to two others, obviously related to this, through the author of the books. There is one scene of sexuality, and there is a lot of alarming and disturbing content in it. I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it; it's not nice 8/10
