The only reason I put this film on 8 out of 10 is that, in my opinion, there are few films that would be perfect. This little B-picture is a tight, well-told story. Alexander Knox has always intrigued me, but I saw him very few films. Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster. He betrays everything and everyone without an ounce of remorse. The performance is one of the most frightening performances I've ever seen. After World War II, the actors who played the Nazis or other evil characters in the films were sometimes nominated for an Oscar. I believe that since it was done during the war, the Academy felt that reading such a performance would be like honoring evil. But Knox shows such performance - a man so bitter and absorbed in guilt that he does not think about making others suffer. I still can not accept this. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt, who usually plays feigned chatter or a social butterfly, is imposed on the type, probably the best I've ever seen in her performance. Maybe not a worthy Oscar, but the best in her career. Nothing against her; I enjoyed her in those "minor" roles that she often played. But here she proves that she is coping with a heavier drama. <br /> <br /> If you like human dramatic stories or stories about the fate of those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis, I highly recommend this beautiful little movie.
