I love this film. Images of noir in combination with the senseless character Spillane, Mike Hammer, work great to create a mood and feel rare in low-budget detective films of the early fifties. Perhaps this is not “The Maltese Falcon”, but this film makes a significant contribution to the genre. Spillane is often criticized for alleged misogyny, and so on. D. But his “ladies” are far superior to their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence. Poor old Mike Hammer, who was effectively played by Biff Elliott, is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist he meets while investigating the death of an army friend. When the penny finally falls, a picture appears on his face. It's nice to see that the censorship of the 50s did not make the filmmakers lower the famous last line. Fair low budget classic.
