Since I am always looking for something new and unique, I watched this movie online. I thought it would just be another movie with a “B” rating, but I was amazed at how the two main characters played. All the actors in this film were very capable and well managed. The plot was wonderful and unique, with an excellent moral to the plot. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely not for those who are looking for a sex prank "Dumb and Dumber" or blood and courage. This is an amazingly sharp film that demonstrates some of the dark realities of life, combined with the kindness of the human heart and enough frivolity to keep it interesting. <br /> <br /> I would prefer this film to many films with an “A” rating. I even saw a large number of high-ticket box-office. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
