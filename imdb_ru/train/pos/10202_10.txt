I personally liked this film and am alarmed that some people gave it a rating. This is a movie based on comics, and it is animated, now, if you don’t like comics or animation, then of course you don’t like this movie, so why did you watch and bother to appreciate that it is taller than me. Although, if you are a fan of interesting, strong characters and heroic (sexual) women who beat each other and save the world (hell), you will like this movie. I thought the story really pulled me, and it was a very cool movie. Completely anime style or more like some American films, following this new trend of adult animation. Like Titan A.E. Meet, this is the version of "Punisher" live. In the end, I highly recommend this movie to a comic lover and a superhero fan or to anyone with a fairly open mind who is looking for a funny movie.
