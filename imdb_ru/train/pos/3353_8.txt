This film makes a strong commentary on the Italian people of the time. Using mirrors to improve the revelations of the characters is wonderful, and I can't help but mention the beauty and splendor of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I love them both. Their way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you can ask if the camera is really there. The husband in his short role is also perfectly depicted as a fascist Italian, who commands his wife and children, but in his own way is a loving father. The opening scenes with Hitler on Piazza Venezia with all Italians are incredible and really set the film historically. I liked the film, and I also agree that it’s funny, it’s not so famous.
