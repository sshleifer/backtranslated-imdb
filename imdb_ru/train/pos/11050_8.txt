Well, magic works in mysterious ways. This film about 4 prisoners trying to escape with the help of spells, written by other prisoners many centuries ago, was an excellent occult thriller with an amazing ending and a lot of suspense. Even if there was something like a theatrical play in him (almost everything happens in the chamber), he was never bored and everything was very good. In the Cuba tradition, you felt trapped with the characters, and even if they were criminals, you developed some sympathy for some of them just to change your mind because of the twists and turns of the story. Some events took you by surprise, and there was always a sense of madness in the air. Overall, intense and interesting, and since I didnâ€™t expect anything (a friend rented it), it was a positive surprise!
