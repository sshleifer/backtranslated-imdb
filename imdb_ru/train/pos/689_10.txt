Maybe I identify myself with this film because I live in New York and suffer from bad insomnia, but whatever it is, I have to praise the director for the excellent work. do what she did without a budget ... wow, that's all I can say. really very good. As if the money was not spent on this film, and it still struck me. I definitely suggest checking it out if you can. excellent direction, fantastic score and, of course, the script that will hit you in the ass. see it.
