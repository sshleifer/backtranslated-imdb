Many people encounter this film in that they seem to think that the story should have been more interesting (ignoring based on real events) or ranting against a film that glorifies Che (which in reality is not). This film is very close to the final biography of John Anderson about Che and correctly tells the story. Soderburg copes with the mood setting for the defeat, which was Che’s Bolivian adventure. You really have the impression of complete timidity and bewilderment of the Balkan peasant about Che’s revolutionary ideas or the difficulties that his people faced with famine and terrain. Sorry to have focused on movie fans, but it was. So do not enter this film, expecting Rambo to shoot them, this is a true story!
