If you need action and adventure in the film, then you should look elsewhere. On the other hand, if it's a lazy day, and you want a good movie to blend in with this mood, see Straight Story. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays incredibly, like the gentle and gentleman Alvin Straight, in this real story of Alvin's journey on a mower through three states to see his alienated stroke stroke. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth is ideally suited for this role, as he travels a long and winding road, making friends of strangers and handing out a lot of grandparent's advice about the family along the way. The story moves as slowly as the mower, but somehow manages to get the viewer to watch, waiting for the next life lesson that Alvin offers. <br /> <br /> Stretch out on the couch, relax and enjoy. This is the only way to watch this very good movie, which is rated 7/10 in my book.
