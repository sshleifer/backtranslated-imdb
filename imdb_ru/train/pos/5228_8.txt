I found this movie funny. Counterfeits in other popular films of that time were among the funniest ones I saw in this film. Try it. If you watched the films that faked this movie, and you have a sense of humor, you will love the movie. <br /> <br /> I (and others who watched the movie with me) felt the most ridiculous role in the movie (this is not a spoiler, because I DON'T tell you what is really going on) there was a scene with a â€œflashy thing "from MIB. When they first discover the device and do not know what it is doing ... and then again in the film ... you will understand when you get there. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the film is that I never managed to find it on DVD so that I could buy a copy.
