I think this is probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. The Robert Harling script is almost perfect, just look at the “quotes” section; after thinking, just rent a DVD, since it is the delivery that makes the strings sing. <br /> <br /> Sally Field gives a comic, stunning performance that you have never seen anywhere else. and Kevin Klein effortlessly cheerful. Robert Downey Jr., as a rule, brilliant, and in a very small role, Katie Najimi - rebellion as a besieged client. I've never been a big fan of Elizabeth Shu, but she's great here, like one * real * person surrounded by a bunch of cartoon characters on the set of "The Sun Also Sits" - that rumbles you feel below you, Hemingway rolls in his grave. Either that or he laughs very much. <br /> <br /> Five stars. Funny, funny, funny.
