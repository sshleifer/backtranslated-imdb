Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a longtime online fan-made movie created solely for the love of the show and a must-have for Trek fans. The quality of film production for fans is extremely high, although sometimes it can be said that they screen it. This does not detract from the overall experience. The CGI ships are fantastic, as well as the scenes of a space battle ... On the negative side, I could say in earlier episodes (and sometimes even newer ones) that some of the actors / actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles, but again this does not detract from the overall experience of the new interpretations of Star Trek. The cast and crew really came up with something special here, and, in general, I highly recommend this series to The Next Generation and Deep Space 9 fans.
