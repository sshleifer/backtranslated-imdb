The ability to dream is a wonderful thing. There is a saying: “Not all dreamers reach, but all those who achieve it dream.” By exploring our imagination, we shape our own future. Or build empires. Perhaps overcome our fears, limitations and obstacles. Get the wisdom and benefit of humanity. Or (to put it simply) just find the path to true love and happiness. Freud could express such things in symbols. Fantasy language. <br /> <br /> Tristan comes from a pretty English village called Wall. He goes through a gap in the wall. Portal. In search of something that will prove his love for Victoria (Sienna Miller). Victoria does not take him very seriously.

The “good guy” they meet on their way is captain Shakespeare (Robert de Niro). He has a fierce pirate appearance, but under him is a sweet queen. The heirs of Stormhold, meanwhile, are entering into a fierce battle for the inheritance of the Kingdom. Ricky Gervais is an optional addition. Trader-jester throws well into standard jokes like Gervais. The purity of Tristan’s spirit awakens love for Ivane, so a little cute triangle begins.
