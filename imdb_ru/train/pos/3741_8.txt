War drama that takes place in Louisiana in 1971. She accompanies a handful of recruits through basic training, and then Thigerland - an accurate depiction of Vietnam on American soil before they are sent. It tells about two people - Buza (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... how they meet, become friends and communicate with the squadron leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and the border psycho (Shea Wingham). br /> <br /> An amazingly non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher. He uses a hand-held camera throughout most of the film and uses digital video for battle scenes. It works very well - the film looks sandy (as it should be) and unpleasantly realistic. <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully covers his Irish accent and takes on a rather convincing southern accent. His performance is great - he is an extremely talented young man. Davis, unfortunately, is not so good. He is tall, muscular, very handsome - and very soft. The rest of the cast, however, is just gorgeous. <br /> <br /> This film was thrown out by his studio. There were no stars, no family history, and he was considered "just another movie about the war." In Boston, played only a week! It is worth it to watch a video or DVD. <br /> <br /> Farrell and Davis have a long, naked scene.
