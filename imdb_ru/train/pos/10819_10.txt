Of course, this film does not look like. 16 blocks, inside a man, an American ghost. etc ... <br /> <br /> But it was a great mystery that can happen to each of us .. I thought this film was really wonderful and scary. <br /> <br /> I live exactly where they shot this film "San Pedro, California". And we heard true stories based on the episodes of this film. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know if you heard about the famous Queen Mary boat at Long Beach. I often come to believe in spirits, illusions and parallels, or how you say it. really. all are in their own universe. <br /> <br /> and the mind is a powerful thing. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie. it's great and very good to direct. <br /> <br /> for those who rate it as 1. they do not understand the film. its meaning. his plot, his appearance. and how bad ocean life can be for each of us. <br /> <br /> Ty. <br /> <br /> Victor
