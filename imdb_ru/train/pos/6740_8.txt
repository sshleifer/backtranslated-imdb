The completely rounded nature of the main role of this film, the role of the policeman, torn by his past and on the path of self-destruction, so clear to the viewer, is unique to his time in 1950. <br /> <br /> Along with obsessive music and a well-written plot, the film is a prime example of a film noir at its best. Close-ups of Dana's eyes show the suffering inside, Karl Malden stands out as his boss, who does not tolerate stupid things, but also has compassion for those who are under his command on the site. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger made this movie for himself. If there is any mistake, it would be with the breathtaking beauty of Gene Tierney, which seems oddly inappropriate with a seasoned cop. However, their scenes in the cafe are beautiful and ring true. <br /> <br /> Tom Talley, in a small part of his father, is perfect, as is Gary Merrill as a hood. Great lighting and mood. The building where the deadly acts are committed is very atmospheric, I love the old woman in the basement. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
