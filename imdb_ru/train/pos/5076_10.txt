Almost 5 years have passed since the release of this stylish action movie. I watched this movie almost 10 times, and this is a great effort Gautama. From my point of view, I consider this film almost flawless. Surya in the role of the ACP Anbuchelvan is without a doubt ... awesome. Jotika played her role very well Maya. She really liked the character. The character that caught the audienceâ€™s attention was Pandia. Jivan played the role of Pandia very well. The brutal and fearsome Jivan deservedly received the Best Villain award at ITFA 2004. The supporting cast of Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others showed himself well. <br /> <br /> The retail scenario, perfectly balanced dialogues and the brilliant narration of Gautam. The Harris Jayarad soundtrack is all brigands, while BGM is very well suited for a movie. Cinema RD Rajasekara is rich. Peter Hein well put tricks. Editing Anthony is accurate. First of all, Kaaha Kaaha is an ideal police film, filled with correct doses of action and romance. <br /> <br /> Even some Hollywood films cannot compete with Kaaha Kaaha ... undoubtedly.
