Was the script more suitable for a 30-minute sitcom? Yes, but they still make it work! I thought the actors did a fantastic job with the free script, especially with Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most people on the blackboard seem to really hate this movie. Personally, I can't understand how this could be, but Envy is just one of those films that you either love or hate. Just like Napoleon Dynamite and every Leslie Nielsen movie ever filmed. You either think this is one of the worst movies in history or one of the funniest. Do not avoid this movie because of the reviews. Look and see if you really are one of those who really like it! If you do, I guarantee it is worth your money. If you don't like it ... well, now you know.
