I still remember how I first saw it on TV. I could not believe that TVNZ allowed it! I should have owned it! A lot of humor will be lost for non-New Zealanders, but try it! <br /> <br /> After the end of the Back of the Y series, Matt and Chris went in for bigger and better (?) things. Randy Campbell, the greatest stuntman from New Zealand, often appeared in the British series Balls of Steel. Yes, he still does all his stunts because he is too drunk. <br /> <br /> In addition, “home group” Deja Voodoo has released 2 albums Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The band consists of members of the Back of the Y team and singles like “I would give you one beer (but I only have 6)” and “You were not even born in the 80s”, continuing their sense of humor. . <br /> <br /> The South-South-West Film Festival also showed the full-length film “The Devil Made Me Do It”, which will be released in early 2008 in New Zealand. <br /> <br /> All up, if you don’t find these guys funny, then you can just F% ^ K OFF !!
