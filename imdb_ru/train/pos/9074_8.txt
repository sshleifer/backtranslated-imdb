The show is really funny. Good topic. Jokes and liners are really good. With a little extra tuning, this can be a very popular show. But the only serious negative point of this show is the cast. David Spade copes well with the role of Russell, Megin Price copes well. But who the hell were the actors Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kailic. <br /> <br /> Technically, Russell and Jeff are the main characters of the series, because of which viewers want to watch it. Russell is a playboy, and Jeff is a kind of disappointed family man. He has a great relationship ... with the experience of all the problems that a married couple faces. <br /> <br /> Patrick Warburton - doing a terrible job like Jeff, heâ€™s not at all suitable for the role. He looks like a robot, literally there is no impact in his dialogue. <br /> <br /> The cast is really important for the audience. A bad acting game will certainly lead the show downhill ...
