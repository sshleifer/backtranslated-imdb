I liked the way the land. His photo is incredible, editing it must have been an interesting task, and Patrick Stewart's voice was perfect. In addition, editing music and sound makes viewing EARTH a deep experience that you don’t want to miss. You really are on a journey to a place where you probably never find yourself alone. <br /> <br /> And although at first I was quite surprised by the laughter of the audience, when we see animals in their daily struggle for survival, I could not help but laugh sometimes. Nature just seems too impressive to be understood. <br /> <br /> But instead of laughing, I left a cinema with a deep question: “Why 200 years of the industrial revolution can destroy the natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years? "<br /> <br /> Bearing in mind this question, you will understand how I felt a little bitter and helpless when I saw the EARTH. I felt the urgent need to change the world, help all these animals in their struggle, reverse the changes that we survived in recent centuries, and immediately stop global warming (this is not an NGO activist at all!) ... <br /> <br /> So I immediately visited the site mentioned at the end of the film to see what I can do to save our still fantastic planet (and polar bear) from its depressing dyby .... (www.loveearth.com) <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed because I did not find direct answers to my questions there. Nevertheless, it was very interesting to learn more about the film and the fight, which the team outlived it. <br /> <br /> I hope that the reduction in energy consumption will do. I don’t know how to shorten the distance that polar bears have to swim to get to land before they drown or attack animals that they will not be able to win in a debilitated state ... <br /> <br /> This is an inspiring film, but I have not left the cinema, feeling very much with fretful
