ZP is closely related to this youth dream represented by the hippie movement. The college debate at the beginning of the film talks about the cultural situation that gave rise to this movement. The explosion that Daria imagines represents the collapse of all social structures and, consequently, the development of this whole huge transformation through which society suffers, and finally Mark’s death anticipates the end that A sees for the movement itself. The film will be easier to understand if we return to the time in life. In the 1960s and 1970s, young people were the driving force behind in-depth research on change. One of the most significant changes was to bring sexuality out of the closet, and I think that the scenes in the desert represent not an orgy, but sexual relations that men and women in absolute freedom will perform in a hypothetical situation when there is no hide I watched the scene where the couples were throwing sand at each other, and appreciated the magnificent way that A portrayed the impossibility to keep hiding this basic human instinct. Repression was a way to “control” social outbreaks at the time, and it is this method that the police use to stop students. This society suffers from hypokresia, and it becomes clear when students gain access to weapons, missing all fake controls. The dialogue between the policeman and the college professor, who was detained for no reason, shows that part of the society is interested in this sense of youth, and partly not at all interested. Representing a flight as a more accurate symbol of freedom, the theft of an aircraft represents Mark’s inner desire for him, but his (return or return or return (shogun)) shows difficulties in order to free himself from these connections and, as I said, - for these difficulties winning the game. In my opinion, the film was remembered.
