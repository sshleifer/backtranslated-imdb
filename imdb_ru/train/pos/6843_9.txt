Screenwriter Brian De Palma is known for his series of films, which are somewhat unfairly called “Hitchcock's imitations.” Contrary to popular belief, De Palma does not rob Hitchcock; he borrows elements of the story or characters that might have been seen in the Hitchcock film, and then reveals them in a more brutal, modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known for mixing blood-soaked death with eerie humor. <br /> <br /> “Dressed to kill”, shot back in 1980, is perhaps Hitchcokyan’s most famous film, De Palma, and is probably his best. The story tells how a serial killer changes clothes into a burnt housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and a street prostitute (played by Nancy Allen). <br /> <br /> Yes, it will remind you distinctly of Psycho, but De Palma’s film is just as technically brilliant and darkly creative. The museum sequence is especially well evaluated and edited; The elevator smash scene is also one of the most unique kills ever filmed. “Dressed to kill” may not be a complete original, but I would say that it is definitely worth your time. Score R. 105 minutes. 9 out of 10
