The film, which I consider excellent, should have been about the novel with a short break between them. <br /> <br /> Rob Stewart is a great actor, I don’t know why people keep giving him a bad rap. As for Mel Harris, she is a great actress, and for those who think she looks too old for Rob, she is only five years old. <br /> <br /> Rob played a major role in his own television series, as well as in a leading role. Fantastic channel. I’m sure you remember the Hot Spot, known as Sweaty Bullets and PainKiller Jane. <br /> <br /> He also starred in several television films and is currently filming Mini Series. <br /> <br /> They need to give him more leadership roles, that's where he is the best.
