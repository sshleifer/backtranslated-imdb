I grew up in Royersford, Pennsylvania. The city where Jerry's market was. I remember how my whole family went to watch shooting. I remember a guy showing “Blob” to me and my brothers in a bucket. I would also like to share the fact that my mom was in the film. She had the same hairstyle as Aneta Corso, and once she got sick, and they saw my mom and asked her to get in the car with Steve McQueen to take some pictures from behind. They paid her $ 25 and told her the story until she passed away in August of this year. My mother was not a teenager and in a few months she gave birth to my little sister.
