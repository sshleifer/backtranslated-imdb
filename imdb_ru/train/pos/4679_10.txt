Awesome film with a little slow start - give it a chance to get cooking. History builds in interest and complexity. Characters and storyline destroy expectations and cliches at all the right moments. The excellent New York locations — coarse, real — are fantastic antidotes to the commercial imperatives of Sex in the City — in fact, the entire movie is the antidote to HBO / Hollywood's concept of New York, sex and relationships. This is a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and sympathetically. LOVED IT! A great cast with notable performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson and her love interest (forgot his name!).
