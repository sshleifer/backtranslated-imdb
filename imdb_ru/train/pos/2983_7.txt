BASEketball is really a very funny movie. David Tsuker manages to make us all laugh again, in a really stupid but repeatedly intelligent comedy. <br /> <br /> 2 creators of South Park, the main actors of this film, play very well Amazingly well, but for the first time I see them as actors. The film often reminded me of South Park, one of my favorite shows. <br /> <br /> This is a really good and funny movie, so do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Vote: 7.5 out of 10
