In my opinion, this is a pretty good celebrity show. I liked to see Greg Kinnear as the host. There are many reasons why I said that. Despite the fact that Hal Sparks was a good host, I sometimes want Greg Kinnear not to leave. If you ask me, it seems that no one else stays with a TV show throughout his performance. However, I liked to see different hosts and other people cheating on celebrities. If you ask me, it was damn funny. Before I finish, I must say that I miss this show. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this show to all skit fans. You will really like it.
