** ATTENTION - CONTAINS SPOILERS! ** <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that I really liked this game. I received it on Christmas after two months of refusing prompts to my parents. I'm glad I did it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the single player was very good. The first level is probably one of the best in the game when you are at a party in London, and some evil guys destroy it by kidnapping the daughter of the prime minister. Of course, you have to save her, and this is quite a high level, but it will probably take you at least five minutes. The best part, and I think also the funniest part, is when you are in the jet pack, and people are going down Big Ben. Just put on the most reliable rocket complex of the jetpack and destroy the dials and enemies. Pure pleasure! <br /> <br /> The remaining levels are very good, but rather short. There are four mini levels that you can unlock, and this is one of the drawbacks, because only the first two of them are really fun, and the last two, to unlock, are just “kill 25 enemies” goals, I mean, with mon! We got a lot of points to unlock these missions, and the last two bonus missions are really bad! <br /> <br /> Multiplayer, I and some of my friends agree, very good and complex, even if there are no bots. Halo didn't have any bots, but these are still good multiplayer games! You can be a bunch of bad guys, and you go against each other, and you can also set traps that are the best way to kill people without paying attention to their character. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 8.5 / 10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions can be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (strange bad graphics, but this is not often). Multiplayer - 10/10 (does not need comments, just great, you can ride jetpacks and vehicles). Sound - 8/10 Playback value - 7/10 (the only levels I return to are London and Istanbul, part 1). <br /> <br /> I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> It may be a little improvement, but it's still good.
