This is the film that, if it was made today, would probably have appeared in the films of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; in fact, now that I think about it, this may well be redone once. It is nice, but without depth. He suffers from an almost fatal mistake of James Stewart in a role for which he is about 20 years old, and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak. Ernie Kovacs in the small role of an aspiring writer is the only actor in the film whose presentation comes close to what you can call “wit.” (** 1/2)
