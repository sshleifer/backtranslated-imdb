As a 90-minute experience, it does not meet the “Drive” standard, since the actors clearly studied their profession in “Who am I?” Academy, while the sequence of actions is usually no better than in the excellent film “Mark Dacascos” . However, those who loved Drive, (and I thought it was wonderful!) Sure, it will also please. Of course, you will not return to the beginning and do not look at all this again, but you will definitely return to some scenes for a long time. <br /> <br /> It’s nice to see that the art of quality battle choreography is still practiced, even if not in Hong Kong, and I would like to see what these guys could do with budget, time and respect provided by such as Yuen Woo-Ping and Corey Yuen Kuei. If you sit in the first half hour and you are not driven by a disgusting dialogue, then a treat awaits you. Bosch is great, and can really turn the tide with some great acrobatics, kicks and simple acts of courage. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky enough to be within 500 miles of the copy, track it and see it. This is not Shakespeare. In fact, it is less articulated than Culio in China Strike Force, but you will be impressed with both the movements shown and the pain the stunt team is experiencing (I'm sure there is no safe way to land right on or be forced to roof at higher speeds the car!?)
