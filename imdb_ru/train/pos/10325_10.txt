I was raised on Dock Savage, and petrified by a green death in childhood, but even then, as now, I found it very interesting. I made countless friends and colleagues watch this movie and was very surprised by the variety of reactions. Of course, they mostly think I'm strange, but you're here. “I don’t know what Doc is, but he always turns girls on” should be the most important feature when you look at his sad group of men. This film is a classic parody of all genres of superheroes, and it was much ahead of time, it should not be taken seriously, move over Austin Powers. Ron Eli - God. Unfortunately, this film was not released on DVD in the UK. I do not think that this should be redone and killed, as I said it is a classic, it cannot be done without Ron (like Italian work without Mini and Michael Kane). I give it a 10/10.
