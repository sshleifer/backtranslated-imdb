I went and saw the Rivers and Tides again today. This is the second time in two days, and yes, I watch films that I like as many times as necessary. Yesterday I was amazed at the brilliance of the images and works of Goldsworthy. This morning, when I threw the coins, I received the number 29 "Abyss" Goldsworthy has a relationship with water, hence the name. I got the 5th line shift, which passed to # 7 Army. For Blake, Art was a war. Anyway, I knew that I had to watch the movie again. <br /> <br /> I read one of the few reviews that have been preserved on the Internet by SF Examiner. The critic loved the film, but said that the Goldsworthy comments prevented him from enjoying the film. He would prefer to have only images and a wonderful soundtrack. So I knew about it when I watched it a second time. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I thought I would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as King of the World. Well, today I could go a little beyond the images and listen to what he wanted to say. Can I enjoy the movie without his comments? What he does, what he says goes far beyond the "art". His understanding of Water, Time, Stone, Change and the like made me think that this man is the reincarnation of Lao Tsu or some Avatar. Some of his writings / words are like Zen. His knowledge ... <br /> <br /> In any case, the film only (apparently) is shown here, in the Bay area. Be a trendsetter. Go to your local cinema and tell them, do not insist that they have to order a movie about which you heard from hard to reach lands. This is called Rivers and Tides. <br /> <br />
