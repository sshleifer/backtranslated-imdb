Imagine that I was going to miss this great cultural event on Swedish television last night, and just because my friend insisted that the television be turned on (to make it easier for her to fall asleep!), I came across it (yes, I used to see advertising this, but, of course, forgot about it and looked forward to "early night" ...). <br /> <br /> In any case - this is certainly a rather unusual idea - to create a documentary film about an interview made with sound only more than 30 years ago. But with an animated and other documentary, it complements the really good and insightful portrait of one of the most recognized literary artists of the 20th century - Georges Remy or Herge. <br /> <br /> I will surely read my Tintin albums with a different look after watching this movie, which makes it easy to link variations of style and content with different periods in Erzheâ€™s life (and I can tell you that I will get those few which I do not have). Of course, my perception of albums has changed in more than 25 years, which I have already read, as well as my opinion about which albums are my favorite, but this adds (at least) another dimension to them.
