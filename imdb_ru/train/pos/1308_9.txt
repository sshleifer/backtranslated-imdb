I must say that I really had no idea that I was going to sit down and watch this movie. I think it was the fact that I had nothing to do between lessons. But this time the television movie interested me. More importantly, Helen Hunt caught my eye. I really wasn't her big fan before this movie. Of course, I liked the Twister and it is good. But something in this film really did it for me. I would now see myself a huge fan. This film received high marks from ... me. Give him a chance, he will not let you down.
