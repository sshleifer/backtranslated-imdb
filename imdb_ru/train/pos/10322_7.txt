The problem is that the film used a concept created in the 60s, when comics could only be made as a “camp” (that is, a Batman show of the 60s) for television and film. So you have subtitles in the fighting (oh well!), Ignorantly unromantic Doc Savage (he was uncomfortable among women in the pulp, not an idiot), monk Mayfair in a night sheet (the scene is guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights) and completely recklessly ending with a minor bad guy enclosed in gold, like Hervé Villehoze, posing for an Oscar statue. And when they do not perform Souza’s boisterous scores, this small, funny, funny music undermines much of the drama. <br /> <br /> Even so, this movie ... well. This is fun, but seriously, this is a very accurate idea of ​​the pulp. With the exception of Monk, as mentioned earlier: he is very muscular, does not suffer from obesity. And Long Tom, who should be a pale skinny guy with an attitude, not Paul Gleason with a (unexplainable) scarf. <br /> <br /> For example, “Green Death” is amazingly awful, and not what I Recommend for children. But they are very close to the feeling of pulp. When script writers and producers get it right, they get it right - I'll give it to them. <br /> <br /> But if the producers performed Doc with love care and scripting, say, Reeves first two Superman films, think about what we could have then. I think the problem is film schizophrenia. There is a certain sense to try to pay tribute to the 30th, but they also try to succumb to the “heroes must be in the camp” position that Batman created. It seems that at first there was a sober draft style, and then someone came in and said: “Hey, let's make it funny - he worked with the Batman show 8 years ago!” <br /> <br /> But Doc lives thanks to Earl Macrouch and Bacaru Banzai. If MacRauch doesn’t pay tribute to Doc Savage in this film, the man is really crazy. Therefore, when the series really appears on television (presumably in the middle of the season in 99–00), Doc Savage, updated to the 90s, will live again.
