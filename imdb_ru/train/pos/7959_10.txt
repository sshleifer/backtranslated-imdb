This is a really cool movie! I remember when I first saw him when I was very young, and I watched him all the time, just once a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the film. Homeward Bound is really fun, and very cool, as they teach animals to do all these things. Although parts of the film are sad (for example, when Sassy cat falls on a waterfall and when Shadow falls into a hole at the end). I have seen the second Homeward Bound, but I must say that it is not as good as the first. Shadow is smart, Sassy is, well, Sassy, ​​and Chance is a funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy or talking animals. This is one of ten of my favorite movies!
