I thought this movie was pretty good. Some details were commonplace, but this is understandable, since it was done more than 55 years ago. I thought that the best performance in the film was given by Michelle Morgan, who convincingly played Millie. Jack Haley is also very good, like Mike O'Brien. Although I'm not a big fan of Frank Sinatra, I think he was very good at this movie. If you have a craving for a stupid musical comedy, “Higher and Higher” is a movie for you. <br /> <br />
