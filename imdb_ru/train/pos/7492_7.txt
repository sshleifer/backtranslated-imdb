Although not a creepy movie in the traditional sense, this creepy little movie delivers the goods. It seems that a vampire in a small German town is losing the blood of its victims. Police Inspector Karl Bretchneider, Melvin Douglas in one of his early roles, is skeptical that a crazy killer, not a vampire, is frantic. The only one who believes him is Ruth Bertin (Fay Ray), the girlfriend of the inspector and laboratory assistant Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atville), who is apparently a prominent scientist, agrees with the theory of vampires. Townspeople suspect the abnormal Herman Gleib, whom Dwight Fry plays with his usual madness of Dwight Fry. The film contains a bit of humor, which helps to relieve some of the tension associated with all the murders. One funny part is Gussie Schnappmann (Maud Abern), Aunt Ruth Bertin, thinking that the strange Herman had turned into a dog, not a bat. Maud Abern and Dwight Fry are a good comedy team. <br /> <br /> This budget film contains elements from Dr. Caligari's Cabinet, in which Dr. Nimann uses the power of suggestion to make the somnambulist execute his Frankenstein orders on using human blood to create life in the laboratory and Dracula. , because everyone except the inspector and his girlfriend consider the killings to be bloodsuckers. These elements are well blended by director Frank R. Strayer with a little comedy added for good measure. Cooking works. The restored version, which I looked through, used shading to enhance the eerie atmosphere. So try to see this version, if possible.
