It was a mandatory documentary for me when I missed this opportunity in 2004, so I was definitely going to watch the repetition. I really sympathized with the main character of the film, because, it is true, I have a milder condition of the skin problem that he had, dystrophic epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). This is a sad, sometimes funny and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disease. Johnny Kennedy speaks like a child (due to loss of muscle mass) and never went through puberty, but he is 36 years old. The most sympathetic moments see his terrible condition and remove the bandages. Johnny had a rather naughty sense of humor, he even spoke from behind the grave, showing his body in a coffin. He tells his story with the help of his mother, Edna Kennedy, his older brother and the famous model, as well as a supporter of Johnny, Nell McAndrew. He won BAFTA for Best Editing and Best New Director (Fact), and was nominated for Best Sound (Fact) and Flaherty Award. It was number 10 on the 100 greatest television pleasures of 2004. Be sure to watch the documentary!
