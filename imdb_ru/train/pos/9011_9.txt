I found this film completely by accident, but I'm happy that I found it. Kenneth Brann's performance came close to stealing this film from Helena Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry together made the film much more enjoyable. This film is a reminder of the wonderful films Brana made with Emma Thompson. Carter's stellar turn in the role of a young woman with disabilities, seeking to complete herself, was as good a performance as I have seen in the female role for a long time. It is difficult to remove a portrait of a disabled person, but, basically, only with her eyes, in order to show her pain in her life situation, she made it so believable. If this film were released after the current wave of films with beautiful women who have “disfigured” themselves for roles (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I would be sure that Carter would have taken seriously the Oscar. If you stumble across this movie on cable late at night, like me, believe me, it is worth the loss of sleep.
