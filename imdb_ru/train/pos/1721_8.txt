If this film were shot a few years later, I would give it a lower rating. However, in 1909 it was a great little movie, and it still does a good job. Just don’t try to compare this silent film with later silencers - the industry has changed so drastically that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century are not at all like films shot in the 1910s and subsequent years. <br /> <br /> This film lasts 11 minutes (approximately the average for most films of that time) and is a variation of the story by Edgar Allen Poe, “Escape from AMONTILLADO.” Although many are familiar with the story, I will not go into details, because I do not want to spoil the film. Suffice it to say that it is very creepy !!
