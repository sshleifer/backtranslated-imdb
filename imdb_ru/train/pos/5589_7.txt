Ecstasy is more than an erotic drama that we all expect to see. It is almost a silent film, with which the communication is conducted in German, and at the same time a strongly simplified German. Perhaps the filmmakers wanted the film to reach as wide a European audience as possible, since anyone who even has a small high school level can easily do without subtitles. In any case, the story does not matter much, the film goes on a cinematic, rather than a narrative level. The symbols of fertility and the power of nature overwhelm human characters - there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of the supposed star Hedy Lamarr - and there are moments that will remind viewers of the work of Dreyer, Vertov and Riefenstahl. If there is any message in the film, I think it is political: the bourgeois man is timid and powerless; the working man is a happy, productive being; and the female creator intended to be unfulfilled until she gives birth to a child. This mixture of Soviet socialist realism and the dogma of National Socialism by no means stuns the film - it is beauty that you need to watch from beginning to end - but it puts it in a completely different artistic era. And, yes, Hedy really shoots his kit.
