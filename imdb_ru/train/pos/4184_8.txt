Some war films succeed where there are no others, and this can be judged from different points of view. The humanistic perspective in which you can feel harsh emotions (the horror of an attack, the camaraderie among soldiers, the ordeals people encounter inside them in battle, etc.) are always films that I consider irresistible. Films like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are just two examples of films in which you feel connected to the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> This film is also a success at this level. It speaks of “Highest Honor,” and this honor does the right thing. These 23 soldiers did the right thing, they had the honor, and this is considered completely incompatible with Western thought, but this, to the end, is a true honor story. Unforgettable movie. Based on real events.
