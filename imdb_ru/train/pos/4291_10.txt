From the first shots of the main actor, we are given an early idea of ​​how many men control life in them, and about the humor that permeates everything that happens in everyday “normal” life. . <br /> <br /> Eric Lartigo, the director, talks about how many European men believe that they have complete control over their lives, but without the help / support of women around them, they cannot bring themselves to work. Using the facial image throughout the film is superb, and its clever location of the eldest family member (mother) at the height. <br /> <br /> Although the film has more than enough laughter, it still remains to deal with single parents / adoption and family strength in society. It is really nice to watch, and again the one that can only make a French seam. <br /> <br /> So far, one of the top 50 or so films I've seen this year is worth five star ratings. I look forward to adding it to the DVD collection when it is released, and highly recommend it to all ages.
