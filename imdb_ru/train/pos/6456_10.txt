My expectations were quite high for this film. Everyone I know who saw this movie in the cinema told me that everyone was there for titles because they were so touched. My expectations could not be higher, nothing but beautiful would disappoint me. <br /> <br /> This film did not disappoint me at all. I liked how he dealt with complex topics, without going through the usual steps, which usually includes a Hollywood film. In this film, the characters worked on the problems that had been theirs for decades, they worked through prejudices, they learned how to open up. But it was not easy, and not just singing a song or two. It was painful, arguments were required, confrontations were required. It was like real life. <br /> <br /> One scene that really struck me was the scene in which Gabriella sings her song. Helen Sjöholm is one of my favorite singers, her voice is beautiful and you could say that she didn’t just synchronize her lips with the previous recording during the shooting (which I often find in other films), she really sang with her whole body and soul. You could feel what Gabriella felt in this scene. If this film were made in Hollywood, her song would most likely have been sung to the end, and this would have made her husband open his eyes and see the mistakes of his way, as well as make other people in the village understand a thing or two. Instead, he passed half path and brought no solutions. Her husband was not taken aback and did not realize what she had to go through, and it seems that no one in the village became more open. It was beautiful, it was clean, and it was touching, but it did not magically solve all its problems. It seemed to me real, this is probably what would have happened in real life. The whole film seemed to me a real life, nothing was neatly wrapped, but all with a feeling of joy and happiness. You rarely find a film that seems so realistic. <br /> <br /> A few things bothered me, but hey, no movie is perfect. If you have not done so yet, you should go see “How it is in heaven” and fill with the joy of life, a sense of hope and a feeling that you were affected at the level of films that you rarely reach. You will be sad, suffer, rejoice and a dozen other emotions. <br /> <br /> Someone once said that if everyone in the world sang in the choir, there would be no more wars. After watching this movie, I could agree.
