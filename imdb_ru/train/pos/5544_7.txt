The People's Republic of China, which was the lowest of the lowest, actually struck gold with this capricious little thriller. They did the same thing a year earlier with Detour, which is probably one of the best low-budget films ever made. <br /> <br /> “Strangler” is, in fact, a one-step film filled with fog and shadows, a technique used by most poor studios to hide the scenery or lack thereof. But here everything works well. The ghost of Charles Middleton (better known as Ming the Merciless) rushes around the swamp, killing those who participated in his unlawful execution for murder, and causes sympathy from the viewer. His last victim is the ferryman’s daughter ..... he concentrates his anger not only on those directly involved in his fate, but also on their relatives. <br /> <br /> Rosemary Laplanche imitates someone in a coma that passes for her acting style. She offers herself a strangler to put an end to the murder, but as a trick for the public, the strangler sees the kindness of her gesture as a sign that his mission has been completed, and he is returning to a somewhat punished future. If Ulmer (who sent the “Walk”) sent the “Strangler”, she would have hung on the nearest tree, and the strangler's work would have been done. But who is complaining? This is not a story that attracts attention, but enveloped scenery, lighting and general mood of the play. He stands right behind the Circuit, as China’s best hour.
