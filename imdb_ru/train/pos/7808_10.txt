This is a movie that everyone should watch. Besides the fact that he raised extremely important questions (although South Africa is on the road to recovery, many countries are now in similar situations), he is superbly focused, while Denzel Washington gives, in my opinion, the best results in his career this moment. Kline also gives good results, although perhaps not as amazing as in Washington. John Tau is also well suited as a police chief. <br /> <br /> There are so many possible areas where a film about apartheid could fall, but all this was avoided. It would be easy to simply portray white people as bad guys, and blacks as good guys, but Attenborough did not. Of course, there were some white characters who initially seemed evil, such as the Captain during the uprising in Soweto, but adding extra dimensions to all the characters would make the film unbearably long. Some people complain about the length of the film as it is, but I think it takes as much as two and a half hours to tell the whole story, because it's really incredible. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the film is Steve Biko's funeral. When the whole crowd starts singing the anthem of South Africa, this is probably one of, if not the most touching, scene that I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, watch it. This may be inconvenient, but worth it.
