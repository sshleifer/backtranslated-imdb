If you like Othello, you will love this film, as half of the film revolves around the production of the play. <br /> <br /> In the film, the great cast is starring Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters as the women in Colemanâ€™s Life, while Edmond O'Brien plays an adventurous press agent. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked several supporting players: Millard Mitchell as the gray-haired reporter who found the approach, and Joe Sawyer, 1940 answer to Drew. Carey, who plays the cop on the case. <br /> <br /> Glorious rough moments in this film with noir realism.
