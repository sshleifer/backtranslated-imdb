I'm so glad I accidentally saw this video in the store. I was looking for some happy movies, and this one turned out to be a real decoration. I liked that the film, a kind of love story, is not about some beautiful twenty year olds; rather, it is a story about some beautiful sixty with something that used to be twenty with something. This is a good, well-written and well-played story, in which the incredible music of the band from the Second World War was also added. For lovers of Scottish castles, this was also a pleasant surprise. It made me smile and was ready to watch it again, which I did a couple of times before turning it on. I highly recommend it.
