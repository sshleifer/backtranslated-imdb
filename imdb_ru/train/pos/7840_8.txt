BORN TO BOOGIE is a real “find” - although a rock fan is almost thirty years old, I saw the film for the first time just a few days ago and was one of the best rock films of all time; the music is amazing (cream of T. Rex) and visually invariably exciting and unusual, leaving this viewer thirsty for some of the past directorial efforts of Ringo Starr who did a great job here. If you love music, you will be in T. Rextasy everywhere, since Marc Bolan is indeed the star of the play, front and center. Even the fact that some songs are repeated does not matter much: different venues, costumes, musical arrangements and fancy visual concepts are used to give different textures and great optimism to what could have ended as “only”. Concert film in other hands. Despite the fact that the film “BORN TO BOOGIE” is rich and full, the film lasts only about an hour, but what is there is quite satisfactory. This is my only criticism - the video package says about 71 minutes, and at least one online source claims that the film is 67 minutes, but apparently it looks more like 61 minutes of fun.
