Initial credits: excellent. Music: just for this movie. Cinematography: sloppy, with great effect. <br /> <br /> The agonizing excitement of a train wreck. That's how some life gets out of control. “Wonderland” depicts the wildness (and its consequences) caused by drugs not as a deviation from the norm, but shows how this really happens in our society. This is better than the images of another wild group - “Manson”, because all films, books, and so on. D. Manson devote so much attention to Manson’s insane mind, and not to the general picture of cheap glory and randomness so common in our time. > If you want to see some of the best "acting method" films, see Kilmer in this movie. He shows how “Method” can be chained to the right role. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers here succeed in raising the “uncontrollable” level of art, not only for the sake of giving us cheap thrills.
