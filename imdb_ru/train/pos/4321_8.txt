I will keep it pretty short. I think this is an unusual film. I see other reviewers who have commented that it is poorly written, poorly shot, has a terrible soundtrack and, even worse, it is unreal in its depiction of life. Okay, so this may not be entirely believable for its entire length, but this film carries a message of hope that some others seemed to have missed. I hope it's not too late to save people from the terrible things that happen in so many lives. Gang violence is real, right? That's right, no! This film carries important social information that cynics may not like, but which nevertheless should be praised, not insulted. I watched this film with great pleasure at least eight times, each time with the same pleasure and each time with the feeling that perhaps the world can be made better, and this is not beyond salvation (well, anyway, until 2008 of the year). 9 out of 10 from me for that. In my opinion, it is almost perfect. Jmv
