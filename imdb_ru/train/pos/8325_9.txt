I liked the idea of ​​this film from the moment I first saw the trailer for it. Einstein was always one of my heroes, and his image as a kind, playful, slightly insane genius was enough for me to watch a movie. Added spice Matthau, as Einstein made it even better. <br /> <br /> History is pure fantasy, but amazing. An auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman who turns out to be Einstein's niece. With the help of four Magic Godfathers, the Fed goes on a quest to win Katherine's heart. Throw the jealous groom (who is an example of the worst in experimental psychology) and Eisenhower into the mix, and you will get pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with wonderful actors and deliciously sweet and fluffy performances. Walter Mattau plays Einstein as a mischievous demon; Cupid with a slip rule. Tim Robbins is wonderfully charming when Ed and Meg Ryan are playing a step above their usual rom-com level. Stephen Fry is pleased, as “R.R. Ratman” and the bridegroom Ryan; which does not have the only romantic bone in his body. <br /> <br /> The film fell below most radars, but this is a delightful treasure that will not become obsolete with repeated viewing. It features first-class writing and performances and is a gentle pleasure in a less gentle world.
