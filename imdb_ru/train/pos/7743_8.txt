I watched him 2 times in this film, my friend went to see him at the party, and he told me that it was so great that I was expecting a lot about the film, anyway, I could not Enjoy it, because I donâ€™t watched it in the inner position. The second time I knew what to expect, and enjoyed it more than the first time. After the second time, I felt so tuned to have a party. I really liked the music, it's just great. <br /> <br /> If Tom Barman enhances his directorial talent, he will become a director everyone will talk about. If you can put this film as your first, you must be talented. <br /> <br /> Some great Belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and a bunch of beginner talents, such as Titus Voogdt, participate in the production. <br /> <br />
