I like it! Fred McMurray is wonderful as Skid Johnson, somewhat vain, proud, but at the same time very vulnerable saxophonist, in love with Maggie (Carol Lombard), who is always with him. They meet in Panama after Maggie leaves the ship and ends up in a bar with Anthony Quinn. Tony gets hit in the nose after insulting Maggie, considering her a free woman - all because she publicly took off her hat. A big fight and Maggie ended up stuck in Panama. Romance. Carol and Arthur are great together. Maggie is always with him when she needs him. She encourages him to go to New York, where (well, watch the movie and find out). They have these wonderful scenes together, where she sings in his hands while he plays the saxophone. I would definitely recommend it.
