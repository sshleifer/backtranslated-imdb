I would not dare to say that this film is better than the original, but in itself it is very good. Although the comedy in this film is as good as the original, there are so many scenes that make me laugh, just thinking about them. <br /> <br /> The story in this film is even more bizarre than the original, that's what makes it so wonderful. Peter Hewitt is great at directing this movie. The main cast of the original film returns to their characters in this film, and everyone does a fantastic job with their roles. I don't care what anybody says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I really liked his image of Ted in both of these films, as well as in Alex Winter's film. I was very happy to see George Carlin returning to the role of Rufus, very cool! Hal London Jr., who plays the role of Ted Loganâ€™s father, does a really good job. The scene where Ted has the body of his father, and Hal London Jr. starts to act like Ted is a great scene and he copes with it impressively. I can not forget to mention William Sadler as Death, he completely made the film for me. The rest of the cast is also pretty good. <br /> <br /> If you liked the first release of the Bill and Ted series, then I hope you enjoy this movie. But do not expect it to be as good as the original. I really hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> - Chris
