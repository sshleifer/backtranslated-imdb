The last hunt is one of the few westerns ever created to combat the buffalo hunt, both in sports and in business, as well as a method of winning the plains in Indian wars. Before the white man set foot on the other side of the Mississippi, there used to be herds of American bison about the size of some of our largest cities on the plains. By the time the “Last Hunt” began, the buffalo was almost wiped out. The twentieth century, thanks to the efforts of nature conservationists, survived the resurgence of the species population, but not in the same way as before. <br /> <br /> Robert Taylor and Stuart Granger together star in the second film and this one is far superior to "All the brothers were valiant." Here Stuart Granger is a good guy, a bison hunter tired of the world, who has to go back to work that he hates because of financial considerations. <br /> <br /> The partner he chose is Robert Taylor. For a moment, forgetting about Taylor, I doubt that a more angry and nasty soul ever existed than Charlie Gilsen, who is portrayed by Taylor. In Devil's Doors, he was an American Indian fighting against the prejudices inflamed by the racist played by Louis Kalern. In The Last Hunt, he's a racist here. He kills both bison and Indians for pure pleasure. He kills one Indian family when they steal his mules, and takes away one widowed widow. Like some barbarous conqueror, he expects the pleasure of the sexual services of Debra Paget. He really gets angry when Paget doesn't see it that way. <br /> <br /> No matter how often they call Russ Tamblin half-breed, I was never convinced that he was some kind of Hindu. This is the only weakness that I discovered in The Last Hunt. <br /> <br /> However, Lloyd Nolan, the old gray-haired bison Taylor and Granger, is just great. Nolan steals every scene with the cast. <br /> <br /> For those who love real westerns, who want to see the side of Robert Taylor, who has never been seen on the screen, and who does not like cheap heroics, “Last Hunt” is an ideal hunt.
