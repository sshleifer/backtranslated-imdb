For years, I thought this popular comedy about comedies was a product of John Ford, especially with Victor McLaglen as one of the hosts. This, of course, has the same rough homely humor with which Ford mixes his films. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I found out that this is indeed George Stevens. Nevertheless, I refuse to believe that this film was not offered to John Ford, but he probably went to Monument Valley to star in the stage. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen, along with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., are played by three sergeants in the Indian army who have a good, friendly journey. But the old gang is falling apart because Fairbanks married Joan Fontaine. No, if his two friends can help him, with the support and support of the regimental beast Gung Dean performed by Sam Jaff. <br /> <br /> Rudyard Kipling's poem inspired this RKO film about the life of the barracks in British rule. The comic starring is so good that it overshadows the incredibly racist message of the film. Not that the creators were racist, but it was the British speculation there at the time, including our leaders, and Gunga Dean shows this most effectively. <br /> <br /> The British seized India gradually, bargaining here and there with local rulers under the weak Mughal emperor, whom they ended in the middle of the 19th century. They ruled India very little, it would be impossible. Their rule depended on the native troops that you see here. Note that soldiers cannot rise above the rank of corporal, and Gunga Dean has a significantly lower status than this one. <br /> <br /> Please note that the rebels are in fact Hindu, not Muslim. There are as many varieties in this religion as there are in Christian sects, and this suffocating cult was quite real. Of course, for those who are strangled, they may not have the same opinion of them as the liberators. But as long as India did not organize its movement for independence, until the Congress Party was formed, these people were the voice of free India. <br /> <br /> But no matter how you do it, strangling people is not good. and the British had their point of view here too. When I watch “Gunga Din”, I remember “Star Trek” and the reason why the main directive arose. <br /> <br /> Keri Grant plays his real Cockney here, and not the polite Carey we used to see, Fairbanks and McLaglen doing an excellent job with roles that are completely appropriate for their personalities. <br /> <br /> The best acting role in the film, however, is Edward Ciannelli as guru, head of the strangler cult. Pay attention to the fire and the passion in his performance, he takes all the rest from the screen when it is turned on. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene in Gung Dean - Cyannelli, calling on his soldiers in their mountain temple. Notice how Stevens gradually darkens the background around Ciannelli until all you see are eyes and teeth that look like a horrible Halloween mask. Phantom, frightening and very effective. <br /> <br /> It was after this film’s action in the late nineteenth century that more and more of the British public began to question the underlying assumptions justifying Raj. But this is the topic of Gandhi. <br /> <br /> “Gunga Ding” is still a great movie, exciting and fun. This should be shown through the “Passage to India and Gandhi”, and you can imagine how the independence movement in India developed.
