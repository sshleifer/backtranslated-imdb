This animation has a very simple and clear plot “good versus evil” and is based on action. What distinguishes it from other animations is how well a person’s movements are animated. It was really wonderful to see the running woman running across the screen from left to right and looking around, her movements were made so well. Why don't they use this rotoscopic technique anymore these days? It is quite effective. <br /> <br /> “Fire and Ice” in prehistoric environments and barely dressed women clearly sought to show the beautiful woman in distress in various sexual ways, and her voluptuous body served as a clean eye. Some may hate it and regard it as another moronic sexual male fantasy, others (including many women) will adore this aesthetic quality. I definitely did not mind! Bakshi just loves to revive juicy, voluptuous babies, which can be seen in Cool World, and I don't think he should apologize, because this is pretty much animation for adults. But I also enjoyed this animation as a child and never forgot it. <br /> <br /> This game was just special, so different from the standard fare in Disney or Anime, and for this reason alone it’s worth seeing since Perhaps this is the best Bakshi. For those who love juicy women animation: try Space Adventure Cobra. <br /> <br /> I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10.
