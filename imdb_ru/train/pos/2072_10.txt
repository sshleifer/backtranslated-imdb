I was about thirteen years old when this film was released on television. It is much better in action than most films since. Martin Sheen is superb, and although Nick Nolte has a small role, he also provides excellent support. Vic Morrow, like a villain, is superb. <br /> <br /> When Shin "tests the water" on his 34th Ford (COOL) along the mountain highway, it is impressive! <br /> <br /> Grand. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed with the low vote that was received. I believe that the younger generations are showing more interest in most of the junk that goes out these days. <br /> <br /> Good taste eludes the mass!
