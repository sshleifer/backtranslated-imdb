I rate it 10 out of 10. Why? <br /> <br /> * It gives an idea of ​​what I barely understand - surfers surf, because that's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to be as important to them as surfing; Nor is it a temporary thing - it's life for these guys. * Buried in the film - the great story of surfing; I have never surfed, but I like surfing movies and I have seen a lot. Nobody taught me what this film did * The film was very well edited. It went well. Interviews were outstanding * This is interesting from start to finish <br /> <br /> In general, it’s about as good as a documentary I saw, so I have to evaluate it from the point of view. So 10/10
