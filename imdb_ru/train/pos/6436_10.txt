Ingrid Bergman - temporarily impoverished Polish countess in Paris in the 1900s, pursued by the most popular French general and glamor count - and this is at the top of the betrothal with a shoe magnate. Such is the unmistakable premise that captures one of the craziest scenes in the history of cinema. There are behind-the-scenes political frauds on the part of the directors of the general, a downed aerostat and ecstatic crowds of the Bastille Day, but the heart of this beautifully photographed film is insane intrigues at the top / bottom, involving extraordinary servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. Yes, these are the rules of the game Redux. Even before it was over, even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamer of the Rules, appears - like a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen too loud and fast towards the end, which leads to some confusion for this non-French speaker, but damn, Elena and her people are another deeply humane masterpiece of Renoir.
