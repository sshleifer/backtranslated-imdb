Pierce Brosnan - the newest, but not James Bond, - the killer. He is very, very good at what he does, but he is getting old and tired. Greg Kinnear is really good as a straight and narrow businessman. Now that the story begins, the film shows these two people in their separate lives. Then one night they drink in a bar and start talking. Suddenly you will find these two people gathering together during a series of events. The story is great, the acting is top notch, and the humor is hilarious. I never thought Pierce Brosnan would be so funny, but he really is, and I must say that this film is a must see.
