Cinderella was one of the first films I've ever seen, and for me it's forever. This is a wonderful movie with great animation. My favorite animation scene was the clothing scene — I just adore these mice. The songs are also beautiful, not as good as Snow White, but they are very pleasant to sing and resemble Tchaikovsky. Dream is desire, and so is love? outstanding characters are also delighted. Cinderella is idealistic and strong, and the mice provided great comic relief. The half-sisters were as well made as Lucifer. But I loved my stepmother most of all, she was really angry compared to the great character in the name of the Godfather. It's true, the film is a bit addictive, with the antics of mice, but they were really funny, so I don’t care. I do not think this is overvalued, underestimated, you do not mean? It rarely plays on television, but a really bad follow-up is doing on Cinemagic on a regular basis. if you want a great adaptation to Cinderella, try a wonderful Ever After or a luxurious slipper and a rose that is not so good. But no matter what you do, avoid the continuation, which I am mistaken because you will thank me. 9/10. Bethany Cox
