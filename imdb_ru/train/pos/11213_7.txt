This second film is as interesting as the previous one, except that there is no expectation. We know what he is going to do and what will happen before he is even hinted at. Then the pleasure comes only from how various tricks and their sequence occur. We know that there will be dynamite in the car, that it will lose the wheel, that the car will have an accident, just talking about the car. And this is what happens. Now details and details for you to recognize them in the film. The fact that he could be the bait of some stupid woman obviously should come, but we know that he has already seen her and that he knows that he is being dragged into a trap. Now, how is he going to get out of this? This is something you should discover on your own. And do not worry, he will get the main merchant, but how is another story. The speedboat is no match for our busy beaver on the river. We also know when he will be injured. They did not know what bulletproof jackets are in those days. True, it was recently discovered that some soldiers did not have such equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a film? This perseverance on the hunt for human traffickers and this blindness, which does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem. But the film is a permanent and perfect illustration of the fact that there is no value that can ever stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. Why not just legalize these products so that they can be properly monitored and controlled? When something is not illegal or driven out of the way, it is less interesting to use them, to do them. It is forbidden or restricted, which is attractive. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques CULARDO, University Paris Dauphin, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and University Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines
