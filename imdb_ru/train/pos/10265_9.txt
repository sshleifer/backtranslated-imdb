A unique film about the tangled woman (Lindsay Crows), which is associated with sharp crooks. Joe Mantegna gives the Oscar caliber as the smoothest of the group. Absolutely charming first hour, when Mantegna shows Cause "rope" of his fraudulent games. The storyline unfolds a little later, but still appears as a unique image of an innocent who finds himself in a dark world. Definitely worth a try.
