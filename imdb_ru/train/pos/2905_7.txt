This is a very funny movie that is easy to watch, which entertains you almost all the time. Director's work is recognizable, and the type of humor is his trademark. The film is a typical story of police partners, for example, a deadly weapon, but jokes and comedies of the Argentine type. The bottom line is that one of them is a psychologist, played by Peretti, and he has to go with detective Diaz (played by Luka) to his assignments, at the same time he also helps him (Diaz is concerned because his wife cheated on him) . Some of the conversations are funny all over the world: everywhere it’s clear and funny. In general, it is very good, it deserves 8, but I appreciated 7, because at the end it falls a little. To personal note, I must add that this is “bravo” for Argentine filmmakers, given that there has been little good lately.
