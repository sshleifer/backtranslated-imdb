As for parody films, then very few people are worth the time and energy. but with the recent resurgence of horrendous parodies, such as Movie Date and The Return, it's a breath of fresh air to go back and reopen a truly funny farce, like Johnny Danger. <br /> <br /> After his mother has no end due to health problems, little Johnny goes to work for the mafia. What follows the game is a series of jokes, most of which work, but failures occur. But a foreign gangster who cannot master the American language (at least wise profanity), a rival gangster with a tendency to tear his mouth (... once!), Younger brother with DA who wants to get Johnie Dangerous, and a hot young star, hot with his affections, makes Johnny be busy. <br /> <br /> And the viewer will be busy laughing, for the most part, since every gangster movie cliche is twisted by a talented actor and a decent letter. <br /> <br /> Not perfect for long shots, but definitely good for smiling on a bad day.
