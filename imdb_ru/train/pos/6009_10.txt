Marc Fréchette plays the role of Mark, a left-wing radical from college. Mark is accused of killing a policeman during a riot on campus, and he runs all the way to the desert. He does this by hijacking a small plane at a local airport, and he flies by himself. <br /> <br /> Once flying over the desert, Mark notices the car from the air. A young woman named Daria comes out and sees Mark circling in a plane. Mark hit the plane several times very low, causing Daria to crouch or hit. When he lands, he meets Daria, who is strangely fascinated by Mark’s air strikes. <br /> <br /> After long hours of heartfelt conversation, Mark and Daria undress and make love on the sand. But with Mark, deviating from the law, they understand that he must continue to run. So the short date between Mark and Daria is quite spicy, because it cannot turn into a full-fledged novel. <br /> <br /> Zabriski Point was an Eraser in the early 70s. Both films have an unmatched, vague quality, as well as complex meanings and characters. Fréchette was as reckless as his character in this film. A few years after the creation of Zabriski Point, Frechette robbed a bank in real life. While serving his sentence, Mark died a shameful death. He was killed weighing 150 pounds, which fell on him during weightlifting. <br /> <br /> The best in this film - great cinematography and special visual effects. Incredible, slow-moving scenes of debris floating in the air after the explosion were a brilliant blow. Although Zabriski Point was not a breakthrough film like The Light Horseman, it still resonated in the counterculture of the early 1970s. I recommend this for those who love avant-garde films, showing upheavals, youth uprisings in the early 70s.
