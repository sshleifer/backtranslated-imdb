When I saw this movie, I was stunned that it was a great movie. This is the only film that I would give 10 stars. I am sure that this film will always be in my best 5. <br /> <br /> The acting is great. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet at their best. I don't think anyone could have a better job than Kate. <br /> <br /> If it's a rainy day and you can't decide what to shoot, well, this one. You'll love all the action, special effects and more. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, you can rent it or buy it right now !!! You will not regret it. <br /> <br />
