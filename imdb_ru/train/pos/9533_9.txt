It could not have been better. Strong restrictions on the expressions of Mike Sullivan could not be depicted otherwise. Tom Hanks provides the best performance in his career. Young Tyler Hoechlin is driving an emotional wheel; play the main role of the character for the story. And veteran Paul Newman for a long time gives one of his best characters. <br /> <br /> This film is based on the bold graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Pierce Rayner. This is the story of a father and son, which mainly involves two candidates who are not suitable for these roles. Mike Sullivan did not have a father as a child, so John Rooney accepted him. Being a generous man, Mr. Rooney was involved in organized crime. Therefore, the debt of Sullivan had to be repaid only for participation in the business. Now Sullivan has a wife and two children, and he is trying to ensure the safety of his children, but at the same time pay off the boss. Subsequent events will test Sullivan's loyalty and accept the fate of his family. <br /> <br /> With the great adaptation of David Sela, dialogue rarely comes out, but it is still very virtuous. The story unfolds in the beautiful setting of the 1930s (Brilliant Art Direction by Richard L. Johnson and Nancy Haig), covered with dark rainy (snow on the ground) exterior. The plot is based on a wonderful Irish score by Thomas Newman, based only on necessity. <br /> <br /> But the most important technical element of the film is Conrad L. Hall’s beautiful photo. This is one of the best cinematic pictures I've ever seen; and I watch a lot of movies. The scene where Mike and Michael are sitting in the car and entering Chicago is impressive. The shot starts from the front of the car, showing Mike (Hanks) through the windshield. Subsequently, he turns to the car to see Michael (Hohlin) wake up and look out the window. As he continues, he transports sideways and leans back, completely surrounding the car, and reveals the magnificent scenic Chicago of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> With an excellent cast and film crew, the main character creates a brazenly amazing film. I'm talking about Sam Mendes, who debuted in 1999 at American Beauty. (He won various awards). Before “American Beauty,” Mendez worked as a director at the British Theater, but he decided that he wanted to say that there was nothing new in the theater for him. With just two films, Sam Mendes noted himself in my book as one of the great directors (there are about twenty-five in the list). <br /> <br /> The film illuminates the brazen genre, which has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly. Photography, action and history are phenomenal. I'm still waiting for Scorseza Gangs in New York, but now I’m completely sure that this is the Best Film of the Year. Considering that this is a competition (Signs, Insomnia, Minority Report), this is a strong statement.
