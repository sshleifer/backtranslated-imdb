I really loved this movie. It made me guess until the very end what would happen. One of the best films about the section that I have seen. Urmila Matondkar is also great. This is one of the most personal and practical films that I have seen on the section. This is a bit less mainstream than Gadar, and in fact itâ€™s an emotional rollercoaster when you start with one opinion about what is happening and completely get off the other side. This is not the typical Bollywood fare, but rather an art house movie. The best part of this film is that it does not deprive human nature of one of the parties to the conflict sections, focusing on the history of the other. He does not blame or condemn, but allows you to draw your own conclusions about things.
