Gary Busey - the main character, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, your reckless police officer of the standard release, who got his nickname because no matter how many bullets he takes (38 and believes), he never stops chasing the bad guys. <Br /> <br /> When an advanced American tank, dubbed the "Lightning Strike", is shipped across the border into Mexico, it is captured by revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogado (Rene Henriques) and Libyan Colonel Carthife (Henry Silva), joins himself with Russian villains. The involved military personnel are held as prisoners, the main one being Devon Shepard (Darlan Flugel), the former ex-girlfriend of McBain. McBain was then recruited by the army for a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> Busy may not have a physical presence, say, such as Schwarzenegger, who would be another suitable leader for this type of film, but he is a blast like a confident dude who is quick with wise men. Flugel is a great female leader; she not only looks incredibly sexy, but also makes an elegant babe. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez and always welcome William Smith (as a Russian major) are disgusting scum in the tradition of the classic action movie. Auxiliary cast is full of familiar and reliable characters: L.Q. Jones R.G. Armstrong, Talmus Rasoulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. <br /> <br /> T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman is delivering a screenplay based on the story of Lankford and veteran director Fred Olen Ray. This is the scenario when you just know that writers have a tongue in their cheeks: they know that their material is absurd and stupid, and just have fun, throwing trust into the window. Veteran militant Steve Carver keeps him in motion and provides a decent amount of shooting, explosions and general lawlessness. <br /> <br /> “Bulletproof” is good fun for an action movie fan who doesn't mind turning off their brains from time to time just to enjoy a generous assortment of violence and humor. <br /> <br /> 7/10
