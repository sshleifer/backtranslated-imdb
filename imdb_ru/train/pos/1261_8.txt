I really liked this movie. All three stars (Connery, Fishburn, and Underwood) give credible performances, and Harris gives excellent results. The lighting and shooting angles in some scenes of Harris make his face truly devilish. An amazing plot twist at the end makes it interesting. Not a great movie, but a nice one. I gave it 7 out of 10.
