I watched this movie on Friday, April 7th. I did not see the last scene (because I was talking to my brother and mother-in-law at the same time). Can anyone tell me what happened to her? I slightly noticed that her husband heard someone talking to his wife in the bedroom, and then he opened the door, she was already dead. <br /> <br /> What happened to her? She killed herself? How could she organize everything, for example, phone calls, and she was at home when her husband was talking to this strange fan? Can anyone please explain to me. I'm so curious !! (In the end, I read that she suffered from multiple personality disorder). <br /> <br /> Thanks before.
