The unique, slow, interesting erotic thriller with a lot of graphic and "blasphemous" scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers. However, even it will be difficult for them not to appreciate the few figurative episodes that this film contains, or to ignore Krabbe's first-class work. Verhoeven supports intriguing ambivalence throughout the film, playing with a sense of the hero's visions. Unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes, everything becomes blurry, and the unsatisfactory ending is definitely not as good as in the rest of the film. (***)
