This is a great shortstop. I think every voice is made by Jason Steele. (You can only say if you heard his normal voice, so do not worry that they sound the same. They do not.) It takes about 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Edward Spatula wages war against spoons and meets strange people. in fact, everyone he knows seems pretty crazy. <br /> <br /> "Edward!" "General Peterson, we must take you to the medical department!" "No, I won't do it Edward." "Don't say that, I'm sure you'll be fine." "I'm down and out Edward, and you know that. Before I go," "yes?" "Can I just ... one kiss?" "um, no." "Come on, only one, small, bite on the lips?" "I'm leaving now, sir. <br /> <br /> There will be a film soon. The date for this is in September, but it will probably be moved back.
