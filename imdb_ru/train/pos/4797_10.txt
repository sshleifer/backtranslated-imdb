I have always been a fan of David Lynch, and with this film Lynch proved to critics that he has the talent, style and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surrealistic aura of which he has become known in the last decade. No matter how the film is rated on the G scale, this is pure Lynch in style, rhythm and tone. The film moves at a virtuoso hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is awesome, as you would expect from a Lynch movie, and the transient editing sequences are breathtaking. It is also very nice to see a film in which all the characters are friendly, kind-hearted people, and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as “good” or “evil.” <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth turns into a beautiful performance, like other actors, primarily Sissy Spacek in the charming role of his daughter and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely important role. <br /> <br /> In this film, David Lynch turned out to be a critic that he could make a powerful moving film, as in the 80s with Blue Velvet and The Elephant Man. Critics seemed to have lost faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me and Lost Highway, but in this film he showed that there was a method for FWWM and LH, and it looks as if the Critics finally understood his recent film Mulholland Drive, given the high rating he received, and the Oscar nomination for Lynch. <br /> <br /> “Straight Story” for me is one of the most touching movies that I’ve ever seen. This is a love story about family, friendship and kindness of strangers. I highly recommend it.
