With a very fast intersection of scenes of insane people in a shelter, as well as with mounting / overlaying images and vague, intertwined narrations, this is a very complex film. Apparently, the man (Masu Inoue) gets a job as a janitor or janitor in a shelter so that he can be near his imprisoned wife and possibly save her. But she is clearly crazy, huddled on the floor, with free expression most of the time and fear, suffering and confusion, written on her face the rest of the time. The cinematographer sometimes switches to her point of view, and we see her vague images on the edge of a pond, a drowning child, or a gripping drowned man. She's tortured with something. When the point of view passes to her or other crazy people, the director uses distorting lenses and the like, showing us what crazy people see, and then how they react. And the place is teeming with crazy people, laughing, hiding and in one case dancing furiously day and night. At some point, the man is trying to get his wife out on the street, but the night outside the door terrifies her and she runs back to his cell. Gradually, the man plunges into a nightmare in which he is interrupted in another attempt to steal her, and he kills the doctor and many of the attendants, and all this time crazy people laugh and applaud. When he wakes up, he feels relieved and wipes the floor. Some breathtaking footage of the lives of Japanese, streets, buildings of the 1920s.
