What I expected: a rather lame overly stereotypical image of a crazy sports guy and an equally lame stereotypical image of a girl who loves him, but still suffers, being the second banana because of his overly zealous support of his favorite sports team. <br /> <br /> What I got: an impartial story in which both the boy and the girl eventually admit - to themselves and to each other - that each of them has passions in life, but everyone can forgive each other so that save the love they share. <br /> <br /> It sounds sad, but with unrestrained humor and amazing actions this story works! Barrymore is the classic Barrymore: the perfect combination of sweet, strong and delicious. We expect her and her to get rid of. <br /> <br /> But Fallon is a pleasant surprise in this film. He brings to the role of the perfect combination of sports nut, combined with an understanding of normal things in life, such as taking care of children and his girlfriend. Fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection. He can be caring ("You just ran after me across the field!") And at the same time, unwittingly being blinded by his love for the Red Sox ("How did the grass feel? What sponge?") At the same time. Image Fallon "made" the film. We hope that this film marks the beginning of a better career in the film for Fallon, which goes beyond the excessive humorous humor typical of SNL graduates (for example, Will Ferrell). <br /> <br /> In short, a film that may have been the victims of stereotypical male and female characters who have risen above this limitation and providing non-stop dotted humorous lines, most of which were delivered with brilliant subtlety by Fallon. <br /> <br /> Hey, I saw this with my wife - not a baseball fan - and she loved him as much as I did. This is not “Guy Flick” or “Chick Flick”. This is a terrific funny movie. Go look!
