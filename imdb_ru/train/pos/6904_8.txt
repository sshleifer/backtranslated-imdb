This is one of the few films that I can watch again and again. If you have never seen it, try it. Richard Dreyfus and Raul Julia are beautiful together, and although the film is very amusing, it reminds me of Julia's untimely death. This is a good opportunity to relax and laugh at international intrigue, which is too great for us in these times of terror and fear.
