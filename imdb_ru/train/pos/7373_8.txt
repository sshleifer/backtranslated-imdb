Before commenting regularly, my main curiosity about the fact that THIS IS NOT A SONG OF LOVE is that, although the playing time on the IMDb is 94 minutes, the Wellspring Media DVD in the USA runs 88 minutes. Any input is welcome! <br /> <br /> Two friends with a very hard life go on a journey for adventure. What they finish is just that, with one randomly shooting a girl, and the two run away on foot to the countryside. The film is complicated not just by a big chase, but by the fact that the stupid and childish Spike behaves inadequately and squeezes his boom box like a teddy bear. Some viewers may not like the story based solely on Spike's character, but without some disappointment added to the story, the film would be too easy. You will notice how the more stable character Heaton calls Spike a “big man,” as opposed to Spike's attitude and behavior, “out of control”. To be honest, I was also aggravated by Spike's ridiculous actions, especially the fact that he was sniffing the spray can, but in a desperate situation it was obvious that someone from his mentality would have chosen temporary salvation. But Heaton was there to keep things in check until everything went over and his head. <br /> <br /> Kenny Glenan, because Heaton is a miracle, and after a while I stopped wondering why the hell he would want to take Spike out of prison and continue the friendship, thanks to the excellent performance of Glenaan. After all, during their run, there are many reasons why the Heaton should leave Spike and try to save himself. I believe that Heaton felt like Spike as his elder protective brother, and it’s hard to break loyalty between them until everything is too desperate. <br /> <br /> Although some of the cinematography is really fanciful, they do offer more flavor to the story, and not just shots of men running through the desert. Beautiful landscapes, rain and vast gray skies create a gloomy tone that enhances the feeling of tragic circumstances. The score is also unusual, and the use of the song Public Image Ltd. “This is not a love song” and the title of the film is pretty clever. <br /> <br /> In general, this is understandable if you do not care that THIS IS NOT A SONG OF LOVE, as it focuses on two contrasting personalities fleeing from another person who decided to hunt them down (plays cool, quiet David Bradley). This is not a high-budget entertainment action. For the rest of us who like to look for something minimal and dramatic, it's worth the time and it offers some extremely tense moments when you hold your breath a little. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy films coming out of Scotland lately, with the likes of this, Dog Soldiers, and the Devil's Tattoo. I am also a little grateful for the subtitles offered on this DVD, as accents are sometimes lightning-fast and difficult for some viewers like me to understand. <br /> <br /> Frustrating, dark and often tense, THIS IS NOT A SONG OF LOVE - a very tragic, but exciting story. <br /> <br />
