So-so thriller with Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis starring, who, along with David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes go on a journey to the west. The last couple explores the sites of the notorious murder for a future book; Pitt is a serial killer on the run (unknown to Dave), and Juliet is his poor, not everyone has a companion there. This is a good cast, and the story is moving forward, but Pitt is not so scary as a serial killer, although it is one of his best early roles. The best thing here is Michelle Forbes, who always manages to express herself, whether in her roles in Murder: Life on the Street or in the short series Wonderland. <br /> <br /> Vote: 6
