In all the comments praising or cursing Dalton's performance, I thought he was excellent. He plays Rochester not as a spoiled pretty rich boy, but as a fraud, a strong man. I liked this version, although the snapshot in the video was sometimes distracting, and the scenes with Jane and St. John never became quite gel-like. I give it 8.
