I LOVE Jack's jokes, such as “Cliche is ...” or “Above, a guy with a cliche, black, oily skin, a bit like a ghost ...”. He's just fun! Daniel starts to catch up with him! Well, that Jack is no longer in the team (in a sense), otherwise it would be sarcasm mania !!!! I just love all the plots (season 8, a little less, I have to admit), the characters are great, the actors are great, I start picking up facial expressions (and even more) from Jack, Daniel and Til'k ... It's just theoretically possible and exciting ... oops! I go to them again !!! Sorry, I'm also starting to take Carter’s traits, and it all drives my parents crazy NUTZ !!!!!!! Well, in conclusion, I think it's good for the next three seasons or so, especially if they continue to pack episodes with all this humor, drama, action, and so on !!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! !
