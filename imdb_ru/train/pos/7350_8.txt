Well, I was a teenager when I watched the movie ... the songs were a huge hit, but the elite class missed Govinda’s films then because they watched Govinda’s and Karishma’s films (otherwise known as Charisma), not suitable for this “class”, but in any Many people liked this event, as the series of these films shook the 90s, and most of them were successful ... today I watched it again after a long time and remembered that there was a long line of people and a riot that they created when Aa e uo oo song appeared on the screen ... Govinda and Karishma dresses were complementary one another (the worst training duo of that time), and Karisma was transformed in the late 90s, but Govinda was still very loyal to his designer, as his feeling of clothes remains the same ... but then everything mixed up, everything was fine .. everything worked, and gradually the elite class realized what it lacked, and then ..... there was no looking back for this jodi, because it continued to force those Indians to continue the series ... hated by few but loved masses. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good time, when you have nothing to rent or watch on TV, I do not think you will regret it ... but remember this is the worst at its best. <br /> <br /> I still watch these films when I have time, because I can't stop laughing ... so I say that to go ahead and have a good time, because there are times when we all I love stupidity, and especially when it is done by the kings of their time, it is certainly watchable ... I recommend it to all movie lovers ...
