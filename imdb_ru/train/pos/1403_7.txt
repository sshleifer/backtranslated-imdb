Paul Verhoeven (a genius and a master of cinematographers) strikes back with a less-than-perfect, but still cheerful in the “dirty image of an old man,” Empty Man. The first two acts are so good that the last act of the slasher is disappointing. Nevertheless, I give recommendations to this film about his special effects MIND BLOWING (possibly the best in the history) and two great presentations of the presenters. Verhoeven's moral questions, of course, raise doubts, and although the film has turned off many, this film is rather soft for old Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Two major flaws: Josh Brolin (he is a walking man-monkey) and the whole deal with the elevator. If there was a ladder for access, why were they trapped in the lab? <br /> <br /> Happy horror movie for Saturday night.
