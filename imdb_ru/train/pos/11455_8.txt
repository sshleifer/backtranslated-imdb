This German documentary in English tells about a Scottish environmental sculptor named Andy Goldsworthy. He makes art from objects that he finds in nature. For example, at the beginning of the film we see how it takes pieces of icicles and “sticks” them together with a small amount of moisture into a serpentine shape, which seems to constantly pass through a vertical rock. <br /> <br /> Of course, the icicles melt, but this transience is part of most of Goldsworthy's work. He goes to the site and feels it, intuitively deciding what to do on that day. He speaks of a “dialogue” with stones and other materials with which he works, trying to work * with *, and not against them. These can be stones, flowers, leaves or sticks. The sculpture may last for minutes or years, or it may not last long enough for it to be finished and photographed. Work seems to be a process rather than a goal. <br /> <br /> Film and work are beautiful, inspiring and make you think. It moves rather slowly, which is suitable for the material, but you should definitely go when you sleep well at night. But if you have such an opportunity, go. <br /> <br /> Find other pages about Andy Goldsworthy on the Internet or read about his local sculpture at Stanford University. There are also several books with photographs of his sculptures. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: skip this part if you want to know what this film means to you completely independently. I remember a couple of ideas that came to me while watching a movie, and I shared them with those who are still reading. First, the transient nature of most Andy Goldsworthy works reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life. We are born, we live, and in the end we die. This is natural, and this, of course, is also part of the art of Goldsworthy. <br /> <br /> Another thought was stunned by how Goldsworth managed to so carefully integrate his passion and his work into his life. Most of us have work that is tolerant at best, a life that we barely notice, and passions for which we really want to spend more time, even if we remember them. Andy Goldsworthy managed to create a mixture of all these aspects of his life, which looks like it works very well and feeds him and others. Wow. <br /> <br /> Seen 8/28/2002.
