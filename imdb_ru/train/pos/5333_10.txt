As it did not become a cult film, I do not know. I think it was sadly ignored as a really brilliant comedy! <br /> <br /> “A quick car” is trying to impersonate a fast-paced thriller, but with the quality of the game (oh God, this is bad), the storyline, the practicality of the demonic possession of the car and the scene of the evacuation of the child are all you can , is to laugh. And you will laugh. Films are made to entertain us, and the extent to which they do this may indicate the value of the film. This film is the pinnacle of entertainment, I laughed from start to finish. At some point I caught my breath and I almost choked, in some moments it is really funny. When the child was lifted through the air from the hatch in the luggage compartment in a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant speed identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plane, which meant that the hook did not tear the roof of the car to pieces. I laughed hysterically. But when the child began to swing in the air, he almost hit the bridge and almost got entangled in the tree, tears flowed down my face. <br /> <br /> It also occurred to me that the black policeman was the guy who played Jesus in Madonna’s Like a Prayer clip. It seems to be everywhere.
