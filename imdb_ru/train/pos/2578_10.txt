“Superman” and “The Mole” are perhaps the most difficult adventures of Superman. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent go to Silsby, where the deepest oil well in the world is located. While there, some oil moles pass through an oil well and explore the city. Jeff Corey and many other townspeople are trying to get rid of the invading moles. Can Superman change people in time to save the moles? Can Superman warn people about the radioactive danger of moles in time? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Superman and Mole is a very smart, well-written and well-played film. Despite the fact that we see how Superman flies only once, it still makes a great adventure Superman. Be sure to take a look. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Stars
