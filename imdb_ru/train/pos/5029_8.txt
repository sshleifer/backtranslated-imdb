I entered this movie, perhaps a little exhausted by hacked movies that are widespread today on screen. Boy, I was surprised. This little treasure was pleasant with a gloomy, dark atmosphere. Even more surprising was the fact that a very limited amount of blood was actually shown. As with most good films, this leaves something for the imagination, and Bill Paxton did an excellent job with directing. The scenes shot inside the car were done well, and after watching the scene anatomy episode at the end of the videotape it was good to see that some of the subtle but wonderful things I noticed were deliberate and not just “Oh, that looks good, hold it ". This is a moody film, filled with gloom. However, for a dark object, much of it is filmed in daylight, even some of the more disturbing scenes. The acting is exceptional (well, I've always been a Powers Booth fan), and never overplayed. Au Contraire, this is very muffled, which works very well for this type of film. If there is any area in which this film is missing, then it is in the final, which seems a bit far-fetched, but still works at a simpler level, without destroying the mood or idea of ​​the film. What is this message? This is what each person decides for himself. In general, on a scale of 1 to 10, this film is rated at 8 points for those who love the genre of southern Gothic (for example, Body Heat or Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil), and about 5 points for those who don’t loves "t.
