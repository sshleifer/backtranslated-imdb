Henri Verney's film may not be as well known as Parallax View, Condor's 3 Days or Kennedy, but certainly not worse, and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre. The action takes place in a fictional western state where a fictional president was killed. After several years of investigation, a special government commission decides that the president was killed by a lonely gunman. But one person, Prosecutor Volney, played by Yves Montand, thinks there is something else to be investigated, and so the film begins. This film is not related to some exact theories, but it covers the whole structure of relations between the government and society in the modern world. Such a film could be made only in the 1970s, but it will never lose its relevance. In addition, it is even a little scary how accurate these oracles are. 10 out of 10.
