I caught this movie on T.V. Last night, and you know that Danny Masterson was a pretty good actor in a film, and it's great to see him in something different than in the 70s show. The film is not rated, but in my opinion, I would rate it (R) only because of the nude nature and the large amount of content for adults. But overall, I loved it; I thought the Wisecracks mud was pretty funny. It's just mostly about a guy who doesn't have a job, a girlfriend or money, and, in the end, he gets a job as a private investigator (actually, rather, a messenger). People who really should help him. I give it .... *** 3 stars.
