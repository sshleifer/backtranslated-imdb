Unfortunately, many consumers who write reviews for IMDb, equate low budget to bad. Whatever this film takes, a larger budget is not really a part of it. Big sets and lots of special effects would turn this into another Lara Croft film. We have a step or two better than that. <br /> <br /> Almost unknown to Alexandra Staden fascinates with mysterious modesty, and this is extremely important for the work of this film. Her wise little smiles and lucid looks are huge, and you will find that you want the camera not to put an end to her face. This makes it possible that the bad guy Nikolai, who is also played by the little-known (at least in the USA) Nikolay Coaster-Waldau, may show an extraordinarily cerebral interest in her, which modesty can take advantage of. She is able to distract him by raping her with just a jerk and spitting out: "Stop wasting my time!" then rages between his heavily armed but suddenly insecure minions. Creating such a believable scene does not happen by chance. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem I face with a slim Staden playing “Modesty” is that she is not very likely to go hand in hand with an athletic and muscular guy like Coaster-Waldau and beat him up. She is simply not Peta Wilson or a pumped up actress like Hilary Swank who can deliver a convincing blow. Coaster-Waldau, allowing himself to overcome the Staden, looks like he is just cursing with his younger sister. <br /> <br /> Since this is not an action movie, this is not a big disadvantage. I just hope they can do it better if and when they do the follow up.
