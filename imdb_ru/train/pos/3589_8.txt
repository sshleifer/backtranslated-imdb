I liked this film, and after watching it, I wondered how much Caitlin Rose existed in the world. How many other girls have been subjected to this kind of sexual abuse and torture by classmates and were too scared to open their mouths about it? How threatening and cruel adolescents can be to each other, because, as this film shows, it does not matter who is right, who is more popular, and who is afraid, that he manipulates the minds of young people and influences them to allow such immorality. . Tiffany Amber Thyssen in the role of a rape victim demonstrates a powerful performance, and Brian Austin Green convincingly portrays a guy torn between a girl he considered favorite and his best friend. deserves. Wonderful, and brilliant, too good to be just a film made for television.
