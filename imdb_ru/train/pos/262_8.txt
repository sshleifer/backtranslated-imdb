*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This film "The Divers" is really interesting. All I knew about this was that it would include Nazi history, underwater scenes, and everyone would speak Danish. But I decided to check it out for one reason: the fact that the story develops around a sunken German submarine from the Second World War. I have a fetish on German submarines, especially on sunken ships. Therefore, I was a bit skeptical about the Danish part, but decided that the subwoofer could weigh this part. Knowing that Scandinavian films are not always so good and not sure about the size of the budget, I was at least very skeptical. <br /> <br /> When I was watching, I was ... surprised. <br /> <I thought that the actors are inadequate, seeing how some of them are very young, especially the two main actors. This was not a problem, they both work very well. Like other actors, who mostly consist of people over 50 years old. This creates an interesting interaction between young and old, which is not often seen on the screen. In any case, not unique, but somewhat rare. And it's all good. <br /> <br /> With regard to the Danish language, it is almost impossible to understand. But it was not a problem, she had subtitles. <br /> <br /> Another problem was the submarine itself, I suspected that there would be both internal shots and submarine external underwater shots. Having decided that their budget is small, I thought that at best it could be adequate, and at worst - just awful. Again I was surprised, the outer scenes of the ruin are beautiful, and the inner scenes are very realistic. Having a fetish for German subwoofers, I knew how the subwoofer should look, especially inside, and I was not let down. The team conducted a serious study. This is all good. <br /> <br /> I suspect that more people than me will watch this film only to see some scenes of debris, so I feel I have to issue a “warning”. The submarine in the film is not a real model that existed during the war. This is a special purpose submachine. But to give you a hint of what to expect, this is the intersection between type VII, type IX and a Japanese transport submarine, similar to I-52. He has a good design, and he makes a crash. <br /> <br /> Located on a Danish island or peninsula, I can't remember. Summer and two brothers go to grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer, like every year. Their grandfather is a kind of sailor. The cinematography is rather pleasant, there are a lot of pretty summer scenes on the island’s docks, some new-found teenage love, good diving weather and a general feeling of “ideality”. Once again, it's all good. <br /> <br /> With the plot on the island there are suspicious visitors, a group of people hires one of the boats, the old minesweeper and his crew. One of the visitors, a man of about 50, has a German eagle and a swastika tattooed on his back. All the elderly inhabitants of the island remember when the German submarine was sunk near the end of the Second World War, and since then rumors of Nazi gold have been circulating in the depths. Grandfather was one of the young men who were looking for a sunken submarine soon after the German bodies began to swim on the coast in 1945. The submarine was not found. <br /> <br /> WHAT TO EXPECT <br /> <br /> The key elements are Nazi experiments, Nazi history, treasure hunting, secrecy, competition, teenage love, conspiracy and ... surprise. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING - SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> I did not expect that some elements of the supernatural appear in this film, and it caught me by surprise. Not being a big fan of supernatural events, he nevertheless fit in well with history and presents no problems. It is not like From Dusk Till Dawn, when everyone turns into vampires by the end. This is a little more subtle. <br /> <br /> Overall: a really good movie, I gave it 8. Some because it is not a Hollywood movie with unlimited resources. I later learned that he had a fair budget, and that some of the actors were experienced Danish veterans. But even if it was a Hollywood performance, I would give it 7 or 8. Definitely worth it. Yes, children's story in a sense, but again a mature tale. It has a lot of expectation and a great aura of adventure, which seemed to me very attractive. And, again, the cinema is really good. <br /> <br /> / Medusa 2001 <br /> <br />
