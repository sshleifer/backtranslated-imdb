LOVE ON TOP is a completely wrong American name for the excellent French film Le Mouton Enrage (which I think Mad Sheep) is such an original film, the fact that it goes back to 1974 seems to be all more striking. This film is far ahead of its time; even by today's highest standards, he performs things that seem rich and new. Filmed by Michel Deville, an extremely underestimated director, he is rather indescribable because he combines social criticism, comedy, riddle, love, sex and satire into one completely original mix - leaving the main but delicate surprise to the end to make it all gone. earlier suddenly sad and more understandable. The cast is great, the same goes for the writing and the theme. But this is Deville's delightful tone, which keeps you constantly unbalanced, but delighted that this “lost” film takes you to a very high level. (A written interview with the director in the Features section on a DVD is definitely worth reading if you have time.)
