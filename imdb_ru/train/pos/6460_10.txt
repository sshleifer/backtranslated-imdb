If the screenwriter and director intended to open their hearts with the film, as the musician wanted to do with his music, they would succeed with me. Ordinary human situations became original, personal and immediate, so I personally felt a touch on each situation. I believe that I would believe in the power of music combined with the point of view of the person writing the film. Without spoiling, I can say that I was very touched by the filmâ€™s approach to life. In fact, did not cry because of what joy? empathy? just deep emotions? in a very long time. I would like to find a way to show it to others. Saw it at the Seattle International Film Festival.
