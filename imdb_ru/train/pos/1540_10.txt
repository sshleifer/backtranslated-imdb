This is an incredible movie. I can't remember the last time I watched a Swedish movie with this layer. This is ridiculous, tragic, irresistible, and most of all it is a piece of Swedish life in a small town. He crushes clichés and lives deeper. It makes you feel connected not only with the main characters, but with all the characters. <br /> <br /> A girl from a big city goes back to her roots, to her little hometown, to celebrate her father’s 70th birthday, crossing paths that she hasn’t met for several years. Although the story itself is not unique, it offers a new approach. In the center of the story - the relationship between the three sisters (at different stages of life), which are not very close. Or at least you do not understand how close they are. <br /> <br /> One of the key reasons why it is so easy to communicate with people from this film is impeccable cast. First, I am more than pleased with the fact that there are absolutely no so-called Swedish actors in this film. Usually there are several actors who can find their way in almost all major productions in Sweden. This time, the production company managed to preserve its reality, hiring actors who really love their profession. Sophia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress after Eva Rose, who proved that you don't need words to convey emotion. <br /> <br /> Scripture is also very attractive. The dialogue is more than believable, and he is ahead of miles compared to other Swedish films of the past year or two. Maria Blom controls everything from the very beginning, and if you didn’t know, you would never have guessed that she was the first to write and shoot a full-length film. I can't wait for her next one. <br /> <br /> As soon as you start watching this, you really want to see it through.
