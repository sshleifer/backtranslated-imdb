Kolchak was a show that really didn't fit into any category. Partly horror, partly comedy, some social awareness, and what we have is what I think people were not ready for. It really is a shame that when I started watching these shows on the Chiller network (I never saw the originals), I realized how different and interesting it was. <br /> <br /> Starring Darren McGavin as Kolchak, International News Service reporter, and Simon Auckland as his always evil boss Tony Vincenzo, the show followed the exploits of the Chicago news reporter, who most often became the part of the story, when he searched in the windy city of modern creepy beetles that stumble overnight. McGavin's genuine charm really sets the show apart. Somewhat silly guy who always wears the same costume, you can't not love him. His jokes are great, and the back between him and Auckland's skeptical editor is completely funny. <br /> <br /> The stories are mostly pretty good, and the acting is very good. The 70s were not * a great * period for special effects, and the show suffers because of it, but if you stop disbelief, you will have a funny series that is ahead of its time.
