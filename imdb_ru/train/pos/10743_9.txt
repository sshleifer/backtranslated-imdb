I read most of the comments here. I came to the conclusion that almost everyone agrees that September 11 is a shocking piece of history. Some people think that the added narration is weak, and I agree that the narration is weak and unnecessary. About two brothers who found each other after the disaster, and a hanger for rocks about Tony. But I do not think that the story is not needed. Like many theorists, I think our own life is a story. We live and do our own autobiography. Therefore, if we tell about our life, it is always in the form of a narration. We do not summarize such facts as: Birth, Childhood, High School, etc. We create a story about our life. <br /> <br /> Since we are familiar with the stories, we want to include the story in the story. Because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves. We can better understand what happened in the story when it is told in the form of a story. That is the purpose of adding a story to a documentary. The story is weak, so be it, but we understand what is happening. If it was me, I would worry about my brother. <br /> <br /> And the second point is to make a film about this blockbuster. True, it was recently to come up with a great film about 9/11. Although, there was a little about the subject, but none of them like this documentary. But what if the film appears in 5 years? I agree that it is wrong to try to make a lot of money on 9/11. But I also agree that films are one of the best ways to tell a story. How many WWII movies have we seen? If I had not seen these films, my view on WW would have completely changed me. I remember seeing the Schindler List, and I cried for an hour during class. The films give you a good idea of ​​what happened in the story, and while this is fiction, they contribute to the memory of disasters and victims. <br /> <br /> So, my point of view: telling stories is not always bad, it makes us identify with the story and never forget what happened.
