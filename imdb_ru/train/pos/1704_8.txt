“I moved here to get away from such things!” The sheriff in a small town complains. <br /> <br /> "Does it happen often in Chicago?" His deputy asks. <br /> <br /> No, not really. The plot is that the Martians group mistakenly accepts Orson Welles' Halloween Wars of the Worlds re-broadcast as an account of the real Martian invasion, and concludes that they should participate in the action! Below is a bunch of failures associated with the Martianist’s random attempts to conquer the city of Big Bean, Illinois. All come to the conclusion that they are children in really nice costumes, with the exception of the sheriff’s daughter and her friend, a child in a duck costume. <br /> <br /> The Martians themselves are ridiculous, and you have the impression that they do not pose a threat to anyone but themselves rather early. This is a fun family movie.
