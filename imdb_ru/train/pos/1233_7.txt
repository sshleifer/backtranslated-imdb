Strange role for Eddie Murphy in the midst of his career. Although there are a lot of “Eddie Murphy characters” in him, he plays a really decent person. The rest of the cast is good, especially the beautiful Charlotte Lewis. The beauty and serenity of her character kept the tone of the film from becoming too big Murphy.
