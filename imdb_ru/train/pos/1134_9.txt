The only role that is missing in this film is that of Shu as a daughter who wants to follow in the footsteps of her “aunt” as a daytime soap star. Otherwise it would be a perfect 10. <br /> <br /> It seems that every actor enjoyed his roles and replayed to fulfill his own pleasure, as well as the script - I have to wonder if there was a bit ad ad ing 'Occurs in parts. It was a good cast, and there are a few classic lines that will stay with you. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic film that everyone should see at least once. I would recommend not to drink anything that could cause a burning sensation in your nose. <br /> <br /> You will certainly want to look closely at the last scene, Nurse Nan has a little secret that she would not share with you. <br /> <br /> If you love day soap or despise it, this step teaches in all the right places.
