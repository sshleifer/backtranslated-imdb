This highly derivative film will be interesting for many who have not yet seen some obscure anime films. I enjoyed most of this, especially after the rather flat minutes of opening at the museum (although the pre-title sequence is very interesting and includes some of the best animation bits) James Garner as the commander and Leonard Nimoy as the king give impressive results.
