The 14-year-old in me is immensely happy that now they can make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they are all enraged, that with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia make a lot of cash at the box office. This year we will see (and have already seen) a few more, especially the “Golden Compass”, which presents the most exciting trailer I have seen this year. Star Dust, based on Neil Guyman’s novel, appeared this week in theaters with a slightly louder sound. I have not seen any previews for this, just a few commercials. A critical reaction like blah. I would not even see this if it were not for the fact that I need to wait for a friend to see the Bourne ultimatum, and that nothing interesting had been revealed this weekend. Well, if you forgive a horrible play on words, the stars must have been properly aligned because I went to Star Dust, and I liked it. This is not a huge movie like The Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your most basic fantasy quest (the hero goes in search of a fallen star), filled with obstacles. But within this basic outline, the story is lively and creative. It's just a desire to be a fun and charming little novel. And it works great. There were a lot of big movies this summer, but none of them was as fun as this one. There is a lot going on there, but the story is well told and almost completely consistent. This is not a masterpiece, but it can definitely occupy the same soil as something like “Princess Brides” (although I don’t like it as much as in the previous film). It's great fun here if you're a fan of the genre.
