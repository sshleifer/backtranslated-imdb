Much richer in texture and character than even the classics of the 30s and 50s. George S. Scott was born to be Scrooge, just as he was born to be Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. Scrooge's character as Mr. Scott seemed to jump out of the screen. Scott, as Scrooge, displayed a richer, stronger, and at the same time more deeply exciting Scrooge than any of his predecessors as the meanest man in London of the 18th century. Mr. Scott seemed to lead Scrooge to a more personal, understandable, but at the same time highly controversial level; his role was played with great prestige, which Scott always brought to the screen: yet his usual warlike voice was sometimes whispered, almost like a monologue, because in one breath he would have scolded the Christmas holidays, but still revealed his own human weakness line. He could portray the sour and crunchy Scrooge and the misunderstood, sympathetic Scrooge in one scene. <br /> <br /> A truly remarkable performance by the giant of his generation.
