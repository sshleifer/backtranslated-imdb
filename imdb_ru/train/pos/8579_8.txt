Plot: The crime lord unites 3 different mafias into an enterprise to buy an island, which will then serve as a means of money laundering for organized crime. To prevent this, the FBI is trying to destroy one of the mafia lords. Everything goes wrong, and according to some unexpected plot twists, we are presented with another film “Policemen who do not like each other”: one is an FBI agent, the other is a former DEA agent. . <br /> <br /> So far so stupid. But the strength of this film is not in its history - at best, a bad joke. This is ridiculous. (At least there is a synchronized German version). The action is also good, with a memorable scene, including a shotgun and a rocket launcher. But the emphasis is right on humor. Not a smart satire, not quite a slap, but somewhere in the middle you get a lot of funny jokes. <br /> <br /> However, this film is the opposite of political correctness. The abuse of legal drugs appears in a prominent place, without criticism, and even demonstrates it as cool. This is the part of the film that annoyed me a lot and makes it unsuitable for children, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> In general, for a pleasant evening viewing, an acceptable action will come with some funny jokes, this film is perfect. Just remember: in this genre, when you enter a cinema or television room, you usually leave your brain outside the door. Then you will have a good time. 8/10
