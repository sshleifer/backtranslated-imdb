SPOILERS <br /> <br /> According to Jean-Paul Sartre, “Hell is other people.” In “Strange Couple,” Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau demonstrate how accurate this can be. Since Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Mattau, respectively, create two good friends who have decided to live together. As these two become more and more disenchanted with each other, laughter grows thicker and faster before Felix leaves, leaving Oscar altered and more purely individual. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon, like Ungar, is absolutely gorgeous as a neurotic who is obsessed with cleaning, copes with life like a lonely man. Walter Mattau, unlike the Lemmon character, is as good as the sloppy sports writer who just wants to play poker to earn money for child benefits. <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Mattau are great in their chosen parts, in some degree depends on the beautiful script Neil Simon, and at the same time because they work well in a team. Being two friends who differ in their way of life, although they are similar in relations with their former wives and children, these two, later, great actors create a partnership that is almost impossible to recreate. So great that the world screamed so much about something like that, two years before Mattau died and three before Lemmon's death, the characters were reunited in the worst sequel. This idea, although after an annoying Hollywood obsession with sequels, might have worked to some extent, but at the same time, it would never come close to copying the genius of this original film. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is not the case. can really say anything else. With Simon's amazing script, filled with humor and laughter, the creators of this film have already hit the hit. However, the role of Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau in the role of Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison is the most important part of this film. “Strange couple”, with its traditional soundtrack (which even received a tribute in The Simpsons), is an excellent script and ingenious leading people, it is a tribute to cinema and a feature of history that needs to be remembered.
