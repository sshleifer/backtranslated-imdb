Nowadays, it is rare to find a romantic comedy that will not be incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the entire film (for example, Big Fat Greek Wedding; me, me and Irene). In this film, there was only a couple of overly insane jokes, nothing was unceremoniously desecrated. Around it was a cute movie with nice characters. I thought the final was a bit harsh. It seems that they had to end this in the world series in order to truly finish. Acting left much to be desired, but was compensated by the pace of history. If I knew that it was the film of the Farrelli brothers, I would assume that this is a piece of garbage that turns the stomach, and I would not watch it, but it seems that even they can accidentally make a good film. Good for them, I hope they pulled their heads to the end and began to consistently make good films.
