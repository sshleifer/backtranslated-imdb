I could never remember the name of this show. I watch it when I was 8 years old. I remember going to bed late when I didn't have to just watch so that I could watch this show. It was the best show for me. From what I remember about it, it's still great. It showed the main role of Lucas Black, making him the first boy I ever had a crush on. I’m from the country, so I don’t like boys with an accent, but for him I would definitely make an exception. That after you saw “Crazy” in Alabama, “Friday Lights” and “Tokyo Drift”, you should understand why He is a great actor and has been since childhood. I miss this show and want it back. If someone sees where they sell the season, email me. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
