Michael Kakoyanis had a relatively long career, but surprisingly few titles came to his name, including some real pranks, such as the unfamiliar Cold War satire "The Day the Fish Come Out." Iphigenia, however, is the highlight. Adapted from Euripides' play Cacoyannis, it is an excellent transmission of the classic tragedy and has recently made its first television appearance in many years in the USA thanks to the Flix channel. The film was shot on an epic scale, but it is definitely not a “big” film, with an emphasis on a simple story: in prayer to the gods, King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) is forced to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamosh) To the horror of Queen Clytemnastra (Irene Papas). Kazakos and Pappas are both outstanding, but this is a terrific Papamos, who displays the most interesting elements on the screen, mixing the innocence of childhood with the knowledge that she is a pawn in a political game. Highly recommended for fans of international cinema.
