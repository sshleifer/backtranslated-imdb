Silverlake Life is a documentary and it was simple and straightforward. In fact, it was more like home cinema, and if you want dramatic coverage, look for something else. And this is by no means a tear. But I mean it in a positive way. It depicts two men who love each other, and how AIDS affects the quality of their daily lives. It is almost difficult for me to say whether it was a quality film or not, because it was so naked that I had to look for other ways to respond. This is a wonderful film, in fact one of the most wonderful, sincere documents I've ever seen. These two people have incredible integrity, because their life is reduced to the most basic parts. Because of this, the production of "The Hollow Tree" about AIDS seems fashionable and heartless. These people made this film for themselves, which is one of the best reasons for creating something. The scene where Tom sings "You are my sun" to Mark and says goodbye to him is the real thing.
