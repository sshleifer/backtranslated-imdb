From these Pokémon films (which are in order from best to minimum for me): Pokemon The First Movie, Pokemon 4Ever, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 200 and Pokemon: Entei and Unknown, this is probably one of the most environmental-related ones , the most beautiful and most soothing. Whether it's good points for you or not, Pokemon 4Ever still entertains many. <br /> <br /> In addition to the three points discussed above, this Pokémon movie includes a good mood and a good CGI (as well as anime). The theme of the time travel film is presented in a good form, and Team Rocket (comic reliefs / trash villains) ends up with pretty good gags and as a result they become more protagonists than friends. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages, as always, are rather unnecessary violence and action, and the villain is rather uninteresting, even more than a few villains from a Pokémon movie. <br /> <br /> A strange pokemon is being hunted down by a pokemon hunter in the forest. A young boy is trying to save the Pokemon, and it takes him somewhere ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Ash, Brock and Misty enter a large forest ... <br /> <br /> Curious? Watch the rest ... <br /> <br /> Good for all Pokemon fans and “American” anime movies, enjoy “Pokemon 4Ever”! :-)
