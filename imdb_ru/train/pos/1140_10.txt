I have been a fan of this film for many years. Due to the fact that Teri Hatchers came to the fore, I had to take a film from the shelf and watch it. Why didn't people back in 1991 see how wonderful this film was outside of me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are incredible. Although I never watch the daily series, this film kills me every time I watch it. The acting game has no analogues in the comedy, and the script is so smart. I highly recommend that you watch this if you have not already done so. You will see Elizabeth Shu, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher and Carrie Fisher ... and many others ... all give great performances.
