This is such a film that England can make in a dream, and that means that it is a compliment. Due to the success of very British comedies about manners, located at the end or beginning of the twentieth century, in particular, the adaptation of E.M. Forster, this very similar to “Trade Ivory” production was perceived in the light that she brought in 1992. It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson, who appeared in the role of wife Jeremy Irons, who discovered that her husband had the worst novel in Damage, and as an IRA terrorist, who eventually puts on a wig and gets an unpleasant incident in a weeping game. Here she plays a quiet, serene woman at Rose Arbuthnot, who, along with Josie Lawrence, who plays Lottie Wilkins, sets off on a journey full of self-knowledge. They are joined by unlikely couples of women: one Caroline Dester, played by the mysterious Polly Walker, similar to the very vampire Louise Brooks (and not only the hair that she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Pleight). This four will eventually merge together and become deep friends only because the story is so full of spring and a terrific, dreamy sweetness that almost predetermines it, but it is beautiful; This is the film that he wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new for the American audience) fill the cast as husbands of the two main characters, and overall Mike Newell makes a living creature from his film with almost magical elements full of quiet moments and wonder.
