I first saw this film when a few years ago it was broadcast on the now-defunct Trio channel, and recently I watched it again — without advertising — on Sundance. I was impressed for the first time, and found it even more attractive in the second viewing. Yes, some segments are far from perfect - Amos Gitai’s hysterical comment stands out like a sore thumb — but in the aggregate, 11 09 01 is a complete success. The best of the show: the stunning final episode of Shohei Imamura, which modern critics, such as the stupid Mick Lasalle, somehow wrongly interpreted as an attack on the "terrorists", but now it is revealed as a clever anti-war controversy; The introductory part of Samira Makhmalbaf, which manages to combine deep empathy with the victims of 9/11 and serious concern for the children of Afghanistan; and Idrissa Ouedraogo's funny children's crusade for Osama bin Laden is a hunt, almost as serious and successful as for REAL Osama. Yusef Chein's segment is a noble, if not a successful experiment that, at least, has the courage to remind the audience that bin Laden and Al Qaeda are mostly creations of American foreign policy and the CIA, and although research into the character of Sean Penn seems out of place, it still remains inappropriate. effectively bitter-sweet movie. Overall, a review is needed and damn better than the reactionary Oliver Stone World Trade Center.
