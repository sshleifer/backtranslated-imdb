All I can say is the first film of this season that caught my attention. I chose him because of the actors, Gere and Claire, and the story looked promising ... I just looked at it and I can say - I'm amazed. There are shocking scenes, really .. but this is what makes it more realistic. We should not run away from our reality, these things are happening right now. And there are experts who are trying to change things and make things better, and who laugh at their commitment. In fact, I can't feel the “hollywood touch” in the film ... and this is what makes it better. Both Claire and Richard played excellent roles and deserve 10 from me.
