I found this very interesting little children's movie, which is actually more focused on adults, with a lot of jokes and humor that they can understand. A few things are not suitable for the kids, but only a few. Otherwise, “Grinch” (Jim Carrey) hacks so many jokes that he does not keep up with them, from sexual to cultural, from insider to Hollywood, to racial. <br /> <br /> The film is very colorful and looks great on DVD. The little girl "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is very cute, and the costumes and hairstyles of little people here are very interesting. Anthony Hopkins voice is also pleasant, so his story tells about the film even more. His rhymes are good to hear. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the theater, although it was “honest”, but on DVD it was much better. I saw it three times, and every time it got better.
