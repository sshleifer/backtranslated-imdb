One evening I went to see this movie with a bunch of friends. I haven't heard that much about it. So I did not expect anything. But after I saw it, I really liked it. Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast were very good. But I have to say that the acting skills of Giovanni Ribisi really need a little improvement. But such a small flaw, it can be redefined. <br /> <br /> Gone In 60 Seconds talks about a former hijacker who must pump 60 rare and exotic cars overnight to save his brotherâ€™s life. The film is in no way predictable. So the final must be a surprise. Do you think this is just another movie about fast driving? Well, you're partially right. It is much more. Everyone should take a look at this movie.
