In the same melody as his “Americana drums on the Mohawk”, John Ford tells the story of America in a fictional, but very believable way. In this era, Henry Fonda made three films with Ford, and all three films are devoted to a specific time and place, with an emphasis on setting and the cultural environment. In the Mohawk pioneer America in full bloom, the Americans protect themselves from the Indians and other forces. Here Ford shows us the 19th century America; a time when ingenuity and creativity began to bloom, and this nation really became great. Amid all this, there was a tall, lanky, young Illinois lawyer named Abe Lincoln, and this film tells of his life as a lawyer, foreshadowing the greatness that he would later achieve. <br /> <br /> The Foundation is great in this film, taking the gist of what is considered to be a Lincoln person, although no one knows exactly what it was then. The sets and the supporting cast also work well together and give a unique balance in Ford's picturesque American dream and its many forms. This is not a film that needs to be understood literally, but rather symbolically, showing that Lincoln really warmed the events of his life that were supposed to create his legacy. We even have some scenes between him and young Mary Todd; and it is difficult to understand how they ended up together, but this is not the main thing. I think it's just a tribute to the greatness of Lincoln, who many consider the greatest American president. His calm and straightforward behavior was rare then and will be today. Indeed, our government certainly needs more people like him.
