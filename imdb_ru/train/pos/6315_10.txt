Welcome to Collinwood, it's a lot of things, but it's not one of the following: <br /> <br /> George Clooney's star vehicle. The movie is another movie. But for Hollywood, this may be the most significant result of this decade, and for me that’s for sure. <br /> <br /> Movie from start to finish - absolute gas. That's why. <br /> <br /> There is no bad performance in the film. Funny parts are funny. The sharp parts are sharp. The script contains not a boring moment of dialogue. Cinematography is fresh and beautiful. And this is not the Hollywood norm (you will understand what I mean when you see the movie). <br /> <br /> When I was a kid, I remember seeing an ad for this movie. This film came under the radar after not making a lot of money at the box office, and is not even a cult classic. The reason why “Transformers 2” is perceived as ordinary movie viewers acceptable is because they are accustomed to seeing “Transformers 2”. cinematic experience would have been a much more recent place - <br /> <br /> When “they” say they don't make them like they used to, “they” didn't see “Welcome to Collinwood”. <br /> <br /> A fun mini-masterpiece of the comedy of capers who refuses to compromise. One of my favorite.
