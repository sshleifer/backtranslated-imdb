I saw this film while it was in a limited release, mainly due to the novelty of seeing Pierce Brosnan with a mustache, but it turned out to be one of the funniest films I've seen all year. It starts almost like a thriller, but gradually turns into a fun work, full of one-liners and great comedic energy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. In addition, although I say that this film is a comedy, he does not forget that he sometimes has a heart, and he can be very touching when necessary. When I came to the theater, I did not know what to expect from a mustache, but what I received was one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Coming out of the theater, I felt very pleased with the film and plan to see it again in a wide release. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well written script and a big mustache.
