In a poor village in Mexico, Colonel (Fernando Lujan) lives with his asthmatic wife Lola (Marisa Paredes) in an old house. Lola is still grieving for the death of their son Augustine some time ago. The colonel had been waiting for his warrior pension in the war against the Catholic Church for almost twenty-seven years. However, for political reasons, the current government wants to forget this old struggle. Having neither property nor money, but a valuable hunting crane, they struggle to survive, waiting for a confirmation letter from the government, recognizing the law and paying the delayed pension. This slow and touching film reflects the social and financial situation of the majority of pensioners in the third world countries. In Brazil, the majority of retirees are forced to survive, having about $ 80.00 per month. The colonel’s debts in history were made to pay a graveyard for his son, otherwise he would have been buried as a beggar. Outstanding performance of actors in a very sad story, which is a reality in poor countries. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): (`Não se Escreve ao Coronel ') (Do not write to the colonel) <br /> <br />
