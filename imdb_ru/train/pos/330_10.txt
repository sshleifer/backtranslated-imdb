I am Italian, and when I recently watched this film, I was surprised by its beauty: I was 10 years old for the first time, and I liked it, but today I can appreciate it with an adult mind and feelings. Now I can understand that it was a masterpiece of the special season of Italian cinema (Pasolini, etc.), by the time of the past. <br /> <br /> Hollywood epic movies are good ... for fun. Perhaps this Odyssey did not have an English version, because it is not funny enough ... not suitable for popcorn and cola. However, it is suitable for the pathos of Homer and existentialist thinking. <br /> <br /> In Italy, a very good DVD version was recently released: INTEGRAL, with excellent colors. You can find it in some file hosting services, but this is only in Italian, without subtitles. Too bad: the dialogues and voices of this film are also wonderful.
