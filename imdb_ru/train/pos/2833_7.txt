Just watched this movie after thirty-seven years. I was eleven years old, and I caught this film on South Beach in a long-gone movie theater on Washington Avenue. In 1969, I thought where it was! there was a very good movie. But now, after almost forty years, things are not as good as they were. Times have changed, and this film is now an old weary revision of the intergenerational war. It is, however, catch a place in time, which is just a memory. It's really interesting to see fashionable fashion, old Vegas, slender Don Rickles, smoking chains and a hip-hop song. The game was decent, the scenario was somewhat outdated, but the memories were still fresh. Where it may not be where it is for you, but for me it was still a pleasant and exciting journey through the memory lane.
