I approached this film with low expectations, but was very pleasantly surprised. This is very well done, and it hits the films about ballroom dances of recent years, especially “Strictly Ballroom”. While the music is pleasant, and the dancing is colorful, for me the film is not about dancing. We are talking about the very Japanese institution that provides male workers with long trips to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not affect their families. Here we have a man with the whole family, a big mortgage and an interesting life. He is attracted by the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio, which he misses when traveling to work, and this forces him to try ballroom dancing. Also, the Japanese fact is that the lecherous motives that initiated his new passion are understandable, but somehow accepted, at least in the long run, by his family and audience. The attitude to ballroom dancing, as shown in the film, is definitely not Western, although the discipline and music are undoubtedly the cultural heritage of Japan. Thus, cultural contrasts are intriguing. Even without a cultural understanding of color, the dance and the enthusiasm of the players make this movie fun to watch.
