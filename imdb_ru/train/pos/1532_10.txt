This, like “The Murder She Wrote,” is one of those shows that after a busy school day, I sit in front of the TV and watch. What for? Because I truly enjoy it, and it is a shame that it is no longer on the air. Dick Van Dyke is amazing because Dr. Mark Sloan, the doctor who became a detective who, with his son, is investigating the murders. He was joined by a largely unknown, but very competent cast, namely his real son Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that with each batch her hairstyle changes. I also liked Scott Bayo and Charlie Schlatter, but I especially loved Michael Tucci as Norman, and was puzzled by how he suddenly disappeared. This show is very interesting, with great guest stars, sometimes it is a little obvious, as in Colombo, but in every episode there is always something to laugh about. In conclusion, a great series, with two thumbs up and 10/10. Bethany Cox
