After watching this movie, I was a bit skeptical that fantasy films are not always my cup of tea. Especially romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> Little did I know that cinematic magic was waiting for me. Everything in the film, from the plot to the dialogue and effects, was very close to perfection. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes shines like a star in this film. From start to finish, you will fall in love with this character more and more. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is formidable, like an evil witch seeking to capture the star of eternal youth and beauty. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is a cute character who gives viewers the greatest comic relief as the film gains momentum to a climax. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a film that surprised and pleased me as a film fan. If you are looking for a fun and exciting movie that will be interesting for both children and adults, Stardust is what you need.
