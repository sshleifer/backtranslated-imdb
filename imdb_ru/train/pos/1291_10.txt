This is a good movie. Something funny in how to look, how money is distributed on super speed, especially from the point of view of the child. Take it for what it is, a funny little film about a childhood dream come true and what a child can do with $ 1 million. Do not like it, do not look. They make films for the audience, not for people who have nothing to do than to complain in their lives.
