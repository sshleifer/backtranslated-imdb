Now I really liked this movie, it was very funny. Both Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are great actors, I think that after watching this movie they will need to make many more films in the future. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar gets He has some problems because he met with 3 women at the same time, but how he copes when one goes out the door and then the other was so funny to watch, he is very played well in his film, and I hope that in the future he will do more wonderful comedies like this one, John Abraham plays his best friend, he plays his part very well, and he is so underestimated that I am glad that some of his amazing work was noticed, but he is a really good actor, I just John yublyu, Neha Dhupiya plays a small role in this film and plays it well. <br /> <br /> The muse is really good, I really recommend this film to everyone.
