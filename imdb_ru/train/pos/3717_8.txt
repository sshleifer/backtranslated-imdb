It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered that I had seen the Cracker Bag. Just a great mood and yet never stoop to being juicy. There is amazing cinematography, and the leading girl is pretty brilliant. It captures more than the nostalgia of that time. It has a real heart. It is the Achilles wound of childhood, which is graceful and painful. A simple story is always effective when done well. This Glendyn Ivin has a great future, and, for example, I look forward to his next project. Observation is always the hardest thing. It's like the second blues album for most people. <br /> <br /> I just hope that his next movie will not be something like a shark movie. Greetings to all. Enjoy your movie.
