For me, this movie was powerful. I don't want to be a spoiler, but I had a friend many years ago; we were like brothers. This film brought some vivid memories. <br /> <br /> For some reason I could not cast my vote for this film, which would be 10. I continued to receive the message â€œThere were no voices. ... "And yet I saw in the statistics that they were. I will try again tomorrow (Monday). I ignored minor flaws. It was the relationship between the characters who got me. Actually and beautifully acted situations. I was in a few of them. <br /> <br /> A little gem of a movie. Just like Spring Forward is another gem. I am very glad that such films are still made; about relationships between people who are well written, sensitively disclosed with first-class acting and directing. In the end, isn't that all?
