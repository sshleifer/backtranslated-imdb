A well-made mediocre film with a tragic ending. Pros: the way the story moves - begins with the fact that Sorya is trying hard to live, and then she remembers for a long time why he is there. Music. An impartial look at the life of the police. Cons: violence and blood, but I think they add to realistic effects. However, it would be possible to avoid cutting off the heads of people and sending them in boxes and bags. <br /> <br /> No complaints - 7/10
