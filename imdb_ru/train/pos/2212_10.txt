E! Television is a great channel, and Talk Soup is so funny that you can instantly see the change of episodes. We want more fun works by the best ever writer Stan Evans. The patron saint of mad masses ... He is really a talented, talented writer, actor, comedian, producer, director and creative consultant. Anna Nicole loved him but he was not a $$$$ billionaire, so he left him for the billionaire. Many superstars like to make films with actor Stan Evans, who has the acting style of "Humphrey Bogart" {Clark Gable}. He has to make many more films. Maybe with Steven Spielberg or with many other talented producers. We wish him moments of glory with great success. Did he put any mocking dramas? or maybe any doodrama ??? The Bernie Madhoff Project would be a great TV movie written by STAN EVANS. How many scripts did he write ?? Is he on the $$$$$$$$$$$ billionth contract with Disney ?? He should earn more than 50 million dollars ... He could also write a television film about the late KING OF POP .. Michael Jackson. We want to see much more and Stan Evans in movies and on television. Thank you so much. Elvis left the building !!!!!
