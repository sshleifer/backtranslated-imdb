The slow, but beautifully mounted story of the American Revolution. Griffith's stories seem far less rigid than in his earlier historical epics, and his work on scripts is fully integrated into action. Lionel Barrymore - bastard and drama. <br /> <br /> Notice that the nonsense for this film says that it was originally released just over 2 hours after the first release, but there is no reduction that lasts more than 90 minutes. However, the DVD release was presented with a slower frame rate per second, which increases the voltage and returns it to just over two hours. <br /> <br /> In terms of storytelling, much better than sound versions such as the PATRIOT. While not quite in the best Griffith league, such as WAY DOWN EAST and BROKEN BLOSSOMS, a great way to spend a couple of hours.
