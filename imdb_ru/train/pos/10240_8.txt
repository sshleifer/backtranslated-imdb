Genre: Dinosaur, animation, New York, time travel, circus.? <br /> <br /> Main characters: Rex Tyrannosaurus, Elsa Pterodactyl, Dweb Parasarolofus, Ooo Triceratops, a boy named Louis, a girl called Cecilia and the captain of New Eyes. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Erdley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Clown Stubbs), Felicity Kendall (Elsa), etc.? <br /> <br /> What is happening: the four dinosaurs (see above) are fed a few cereals and now are pleasant, friendly dinosaurs that will be cute with children. They go to New York with big plans. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: this is a cute animated film. Dinosaur animations, when they become pleasant and friendly, are a bit flexible and not very good, but they still look nice. I like dinosaurs, when they are nice and friendly, they are cute, friendly and good. I like (almost) all the characters, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but, of course, I like others. Overall, I really like this movie! :-) <br /> <br /> Recommended: people who love good animated films for children, people who love dinosaurs, John Goodman and people who think that circuses are not always what they seem ?? Enjoy! :-)
