I personally watched it to see footage of the 60s and 70s. It was interesting to learn how the narrative movement, in fact, began and became a pop culture and a possible uncompromising force in life. Interviews of classic rock stars are exciting and humorous. You feel that you are secretly and at the same time nod your head ... because it is so good and familiar. I really liked all the segments from the 60s to the present day. I highly recommend this for all aspects, including rock music, the hippie movement, politics and a good story. I checked the box, noting that it contains a spoiler, just because I have no idea what some might consider to be a spoiler or not in this regard, as I discussed what is in all 4 segments, so I just wanted to be safe .
