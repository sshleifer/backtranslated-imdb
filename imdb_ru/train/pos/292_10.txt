Well, first of all, I received this movie as a Christmas present, so it was FREE! FIRST - This film was supposed to be in stereoscopic 3D. This is for the most part, but whenever the main character is in her car, the film falls to 2D! What kind!!?!?! It's not so hard to shoot in the car !!! SECOND - The story is not very good. This is a lot of bad. <br /> <br /> THIRD - Why they show all the deaths at the beginning of the film! It made the movie suck whenever someone was going to kill !!! Look to laugh, but do not waste your time buying it. Just download it or something cheap.
