In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced through three Warner Brother musicals, which offered Depression-era viewers an instant distraction from their troubles. The gold miners of 1933, 42nd Street and the Footlight Parade were created in the world of the Broadway Theater, and the whole theme of the show should continue. In addition to Keeler and Powell, Busby Berkeley's kaleidoscopic choreography, show melodies and many of the same supporting players were featured in the films. <br /> <br /> All of them are probably classics of their genre, but I have to admit that I explicitly prefer Prop, thanks to the energy of pace and the leadership of James Cagney. Warren William at Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter on 42nd Street has proven himself as a production manager, especially Baxter and the burnt Julian Marsh in search of the last ticket office. However, both lack the infectious energy of Cagney, which perfectly complements the insane pace of the production of the Broadway musical. He is an absolute whirl because he deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a girlfriend who mines gold. <br /> <br /> Of course, Cagney alone does not make Footlight a classic as it is. The script cracks from some sharp twins, posed by an excellent supporting actor with Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibby and especially Joan Blondel, who shrinks everything to size. Busby Berkeley's dance numbers are surrealistic, suggestive and risky, and made just at the last moment before the arrival of the Hollywood Codex in '34. Unfortunately, in the thirties and even later years, never would have seen such a richly made musical with enthusiasm and impudence Footlight again. This made sure the nobility and morality.
