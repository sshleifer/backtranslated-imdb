Goldeneye will always be considered one of the most legendary games in the history of VG. There is no doubt about it. But this game, although very excellent, could well become the modern Bond champion of its time. <br /> <br /> This was not a game of connections based on materials from another medium. It was completely new; Script game. Who even had his own song theme! (without this, there would be no connection, ha ha!) The gameplay was excellent, and if you're a fan of the same games or movies, you'll like it. <br /> <br /> Unlike some / most games, these Members cast their characters themselves, as opposed to fictional works for the game. What gives it more cinematic sensation. With a very storyline able to tie you up, you feel that you are playing the game just as much as you got lost in the movie. <br /> <br /> Pleasant in all aspects, from beginning to end. Even after defeating the game, much remains to be done. Thanks to the ranking system and unlockable achievements, as well as multiplayer missions, this is an outstanding game. Despite the fact that it is quite old, in the years of video games. It is still a good game that you can play and play when you feel the need to get a little more Bond in your life. Even now, thinking about it, a topic stuck in my head. Such a great cast and well-written storyline. <br /> <br /> The story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were in front of you, and no less interesting than the game itself. Greatly done, in true communication fashion. Which can only be called awesome, completely awesome. <br /> <br /> I have to start this game now. If you have not played, you missed!
