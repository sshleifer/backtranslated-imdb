It was a pretty good movie, I liked it. I thought it was a fairly accurate look at bulimia and that the point was not the diet, but that the pain was so strong that they needed to find a way to cope with it, and they chose it. Beth was a very accurately drawn character, and in the scene where she tells her mom about eating disorder, you can see the pain inside her and hear her voice, and you know how deep the pain she feels. I also think that one of the best lines in the film is where Beth shouts: "It's not about you." her mother. These words were so true and added so much to this scene in the film. I think this scene was definitely the most important scene in this film.
