“Driving with the Devil” by director Ang Lee (“The Crouching Tiger”) is another jewel in this beautiful directorial cap. For those who are not familiar with the history of the Kansas-Missouri border wars during the American Civil War. Watch this movie and you will visit a sad piece of Americana. In addition to some superb action scenes (quite bloody at times). This is a story of love and devotion between men and one woman in particular. Toby Maguire, Skit Ulrich Jeffrey Wright, and as a young lady Jewel, I never heard or seen her before, I want to see her more) novel. its worth seeing. <br /> <br /> My rating **** <br /> <br /> respectively submitted <br /> <br /> Jay Harris <br /> <br />
