I first saw this film about ten years ago, and I thought it was really very funny. It was not as bad as some critics did. The fact that it was usually written by a reliable John Hughes shows that at least you can expect a funny dialogue. (By the way, I also think that Weird Science is pretty good, which was also done by Hughes at lightning speed). <br /> <br /> The film looks very catchy, using all the primary colors - red, yellow. and so on - which makes it completely unique. The actors are also pretty good. Outstanding Bunny Packard and devil-obsessed Salk Devil stand out. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is a bit outdated, but I personally prefer it to all the other TV shows “The Lamp”.
