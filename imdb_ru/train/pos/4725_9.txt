Despite the lack of logic in the plot, “Kill a shot” is a very nice movie. In a touching performance, Casper Van Dien brilliantly portrays the emotional break between the hard-working rich father and his deceived son. Each member of the support team performs with a solid performance, underlined by the bright play of a young Asian man, whose name I cannot remember. A shockingly tragic ending can upset some young viewers, but overall, Kill Shot does deal a fatal blow.
