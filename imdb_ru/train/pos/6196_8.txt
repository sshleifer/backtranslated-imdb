Faye, the sister of the notorious Nobel Prize laureate poet Simon Grim, still loves Henry the Fool. Their son receives an ingenious orgy in a box from an undisclosed sender, and this is followed by a chase on three continents, in which government agents, terrorists, flight attendants and messengers are extremely sad. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey provides an excellent time for comic books, including brilliant physical work. Thanks to the strong contributions of Jasmine Tabatabai and Saffron Burrows, Faye Grim argues, in the best tradition of Billy Wilder, that nothing is more fun than a beautiful woman in trouble. <br /> <br /> Another good Hartley result (and thanks for the merits of the American Academy in Berlin, where Hartley served as a fellow in the fall of 2004).
