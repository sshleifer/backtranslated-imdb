A charming little film made in Great Britain, about the reunion of all girls (almost) in World War II. A wonderful selection of old people brings to this cheerful story a carefree view of life thanks to the award-winning performance of Dench and Lane, always excellent “tubes”. Well spent time and fun hours for everyone.
