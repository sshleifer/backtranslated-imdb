The film begins with Vincent Price, about to begin his performance as a magician. However, halfway to a very successful show, the police come and close it. It seems that his old boss has deceived him from the tricks that Price has created - even those he did at home. As a result, Price justifiably kills an evil person. The problem is that, although the viewer understood why Price killed, and most likely thought it was OK, because Price was a little crazy, he just couldn't stop at one thing (something like eating potato chips). Lei). <br /> <br /> The film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the show), great plot twists and exciting activities. One thing you can’t say about this film is that it’s boring. Despite the fact that he is also far from being thin, he is cheerful, although it is worthwhile to look at him. <br /> <br /> If I had never seen Vincent Price’s HOUSE OF WAX version, I’d probably like THE MAD MAGICIAN more and get 8 or 9. That's because, although MAD MAGICIAN is a great movie very much like the movie that preceded it (HOUSE OF WAX). The bottom line is that since HOUSE OF WAX was so successful, the formula was rephrased in the subsequent film. Both were made in 3D, both have a storyline, where Price has every reason to kill, but he cannot stop when he does the first, and both are very interesting to watch. The biggest differences, and not many of them, are that HOUSE OF WAX was colorful and was more like a horror movie, and THE MAD MAGICIAN was definitely a mystery. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch this movie. AND HOUSE WAX (only priced version). They are both awesome horror films of the 1950s.
