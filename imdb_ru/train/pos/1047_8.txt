It may be (or may not) be considered interesting that the only reason I really checked out this film was primarily because I wanted to see the performance of the man who beat Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (the role of 10/10 for Best Actor Oscar. (I still would have given Oscar to the Gods, but Paul Lucas did a great job and at least deserved the nomination.) Well, I'm glad I checked this film because I really liked it. I think the film was a little preaching , but not only did I not mind, I enjoyed the speeches and never I missed them. <br /> <br /> In this film, the game was outstanding. I especially liked Paul Lucas, Lucille Watson (rightly Oscar-nominated), Bette Davis (wrongly nominated), George Koulouris and, like strange, Eric Roberts, who plays the middle child. I really liked his character: a strange-looking boy who speaks like a philosopher. He just infuriated me. Even the name of the characters (Bodo) is funny. <br /> <br /> End g in which the character of Lucas was forced to do something that he considered wrong, even if he did it in all ht reasons, and worked on me. I agreed with why he felt that he had to what he did, and I understood why he could not explain it. The message this film makes is good and noble, the landscape (that is, the house) is beautiful, and the action is excellent. Watch this movie if you have a chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
