In this film, there are scenes that come back to me in the most strange times - this tense scene with Mr. Makerjee telling Mrs. Melandez that someone with whom he spoke indicates that a woman who pushes a girl out of the window this one it rolls - as she continues to call him by name - with a Greek accent "Mr. Mckurgee" - and then when Boyer discovers that she has just taken poison, and gives her one last blow on the head before she dies --- it's a delight! "Fools - fools - my whole life" ... and so on. D. And so on. D. - you will understand the meaning ... I have to buy this one. I like the acting skills of Dana Seymour - he usually plays some kind of fat foreign sultan or police chief and has appeared in Casablanca and many wonderful pictures.
