1st viewed 08/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Deer-Sidney Franklin): A well-told story about farmers in China and their elevation and the struggle that Mother Nature throws at them. This film is based on an award-winning novel and tells about the family, starting with the marriage of a son and a slave. The film copes well with your interests, despite the rather modest performance under the guidance of Paul Mooney. It tells Wong Long (the character Mooney plays with) and how he tills the land, buys more land, eventually becomes very rich, but then returns to the land where he originally started. The relationship between him and his wife, played by Louise Rainer, is the main thread of history (besides the land itself), and, despite the obvious non-Chinese actors, they are pretty good at demonstrating the country and its people. Obviously, MGM used their money to create a really good epic with this in an era when they probably could afford it. The locust scene is very well done, and the rest of the film really looks good, guaranteeing an award for the best cinematography on the Oscars this year. The final definition of the epic is what this story is, and it does quite well.
