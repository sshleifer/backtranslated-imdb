BABY FACE is one of the best "forgotten" films before the code. It was shown last night after the 1931 version of WATERLOO BRIDGE on TURNER CLASSIC NETWORK, so I was able to watch the movie for what it is now, with four plus minutes recovered. <br /> <br /> Stanwyk lives in East St. Louis (where she may have known Mayra's drunken parents, May Clark, in THE BOILER OF VODERLU). Her father is Robert Barrett. She lived with him since the death of her mother, and (in a restored dialogue) he drove her since she was 14 years old. Now she is a full-time part-time waitress in his speakeasy, her closest friend is Chico (Teresa Harris), an African-American servant whom Barrett continues to mock. This is one of Stanvik's two positive personality traits when she continues to confront her father about Harris, threatening to quit if Harris is fired (and because they are such dirty workers like Nat Pendleton who like to see how Stanvik serves them, but not Barrett should to obey her, and he needs the taste he serves. <br /> <br /> One of those who regularly come to the party, which Stenwick loves, is the shoemaker and intellectual Adolf Cragg (Alphonse Ethier), who sees great potential in an energetic girl if she just leaves her Abyled house. He also promotes the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and the idea of ​​will to power. More on this later. <br /> <br /> After she knocked out a local political figure (Arthur Holl) and argued with Barrett about it, everything another explosion kills Barrett and allows Stanwick to leave his hometown, and she and Harris go to New York, where they have the opportunity to travel free of charge on a rail freight car, sleeping with a brake (James Murray). They get to New York, and, having a walk, they see the Gotham Trust Company (founded in 1873), and a friendly guard tells her where the personnel department is located. <br /> <br /> We are slowly seeing Stanwick climb the corporate ladder to Above, similar (but more messy) than Robert Morse dared, in the section “How to succeed in business without real attempt”. But Morse was a man in a company dominated by men. Stanwick knows that her sexual charm is her weapon. It passes through John Wayne, Douglas Dumbril (a section of the film that I always felt most shocking - oddly enough - when I watched it), Douglas Wood, Henry Kolker and finally George Brent. Everyone ends up falling in love with her and either pushes when she is no longer useful or is destroyed by her. Brent, the new president of the bank founded by his grandfather, eventually marries her - and the film’s crisis is when the bank’s economic situation is shocked (especially after Brent buys her valuables and gives her valuable bonds). Brent is charged. Will she support him? <br /> <br /> NEAREST SPOILER: <br /> <br /> The only thing that is not recognized in these films is that theatrical and moral agreements of that time still dictated the ending. The initial ending was that Stanvik boarded a ship for Europe, leaving Brent to the mercy of fate, but realizing that she could not do it with him, returning to their apartment building and discovering that he had shot himself. She travels with him to the hospital as he ends. Now that the newly discovered images were found, the film ended up obviously donating all of their money to the bank to save it, and retired back to East St. Louis to live happily if they were poor. <br /> <br /> Neither of these are good endings. Stanwick must continue his destructive course, and Brent is the last of her victims. But even without Bryn's office, scriptwriters (one of them, by the way, Darryl Zanuck) found it appropriate to find a moral center for her. She does not have her - at least not for influential men (whom she hates). I do not think that the depressed audience would allow such a conclusion. <br /> <br /> There are other problems associated with changes in public opinion styles and changes in society. It was the world of men in the corporate world in 1933, so Stanwick chose her job for her. Wood (when she’s fired for negligence) admits that he didn’t want her to work. <br /> <br /> But in 2006, Stanwick would have found a woman everywhere. There are unpleasant, funny remarks in the film (obviously, some of which are based on jealousy) in relation to Stanvik from other secretaries and employees at her rapid growth. In 2006, she often encountered female leaders, and she found that they very quickly cut her off from her legs. Of course, if she finds one or two lesbians, she can go this way, but this is doubtful. And she also never meets men who are gay. They have gay businessmen in business who don't give a damn about her legs or her breasts. <br /> <br /> And there is also her mentor, Mr. Cragg. Cragg remade in the "stupid" version, trying to get her to look for a moral center. In fact, he pushes Nietzsche, but the path (in a broader sense) of the Nazis pushed Nietzsche - to find his way to power and push it. While Nietzsche sometimes emphasized power, it was not the end, but the end of all his theories. Otherwise, no one would read it today in college courses. Cragg is obviously self-taught, but only half. In short, if someone who had studied Nietzsche thoroughly, had run into Cragg, he would have looked like a half-educated fool. And this is Stanvik's mentor! A good film, and today it is worth 10 ... but seriously spoiled.
