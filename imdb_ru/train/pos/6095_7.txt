I have a little conflict over this. The show on the one hand is terrible, the acting is terrible (even when we see real famous actors such as Brad Pitt and Bill Mosley in one episode), the dialogue is moronic, and the background / moral of each episode feels like something unusual. 50s educational short. In none of these episodes, you will not be scared for a second, and Robert Englund's cameos are short, meaningless and banal in some way by Bob Saget from the movie “The Funniest Home Video of America”. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is one of the funniest things on television. The fashion of the 80s, soft focus makes the actors look like their own on the set of The View, the rooms give the material more self-parity than panic, so we have an episode in which the high school child is afraid that if he fails his girlfriend will give up he and his parents refuse him, another fears that she will be put in prison, because she is a poor-quality mother (her husband is playing Brad Pete), another fears that all parents in the world are allied against him when he runs away from home, the other is afraid that she will be confused with her socially backward twin, the other is afraid, if he does not break his mother and stepfather, he will get killed for a party in his house. This list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Considering that these are dreams, I suppose you could look through ridiculous plot points and devices, but they are so out of sight that writers do not really have the power to frighten viewers. You have characters dressed as something from the nightmare of the 80s who roam around, delivering bad dialogue in a very tempting manner and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose than to move the plot to the next weird point of the plot ( usually watching a minor character do something uncharacteristic for a sensible person, while our main character is stunned and too shocked to do something about it). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something that may scare you, stay away. If you are looking, on the other hand, one of the funniest things from the 80s. Watch it. <br /> <br /> Lately he showed up on Chiller TV (almost every day), and I watched it before because of painful curiosity, and now just so that I can laugh every day, With arrested development and additional things on the air is officially the funniest thing on television right now.
