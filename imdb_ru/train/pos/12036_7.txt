Why am I so sure that somewhere there is another version of this novel? I saw the film again this year when I teach a novel, and I find the changes in the film annoying - there is no little boy in the novel, and the ending has changed. They kill him in the film, but the point is that he has been haunted by events in the House of Eel for many years, but he remarries and ultimately leaves the events behind him. Mr. Bentley is a much more sympathetic character in the novel, the scene of the film in which Kipps sets fire to the office is just stupid, and the constant appearance of a toy soldier indicating the presence of a child is really creepy but pointless - Kipps is being pursued by a woman seeking revenge rather than a child. I’m sure I’ve seen a movie that is better and closer to a novel and actually worse. I just imagined it?
