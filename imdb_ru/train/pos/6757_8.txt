Dana Andrews performs "Where the Pavement ends" in this 1950 film, which also starred Jean Tierney, Gary Merrill, Carl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrews plays a New York detective sergeant. Mark Dickson, a bad-tempered cop who had problems with beating suspects in the past. When a person is killed in a gambling club owned by a gangster, Scalis (Merrill), Dixon and his partner are sent to investigate. Scalis blames the murder of Ken Payne (Stevens), who has now left the club after a fight not only with his wife Morgan (Tierney), but with the victim. Dixon believes that the victim won a lot of money and as a result was killed by gangster people. He goes to Payne and, not realizing that he has a plate in his head from the war, knocks him down and accidentally kills him. Now he must hide the murder. As a further complication, he falls in love with Morgan; her father (Ken Talley), who came to Payne’s apartment after seeing that Paine had hit his daughter, was arrested for the crime. <br /> <br /> This is really a terrific, sandy noir with good performances. Vigorously handsome and weathered Andrews is convincing as a tough but nervous detective who must be one step ahead of his colleagues. The film reunites him with his terrific “Laura” partner Gin Tierney, and she looks great as a model with a bad taste in men who are obviously used to being rude. Little does she know, she has another one in her arms. Ken Tully does an amazing job as his father, who protests against his innocence, despite some incriminating evidence. Karl Malden is very tough as Dixon's boss. <br /> <br /> My only problem with this well-directed, fast-moving and exciting film is the end. Pure Hollywood and, putting myself in Tierney's place, I doubt that I would react the same way. A small criticism of the film, written by Ben Hecht and director Otto Preminger. I didn’t find it as fearsome as Laura, but there are few things in this world. If you like the film noir, this is a must see.
