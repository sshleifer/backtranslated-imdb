PROHIBITED PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF films. His influence was felt for more than ten years. However, some of the elements relating to how this widescreen entertainment was aimed at the mid-fifties audience, which had already gone, became outdated quite a bit, and sometimes the slow pace of the film does not help. But the irresistible central idea of ​​the plot, including the ancient, extinct civilization of Krell and the “monsters from Eid”, has not lost its appeal and continues to make this film an actual film that “must see”. Most of all I want to say that the current DVD for this movie is terrible. The film has never looked so good on a home video, and its elements are in dire need of restoration. I hope that this will happen soon, and we will get a special edition of this classic SF.
