This scary and rather bloody adaptation of Stephen King's great novel includes the outstanding central productions of Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynn (who unfortunately died a few years ago) and Denise Crosby, and some really horrible bloody effects. Director Mary Lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style and manages to make this one of the few versions of King’s work, which is not only to be seen, but also really upset. The image of the child Zombie Gage (Miko Hughes later in The New Nightmare) is no less remarkable than what could easily have been a funny character made formidable and creepy. As for people who think that this is not scary, then look at it in the dark alone (after all, with your fastidious girlfriend), and I guarantee you that the "Sematarium of Pets" will not sneak up on you. Some horror films, such as this one, or the “Chainsaw Massacre of Texas” should not be seen in a group. Recommended for horror fans!
