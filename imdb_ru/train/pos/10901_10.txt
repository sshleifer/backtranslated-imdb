This is probably the best documentary I've seen in a very long time. Johnny Kennedy was and still is a tragicly beautiful inspiration. He not only survived one of the most painful diseases, but also used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never give up, reaching people and spreading his love. Watching the minutes of his long struggle was heartbreaking. Listening to his smart ass and seeing his delightful gestures was soulful. And to see his smile was indescribable. I am happy that this tiny giant could touch me. Please, if you ever have the opportunity to watch this film - consider yourself lucky to meet Johnny Kennedy.
