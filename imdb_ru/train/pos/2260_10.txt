Damn good movie! One that is seriously undervalued. The songs that the children sing in the film gave me a sense of their pain, but also their hopes for the future. Whoopi Goldberg plays well here, but the best film throughout the film is an actress who plays a major role. I wish she had starred in other films. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a higher rating. I put it on 10/10.
