A delightfully unpretentious promise of Romeo and Juliet. Come without expectations, except for a pleasant stay, and you will like it. A talented group of comic actors released and staged a riot in this frivolous performers car. Bad reviews were caused by snobbery about Shakespeare’s treatment. Some people think that the whole movie should be “important” - if you share these views, do not worry. The inscription reads: Angelina Jolie’s “Presentation”, which is not even close to reality, but she is strikingly beautiful, like Juliet’s character, and, as always, her acting is wonderful - and considering her age at that time, even her dialect is pretty good. Recreating this classic fairy tale with rival Italian families in the catering business in New York will bring you great pleasure. Look at it in the right mood, and you will laugh out loud.
