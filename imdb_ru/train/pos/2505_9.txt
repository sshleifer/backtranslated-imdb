Many people perceive it as a film about working with fans, because in this film many superstars starred (Gackt, Hyde and Van Lee Hom - a very famous singer in Japan). But do not judge until you look, that's what I say. Gackt and his co-workers are very serious when they made this film and they worked so hard. This is a good movie with a touchy story inside. A few scenes can be so funny, and some - so sad. They did it so well that I can't stop watching it all over again. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty well written, but I admit that their actions are a little disappointing. This is especially important for Hyde, because his acting skills are inferior to another, and it is strange to hear him speak in a language other than his native (Japan). But this is understandable, because they are playing in the film for the first time. <br /> <br /> I think Gackt is trying to show us how someone can be so weak when he loses the most important person in his life. When Toshi was killed, when Shaw asked Kay to turn Yi-Che into a vampire like him, because he would not let her die, When Shaw's brother died, Kay Shot Son died, and the best and most beautiful scene - When Shaw died ~ even I said that Hyde's skill is still strange, but I give him two blows on this stage !! <br /> <br /> There is a time when the plot goes too fast, as if they did not explain the reason why the Son can join the local mafia and the enemy Sho, because they are good friends in the past, as well as the son Shu. Shaw. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I love this movie ~ (very much ^^). <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with a touching beautiful story.
