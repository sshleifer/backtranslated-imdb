Although it was clearly a low-budget production, the performances and songs in this film are worth seeing. One of Walken's few musical roles to date. (he is an amazing dancer and singer and demonstrates his acrobatic skills - watch the wheel!) Also starring Jason Connery Excellent children's story and very nice characters.
