Great game by Gretchen Mol. This film is one of the best biographical films that will appear on the screen for some time. While it does cover most of Betty's young life, he also manages to stay mostly focused on the path, which is what most biographical films seem to lack. There is some cute and frighteningly funny subtext in the dialogue and action. This film is a great excerpt from the director. “American psychopath,” and I think it will show her best work to date. Oh, and as a movie buff, I give this movie 100% at the cinema. It was amazing how well they looked in the style of the 50s with modern film screenings. Awards D.O.P. Everything is very pleasant. I recommend to anyone who wants to see it: 8/10.
