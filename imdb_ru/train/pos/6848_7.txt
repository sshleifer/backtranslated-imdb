A very stupid film, it starts with a soft porn sequence, risks a farcelike comedy in an art gallery, adds a shocker from a discovery in a hotel room, then introduces an occasional murder for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> What follows is bizarre and surreal (in particular, the stopwatch scene is extremely unnecessarily unnecessary), the culmination of which is a frank "turning" ending, which is as obvious as it is unfair to the viewer ( see the section on trivia to find out why he is intentionally dishonest). br /> <br /> The film is trying hard to insult as many groups as possible - transgender, crazy and wonderful racial stereotypes in the Huggy Bear style on the subway - and treats the viewer indifferently as an idiot in the final scenes, as the characters infinitely explain in detail each other, over and over again, what just happened in the film. Although the minor female characters on the restaurant's stage at the end are a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole film is a joy to watch: despite many, many flaws, the whole package is simple, well, it works.
