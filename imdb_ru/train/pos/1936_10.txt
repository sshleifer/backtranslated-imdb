This independent film was one of the best films on the festival of high grass that I have ever seen there, I loved it, there was so much good in the film that the actors and the film crew got the opportunity. The meetings were absolutely phenomenal. I thought Avi coped well with his role. and Ricky Ullman was absolutely faithful to his role as an actor Disney, and I was amazed by his talent, which allowed him to move from a funny teen comedy to such an adult role without problems, the talent in the film was just amazing, the cinematography would be just great if you wanted Watch an independent film, this is really what you should see. I think Mr. Grover would be very proud to have such an idea at his festival, and his parents liked the film so much that when he won the audienceâ€™s popularity, they went and saw it again. it really was a great movie, it was dark, funny, sad and truly emotional, just incredible. I, frankly, just delighted with this film, and I really do not want to spoil it, because someone just looks at it and will be genuinely surprised by this, I think that these filmmakers really have what it takes to go somewhere, and I hope to see more work from them in the future.
