It's a bit long (2 hours, 20 minutes), but there was a lot of the famous Pearl Buck novel in it. In other words, much could be covered. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it was a soap opera, but some visually dramatic moments were also limited by a locust attack at the end of the film. It was amazing to watch. Given that this film is about 70 years old, the special effects team in this film did an amazing job. <br /> <br /> Paul Mooney and Louise Rainer were award-winning actors in their time, and they do not disappoint here, both give powerful performances. The only problem is trust, because all Asians are Caucasians, and some of them, such as Walter Connolly, simply do not look real. I would like to see a rework of this film with the participation of Asian actors, but not for reasons related to the PC, but just to make the story look and sound more believable.
