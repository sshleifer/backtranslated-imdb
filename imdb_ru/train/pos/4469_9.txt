Usually musicals in the 1940s had a certain formula - and if you studied films, you know what I am talking about, a certain long-lasting, very “spectacular” game that was gorgeous on the surface, but never reached the real personalities of characters and ect. <br /> <br /> THIS IS ONCE /> <br /> Gene Kelly was probably in top form in his entire career - yes, I know about "American in Paris" and "Singing in the Rain ". This one is different. He really begins to understand his character "sea wolf", thinking (first) that "pick up any girl during the holidays" is nothing more than a lark. And if you had to come up with a “story” to get it - so be it - for now. Kind of like the Musical Man when he "hooked on the door." The possible gaiety of the film stems mainly from an attempt by him and his new friend (Sinatra) to make the “story” good, in order to “get the girl” with whom he REALLY and unexpectedly fell in love. You will need to watch a movie to understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are many other elements of a great movie in this film, this is a classic story of friends, nostalgia for the time when World War II began. was almost over (the war ended about a month after the release of the films), the realization that the guy who always laughed at life can find out that he is a really great man, great songs and maybe a few other elements of classic filmmaking that I don’t I can think now. <br /> <br /> Why not 10? Toward the end - at 2 and a half hours begins to feel a little long. There is a small ballet number, which Gene Kelly makes, which must have been a sensation in 1945, but it seems outdated and it seems that now it adds minutes. But overall, this is a definite winner at every level.
