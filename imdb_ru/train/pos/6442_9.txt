This is an excellent Swedish film ... it was the first Swedish film that I watched ... it was simple and deep ... what a wonderful combination! <br /> <br /> Michael Nyquist did an excellent performance as a famous conductor who seeks peace in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Frida Hallgren was great as his inspiring girlfriend, who helped him to continue and never give up. <br /> <br /> The struggle between the conductor and the hypocritical priest who loses the battle with Michael when his wife confronts him and defends Michael's noble cause to help his hometown find its own world in music. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn’t like was the final ... it wasn’t so good, but it has some deep meaning.
