This movie is dumb as hell! I think it was written as a serious film, but when it came time to shoot, Michael Cooney said: “Hey, let's add a little humor and give it some spice!” The characters are also a little developed, too. Oh, and the death sequences are the best. However, I hate hair dryer. What was it all about?
