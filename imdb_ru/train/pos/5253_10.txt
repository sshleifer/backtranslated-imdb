I really do not understand why people are so upset and panning this film! Remember, guys, this is an SNL movie, not something that should be unpredictable and original in the plot or direction! “The Ladies Man” is a hilarious film, although sometimes stupid, with a stunned cast and, as usual, wonderful performances by Will Ferrell and Tim Meadows. Yes, some jokes are stupid, and yes, the characters are incredible, but this is a comedy! I really don't understand how no one could laugh a lot during this funny movie. Anyway, all I ask is that people take it as it is - SNL, a stupid and disrespectful comedy. Nothing that will receive awards, but, nevertheless, a bit of modern comedic gold. "10-4 Apricot!"
