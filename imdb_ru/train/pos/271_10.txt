It's all about Mitzi. I loved her about it. And didn't she look fantastic ?! I like these popcorn movies Lifetime Sunday. It’s like one of those nail catchers where they always go into advertising in the most annoying times. Richard's character was absolutely creepy. I met with these guys. Well, not exactly, lol. I wish Zack was not killed. He was pretty and very light in the eyes. I love these stories like stalkers. It always makes me stand up and make sure my doors are locked. My husband doesn’t usually like these type of films, but I actually sat with me and enjoyed them. I can't wait to see what Mitzi is doing next!
