I thought I should evaluate my position after reading other reviews. The film is not great, but it has a lot of great elements. The lighting and the scenes along with the camera work are great. The story is slow and weak, but entertaining. The game is bad, but no worse than what you find on the SyFy channel. The music is pretty good, but the blood is good. He has a gorgeous Leather Face in the film, produced by Bruce Campbell. I watched the whole movie, and although it was mostly predictable, it was still enjoyable. Women are attractive enough, and the lead actor does a good job of being thoughtful and creepy. The film was surprisingly clean for contemporary film and violence, suitable for children 13 years and older. There were no sex scenes. I gave it 7 out of 10, and I think it is fair. I would watch it again if I had nothing better to do. The most annoying aspect of the film was the cheerful angel, the devil rather creepy.
