Stage adaptations often have a serious mistake. They often look like they just put a film camera on the stage (for example, “Night Mom”). Direction Sydney Lumeta supports the film alive, which is especially difficult because the picture did not bring him any real problems. Still, it's nice to see what it is. The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is pretty brilliant. The dynamics of their relationship is amazing. Cain, as always, is fantastic, and Riva has one of the few chances to really play. <br /> <br /> I confess that I have never seen the play by Ira Levin, but I hear that Jay Presson Allen’s adaptation is correct. The script is incredibly confusing and makes you guess. “Deathtrap” is an extremely exciting movie that is recommended to almost all fans of the stage and screen. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
