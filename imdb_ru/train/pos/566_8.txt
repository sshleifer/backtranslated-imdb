Trustingly interesting western from a director who had few peers in the genre. Just like other paintings by Anthony Mann, The Far Country combines a powerful story of a boiling pot with clever knowledge of the influence of the landscape. Both are played out among some of the Mann's pecadillas, such as honor, honesty, betrayal and, of course, death! The story tells that state hunting partners Jeff Webster (James Stewart) and Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) are traveling to Oregon with a herd of cattle. Aware of the prosperity of the golden boom, they plan to make a net profit selling livestock in the city of Klondike. Arriving at Skagway, they discover that the self-appointed judge, Mr. Gannon {John McIntyre}, is ready to give justice to Webster because Webster has broken the law, and all this will be with an honest purpose along the way. As punishment, Gannon takes away a herd of partners from them, but they steal them back and go across the Canadian border to Dawson - with Gannon and his people in hot pursuit. Here, beautiful women and the meek and lawless city will fill the fate of all participants. <br /> <br /> Interesting from start to finish, Far Country benefits enormously from the anti-hero James Stewart in anticipation of the image and Mann. the slippery direction of the hard Borden Chase script. The cinematography from William H. Daniels is excellent, although the current DVD prints have not had any benefit, and the film has several surprises and "will it not be it?" Clarity of viewers in the game. Paying dividends for repeated screenings for fans of the seasoned genre, it still remains something essential for newbies who delve into the amazing, but dark, western world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 8/10
