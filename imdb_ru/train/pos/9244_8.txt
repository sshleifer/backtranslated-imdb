If you only read a brief overview of the plot, this film will sound like a typical film from the 1930s. The story might seem rather far-fetched. The strength and beauty of this film - in the immediate, mundane actions of the actors. I have rarely seen Jean Harlow demonstrate such a range of feelings, rich and subtle nuances floated across her face. If you watch their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel, there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the main characters. Raw emotions are so sincerely depicted, so true. The final sequence is almost unbearably agonizing: when Clark Gable looks with such joy and surprise at his son, he raises him and says proudly: “My child!” This is one of the best examples of the era of depression in the movies.
