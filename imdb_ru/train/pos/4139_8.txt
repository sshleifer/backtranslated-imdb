I really wonder how this show plays in the UK and the rest of Europe. THIS IS THE MOST CONSUMPTION ABOUT BEING AN AMERICAN (especially white Americans). This can be a big reason for some poisons and vitriol expressed here on this board. I love the show, but it is with some reservations, and I feel that Spoiler chose the easy way: <br /> <br /> To destroy and burn everything at the end of the second season. Julie slammed the door, hoping to resume the show, unless her character was on the haystack in the middle of the farm. Who knows? It was a funny, indecent, and sometimes rather scary show.
