Long before “Brokeback Mountain” (about 23 years ago) “Death Trap” was the first time when I saw two men kissing passionately on the screen, and, frankly, I was shocked. I understood it from the point of view of the plot, and this did not upset my feelings very much (not much), but this was the first time I saw him, at least in the “mainstream” film. I thought it was a fearless move for my time, and I took it upon myself to try it, especially Christopher Reeve, in the midst of my time as Superman with a PG rating. Male bisexuality on the screen may have reached its climax with “Brokeback”, but it is interesting to note this much earlier incarnation.
