I participate in a director's symposium, and this film was shown after we had already watched a not-so-good film and took part in a 40-minute discussion. Despite the fact that it was incredibly late and we were tired, all the spectators enjoyed it very much. <br /> <br /> Personally, I thought the movie was hilarious in all the right places, and I liked the unusual characters. They really grow on you in the film.
