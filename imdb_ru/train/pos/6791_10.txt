I applied to turn it into a movie, it would be great !! I was also amazed by the plot and character creation in this game. I played again and again (more than 20 times), just to try something different, and every time everything is more interesting. Final Fantasy will eat your heart !! THIS SHOULD BE MADE IN A FILM !!!!! If someone needs help creating a petition to turn it into a movie, please contact me. I would like to help with this project any day. The graphics are great for the PS1 and even make you forget that this is the PS1 most of the time. A lot of side quests set him apart every time you play.
