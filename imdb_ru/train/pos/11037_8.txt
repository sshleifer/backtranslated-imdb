Now I know that French prisoners hardly read Lovecraft (and this proves my point that his works should be taught at school, maybe as a separate subject), but how do they think that something like “ftagn yog sototh ”can lead to anything good? <br /> <br /> The film unfolds in prison, where four completely unexpected cellmates stumble upon a magic book that can, if properly read, pull them out. As for prisons, the cell was completely unreal, so it was difficult for me to penetrate the atmosphere of things. It also moves rather slowly, which can tire people. But beyond that, this super terrifying feeling that mixes “hell are other people” of Sartre with a Lovecraft / Barker type story, and makes it rather successful. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: take time to watch this. It means not doing it when you are going to go to work, sleep, or do something else. This is the movie that works best if you are immersed in it. Lessons: Yogi is bad, almost as bad as French women.
