This is a fantastic film for children, based on The Legend of Bogey Creek, although I don’t know why they called it Return to Bogey Creek as if it were a continuation. The stars of Dawn Wells became the mother of three children who got lost in the swamp around Boggy Creek along with two other men, and the monster came to their aid. Yes, it is very stupid, and the plot is banal, but this type of film is ideal for a target group of 8-12 years. This is a harmless fare for children with a G rating, and at the very least you don’t need to worry about leaving your children alone while they watch it. Strictly speaking, for 8-12 years, older children will be bored and think that it is lame.
