Only during my second viewing, after years, I understood two things about this film: 1) I really liked him, and 2) that his performance is clearly sharper than the premise itself. I laughed at the film before it occurred to me to resume my initial protests - peaks and logs, as well as lightheadedness (even * good *, dizziness) are simply not funny in their essence, especially when they are elongated. But while the impulse of the film begins to end, Reeves, Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene) demonstrate such a wonderful sense of comic time throughout the film that even more awkward jokes (for example, Ted) are unable to recognize a certain occupant hell) work as easy as witty (like a challenge). And the unification of Winter and Reeves sounds so good that the unification of Bill and Ted (who conduct just one scene, divided throughout the film, is a disaster if they donâ€™t correspond to each other) seems completely unstressed. <br /> <br /> (Note: I found that the first film was only episodically interesting - it seems that there are noticeably different comic feelings). <br /> <br /> I give him 7.75. Amazing fun
