This is a very good film, not only for fans of Lady Death comics, but also for those who love animated films / series of adventures and fantasy. <br /> <br /> A film about an innocent girl who was killed for what she did not do, but for who she is the daughter of the ruler of hell, of Lucifer himself. <br /> <br /> Then she is looking for revenge ... and the rest is better to watch it from the movie. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie, the characters look like original comics, from chaos. I have never had the opportunity to read the first parts of the story in the comics, only the last, after the passages from the film, so I can't tell you if the events are exactly like the comics, but ... anyway, another story about the Lady of Death!
