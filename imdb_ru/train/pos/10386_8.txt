what's wrong with you people, if you weren't hit by the sequences of action movies and Jessica Simpsons hot body, then you mostly chatted in the head. Of course, the film is not a masterpiece, I do not think he wanted. It was fun and funny, I never watched the show when I was younger, I just recently saw one episode, and when I watched the movie, I felt that it had the same atmosphere. The places in the film were practically trembling, and the car sequences were good because it didnâ€™t bother me and dragged along like some scenes in 2fast 2furious. and Jessica Simpson is just hot, I just want them to use her more in action movies. In general, I had a hell of a time when I watched it, and I will soon go and see it again, and I will buy it on DVD. People enjoy what is.
