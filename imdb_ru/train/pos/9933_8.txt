If you find that you need to escape, something that will keep your attention for two hours and let you get lost in another world, Domino will satisfy that need. In the end, this is entertainment! The plot keeps your brain in motion - one of those films (for example, “Ordinary suspects”), where you want to see it a second time, to sort out everything. I wondered about Domino Harvey herself, how her life became interesting for Hollywood. As for acting, many celebrities are not featured in trailers. And any actor who makes me forget who they are has done a good job. I have never thought about Cyrus in a football uniform or a pirate costume. And, of course, Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke well and often, but here, despite the violence, he shows signs of being able to care for other people.
