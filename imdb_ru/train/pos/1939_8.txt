I don’t know why I chose this film to watch, it has a strange name and from the description it looked somehow different. From time to time it is useful to try a film that is slightly different from the main Hollywood film “Hero / Thriller”, and this film is definitely different. From the very beginning, this film intrigued me, but I could not understand why to the end if the film, when I realized that the film was great, because the characters were so real. I thought the acting was excellent and the character development really makes you take care of them and I hope that in the end they will succeed. I think that everyone who watches a movie can somehow relate to one of the characters, and this makes it great for watching and having a good laugh over the usual mediocrity of the actors. <br /> <br /> With the climax of the film, you will definitely feel good, and you will have the feeling “everything will be fine”. I am sure that it will have wide appeal and a chance should be given.
