This is the movie "Serial B", and my voice reflects his belonging to this genre. I saw this film last night in the left bank cinema in Paris, where he opened the two-week film Noir. Yes, the film has some flaws, but too many delightful elements to ignore. <br /> <br /> As the previous reviewer noted, the drumming scene is incredible! (B-movies can go where A-movies are banned!) And the plot is intriguing. As for Francho Ton, however, I ask you not to agree: for me he is quite mysterious; just the right shade of creepy. It must be borne in mind that something like German expressionism is happening here (director Robert Siodmark was a German who came to Hollywood during the war), and thus the atmosphere of exaggeration fits into the whole movie. At least for me it is. <br /> <br /> However, this gorgeous Ella Raines, who only in her third well-deserved performance kept this viewer fascinated throughout the film. The “Friday Girl” type with strong resemblance to Gene Tierney, it is surprising that she did not become a household name. But she is so good that I just ordered another film of hers (“Impact”) over the Internet, and I can't wait to see it.
