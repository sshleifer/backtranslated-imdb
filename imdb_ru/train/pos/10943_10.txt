I have to vote for these 10 out of 10 in a rare case when she sees this review, pity me, take me to Hollywood and drag me into her strange / funny world. But in all seriousness it was good. The first episode obviously finds his feet, but he has the oddity of Silverman passing through him. This is not a funny comedy, but this is good, too many laughs, and it would be wrong with remarks when laughing, this is for the audience to hear their inner jester laugh at the absurdity of all this. I can easily see this as the strange show of Drew Carey with his strange characters and an incredibly strong central character. Worth watching, looking forward to the next episodes. A VERY good chance from the usual comedy there. <br /> <br /> ps, Sarah? Call me....
