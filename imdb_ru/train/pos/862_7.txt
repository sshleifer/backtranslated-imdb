Carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids. When she gets overwhelmed at work, she can hire Paul to help her. Paul is just out of prison, and his past is not entirely behind. To talk too much about a story in which there are many turns would be a mistake. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing for me in this film is how sound is used to indicate when Carla can hear and when she cannot — a kind of “point of view” (like point of view). The early scenes that set this up, as well as the early development of the character of Carla and Paul, were more interesting to me than the twists and turns later, some of which were difficult to track and / or slightly stretched confidence. There is also some unpleasant violence. On the positive side, the cinematography was very good. <br /> <br /> The film is worth seeing, but perhaps not to look.
