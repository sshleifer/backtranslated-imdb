It's been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used Wall Street to let us know that greed is good. Now Michael Douglas takes GG's character and turns him into a secret service agent, Pete Harrison. Guess what? It is working! This is a serious political thriller that made me guess. The detailed work of demonstrating the security measures taken by the SS on behalf of the President and the First Lady was also intriguing. All the leads were pretty good, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldnâ€™t accept Eva Longoria as a secret service agent. Considering that Jodie Foster has just made you give up her faith and really think that she was an FBI Starling agent in Silence of the Lambs, you do not feel the same way about Longoria. However, it is a funny movie, escapist entertainment in the background.
