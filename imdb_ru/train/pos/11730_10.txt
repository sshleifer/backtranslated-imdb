What can be said about Elvira, which has not yet been said in the world press? The classic comedy that IS Elvira presents in her first full-length comedy masterpiece with a big budget. <br /> <br /> From the very first movie in the film, Elvira shows an acting effect that clearly speaks of the movie “Excellent ... cordially, Bette Davis! Look at poor Elvira, at the agitated Elvira, at the jealous Elvira, at the murderous Elvira. There is nothing you can do but admire her acting skills! <br /> <br /> At the heart of this comedic masterpiece is Elvira’s desire to show the star glory of Las Vegas. Despite the fact that in the role of the hostess of horror (along with the saddest) put "chest back in the chest," Elvira believes that the small screen is emotionally compressed .... and physically! According to Naff, she packs her bag and goes to the east ... a hot dog in one hand and a letter from her aunt's lawyer setting out her "randomness" of the inheritance in the other. <br /> <br /> I have seen this film so many times that I can almost repeat it verbatim .... (literally just show it)! <br /> <br /> Take a copy, laugh stupidly, learn the lines .... <br /> <br /> Why she didn’t win Oscar's best female role for this role, I can’t do it.
