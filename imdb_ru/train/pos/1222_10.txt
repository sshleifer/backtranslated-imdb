I saw this short film on DVD with the best New Zealand shorts, everything is fine, but the French doors were awesome. It starts slowly, and you wonder if anything will happen. Just as you relax in a noisy home repair drum, the worst happens. <br /> <br /> EEEEkkk, I wanted to stop watching, but they stuck me. <br /> <br /> Films plunge into primordial fear of the dark and almost without any special effects. It cools you straight to the bone. A simple but brilliant concept revealed all these memories of when I was young, and did not dream of the most incredible, but frightening situations. <br /> <br /> Visual style of cinematographers will crash down, and the main character will convincingly guide you through the plot. This is a quality that I have not seen for quite some time. <br /> <br /> The French doors have all the distinctive features, alas, they end in about ten minutes. Still a great ending that asks you to want to know more. <br /> <br /> I liked it very much, well done, thanks for the trip. These New Zealanders really show talent. <br /> <br /> New fan.
