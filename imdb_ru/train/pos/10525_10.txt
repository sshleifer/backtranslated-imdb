I have no idea how a Texan (directed by Douglas McGrath) and American actress Gwyneth Paltrow ever coped with this, but the repetition of this event will remind you what a fuss about Miss Paltrow was at all! I’ve left the woman a long time ago and still feel that she’s pretty boring in her play Shakespeare in Love, which won an Oscar, but she gets all the hits right here — she’s almost perfect like Emma Woodhouse. She may have won an Oscar for Shakespeare, but this should be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course, she is surrounded by a great cast, including Tony Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliet Stevenson, and others ... Jeremy Northam is very attractive as a love interest, even if the script is a little buried in his recognition of his love Paltrow (in the process, allowing all tensions to disappear from their relationship); A few years later, Evan’s hair is a little easier to give than to 96, and I personally find the vile Alan Cumming an annoying presence in everything. But without a doubt, Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson, daughter of Phyllida Lowe) - Miss Bates; what this version needs is a scene in which Emma reconciles with Miss Bates, since she is a character to whose fate we are attracted. The film is worth watching (again, even) only for her performance. <br /> <br /> In general, it has miraculously grown old with charisma to save and more than enough subtlety to understand the British class system. It’s worth renting (because it’s unlikely that Paltrow will ever be so good again, but we will always have Emma).
