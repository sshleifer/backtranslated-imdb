“Strange Couple” is one of those films that far exceeds its reputation. Everybody knows it, they sing a song, they complain about life with a sloppy Oscar or a choosy Felix ... but they underestimate the movie without knowing it. This is not just a neat guy living with a sloppy guy; This is a portrait of two friends helping each other in the throes of divorce. It's also damn funny from start to finish, but this is such a comedy that springs from realistic, stressful and just awful situations. Thus, some viewers actually find the film a bit uncomfortable, but I think its credibility is its strength. In addition, the face of the bulldog Mattau just infuriated me! My favorite comedy, on the mile of the country.
