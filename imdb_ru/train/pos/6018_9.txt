I saw it in the early 70s (when I was 16 years old), and, despite the long slow set-ups, meetings, riots, etc. When the desert section began, everything fell into context, and I liked it. (However, he grew very old very well.) Then I was in what seemed like a tiny minority. All the criticisms seemed to focus on inaction and narration. Fortunately, I am no longer in such a minority. <br /> <br /> He cleverly shows (in a somewhat prophetic way) the political divisions, unrest, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialization and deception that are still ahead. <br /> <br /> The appreciation for this mainstream film has grown, and I am glad about it.
