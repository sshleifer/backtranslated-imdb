Have you ever wanted to know how much Hollywood can get away with before the official entry into force of the Hayes Code? Well, unfortunately, the Convention City is lost, so you just need to look at Tarzan and his assistant to find out. In 1934, there is a significant amount of sexual hints and even naked flesh. Just look at Jane's nude swimming. While Tarzan is often viewed as adventure films for young boys and for no one else, this picture proves that the series was originally very adult. Seventy years later, he is still as sexy as he was. <br /> <br /> In addition to the taboo nature ban on nature, this is an excellent and exciting adventure story. I have always liked jungle movies that Hollywood produced in the 30s and 40s, but not only that genre, which I would call excellent films. "Tarzan and his friend" - certainly the best film from this long-gone genre. Sequences of attacks on safaris by monkeys or locals can still create tension today. In addition, animals are too steep (especially monkeys, throwing boulders). Soon, the acting will not receive major awards, but, of course, more than adequate for this type of film. The film is stolen again by Cheetah, the most intelligent monkey in the jungle. One of the most interesting examples of Hollywood pre-coding.
