Oh, this is such a great musical. There are some miscalculations - Frank Sinatra is very mistaken as a Jew Nathan Detroit, although this becomes apparent only in "Sue Me", which is clearly a Jewish song. Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the best songs from the Marry the Man Today show, and replaced it with a lower Sinatra show. Given these two flaws, the film is great. Gene Simmons shines like Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando does not know how to sing valuable beans, but he still copes with Stubby Kaye remarkably repeats his role on Broadway (it was written for him). The language of Damon Runion, his rhythm and humor are well traced. It is on my list "every occasion I receive."
