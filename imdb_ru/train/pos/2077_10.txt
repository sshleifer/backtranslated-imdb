This eternal proverb is reflected in this film and in my heart. So many years I have been waiting to see this eternal story! I was not ready, maybe. It is possible that my feelings would not appreciate his power. Therefore, I now joyfully greet it in my soul with joy. <br /> <br /> My respect and admiration for Pavel Muni was long. His now legendary glow. But now I finally discovered the priceless gifts of the magnificent talents of LUIS REINER. Oh, how many faces can speak the same as her? Some say that it was done from her silent years, and it could well be, but her speech is quite eloquent when she is given a chance. She deserved her Oscar. <br /> <br /> This film is in the epic epic in the most classic proportions. All items are equal, necessary and perfect. Skeptics may leave if they wish, but they will avoid storytelling, which remains with him all his life. <br /> <br /> Good land enriches a person in a way that no one expects. But not all of this will come with the joy I did. But I can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Don't push me with simple technical details regarding the race of the main players. These are the expectations of modern times, when we are obsessed with absolute perfection. But I dare millions of new films to tell the story of PEARL BUCK with such sharpness, strength, conviction and grace. <br /> <br /> If any modern artist dares to retake this masterpiece, I warn them never to come close to the aromatic scent that still comes from the essence of this story. Time will not diminish this effort, and progress will not improve its greatness.
