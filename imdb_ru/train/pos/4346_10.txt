Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in show business. I read both of his books and think that he is great. Peter Folk can deliver the highlight with the best of them. The combination of these two is magic. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a family that really gets to know each other. Through the trip, father and son are united for the first time in their lives during a family crisis. They do everything that fathers and sons should do in life ... they just do it much later in life. The situations are very funny, but there is a feeling that they can actually happen to people in real life (not too intrusive or caricatured). This is the first time I watch Paul Reiser and fully believe in every emotion that has been depicted. Sometimes his eyes look so sad. <br /> <br /> Gret film and a great story and plot. She has comedy and emotions, but an inspiring message ... Olympia Dukakas also does an excellent job :)
