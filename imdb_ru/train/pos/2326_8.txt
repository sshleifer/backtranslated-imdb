Danny (Reese Witherspoon) was always very close with her older sister Maureen (Emily Warfield), until they both fell in love with their neighbor Court (Jason London). But not after the terrible tragedies, the two sisters understand that nothing can separate them and that their love for each other will never fade away. <br /> <br /> This was a truly heartbreaking story of first love. Probably the most painful story of a young love I have ever seen. All the action is awesome, and Reese Witherspoon in her first film gives an excellent presentation. I would give Man on the Moon 8.5 / 10
