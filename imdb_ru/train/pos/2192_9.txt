Dan Katzir made a wonderful film in which we will ride a roller coaster on a truly romantic set of problems in modern Israel. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has ever been in love, the film returns insecurity Unreliability and heartache that make love so bitter-sweet. The atmosphere of fear and isolation, which came from difficult times at the time in Israel, only reinforces this feeling. Instantly, you fall into Dan's plight and you can't help but be deeply agitated. <br /> <br /> You cannot write drama and passion, as it is - the contrast between the realities of a desperate, grasped Dan relationship with Iris, and the realities of the state in the confusion make it extremely watchable. If you have an ounce of passion and you have ever been in love, watch this movie.
