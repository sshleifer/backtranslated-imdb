This is a poem about the film, wonderfully presented and photographed with delicate skill. It perfectly conveys the atmosphere of time and place. (Lake edge of Italy in the twenties.) This is a love story with a twist. Characters are unique and believable. The settings are very exotic. Some scenes — a funeral boat in the fog — a tall, long shot of a chess table in the center of a fancy patterned tile floor — beautiful images. And instead of the obligatory happy ending, this story is bitter-sweet. If the film is an art, it is close to a masterpiece. <br /> <br />
