I'm not saying that, as a fan of Chris Rock, I say this as a person who had low expectations for this film and who was wrong. The first flaw was that it all ended with an ending that everyone saw. The disadvantage of number two was that I discovered that the chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seemed fake. Finally, the acting in this film was low: the best actor is Regina King, and the worst is Mark Addy. but I saw past this flaw and saw a solid comedy. In heads-up scenarios, see how paradise can wait is better. So for all of you, fans of Chris Rock, WATCH THIS FILM, you will like it. He has a good reputation in this film. <br /> <br /> Overall: 7 out of 10
