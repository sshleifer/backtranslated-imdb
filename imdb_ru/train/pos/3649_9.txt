When I was a student, I saw a lot of television films, most of which are a common waste of time that American television throws. This one, however, was well thought out and prepared, and at the end it had a very pleasant turn. Seeing only Richard Dean Anderson at MacGyver and Stargate, I was surprised by his excellent performance, and not the rather set of expressions from AB that he usually gives. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after quite a long time associated with The Fly II. Also nice to see Robert Guillaume again in the lead role. I can't say that I ever took Jane Lives seriously after her days with Benny Hill, but she almost managed to cope with her role. In general, a highly recommended movie.
