It seems that there is no middle ground in this film! Most of this happens in a dream and, like most dreams, is often stupid and illogical. It is also a great performance with great songs and great performances, especially from our angel. <br /> <br /> Janette’s ruthlessness, ignorant insults and other dreams of taking dreams are ridiculous, and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes surprise and delight. At some point, she begins to sing an excerpt from Carmen, followed by the final trio of Faust (for some strange reason holding a dog), then “Aloha Oe” on the beach! <br /> <br /> This surreal comedy is incredibly interesting if you can get into the groove.
