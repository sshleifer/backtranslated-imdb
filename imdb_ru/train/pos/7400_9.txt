This is a great story of family loyalty, which, fortunately, does not resort to ordinary tricks (or, at least, to those that I used to see in American and European films) about super sense or high dramatic tension. It is very watchable and very attractive. It has some beautiful cinematography, but does not rely on this one to entertain.
