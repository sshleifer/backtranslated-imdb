This is very helpful if you are familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place. First of all, these ladies are NOT geishas, ​​they are Oiran (prostitutes) in “green houses” like Yoshiwara, around 1860, give or take. This should help clarify some details that may confuse the ignorant. The film deals with issues of loyalty, love and, perhaps most importantly, how people cope with misfortunes, both their own and those of others in their immediate environment. This plus an outrageous picture along with obsessively beautiful music, make for a wonderful trip. Just turn it on, suspend your disbelief and enter their world. You will not be disappointed.
