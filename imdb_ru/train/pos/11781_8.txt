The documentary presents an original theory about "weapons, microbes and steel." The series graphically depicts several episodes that fully support the theory, and protects the theory from general criticism. <br /> <br /> I was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about the lack of new information in these series. They say that the documentary represents information that is taught in high school. Indeed it is. In fact, I really liked the original view of the information that I knew from high school, and an unexpected analysis. <br /> <br /> So, if you like to know WHY it works, if you disassemble the phone, try to find out how it works, if you went to the farm to see how the farm works and how to milk the cows, you like this series. A definite recommendation.
