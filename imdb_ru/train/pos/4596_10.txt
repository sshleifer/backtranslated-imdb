This is Jackie Chan's best movie and my personal favorite. After the disappointing U.S made The Defender, directed by James Glikenhaus, Jackie took the concept and sent it to Hong Kong. This is also probably Jackie’s most brutal film, when viewers squeeze bone breaking tricks. <br /> <br /> The action is fast and furious, Jackie and his team really did their best to create a design battle. In the process of making this film, as you will see from the titles, the bones were broken and blood was shed. <br /> <br /> Scenario - the case of ordinary police and robbers, nothing special, because it was written around the action. I have to say that in the English version there is some tricky duplication, but this should not repel you much. <br /> <br /> So collect the guys, open the beer and enjoy. By the way, the crew got the nickname “Glass Story”. What for? I'll let you find out for yourself!
