Given the nature and origins of 11 filmmakers, it is not surprising that this film is at best neutral with respect to America. Probably the most "anti" segment belongs to Ken Loach, who definitely does not tow the line of the British New Labor Party. Although these events a year ago were shocking and painful for most Americans and most viewers who saw them unfold live on CNN, etc., Most authors and directors prefer to show that the tragedy is not an American monopoly. If anyone is surprised that these 3,000 deaths have the same weight in other places as the West gives thousands of Tutsi, Tamil, Bosnian, Chilean, Kurdish victims (if we go further). If it was a call for “awakening” for states, then it’s just as tragic that in the next 12 months the Israeli-Palestinian deadlock is still far from resolved, while George W. Bush. revenge rather than make the world more secure. I think many of the participants are wondering where the idealism of the founding fathers went, and why America, originally built as a bulwark of freedom, justice and tolerance, now sees paramount importance for its own interests, while third world countries are wondering where the next drink, food or bullet goes from.
