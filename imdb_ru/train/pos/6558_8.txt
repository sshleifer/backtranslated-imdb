I do not agree with the previous comment about this film. I think it was cute and fun, and it carried a good message for young girls like my daughter. You do not need to dress like a cheap prostitute to be cool. You can be smart, beautiful and stylish at the same time. <br /> <br /> I think the actors were good and the story was good for the target audience. In general, my wife, daughter (10 years old) and I thought it was a good movie. I certainly recommend it. It also prompted my daughter to start reading the original puzzles of Nancy Drew, which I am sure she will love just as I loved Hardy Boys. <br /> <br /> It was hard to get her to sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading right now. I canâ€™t think of a better result for this film than to spark interest in this classic series.
