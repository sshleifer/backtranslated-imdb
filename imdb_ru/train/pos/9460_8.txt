I liked the story. Somewhere on the poster it was said that there are no families like the one in this film. Well maybe it should be. I thought everyone seemed really human and believable. What a higher class. What a great music on the soundtrack. How sweet and good that is, but most of all I will say two words to recommend this film. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell. <br /> <br /> He really showed a nice Thin depth that touched me. He really commanded as a widower who devoted himself, perhaps, too much, to first become a good father, at the cost of denying his own needs. <br /> <br /> Did he act like an irritable ass? Yes, yes, he did. <br /> <br /> And you see, that's what was perfect in this film. The actor who played this character made me believe that he FEELS something, and not just REALLY, as if he feels something, and he perfectly conveyed to me what he felt, and what he felt was denied . <br /> <br /> Denied to happiness. <br /> <br /> Refused. <br /> <br /> Denied love. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s painfully impossible to lose your love, and many of them will never feel something like that again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I gave him eight out of ten.
