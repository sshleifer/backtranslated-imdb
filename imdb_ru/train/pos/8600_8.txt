For my part there was some doubt about what this film has to offer. To begin with, the casting did not seem right. Kiefer Sutherland had already performed well in “24,” and the preview did not seem to offer anything difficult for him or the audience. Eva Longoria seemed inappropriate, and the rest did not seem very interesting to me. <br /> <br /> When the movie finally ended, I was not completely unhappy because I saw a decent thriller that could have been much better if the responsible parties were a little more concerned about watching narrative gaps and more cared about character development. We have already encountered similar threats, and this made the main conflict much more difficult for the authors. As an audience, we don’t want to see the same old story again. We want to see something else, be delighted and have fun. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with casting. From the delightful first lady Kim Basinger. She wears herself with enough grace and sex appeal to make her memorable. Michael Douglas was and did this before. Unfortunately, the president is not an organization that even cares about his fate. Sutherland rephrases his “24” cool approach with enough power to make it big enough for a large screen, and Eve does a decent job as a novice. <br /> <br /> Don't expect so many turns and fireworks as some of the recognized classics (“North to Northwest” and “Fugitive” come to mind). Leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride, whatever it may be. It's okay
