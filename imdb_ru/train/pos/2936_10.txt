If only Eddie Murphy was born 10 years later. Then we all remember it. But even I was only 4 years old when he came out. If you haven’t seen this yet, hire Dr. Dolittle, Showtime, I'm a Spy, Pluto Nash, and all Eddie's family comedy films - then watch this. Hands down, you will laugh 90% of the time. The remaining 10% you wipe tears from his eyes. <br /> <br /> It’s really necessary to watch more than once to understand all jokes. From rude humor to jokes for kids! (If you saw it, you will laugh here) - you will like its things. If you can (or are a big fan) try downloading clips from Eddie’s acts. Many shows are different, as you imagine, and he has even more funny jokes. <br /> <br /> But it looks like Eddie Murphy's “best of”, who received an “X” rating, if you like. <Br /> <br /> And all I can say is, please don’t watch Rabies if you don’t like comedy, you don’t have a sense of humor or you don’t like to hang out. You just put off this great classic Eddie Murphy and maybe make someone miss it. <br /> <br /> If you want to know how Eddie got the Beverly Hills Policeman and got famous from him, this is crazy.
