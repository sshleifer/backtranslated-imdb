The Home Room deals with Colombine-like shooting in high school, but instead of hastily dealing with the incident itself, the film depicts the consequences and what happened to the survivors, their trauma, guilt and denial. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * The shooting itself is considered to be a foregone conclusion, without any action other than the reaction of an almost teenage special forces special forces after the shooting of the school killer. In the film, the three main characters; a detective investigating a crime in which there were no convicted perpetrators, and two teenage girls who survived the incident, performed by a very young Erica Christensen and the Busy Philip. <br /> <br /> Two girls have nothing in common, except Because of this, filming is started, and the drama begins. <br /> <br /> Erica Christensen, although only about 24 people were around, so the audience of the film is largely familiar with her solid and reliable style of play. The busy Philip, three years older than Christensen and completely unknown to me, struck me with his amazing dramatic power and presence on the screen. This girl was a part. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, and it connects you with your attention to the fragile, but growing relationship between the two injured girls. The Elephant by Guus van Santa (2003), although good, seems almost superficial and insignificant compared to Home Room when it comes to dramatic style and acting. What I see, this film got very little time on the screen and exposure - a much greater loss for an equally traumatized America. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten
