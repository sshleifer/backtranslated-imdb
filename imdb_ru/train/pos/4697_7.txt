Michael Keaton - "Johnny Dangerous" in this role in gangster films, made in 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays his sick mother, Griffin Dunn - his brother DA, Peter Boyle - his boss, and Marilou Henner - his girlfriend. Other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays the pet shop owner in the 1930s, when he catches a child stealing a puppy, and then tells him in retrospect how he became the owner of a pet shop. At a young age, he turned to theft in order to force his mother to undergo an operation on the pancreas ($ 49.95, this week is special) and began working for the Mafia boss (Boyle). Johnny uses the surname "Danger" in the gangster world. <br /> <br /> There are several funny scenes in this movie, and Stapleton is a riot, like a mother with Johnny's dirty lips, who needs an organ in her body that has ever been replaced. Peter Boyle as boss Johnny gives a very funny performance, as does Griffin Dunn, the DA direct arrow, who won't “play the ball” with a crooked Barr (Danny DeVito). Like Johnny's sworn enemy, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri is a distinguished Moroni who torments the English language - but you have to hear how he does it, and not read about it. What is funny is that he does all this with an angry face. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, a little tired, but worth a look, and Keaton is amazing like a good boy / bad boy, Johnny. For some reason, this film was underestimated when it was released, and, like Keaton's other pearl, Night Shift, there’s not much heard about him today. With some performances and scenes that are true pearls, you will find “Johnny Perilous” incredibly enjoyable.
