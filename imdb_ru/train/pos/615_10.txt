This is the embodiment of a fairy tale! The villains are completely evil, and the characters - refreshingly clean. Fine Danes, Dénire and Pfiffer, as well as a new actor who plays the role of Tristan. Outstanding performances, delightful magic, funny and dramatic, as well as a wonderful ending of the tale make this film absolutely incredible! I'm not sure that all the content is suitable for younger children, but for the older audience there are a lot of fun subtleties! Previews don't make this movie fair! My fiancé and I were quite skeptical, but were so excited that we took a chance in this film that I can only hope to reassure someone on the fence about this film to try!
