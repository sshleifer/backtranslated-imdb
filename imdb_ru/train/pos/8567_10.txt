I liked the movie, and I would advise someone to just have a good time. Do not take the film too seriously, because remember that this is Disney and its G rating. It is good pure entertainment, although some parts can be recognized as adults, but children will never notice, especially the “triangle” between Cruella, Le Pelt and the faithful Cruella . valet Alonso. Glenn Close is fantastic and has really made Cruella her own, and she is incredibly frightening, even when she is "cured" from her fur love tricks, she can awe the viewers with her piercing cries that literally shake the theater. (I even found myself jumping in my chair when she caught you off guard with her “bipolarity” as a dog who loves Ella.) In general, I will go to watch it again in cinemas, I found that I like it so much.
