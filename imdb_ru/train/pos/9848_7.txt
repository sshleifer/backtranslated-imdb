I watched this film with my childish eyes, and I was not disappointed. The story is well known: some abandoned orphan needs to be brought to parents with the help of an incredible trio (a mammoth is a saber-toothed tiger and a lazy animal) ... And I don’t want to forget to mention the incredible little animal of rage with its hazenut. It really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture. <br /> <br /> Briefly: it works, it is funny, and it’s necessary to see your children (they will like it).
