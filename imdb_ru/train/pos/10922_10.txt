When I was very young, on a local television station on Saturdays they showed films of kung fu of all kinds. On weekends I saw a lot of kung fu movies. I remember a lot of them. I have seen such wonderful films as Crippled Masters, Bruce's Blind Fist, Kung Fu Zombies, Drunken Shaolin Monk, Master Fury, Dragon Tattoo and ... Five Deadly Poisons. I remember that day well. Me and my dad just had lunch at Burger King. Let's see what movie will be this Saturday. We ran into the house, jumped on the couch, turned on the TV and switched it to 56. The usual entry for many kung-fu clips in the background with the words "Kung Fu Saturday" over it. Then under this was the name of the film. He said Five Deadly Poisons. Then the film began. I plunged into my burger, amused by the sequence of lending. I liked this movie as soon as it appeared. My favorite character was Toad Venom. The plot was difficult to follow at this age, but this is not what lured me ... it was a fight. The fights were so ... Amazin g.I groaned every time a commercial appeared, and soon the 2 hours of the best movie I had ever seen ended.
