Paul was completely disrupted by one of the main ones who created Dave. This is the same story, though not so funny. <br /> <br /> This morning Paul told me about the scene in which Sammy Davis sings the new anthem of Parador. he arrived in Brazil after a long flight from Vegas, three planes, a trip by car, etc. he could barely stand, had to use a cane. he stopped in a trailer the size of my bathroom. <br /> <br /> he did not know that he could do it. Then he saw a crowd of 6,000 extras, paid 7 dollars. he came to life, and they filmed the scene for two hours. he was great, and then he almost collapsed. <br /> <br /> Paul is a great guy, albeit a very liberal guy. real talent.
