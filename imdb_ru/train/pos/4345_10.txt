Not surprisingly, this film won 4 prices, a film that clings to any soul, no wonder why Paul Reiser took 20 years to finally give up and talk to Peter Falk about his idea. I can understand every part of it, it's a movie that makes you cry, or just tears, or thousands. <br /> <br /> History: 10/10 When Sam Kleinman receives a letter from his wife that she leaves him to find something else, his son and he go on a journey to find her, and while they doing this, they find something lost, friendship, family and affection for each other. At the beginning you know what will happen, but, nevertheless, the story is not so easy to understand, from beginning to end, this is the journey of the father and his son, as well as the husband and his wife. Not surprisingly, it took Paul Reiser 20 years to write this beautiful novel / comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors: 10/10 Well, you can't say anything else about what I'm going to say, hey, this is with Peter Falk in him he is a legend, everything he does in movies - this is magic, when you use Peter Falk in a novel / comedy, what do you think you get? Excellent results, no wonder that this film is so perfect and won so many prices. Since the son Paul Reiser does an excellent job with his work, although he is not always a good actor, this does not mean that in fact it did not work. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser play the perfect Father and Son, the rest of the cast are good enough, but you don’t see so many of them, just say that they do what they have to make it shine even more. <br /> <br /> Music: 10/10 This does not always work when using music, sometimes it just doesn’t fit, but it’s not what you need in this film, the music sounds perfect, it makes the film even more convincing. This part of the film will shine just as well as other parts, an excellent soundtrack for a novel / comedy that is accurate. <br /> <br /> Overall: 10/10 There are so many movies about the novel / comedy on tapes, DVDs, Blu-Ray and what not, but this film is one of the special ones. there is no everyday that you can create such a story, it takes years thinking about it, and the fact is that what you really need to do is a great work that you need to buy and save in human soul, see it. When you grow old and see it with your father in old age, I think this film will flare up like no other.
