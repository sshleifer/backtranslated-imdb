I watched this movie on the Hallmark Channel and thought it was wonderful, especially since it is based on a real person. Pierce Brosnan was very good as a lonely Englishman who took on the role of the half owl of the Gray Owl. The photo was beautiful. <br /> <br /> This film made me explore more of this character Archie Belani, known as the Gray Owl. I want to read about him as much as possible. At that time I did not know that Richard Attenborough was in charge of this. But I am not surprised. I like all his films, regardless of whether he plays or the director. I gave him the highest rating. However, I would like to see more in the film about WHY he took on this person, because only two aunts who brought him and his room in their house are shown in it. <br /> <br /> You canâ€™t go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language or contrived special effects every few minutes.
