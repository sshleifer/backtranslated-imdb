In the movie guide for the Santa Barbara Film Festival, where I came to when I was in Hollywood, I noticed that this film was in a show. In fact, it is planned to elect a new chairman of the Hong Kong Triadic Society, Wo Singh, so that you can imagine how much violence will occur during this. The struggle is between the “candidates” Lam Lok (Simon Yam) and Big Dee (Tony Leung Ka Fay) for control of the oldest and most powerful part of the Triad in society. Also starring Louis Koo in the role of Jimmy Lee, Nick Chung in the role of Jet, Cheng Siu Faye in the role of Mr. So, Lam Suet in the role of big head and Lam Ka Tung in the role of Kuhn. There are some good realistic corruption themes and moments, almost enough actions, except, perhaps, when the police intervene, but a sequel has followed, so this is a pretty worthwhile crime drama. Fine!
