Do not read anything about this film (especially nothing that could contain spoilers). Just watch this amazing movie without knowing anything about it, and you’ll get a really great experience. If you like to watch an intelligent, perverted story: go get a DVD and you really won't be disappointed. “Cypher” is not really a science fiction film, rather a psycho-thriller based in a globalized business. We are talking about corporate secrets, about how big companies are spying on each other’s research departments, and on the methods they use. The actors perform well, and the overall visual style of the film provides an ideal chill mode. Cypher is much deeper, more complex and - what belongs to the story and the final - is also much, much more satisfying than the other films of Vincenzo Natalie "The Cube" and "Nothing". In fact, this is one of the best films I've ever seen (and this is something that I don’t really say about every fifth well-made movie). Sorry, I can’t tell you more about this movie without risking harm to your experience. Just give him a chance. ;-)
