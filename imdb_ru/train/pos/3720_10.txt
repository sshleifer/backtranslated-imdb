Joel Schumacher made the choice when he chose this cast and this script. The story is well written and well thought out, and this brand new composition of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant. It seemed that there were 6 “leads” and about half a dozen support, and, of course, this is the best thing in the film, the fresh young faces of tomorrow. It has been a long time since Hollywood touched scandalous films about the Vietnam War, which say something about “stories to be told” (as Schumacher claims) and the lands of Tigerland during this period of the best war films. And yet he cannot be called a war film, because it seems to be more based on the human spirit of Bozts and others. I think that anyone who just wants to see a good movie without all the special effects, but just a good, tough drama, should go see Tigerland, obviously, the work of Schumacher Best over the past 8 years.
