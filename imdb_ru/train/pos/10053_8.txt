I have to admit, when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as “Steamy Romance”, I was a bit skeptical. "Steamy"? In the 1968 movie ?? I was ready for disappointment. And when I realized that it was shot completely in black and white, I realized that my erotic hopes were dashed. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong! Not only did this movie contain all the elements of the twin novel - revealing first love, fear of revealing secrets, unexpected unexpected ends - but sometimes this film was completely erotic. Soon you will forget that it was shot in black and white. Cinematography deserves every award she has received over the years. The performances of two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. So, to both of them for twenty, they try to play school girls. This is the year 1968. Do you really expect 60s teenagers to be able to effectively explore such a lesbian love story? At that time, many adult women were still trying to cope with their sexuality. Anyone looking for real teenagers is expecting too much. <br /> <br /> I think this film is far ahead of its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; yet he still managed to leave much to the imagination, instead he decided to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that lesbians identify themselves with the characters here. As for you guys who like to watch lesbians in action: although it will not be what you expect, I do not think that you too will be too disappointed.
