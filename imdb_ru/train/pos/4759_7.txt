Elegant little episode, played mostly for laughter, but with a smart portion of waiting. Somehow, the Martian slipped on a broken bus on the road to nowhere, but what kind of passenger is it (talking about your illegal immigrants!). Auxiliary cast of all the stars: from Jack Elam's wild eyes (shamelessly flirting) to sexy Jean Willes (if she is a Martian, then I say, let's open the borders!) and Barney Phillips (and a pleasant turnaround from Bill Candice as a bus driver). Makes for a very interesting half an hour, even if the action is limited to one set.
