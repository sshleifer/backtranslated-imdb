"Matador" plays the role of Pierce Brosnan as a burned killer. His name is James Bond in too narrow, bright clothes, gold chains and an ugly hairstyle. Our fighting killer, Julian Noble, is in Mexico, trying to regain his composure. Staying at the same hotel is a pleasant, unlucky businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), also trying to regain his balance. Danny is desperate to make a deal and return to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. <br /> <br /> Noble and Wright suddenly become friends. Wright convinces Noble to reveal certain tricks he demonstrates on the bullfight. In the end, Noble became a target for his employers and appeared in Denver. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter and director Richard Shepard shot questions and answers after this amazing film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard is also out of luck. Having suffered the loss of his agent and the abandonment of recent scenarios, he decided to write a story that no one would buy, and create a character that no one wants to play. Then Pierce Brosnan called. Brosnan restores the balance in this film. (There is life after Bond!) He has a wonderful talent for self-deprecating comedy. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Stay in the closing credits to read what directors say about bullfighting. I look forward to new projects by Richard Shepard.
