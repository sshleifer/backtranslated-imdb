This is a wonderful film with a funny, intelligent history and the dynamics of cultural differences, as well as the theme of what is important in life, makes this film very undervalued. Don't let the cynics of the world stop you from seeing it. Keaton has wonderful moments, and Iâ€™m surprised at the fact that comedy is never appreciated, because actors like Keaton make the transition from humor to serious things extremely easy. Great movie around!
