In several posters it was quoted that Renoir declares his desire to make a film in which Ingrid Bergman is smiling in front of the camera. The short answer is: aren't we all, although the harsh reality is that only a few have to do this? At this stage in his career, Bergman could not be arrested; in 1949 she left Hollywood to make a picture in Europe, fell in love with director Roberto Rossellini and never looked forward to it. After five turkeys in Italy, she was probably ready to open a vein, but within a year, having done this for Renoir, she returned to where she was supposed to be, and with Oscar, to load Anastasia. This is one of three films that Renoir made in color in about this time, and in general he is better than the Golden Coach, which is not difficult, and even from the French Can Can. Renoir probably believed that with such a strong desire Bergman could get away with a pair of leading men from wood, and Renoir chose two Douzies from Jean Marais and Mela Ferrer, in both cases solid mahogany. The plot is actually based on a real incident in French history, but Renoir is content to give it a little frivolous and focus on replicating his father's paintings in the production after the production. In his pastel colors, he recalls another film from the period Les Grandes Manouvres, which is not bad. In general, it remains a pleasant trifle, showing a beautiful and charismatic actress.
