You cannot often enjoy this gem, the Invisible Ray of 1936. But no one can forget it. The story is elegant. Karloff, stern and embittered in his solitude in the Carpathian Mountains, is the brilliant scientist Janos Ruch, who reads the ancient rays of light to find out events in the great geological past, especially the crash of a powerful radioactive meteor in Africa. He is joined by the eternally elegant Lugosi (like a rare hero), who studies astrochemistry. Francis Drake is a beautiful, under-used young wife; Frank Lawton is a romantic temptation; and the divine Violet Kemble Cooper - Mother Ruch, in a play worthy of Mary Ospenska. <br /> <br /> The story quickly unfolds in bold episodes with special effects that are still beautiful. It also contains some great lines. Rukh alone restores his mother's vision, he asks, “Mom, can you see, can you see?” “Yes, I can see more clearly than ever. And what I see scares me. " Even better, when Mother Rukh says: "He broke the first law of science." I am not alone among my acquaintances that for many years I have been puzzled over what this first law of science is. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely a desert island material.
