A wonderful family drama / comedy with McClean and Garr in the title role, which entertains and warms the heart every time I see it. It is highly recommended for all ages from 9 years to grandmothers. Beautiful historical period, shot in 1962. The story encompasses a struggling Garr, her two children, and aunt Xena (McClain), trying to make ends meet without a man as head of the family. The Family is heading west to receive the inheritance of a long-forgotten relative who left Garr in an abandoned, decrepit roadside cafe right in the late 1940s. Steady Garr, like a sweet but determined mother, involves the whole family in the restoration and opening of the cafe. But wait ... Aunt Xena is an old circus actress with card tricks, magic powders and a sense of humor ... she loves to involve children and her in silly and sometimes dangerous games ... ... What happens next is so adorable the combination of “Miracle in Lords”, thrown along with Cuban missile crises (with genuine television news from a real event) and a “ghostly” joke that is completely out of control. This film entertains, philosophizes, questions religiousness and gives a nervous impression of the frightening threat of the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962. In the end, there remains the miracle of faith, family and newfound love. Oh, and the music of the early 60s is simply gorgeous! <br /> <br /> RECOMMENDED TO STRONGLY FEEL FILM FEEL 10 of 10
