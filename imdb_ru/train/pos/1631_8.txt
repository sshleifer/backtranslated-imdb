This film has it all. Fun, subtle jokes, puns and poems. We are talking about a rag group of boys from different ethnic and social classes who come together to defeat a common enemy. If you look at it several times, you will find that you quote it as Animal House (and yes, I also love Animal House). I put in the top 15 funniest movies. A major in the boys' military academy is paranoid that every child is bad and wants to get in trouble (in this film he is right). He is a sadist, indifferent, cruel and should be removed. A group of boys who do not get along at first will eventually come together to survive and get rid of a major with a stupid plan that only Mad Magazine could write. Be sure to take a look - you will like it!
