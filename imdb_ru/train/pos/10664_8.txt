Anyone else crying with tears of joy when watching this movie? I like it! One of my top 10 movies of all time. It makes me feel good. I watch the final number with all the actors over and over again !!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) - movie babe, IMHO! I have never seen a play, but I get angry when I read reviews that say the play was better than the movie. They are like apples and oranges. The film making process rarely delivers a finished product that matches the original work. I believe that just because of the fear of social exclusion, many famous works adapted to the screen have not changed more than they. This is a very good movie, it is very nice. That's all you need to know!
