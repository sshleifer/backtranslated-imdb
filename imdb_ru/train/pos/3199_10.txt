Well, I donâ€™t think that Trailer Park Boys have bad storylines because they kick ass. They just ... conflict with each other. <br /> <br /> For example: near the end of the film, Ricky and Julian tell "Patrick Lewis" to lower the dog and leave. Then, in the end, it shows that Ricky and Julian say they are in prison for 2 years. In the pilot series, the first video they show is the same as Ricky and Julian shout at Patrick Lewis. But in the series, they were supposedly in prison for only 18 months. <br /> <br /> In addition, they have the impression that the plotline of the film and the plotline of the television series are connected (due to the screaming scene between the guys). But some actors portray completely different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays Patrick Lewis in the film, but in the series, he plays Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys who pays Ricky for extermination, and then he plays Sam Losco on the show. <br /> <br /> Also (again ... I know I have something to say), In the movie, the guys sniff the cola instead of smoking. The fact is that they never confirm that these two plot lines are connected in any way, except for the scream scene. <br /> <br /> Sorry to keep talking.
