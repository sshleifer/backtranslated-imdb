After some negative reviews I heard about this film, I tried with doubt, but I had 3.99 pounds sterling in my wallet, and I thought that I could buy a budget such as a film, and looked at it, gave it back, and I am glad I liked it. Directed by the stars of films such as Chain Reaction, The Ring, Born's Identification (Brian Cox), I had to play with it, even if it was rubbish, but it wasn't at all, I found some of the humor funny, especially Alfred Molina Star Spider-Man 2 Character Doc Ok. He was the most excellent part of the movie. Of course, like many other people who bought this film, I saw the name Matthew, and that made me get it! and no, his role is not big at all, it is very short at the very end of the film, itâ€™s not much that makes me believe, so people hate the film. I suggest you try. Some parts are a poor pit that needed polishing, action, and a little more action. But it is watchable.
