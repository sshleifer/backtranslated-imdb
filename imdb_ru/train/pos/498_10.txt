This is what I expected when the Star Trek DS9 premiere. Not for light DS9. It was a wonderful show in itself, but it never gave the fans more than what they wanted. Enterprise is a show. Having similarities with the original track, it is quite different to be original in its own way. This makes research ideas exciting for us again. And it was one of the main ingredients that made the original so loved. Another component of success was the relationship that developed between the crew members. The viewers really cared deeply about the film crew. The company has many prospects in this area. Chemistry between Bakula and Blalock seems very promising. Although sexual tension in a show can often become a foothold, I feel that tension in an enterprise can lead to much more and say much more than usual. I think that when we deal with such large-scale characters of different races or species, we have very interesting ideas and television. In addition, we have to mention the performances, Blalock is very convincing, because the Vulcan T'pol and Bacula do have the whims and strength of character that provide excellent performance. The rest of the cast also performed well. My only problems are as follows. Theme. This is good, this is different, but a little frivolous for my taste. We need something more ambitious. Should not be orchestral. Maybe something with a little more electronic sound will be enough. And one more complaint. They sell too many supplements. They could fix this by selling less advertising or doing all the shows by two partners. Otherwise, we will eventually see that the final act of the show will be curtailed too quickly, as was one of my complaints about Voyager.
