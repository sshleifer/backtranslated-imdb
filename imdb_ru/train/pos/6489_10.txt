I watched this show when it first came out in the 70s. I was 14 years old, and I watched it in the house of my best friends, since my dad did not want to watch it. It became a weekly ritual every Sunday, and, like anyone who wishes, to say that two fourteen-year-olds watch a documentary in almost respectful silence, should mean that it was something special. <br /> <br /> The wide dissemination of the events of World War II makes the subject matter of the document difficult. the creators broke it into what they considered to be the most significant key events, and dedicated one episode to each. Some episodes spanned long periods, such as the "wolf pack", which covered almost all the six years of the Battle of the Atlantic. while the battle of Stalingrad had one episode. <br /> <br /> This documentary could not be made today simply because most of the respondents are dead. The list of significant players on the list provides an amazing insight into the thinking of that time. Anthony Eden's foreign minister, Karl Donnitz, Seeing the submarine, Albert Speer, a self-confident pet architect, and then Hitlerâ€™s arms minister. In one of the later episodes, we see Junge's traudla, Hitler's secretary, who was with him in the bunker, and it was she who dictated his last will and testament - she left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and ran along Russian lines. These and many others play a major role in the realism of the events depicted. <br /> <br /> If I have any criticism of the series such that the code crackers of Bletchley Park are not included, but the revelations about their participation in the war appeared only after the series was made, so I can not blame software developers. <br /> <br /> The introductory titles and music are gorgeous, and the story of Lawrence Olivier gives the script a natural seriousness. <br /> <br /> Best documentary series ever created? without a doubt
