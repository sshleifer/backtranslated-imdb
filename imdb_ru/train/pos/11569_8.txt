"Itch in Time" Bob Clampetta milks seven minutes of insane action from a very small background. Elmer Fadd tells his dog that if he scratches himself again, he will be given a terrible wash. Unfortunately for a dog, a relentless flea makes it almost impossible to stop scratching. The cartoon switches between the progress of the flea inside the dog’s fur and the dog’s desperate attempts to deal with it. In a perfect sequence that truly reflects an itch disorder that cannot be scratched, the dog changes color from brown to blue from red to red polka dots and plaid! It sounds ridiculously surreal, but it’s wonderful to have an indescribable feeling of itch, as only Clampett could. There are several other elements that make The Itch in Time pure Clampett. There is the grotesque concept itself, which leads to some graphic scenes of fleas chewing on a dog's flesh. There is unlimited violence that raises its head in any scene involving a cat. In particular, there are dirty jokes, including a huge shot of a dog behind his back, which causes a wolfish whistle of fleas and a hysterical sequence in which the dog tries to scratch, dragging his back along the floor. He pauses for a moment, turning to the audience: “Hey, I better stop this. With a very limited concept, Clampett manages to make The Itch in Time a unique, trivial-based cartoon. As in the early episode of “Seinfeld”, “The Itch in Time” practically says nothing, but is very funny.
