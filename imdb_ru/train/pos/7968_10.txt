I first saw this film when I was 6-7 years old, and I did not think that it was something special. As time went on, I watched it several times, and it began to grow in me when I began to understand the manners of the film, which I will discuss later. For a while I left this film alone and for a while did not watch it. When I was looking for an old classic movie to watch a few weeks ago (I'm 15 now), I dug out VHS in my homeland. After watching, I stayed at a natural maximum, which I could not explain. The film gives you a stunning feeling of joy that you never expect. The nature of films about three completely different animals, working with each other to find their way home, really sends home a message stating that no matter how different you are, you can always find a common language, what you all need. The way the personalities of the characters are chosen is truly fantastic. That you have an old, knowledgeable, wise golden retriever who looks after or directs the “chance” of a funny, loving but slightly awkward young American Bulldog, with a daring smart, vulnerable, but self-confident cat. The film tells about these three friends or companions in a journey that is so really impossible that it creates magic, so you start to believe that this journey can occur. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to sound like a soft-tissue grabber when it comes to films, I assure you that I’m completely opposite, but the most inspiring part of this film no doubt comes back when the shadow is Shadow is desperate to run away and accidentally, and cheekily, it hurts him to leave. When both animals return to their beloved masters, silence ensues, until a shadow settles on the horizon to be in awe of everyone. There is a fine line between warming and banal garbage, but this film is pure magic even at 15 years old. This film may not be the lord of the rings, but Disney can make such a fantastic film using animals and raise himself to how it happens even at this age, he deserves 10/10.
