This is one great Sammo Hung movie. In fact, this is a great part of a Hong Kong action movie. The story tells the story of rickshaw drivers in Macau, who are looking for love and confused with the vicious pimp. The performances are excellent, and the characters are nice and clear. This story involves and has enough romance, drama, comedy and expectation so that you can watch the battle scene. Sammo Hung proves that he is probably the best choreographer in business. The action is awesome, especially the fight with Lau Kar Leung and the final. Billie Chow and Sammo Hung are awesome. A must see for any action fan.
