This is a very long film, which means that you may become very bored before it becomes interesting, but its length enables its characters to find a constant affection in your sympathies. <br /> <br /> If you are touched by a sense of guilt from the abominable you will find it especially heartbreaking, because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak. If you can love a monster, you will cry about Magnus Pima, the spy who betrays everyone - especially his country, his friends and family - a person whom the same people have manipulated and molded since childhood. <br /> <In the whole story, there is not a single truly cute character, not a single true, “moral” person who can sympathize with. But it would be great to watch all this without the help of cloth. <br /> <br /> In the end, I really liked it. It is worth it for people who love inflammatory films about a lowly human character.
