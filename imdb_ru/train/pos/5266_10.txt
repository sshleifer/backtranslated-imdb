Well, some people will say that this particular film stinks ... but hey! It's not right, not right ... The film may not have the best special effects, and they may not have the best actors (Except for the superiority of Barbarian Bros.) Despite this minor fact, I can honestly say that this is one of The funniest movies I've ever seen, and I saw them all!
