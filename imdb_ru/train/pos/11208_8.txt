Oh, where are you going, my little, little ... <br /> <br /> Turn around and you two, turn around, and you four ... <br /> <br /> I remember these shows when they were first shown at Disneyland. I remember sitting there, excited by Werner Van Brown’s explanation of rocket science. I watched as history, science, and humor intertwined in an exciting history of opportunity. <br /> <br /> This was fifty years ago. And the show is again in the Disney Treasure series, and what a treasure they are. I watched them last night and tonight with my 8-year-old daughter, who at first did not even go into the room, but later changed her mind when she saw that they were partially revived. As she watched, I looked at her, and by the end she was almost as engrossed as I was. <br /> <br /> Turn around and you are a young wife with your own babies ... <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is still fairly accurate, and the overall presentation is still impressive. I thought that my daughter’s teacher might want to show them to her class, not only as a 50-year-old artifact, but also as funny and easy-to-understand history lessons. <br /> <br /> Turn around, turn around, turn around and again ... you wonder how much has changed in 50 years.
