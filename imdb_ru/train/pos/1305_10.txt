This film took me by surprise when it started in a cafe in Arizona, and Richard Grieco (Rex), “Dead Easy”, '04, decides to eat something, and he gets hot and tired very hot, sexy waitress while Rex comes out of the cafe, he sees a state soldier and asks him: "ARE YOU QUICKLY?" and then all hell breaks up in many ways than one. Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt), "Dressed to kill," 80 years old, is a television reporter and is always looking for news feeds for broadcast. Maggie finds herself in a hot tub, and Rex calls her to tell her that he wants a Western-style show with a local top cop in town. This is another film, however, Nancy Allen and Richard Greco are the only two actors who help this film TOGETHER!
