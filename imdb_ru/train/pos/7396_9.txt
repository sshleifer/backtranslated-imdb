Another outstanding foreign film that completely concerns the endless harvest of dirt coming out of Hollywood! This is the story of life and life. No, definitely not the ideal little life that is so often portrayed in completely artificial Hollywood films, but rather a real life full of real characters, each of which has its strengths and weaknesses, like real people in our life and in ourselves. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of all these lives, intertwined within the walls of this bath, and especially of its elderly owner, is magnificent, touching and evokes a lot of thoughts. <br /> <br /> Sit down, relax and get carried away in a simple and beautiful life. In this film, you can learn real wisdom, if you open yourself only for this. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
