A scientist who works desperately in solitude finds a way to detect the impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element. All the (pseudo) scientific and breakthrough technological negotiations of the 1930s are right here, including the idea that radioactivity can cure any disease if it is properly used. When he calls his rivals - who expelled him from the scientific community and ridiculed him - to witness his discovery, they offer a “joint” expedition to Africa ... of course, they end up stealing most of the doctor. The initial discovery of Rukh, which gives him only residual credit. In addition to this, the effeminate weakling who looks like an actor from a comedian from the worst Abbot & Costello (Lawton) literally steals the doctor. Rukh's young trophy wife (Drake), who falls on his heels for this piece of human being. To grow horns like a deer was not going to do a doctor. Ruch (Karloff) is any friendlier, so he starts a secret mission of revenge ... killing 2 of his enemies and a friendly doctor. Benet (Lugosi), the only one who helped him ... eventually succumbed to the death radiation, which allowed him to start his revenge from the very beginning, but (to my extreme displeasure) sparing the adulteress and this is a bad excuse for a man being married well, with Karloff and Lugosi very well. Look at the scene of the hysterical maid ... There are no other characters to mention ... It is recommended, just like ALL the old horrors of Universal ...
