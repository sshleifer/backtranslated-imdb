I love bad movies. Not only because they are often as interesting as “really” “good” films (for example, the TV series “Pirates of the Caribbean” and other Hollywood pathos), but often they are much better than these films. And this is the reason why I like Italian robbing a movie from the 1970s and 1980s. And that is why I especially love this film “Barbarians and Company”. <br /> <br /> Director Ruggero Deodato made some very good films, such as “House on the Edge of the Park”, as well as his Atlantis interceptors. “Live as a policeman,” “Die as a person,” are pleasant action films. But this is really bad. Barbarians is such an idiotic film. Peter and David Paul as barbarian brothers Kuchek and Gore are very funny because of their lack of charisma and acting skills. But if they can't act, they scream and scream every time they do something important. In one scene, people try to hang barbaric brothers, and they run away in a very unusual way. <br /> <br /> Bad game, bad special effects, a very stupid story, bad leadership, in fact, everything is bad in this film. I can't describe how much I laughed when I watched it for the first time. “Barbarians and Company” is a classic of the camp that everyone should see. If you thought Plan 9 from Space was a fun camp, it would be a real killer.
