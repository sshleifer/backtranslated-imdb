I was not only complementary to this film, I saw him in Boston in the sold-out cinema. More than a thousand fans of the Boston Red Sox / Farrelly huddle into a movie theater near Boston Common to watch a comedy ... about them .... Red Sox fanatics! Star Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon - this is a cute comedy about love and lust. Love between two young lovers. Thirst for the Red Sox, who won the world series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role. He is funny enough and most of all laughs. Barrymore, on the other hand, is the same Barrymore. At times, I felt that fellow actress Jonah Sky would be the best actor for this role. In general, all fans of the Boston Red Sox will love this movie. For the rest of the world, it's just a fun movie.
