I also just returned from the Reday advanced film, and I must say that for a long time I didnâ€™t have much fun with the film. WES CRAVEN at its best. He brings us the amazing end of the summer thriller that I so desperately craved. This is a thriller of the year .. without a doubt. <br /> <br /> All the actors are awesome, and the action is realistic and fun. F / X were great. This is a stably constructed unknown. I was on the edge of my place most of the film. Much time has passed since I heard the audience applause and claps in the theater. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a thrill, action and good story this summer, REDEYE will deliver. Go look!
