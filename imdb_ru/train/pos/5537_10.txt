It might not have been so good overall, but the second episode, which was the first one Iâ€™m talking about, was so memorable that I still remember it today. I became a Dick Francis fan. I would recommend this if you are interested in horse racing and riddles. <br /> <br /> Buddy's slang of a friend, Chico Barnes, is much more amusing to those of us who have never been close to hearing the London Bell Bells, but the main roles are attractive and the shows were interesting. <br /> <br /> Sid Gully was one of the most interesting characters of Francis, and the show actually minimizes some of the difficulties on his part. Interestingly, electronic hands, similar to those used in stories, appear to be less functional for the user than those that were invented after World War II.
