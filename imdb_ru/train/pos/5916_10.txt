I watched this movie from Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin ') one evening at www.afrovideo.org, and I didn't see anything racial (I'm not stupid), I admit that character design is a bit rude and unacceptable today, but I I think this is a satire and a very, very urban retelling of old uncle Remâ€™s stories that black culture created right down to the main characters and a glaring nod of "The Tar Baby" and "Patch Briar." Note, these are not fanatical stories, but cultural icons created black Americans, and I, being a white woman, read and love these stories. And it also seemed interesting to me about the black culture in Harlem, New York, in the 70s. This is a very interesting picture of the film: this film is a live action / animation film that begins in a live battle with a guy named Sampson (Barry White) and a Preacher (Charles Gordon), who rushes to help his friend Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) to escape from prison, but it stops the checkpoint to be in a shootout with the police. While waiting for them, Randy reluctantly listens to the runaway Pappi (Skatman Krothers), when he begins to tell Randy the lively story of Brother Rabbit, a young novice in a big city, who quickly rises from the darkness to rule Harlem; You know, for me, Rabbit, Bear and Fox are animal versions of Randy, Sampson and the Preacher. An abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and live action films, the film is a graphic and accusatory satire of stereotypes prevalent in the 70s. racial, ethnic and other. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is another GOOD film of Bakshi; and we have to sweep the movies like this under the rug? pretend they never exist? hmmm ... i think that would be a shame; I think we should watch these films and find out what is happening then how far we have come since.
