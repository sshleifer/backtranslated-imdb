It is very outdated, but this is part of the charm of this 1933 film. You can say the same for most Pre-Code films; they are just different, and usually in an interesting way. <br /> <br /> It was a short time, the magnificent game Spencer Tracy and the beautiful face and sweetness of Loretta Young's character, which made me watch and enjoy this meager, but intriguing film. <br /> <br /> It will be difficult for you to find a prettier girl than Trinna played by the 20-year-old Young, who was about to make her 50th film! (She began to act like a small child. This, and the fact that they quickly made films in the old days.) The camera, although focused for most of the film, magnified Lorette’s face and eyes many times, and I was hypnotized by her beauty. <br /> <br /> Playing a capricious man with a cynical outlook on life, thanks to Trinna “Bill” Tracy slowly turns into a loving man. Spencer presented his lines here so naturally that you barely knew that he was playing. <br /> <br /> Although they have small roles, the actors Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambo, Arthur Holl and Glenda Farrell leave indelible impressions long after watching this 75-minute film. I was especially fascinated by the role of Connolly in the role of camp minister / father. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit contrived, but - hey - these are films. This story is about two lonely victims of the Great Depression, trying to survive in a camp like “Hooverville”, and this is a very touching story.
