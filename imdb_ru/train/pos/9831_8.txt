We have high expectations with this. because his Zombi 3 is the official sequel to Zombi 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci. , , anyway . , his co-director Bruno Mattei (from Zombie Night) and not written by Dardino Sachetti, but by Claudio Fagrasso (Zombie Night) and his picture in Zombie Night films and reminiscent of Zombie Night (Hell Hell) lot. as a result, he looks more like a companion to the Living Dead Hell than Zombie 2. Fabrasio DeAngelis, who produced Zombi 2 and its editor Tomassi (?) and efx gianetto De Rossi, gave Zombi 2 his magic. Zombies 3 is not magical. This is like a peanut butter and peanut butter jelly sandwich. But over the years, I grew up to take Zombi 3. I swear I saw the version where a soldier was bitten by the hand and went to the hotel room. There was a meaningless Fulci-cut, and the Mattei / Fulci-cut was the one on the DVD.
