I like all the films of Michael Landon Jr, and the role of Michael Landon Jr in the role of Dale Midkiff in the role of Clark Davis could not be better. Dale Midkiff has ways to handle this character. <br /> <br /> This film fascinated me from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The death of the girls Missy and Willis with the time of Clarks visit was only the time of the gods. The way they coped with death and how Clark helped them do it was the love of their fathers. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 films before this [Love comes quietly, loves eternal promises and loves a long way], I feel that you can watch this film and understand it easily. And yet go away and want to watch the previous 3 films because of the story that all the characters have. <br /> <br /> Michael Landon Jr. is a great director. <br /> <br /> I look forward to many more films from him in the future.
