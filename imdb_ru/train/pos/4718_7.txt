I think this film was made in Hungary. in any case, the countryside is gorgeous, the people who play the farmers were absolutely charming. their ability to ride horses is amazing. I got to know the locals more, life on the farm, and how heroically they tried to hide Brady from the evil Nazis who were looking for these parachutists. They even sacrificed their lives on several occasions. the young orphan, with whom Brady is friends, was a sweet child. I think you will be surprised by horse riding and an attempt to evade the Nazis. in some places it is funny and comical, and in others it is very tragic. Ladies have comfortable handkerchiefs, since at the end you will be devastated. I own it, and watched it several times. in other words, not just once around the click. his keeper ....
