This is something that the whole family will like ... even those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales. Shelly Duval surpassed herself with this unique, creative take of almost all popular childhood fairy tales. The scenarios offer new twists and turns of the old ages, on which we grew up, and in each episode there are several stars. “Cinderella” is no exception to Duval's standard, and in my opinion, she is among the top five selected by Jennifer Beals (think of her from “Flashdance” - and she still plays in Hollywood here and there), the title role, Jean Stapleton like a fairy with a southern accent, and Eva Arden as the embodiment of an evil stepmother. Edie McClurg (“Ferris Bueller's Weekend”) and Jane Alden make a cheerful duet as step-sisters. Matthew Broderick is the affable Prince Henry. You will all come back for it!
