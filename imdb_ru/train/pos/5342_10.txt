I was deeply touched by this film in many ways. First of all, I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most precious little thing! Such a cute little girl. Her game was great. True to life and very human. Although I do not like the part where she had to smoke; I hope it was just a fake prop. In any case, she was absolutely wonderful, and the story was so touching. I plunged into the story and her character. <br /> <br /> I wonder how I learned this movie? I was walking in a blockbuster, and I accidentally noticed her beautiful smile on the cover when I was passing by. Fortunately, I looked down in which was this movie! I thought to myself, “Wow, look at her!” So ​​I picked it up and saw that this film was described as such wonderful things as “The Little Pearl”. I read the story on the back, and then I thought that maybe first I would look at it on IMDb, and then come back and rent it later. I am glad that I did not, because I certainly would have missed. After searching for a film with a friend of mine, I knew that in the end I would regret not having rented this film, so I went back to the place where I originally found it, and made it. <br /> <br /> I was on my dresser for a week since the school started for me this week and I really didn’t have time to watch it, but today was a great opportunity. I turned it on and was glued to a beautiful cinema, an amazing account and a moving story from beginning to end. I was so captivated and must say that some parts almost brought me to tears. <br /> <br /> I would also like to specifically mention the young boy in this film, Juan José Ballesta. He was wonderful. Also the actor who played father Carol, whose name, unfortunately, is not indicated on the site. His voice was so loving and tender that I really felt his love for Carol. Although his appearance is not very noticeable, I really felt the presence of his character. <br /> <br /> This is a really great movie. If you are a person who cares about light but emotional films, then this is definitely for you.
