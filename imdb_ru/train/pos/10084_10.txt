This exciting movie is one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. It depicts China, which I have never seen or imagined, and I believe that it shows China of the 1930s in the REAL light ever seen in the movies. It is very heartbreaking in many situations, to see how hard the life of the heroes was, and yet the story and the finale are incredibly joyful. You really see the depth and height of human existence in this film. The actors are all perfect, so you feel that you have truly entered another world. <br /> <br /> I just cannot recommend this film highly enough. It can just change you forever, as soon as you see it.
