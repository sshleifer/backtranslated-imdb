How nice that the film can be watched by the whole family together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who are married in real life) play a couple who, on a whim, marries in Las Vegas and then are forced not only to tell the news to their children, but also try to unite their households ). boys and two girls) in a single family unit. What happens when a group of four adolescents, two children and two younger children, first makes you wonder if there can ever be real happiness for Carrie and Jim. Fights between children (and one little romance between two of them) make you wonder if everyone can ever get along. More interesting than the Brady Bunch, that is an absolutely pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. Recommended as a good movie for all ages.
