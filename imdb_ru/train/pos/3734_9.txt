The non-humanizing effect of war is a very well-studied subject in cinema; as well as the inhuman, but potentially salutary, dehumanizing effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's “Tigerland” follows the standard pattern: we see that men are treated like mud, but they look like soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanders, and the question remains whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as well as the judgment of the merits of the war for which they are preparing (as, for example, here in Vietnam). But Tigerland has an interesting approach, because its focus is a daring dissident named Bozz (played very well by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power is ultimately controlled by consent, as well as a lack of awareness among their powerless complicity. , A fascinating learning plot was built around this character, and it’s also a plus that the action never leaves America (while Stanley Kubrick’s “Full Metal Jacket”, if you name just one other film of this type, lost focus after the action moved to Asia) . Although it is not a film of stunning originality, it is extremely well-made and fascinating in everything: the best film of this director that I have seen, and one of the best in its genre.
