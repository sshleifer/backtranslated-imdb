B Movie? Yes. DIY? Yes. The first movie? Yes. But aesthetically +. This film definitely had a bad sound / editing / lighting / acting / etc. etc. Problems. However, there are many positive moments in this film. First, the most annoying character dies first! Secondly, it is made to be a parody / funny movie of B Rated Horror. The comments that our killer makes to his victims made me and my friends roll on the floor laughing. <br /> <br /> The problem is that many people are trying to take each independent film and expect it to be a masterpiece. Take it for what is, a group of children straight from high school made their first film. For what it is, only this, it is really good.
