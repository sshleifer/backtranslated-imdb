I have never heard of this film, despite the connection with George Clooney (whose company produced, and he appears in a very funny role of support) and his director from Ocean 11 Steven Soderbergh. Worse, we took it to the trash for $ 4.99 (Canadian dollars!). What a wonderful and pleasant surprise. But then I am of the opinion that if William H. Macy is in it, you cannot be disappointed. It was very much like Ealing's comedy from England in the 1950s. OK, with profanity. This is a strange and sometimes funny movie. The actual robbery made me laugh so hard that I cried. Perhaps the funniest use of cowards in film history. Maybe it was the low expectations that I expected, but I looked with a group of people, and we had a blast. The best 5 dollars I've spent in recent years.
