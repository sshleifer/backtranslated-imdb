The US State Department would not want us to watch this film because they have a quarrel with the Iranian government. Nevertheless, it shows us how civilized Iran really is, despite the content of the film, which tells about the struggle of women for equal rights in the simplest form: the ability to watch a football match at the stadium, which is strictly only for a male audience. The film is ridiculously funny and in itself is evidence of freedom of speech and expression in Iran. I really liked this movie. Five girls are trying to cross the police border at the gates of a football match between Iran and Bahrain. The subsequent comedy is too funny to describe it - from a bus ride to the stadium, to police intervention and the subsequent detention of girls to the final result. Do not miss this classic movie. This MUST be seen. One of the best foreign films that I have seen in recent years.
