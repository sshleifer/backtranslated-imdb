The film “Wonders of Life” by Frank Capra. <br /> <br /> Responsibility for hard work HEMO THE Magnificent lies on the blood. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1950s, AT & T and Bell Science teamed up with famous Hollywood director Frank Capra to create a CBS television science series to tell the public about the universe around them. Far from the dark black and white food that was so often imposed on young scientists, the films “Kapra” simultaneously taught and entertained with vivid scenarios and attractive visual effects shown in “Technicolor”. Four films - OUR MR. THE SUN (1956), THE STRANGE CASE OF SPACE RAYS (1957), HEMO THE MAGNIFICENT (1957), UNKNOWN GOD (1958) - quickly became the favorites of school houses, where they were endlessly shown in 16 mm format. <br /> <br /> The star of the series was Dr. Frank S. Baxter (1896–1982), a friendly professor of English at the University of Southern California. This avuncular teacher turned out to be the ideal teacher of cinema, kindly telling his audience sometimes complex facts in a way that never made them boring or boring. Dr. Baxter, who won the Peabody Award for his achievements, continued to make high-quality educational films after the Capra quartet was completed. <br /> <br /> HEMO THE Magnificent, which was created, written and directed by Capra, tells the story of the human heart and circulatory system, using animation and gentle humor. Film star Richard Carlson acts as a science fiction writer, energetically helping Dr. Baxter tell the story of Chemo. <br /> <br /> Cinematographers recognize Stirling Holloway as part of the crew, and Marvin Miller and Mel Blanca June voices Foray & Pinto Colvig as various cartoon characters, all without accreditation. <br /> <br /> Religious Scripture, from which the film begins, fully corresponds to the tone and tone of the production.
