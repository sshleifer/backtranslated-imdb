Listen, this is probably one of the best films America can offer the rest of the world. To hate this film is to hate freedom itself. I remember that the beginning of the 80s was a time of uncertainty. The economy was weak, communism threatened us all, and nuclear annihilation was almost inevitable. Out of this confusion came the hero, Stroker Ace. The performance of Ned Beatty in this film showed that he would never again be portrayed as a one-sided victim in the desert. His triumph is inspiration for everyone. Screen chemistry between Bert and Loni makes obvious comparisons with Brad and Jennifer. Jim Sets - the poet. Go watch this movie tonight!
