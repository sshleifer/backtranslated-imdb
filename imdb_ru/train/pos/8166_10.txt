This movie is very good! The game is good, with an excellent performance of the role of Corbin Burnsen as a perfectionist and dentist, who is frantic and torments his patients. In the beginning he sees his wife with a machine gunner, and then he goes mad. He also avenges his wife and the pool, except for the patients he torments. Most of the special effects are also beautiful, although some of them are really fake (for example, a drilled tongue that lain 1 night outside and is still red in the morning). But the torture scenes are absolutely well done. Although this film has a weak point in that it is very slow; between heavy parts sometimes extremely boring parts. But for a true horror / thriller fan, itâ€™s a must-see!
