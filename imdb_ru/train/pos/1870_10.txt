This movie is great! It touched my stone cold heart. I could not talk about the racial discrimination that Antwon faced because I live in my own country. I think it is really difficult to discriminate. <br /> <br /> We watched this film in our sociology lesson at the University of New Era, and I did not know that it was a true story, I thought that it had just been created by an intellectual who wants to bring fresh air into the industry. It is very good. <br /> <br /> I was shocked by what Nadine had raped Antwone (who was only six years old) sexually. If I were in his place, I could jump into a ten-story high-rise building. I salute him for being so strong! <br /> <br /> The scene that touched me here is when Antwon finally saw his mother Eve face to face. He did not scold her or anything else; instead, he told her about the achievements he had gained in the long years that they were divided. (I think I'll do it when I have the opportunity to trace my roots.)
