"Sky Castle" is undoubtedly the film Hayao Miyazaki. Seeing this for the first time, I am glad to say that it does not disappoint. On the contrary, you get time, which means (as for Miyazaki films), it is nothing short of excellent! <br /> <br /> Created at the beginning of his cinematic career, “Castle in the Sky” foresees many of the trademarks in his later films, when strong (but young) female characters, forced to grow due to external circumstances, helped a lot interesting (and sometimes attractive) supporting characters. And, of course, the usual battle of nature against civilization, aircraft (a lot!), Beautiful painted landscapes ?? but, alas, no pigs (at least I noticed it, because I only saw it once). However, Miyazaki had already received his theatrical debut two years earlier with Nausicãa, which was the dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke, his opus Magnum. "Castle in the Sky" is part of these two, with soft performances, stuffed the first 30 minutes, reminiscent of his episode "Conan" and his directorial episodes of Meitantei Holmes. Here we meet Shita, a girl who literally falls from the sky, but she is found by Pazu, a young man who works in a small town in the countryside. Intrigued by the amnesia and suspicious connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa, Pazu is going to help her find out where she came from, avoiding the army and the gang of air pirates. As the movie progresses, the story gets harder and more interesting, revealing Miyazaki at its best. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is very reminiscent of “Spirited Away” (or vice versa, since “The Castle in the Sky” was created first), and, like its director Joe Hisaishi, the composer, begins with a very easy score, this It becomes more complex and beautifully suitable as the plot progresses! <br /> <br /> An English dubbing note, with a good interpretation from the two main stars, although Sheet Anna Paquin has a very strong accent (which the actress still had at that moment in her career), and Directed to Mark Hamil in Muscat's role to fill the admiration, but at the same time the devilish villain! <br /> <br /> Don't miss this nation!
