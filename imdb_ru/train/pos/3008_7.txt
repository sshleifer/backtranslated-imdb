Unbeaten William Powell. His joy is to see on the screen when he sneaks through situations without caring for the world. He always seems to be the best in his game and cares little about those who doubt it. The killings are projects, only people. I noticed that this is the main product whodunnit. In addition to the occasional weeping widow, the victims function as the reason why the film exists. Nothing more. There are enough turns along the way for everything to be interesting, and Powell is a master in this. There is a lot of political incorrectness, especially with regard to Asian performers. It is a bit difficult to accept. The cast is great, and Curtis direction is also a constant asset.
