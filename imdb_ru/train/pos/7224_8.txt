When DEATHTRAP was first released, the poster reproduced on the cover of this DVD was an image similar to the Rubik's Cube. This is a suitable image: originally written for the scene by Ira Levin, who is the author of such memorable works as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE STEPFORD WIVES, the play was one of the most famous Broadway twisters, and it is very well broadcast on the screen under the direction of Sidney Lumet. <br /> <br /> DEATHTRAP is one of those films that are very difficult to discuss, because of this, the story that he is famous for is revealed in detail. But the introductory premise is extremely clever: Sydney Bruehl (Michael Kane) is a famous author of mystical plays, but he seems to have lost touch today. After a particularly brutal premiere, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends him the script of the play he wrote. This is called the Death Trap, and Sydney recognizes this as an unmistakable blow. It was such a blow that would revive his career ... really, a blow for which one must die. And when Clifford arrives to discuss the play, events suddenly begin to unfold in unexpected ways. <br /> <br /> Like the equally tortuous SLEUTH by Anthony Schaffer, DEATHTRAP is actually a story more at home on stage than on screen. - to achieve full power requires the immediacy that offers live performance. However, under the expert guidance of director Sidney Lumet, this makes a more than respectable screen display. This is largely due to the cast, which is remarkably good. Michael Caine gives a truly brilliant performance, Diane Cannon is funny and charming as the mercilessly agitated wife of Sydney, and Christopher Reeve gives what may be the only best performance in his sadly short acting career. If you cannot see it in a first-class theatrical performance, it will be more than you do until it appears. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
