When I first went to see Shining, I was expecting a decent film from what I heard about him, and I really liked Stanley Kubrick's other work, but when I started watching her, she was much better than I thought. At times I seriously felt ridiculous and could not take my eyes off the screen, but there is something very disturbing in this whole film. Now, some people don’t like the version of Kubrick's Radiance, since it doesn’t quite follow Stephen King’s book, but in my opinion, both Kubrick’s version, the mini-series, and the book are great. You are looking for a good original film that makes you think even after the films run out, and then watch “Shine”.
