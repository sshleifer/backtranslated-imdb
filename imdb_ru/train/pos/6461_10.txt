At first I was completely taken aback by the original lyricism of the film, and then I was completely fascinated by the unfolding history and absorbed in brilliant directing. All the characters were fully developed, no more than life, but just like the people among whom we live, no matter where we are in the world, in Sweden, in Turkey or in America, all are absolutely believable people with weaknesses and nobility . Hollywood could learn a lot from this beautiful film. This shows that there is no need to go into every little thing behind every action to emphasize the whole topic clearly and vividly, and it shows the splendor of the director! From the bottom of my heart I thank Kay Pollak and the wonderful actor for this excellent treat !!
