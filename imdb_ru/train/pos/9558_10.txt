So I consider myself quite large in the anime scene, with very few shows that I DON'T SEE. <br /> <br /> This show, however, I would recommend to everyone. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly the most original series to date, it has everything I could ask for. A side story, so to speak, about unconditional love, which will NOT be allowed, is a very glaring comedy and a very well-composed cast of voice acting (in both Japanese and American translation). <br /> <br /> If not for a very funny aspect, it would be just another anime. <br /> <br /> More or less, as I noted, “love it or hate it,” very few people I saw presented this series will end with disgust for her. <br /> <br /> Original to the depths of the soul, with all that you can ask for in the afternoon, put a house on this series. I am ready to assure you that you will like it.
