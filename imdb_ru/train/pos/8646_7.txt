In 1990, Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis filmed the series “Too young to die,” in which both played almost the same roles as in California. I have no doubt that this is exactly the reason for their filming in this big movie. <br /> <br /> In California, budding writer David Duchovny and his girlfriend, art photographer Michelle Forbes, have a difficult relationship because of Duke’s obsession. with writing a book and penetrating into the minds and souls of serial killers. In fact, he planned the most unusual odyssey, he wants to cross the country and visit the places of several famous serial killers. But he and Forbes are idle. <br /> <br /> Fate intervenes not only financially, but with the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, couples of strange southern types who agree to share the cost of gas in this country trip. It turns out that Pitt himself is a serial killer, and he decides to do a little research on his own, delving into the thoughts of someone who is fascinated by immorality. <br /> <br /> “California” is not the movie that I usually shoot. go, but in fact, the acting ability and charisma of Brad Pitt make him work to a great extent. Pitt is the current definition of an inbred Gothic refugee from Liberation. But better than he is Juliette Lewis, who again plays these types of low self-esteem, which she seems to do well. Watch her scene with Forbes when she does her hair, and Lewis describes her sad and miserable life. Lewis dialogue and Forbes reactions should be shown in acting classes across the country. <br /> <br /> For those who like their dabbing blows, they are no better than in California.
