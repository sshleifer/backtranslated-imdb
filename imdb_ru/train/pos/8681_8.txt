This cartoon is short on the plot, but visually stunning piece of work. There will be very, very minor spoilers: <br /> <br /> In this short film there is a “story” that incredibly small underground gnomes are responsible for returning spring every year, but have to fight against winter, which is not yet ready to withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. This is largely a plot, as it is. But this cartoon is not about the plot, but about color and animation. Visual effects are exceptional. Back in 1936, such a bright color was still something of a novelty, and there are some incredibly inspired works here. <br /> <br /> My favorite short circuit moments surround the movement of liquefied flowers through the pipes. At more than one point there is a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the highest, and the colors move through the pipes, and the music track gives the impression that the series is a pipe organ. <br /> <br /> The visual battle between the growing greens and the winter storm, which refuses to leave quietly, is very good. These types of shorts were things that Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are famous for, but they probably also helped lead to their final departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably went beyond the budget, and MGM finally decided that they could it’s better to control costs if the animation department was run by someone who was a little more aware of the cost than Harman and Ising. <br /> <br /> This is a really beautiful cartoon and worth seeing. It is available on DVD Attack of the characters of the 30s. Recommended, especially if you like good animation.
