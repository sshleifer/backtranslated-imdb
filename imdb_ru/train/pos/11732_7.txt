Well, I saw it in cinemas when it came out, and I don't know why. I have not seen him since, but I found myself on this page because I thought about this film - again, I do not know why. But the fact that I remember speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> Comedy is hard - much harder than any drama. Doing it right seems easy, but doing it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin, notice for some reason you fall into this category again. <br /> <br /> Elvira The Mistress of Darkness must have correctly done what I fondly remember this film. Made at a fast pace, with tongue in the cheek and knowing that this is not a Philedelphia story, it entertains from start to finish. Brain donors are another person who fits into this category (without most free tits jokes). <br /> <br /> One of the controversial issues is the ending. It seems the scriptwriters / directors had no idea how to finish the comedy. The ending is trying to become a love story, somewhat undermining the bizarre rapid dialogue up to this point. Then there is the scene "tassle". Whereas this must be seen (male opinion), it is so excessive and inappropriate, it is like a shock. It took another correspondence for the final. <br /> <br /> This is not a comic genius like Spinal Tap or The Producers or The Holy Grail. But if you do not try to disassemble it and just let the puns and keenly fun come to you, you will laugh, I guarantee it.
