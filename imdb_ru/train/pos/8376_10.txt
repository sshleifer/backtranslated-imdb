One of the best movies out there. Yes, perhaps, cinematography was not the best, but an excellent plot and concept. Great for time and brilliant and creative ideas. Something different from ordinary movies and great entertainment. One of my favorites and recommend to anyone who loves creative and creative films. After the 3rd World War, fighting in giant robots, the actors performed well and justified themselves. The sets are not surprising, but simple and worked for a complete film look. This film is very difficult to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Check it out because I loved it since it came out. Not a mainstream movie and not like what you have ever seen. Look and think like a child. This is a great view and very fun.
