Slaughter High is perhaps the most underrated slasher film of the 1980s. This is one of the few films in the genre that fascinates in everything. At the same time, he also relies to a large extent on the standard slasher formula: a group of young men and women are killed one at a time until the final duel. <br /> <br /> The reason why "Slaughter High" is above the majority of films in its genre is such that it goes beyond the usual. Marty, the murderer, has good reason to be dissatisfied with her former classmates. They killed him with an electric shock when he stood naked in the girl's dressing room, jabbed his crotch with his dart and, to top it off, put an experiment in his scientific laboratory so that he could disfigure him. <br /> <br /> So the victims in this film are as incredible as you are. When they reunite years later — at a high school reunion organized by Marty himself — you will realize that they have not matured so much. They are a bunch of sociopaths. <br /> <br /> It is striking why they do not wonder why they were the only ones who appeared at the reunion, which, by the way, has been held at school since then has declined. And who would have thought that it was a good idea to drink beer and spirits found in an abandoned building in a room where, as it turned out, their old lockers were displayed - and Marty? There are many leaps of faith that the viewer has to do to enjoy this film. The ending has little or no meaning. And the writers have a strange understanding of how the April Fool's Day is arranged: the film claims that the jokes are no longer resolved in the afternoon. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is one of the best examples of the slasher genre, despite all its flaws. It’s hard to understand why it hasn’t yet been released on DVD, when so many other mediocre clicks of the film are decorated with special editions.
