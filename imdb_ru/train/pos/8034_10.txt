There are several films that seem to provide entertainment as well as realism. If you ever thought about the role of snipers in a modern war, take a look at this. <br /> <br /> I just liked the scene, where hundreds of soldiers shoot in the jungle, nobody knows exactly where this shot came from? <br /> <br /> And they called one scene “Salvation of Private Ryan”. so there must be some virtues in the scene. <br /> <br />
