Tramp in search of work mistaken for a killer in a small town of Wyoming, which leads to all sorts of complications. Cage played well in the role of the unfortunate smack, hoping to make money quickly and get out of the city, but he found that he could not avoid the title city. Hopper does what he does best by playing a psycho, known as "Lyle of Dallas," a real killer. Walsh as a crooked sheriff and Boyle as a femme fatale complete the wonderful role. The scenarios of the brothers John and Rick Dahl contain delightful twists and turns, and the direction of John creates an amazing atmosphere of "neo noir." Witty and very interesting, he delays the viewer from the very beginning and never gives up.
