I know that there are some purists who do something that does not quite resemble the original, but sometimes by-products can stand on their own merits. I like the new Iron Chef, because it is quite similar to the Japanese version, but at the same time serves the American spirit. I love Alton Brown as a commentator, because he explains things with talent. Iron cooks themselves are very interesting. I know that the originals were probably the best cooks on the planet at the time, but Bobby Flay is the only American Iron Chef who defeated them. Mario Batali seems to have the most fun when he prepares, comments and catches the eye during his creative work. I watched the show and found that all the players work well together. However, judges are not always the best choice. There are a few exceptions, such as a lawyer who has become a gourmet, but most judges doubt the ability to cope with what they are being served. I like to watch the bustle of cooks, and applicants are surprised. The food at the end always looks amazing, and sometimes it inspires me in the kitchen. Perhaps this is all that anyone can ask, want to really eat what is served. The only thing that I really would like to change in the series is to ask the guys from the show to shine a little. Sometimes the mood gets too intense, and itâ€™s not always fun to watch when you expect more entertainment. I liked the version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA), because it was too cool, like the original, but I can say that it was a rather expensive offer. I wish he would stay with this version and be the host - between Bill Shatner and Elton Brown, so that I could smile for an hour. As long as you do not expect the original Japanese version and can take this series essentially, you may think that this is a pleasant hour.
