Surprisingly well done for an independent film, Insomnia Nightmare paints a striking picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia. Miraculously well written and directed, it creates an atmosphere of sleep when the viewer experiences one night in the life of insomnia. <br /> <br /> In the lead role of Dominic Monaghan in the role of Jack, we see everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night stretch. The narrative is almost hypnotizing, and it is impossible to turn away from the opening lines. Exciting and a little disturbing, it shows how someone copes with lack of sleep, balancing on the edge between sanity and insanity. <br /> <br /> Twists and turns on every corner, Nightmare Insomnia is provocative and attractive. This is highly recommended.
