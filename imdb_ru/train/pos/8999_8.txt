This film does not make any pretentious effort to hide its real genre - the film "Campy B". First, he will tell you the definition of Campi. It should also give the adjective meaning of cheese. But these two get together in this film in a way that makes you say, “Hmmmmm ... it's so stupid!” And then you laugh. For example, there is a scene in 16th-century Japan, which depicts a pair of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple. In the background of the temple are several tourists looking into the distance in slippers and shorts. Hmmm ... hahahah! I could not stop laughing. And the game comes from a decent, tolerant, oh my Lord, but this is what makes it funny. You will see worthy actors, and then you will find other really awful ones. I have to retreat somewhat, because I have seen Stephanie Sanchez in several plays, and she’s awesome. Her broadcast time in the film was rather short though. I also saw Brian Yamasaki in several plays on the islands during my visits, and he is also better at the theater than in this film. In any case, this is an entertaining film, if you have nothing to do on a weekday night.
