That's how I felt while watching this movie. I like it. It was fun. But I felt as if I was getting a secretive idea of ​​someone’s psyche, and then laughed when she was turned to make an interesting moment. One of my friends put it this way: <br /> <br /> "I feel that we broke into someone's house and now, without their knowledge, we are watching their terrible home video." <br /> <br /> Another of these facts is weirder than fantastic pieces of film. “Groovin 'Gary,” the original “Beaver Kid,” is a guy from a small town who appears on a nearby television station hoping to get into a movie - and he certainly does, although perhaps not in the way he originally expected. With great hopes of fame and importance, he invites Harris to come and take down a really terrible talent-quest, which he organized in his hometown, entitled his own dramatic act "Olivia Newton-Don." <br /> <br /> Directed by Trent Harris brilliantly copes with this slowly evolving story. Some shots of an awkward child who wants to be someone turns, after two subsequent reinterpretations, into a history of freedom from repressed sexual identity in a small town in America. Harris simultaneously criticizes the attitude of the small town of America, the cult of celebrities and the exploitative practices of the film and television industry. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn and Grispin Glover make amazing performances. young Sean Penn is the most memorable - he watches Gary's shots so closely, but with strong nuances that give the sensation of interaction in the way Harris wants. <br /> <br /> In The end with the wide-open eyes of the original Gary's naivety is what touched me — when he contrasted with these possible interpretations of his situation. <br /> <br /> The film is not to be missed. I have not seen anything like it. <br /> <br /> Jacob.
