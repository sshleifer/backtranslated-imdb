Brown from Harvard is a difficult film to pin down. Nowadays, we expect much more from our films, so it should be remembered that the audience in the 20s was a little more innocent. William Haynes is charming as a fraudster who stumbles through pain and humiliation to gain success and even fame. All relationships in the film seem very unnatural, with the exception of the homoerotic connection between Billy and Jack Pickford, the city botanist. The film has it all: romance, tears, love, death, and even sport ... This is an excellent education in how society changed in the 20th century.
