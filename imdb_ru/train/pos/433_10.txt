This is one of those rare films, it is cute and compelling, worthy and unusual, a real gift. I consider this a prerequisite for any trip to Italy or for any vacation at all, because it reminds you to open yourself up to a wider experience (yes, find the magic). I especially liked Josie Lawrence, like Lottie Wilkins, but every leading and auxiliary actor is perfect in this film. In addition, costumes, if you are passionate about fashion and costumes, are extremely well made. I would just like them to release it on DVD, because I wear my tape version! <br /> <br /> Absolutely well worth the time spent, just try to watch it without interruption.
