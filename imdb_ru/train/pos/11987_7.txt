Several years have passed since I revised this classic, and I decided to return to it in more detail, but first a few insider notes from the critic of the film. <br /> <br /> This animated series is one of those I grew up with, it made my childhood joyful, it made it amazing to miss some of these things today that we clearly don’t see as much as we did. in those days, well before the review ... <br /> <br /> Talespin, or Luftens Helte, as they call it in Denmark, is an excellent animated series, it is in many ways similar to the chip and dol, ducks and many old that he has such a strange feeling, I can not remember this series as much as I would like to remember. <br /> <br /> But in my opinion, it was very cool, she came with some kind of message, not so wild, although it is one of the old ones so that they can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Now I don’t want to seem old or something else, but I feel that time has come out of my hands with these cartoons, today we see something like Ed E. dd and Eddy or something something strange, we have all these new or almost new shows, such as Hannah Montana, or something like that, but I feel that we don’t have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows as we have in the first days <br /> <br /> Now, maybe I’m wrong, but I feel that the time has changed a lot, so I’d be happy to see how these series, like Talespin, will be released to the TV screen instead of all new ones, Give me back my children's cartoons, give them to the children that I ever have, give them back again ...
