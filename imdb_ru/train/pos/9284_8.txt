This film is described as a comedy, but it is not a comedy at all. Like any Panahi film, it was a very realistic drama depicting a common thread of social injustice and hypocrisy. But it was very funny; much brighter than the dark and serious film directed by The Circle (my favorite Iranian film). The inventiveness of the girls and the banter between them and the soldiers was absolutely believable (as if it was a documentary) and completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Shooting the actual match and the impact was astounding. This added realism much like Australian Kenny, of course, a completely different film. <br /> <br /> Performances of all non-professional actors ?? soldiers and girls ?? were very trustworthy. It was very touching to see the passion, disappointment and excitement of these girls. Anyone in this country who thinks Muslim veil girls are different from their own daughters should watch this movie ?? it will be a real revelation. <br /> <br /> For me, the soldiers represent the current paradigm. They began with standard official responses to all requests from girls. As the movie progressed, it became increasingly difficult for them to maintain this position. When what seemed like everything to Tehran broke out in a wild celebration, everyone was captured by it, and the absurdity of current politics is obvious to one and all. <br /> <br /> It was a very touching and unexpected ending, and gave the film a really good combination of emotions, levity, drama and social commentary. Despite the fact that this movie is for adults, I think that mature children from about seven years old will truly appreciate this film (if they can read the subtitles). <br /> <br /> It is noteworthy that such a repressive country like Iran can produce films of such quality as Panahi and Kiarost. Perhaps the constraints are forcing directors to be extremely inventive. Australian (and other) filmmakers could take a sheet from their book.
