Great fun from start to finish. Great performances Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback. Some twists and turns and many battle scenes. The film is made for me! Funny lines in the script, good music. Dalton as a tough sheriff and Reilsbek as a "villain-villain." I have to recommend this movie to all fans of action-adventure! 10/10
