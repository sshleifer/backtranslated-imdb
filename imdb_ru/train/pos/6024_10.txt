I saw ZP when it was first released, and found a big disappointment for me. His script looked forced and arched and too phony of the 60s. This is too frank and funny policy. And let's face it, I was still under a love spell known as BLOWUP: and I still haven't completely shook it. Now “love” is tangled with all kinds of nostalgia that it causes and, well, okay. , , Good luck for me! <br /> <br /> But the time is passing, and the time was kind to ZP, and the time was a teacher for me. I watch this movie about every ten years, and it gets better and better with age. And ZP is his own "experience", and he is really connected with BLOWUP only through his creator, the late great Mr. Antonioni. <br /> <br /> Twelve years ago, I was fortunate enough to see an absolutely untouched Reprint, designed in the right size (huge), restored by an Italian government cultural agency that knows a good work of art when it sees it, and knows how important it is to maintain such Thing in good condition. To this day, I remember how the audience sighed when the first shot of Death Valley appeared. It was like a thousand-volt visual shock that Antonioni deliberately inflicted to wake us up at a new level of consciousness. Indeed, what follows from this point is a completely different kind of “place”. <br /> <br /> What surprises me is how this film becomes independent. <br /> <br /> I remember the second time I saw him - in the early 80s - I began to feel affection for the film in general and for Daria and Mark in particular. Considering that before these two seemed like the ingenious shadow version of “Olivia and Leonard” Zefferelli (read: “Romeo and Juliet”), they now attracted me - especially “The Girl” in her persistent slow mobility. She took her time. .. Live. Everything, EVERYTHING dies around her. <br /> <br /> After the excitation of the theater, the daylight of the Reality quickly began to erase my new “pleasure” found. Secondary shoulder pads with long hair of the 80s whispered: “But this is a hippie fantasy - let go” <br /> <br /> I realized that the power of Antonioni’s vision had already worked inside me, so I responded to the “80s” with using "Hugo" and guarded his "love" secretly, possessively and jealously. <br /> <br /> But this is what good art is that lives in you and, if you will, it will find its way and “love” you back: secretly, jealously and possessively. And you "have changed." <br /> <br /> It was very nice to see that Turner Classic Movies decided to show ZP in their March lineup. Undoubtedly, ZP needs to be seen on a giant screen, so that it can truly take you into the current environment. But hey, sometimes even a glimpse of the Beloved in newspaper photography is no better than a glimpse. <br /> <br /> Today’s reality hit, ZP was mysteriously recalled and replaced with tearful antics of RESTAURANT ALICE. <br /> <br /> So, this is still too “difficult”, too “disturbing”, too “what”? <br /> <br /> Maybe this is the case, as is the case with all good art, it lives until everything dies. <br /> <br /> Peace.
