Johnny Hume, one of the most sought-after Western all'italiana, has the freshness of many WAI created during the heyday of the genre, and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or the original, intelligent cinema. <br /> <br /> In many ways, Johnny Hume is not very original, but in fact it does not count. The success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the expectations of the audience, and also provides amazing variations of these expected elements. Previously, pleasant impressions were recreated, but with a subtle (or serious) turn, ensuring constant interest. Workmanship is also obviously important. Tired re-reading will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or excite the audience. <br /> <br /> Given these criteria, Johnny Hume succeeds. There are numerous reprises of elements from earlier films. The setting is a brutal, distorted semi-feudal twilight world in which many of the best westerns of the "Gothic family" from 1964-1968 lived, such as Tempo di massacre (1966). The plot is a combination of the main plot of "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964) and the movie "Ringo", which is not surprising, since in both cases the scriptwriter Fenandando di Leo participated. Di Leo was one of the best writers in popular cinema that appeared in Cinecitta in the 1960s and 70s, and his work helped to ensure most of the thematic continuity and coherence of the genre (along with several other personalities in several different circles, actors, directors and screenwriters). In the FOD story, the protagonist arrives in the city, causes a tense situation, then almost dies, followed by a resurrection (in some films such as Quella sporca storia nel west (1968), it is literally a crucifix). Catholic narrative overtones and symbolism are intriguing, especially given the hidden populist / overt socialist leanings of the filmmakers and their films. Ringo’s plot, more fully developed by screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi in a series of films in which Guliano Gemma plays the main role, the egoistic hero chooses community interest in his own through relationships with a member of this community (with a healthy trait of irony) uncertainty). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Carradine and Johnny is clearly based on the relationship of Manco and Mortimer from A Handful of Dollars (1965). Two scenes of exchange of weapon belts provide intelligent dialogue and mutual understanding between them. Numerous films, including Da uomo a uomo (1968) or even El Chuncho, quién sabe? (1967), use this connection between the older and younger man (father / son, older / younger brother, the English advisor / opponent and the peasant revolutionist) as the central plot dynamics. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a focus on deception and the wrong direction, labyrinths and mirrors that repeat during the best early WAIs. Almeria's canons and pueblos become literal labyrinths in which the main character and antagonist play cat-and-mouse games. <br /> <br /> Johnny Yuma’s distinction from other WAIs is in the quality of director Romolo Guerriri in using visual / psychological space. coordination with the intellectual mechanisms of the script to advance the plot. The dialogue has never been very important for WAI and is often absurdly illegible (although there are exceptions, such as cynical comments in Django (1966) or Faccia a faccia (1967). <br /> <br /> Psychological depth of character is created). almost entirely through cult images, this juxtaposition and description of the overall narrative situation. See how deadly Samantha’s presence feels during the beating scene - watching from the roof or from the background of the action. Or how Johnny undresses Samantha and Pedro about their safety and confidence in their strength thanks to their secret invasions of their ranch, hotel, even bedroom (again, this is a FOD theme). Finally, notice how the focus is on finding information. Many elements borrowed from FOD, which was ultimately based on the mysterious novel Red Harvest, hard-boiled, through casual contacts, wanted posters, random conversations, views from windows, clocks left in the twilight, or erroneous identities and movement through the ripples created by the actions of Pedro and Samantha in this surrealistic and absurd reality, which the narrative pushes towards its completion. <br /> <br /> The film was remarkable in its time for being perceived as an excess of violence. Of course, these films were a bit more brutal than many American westerns. A distinctive feature was the psychological intensity of violence and the reasons for which it was attributed, that is, it was not violence, but its significance, which changed. Johnny Hume is different from others and is interesting in its use and portrayal of violence, and this is another interesting aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> What I personally like best about this genre is its connection with the anonymous author. Unnamed audiences in Italy and Spain, for whom these repetitive stories had some meaning and interest. The artifact may not have intrinsic value by itself? Any flint production from a prehistoric site, a piece of pottery or a piece of leather and rusty metal ?? but this is a reference to some nameless presence, lives that were significant simply because they existed. Although Johnny Hume has intrinsic value, much of his interest for me stems from this connection and riddle. <br /> <br /> List of the best spaghetti western http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br /> <br /> Average CP http://imdb.com/mymovies/list? l = 21849889 <br /> <br /> Only for fanatics (lower part of the trunk) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list? l = 21849890
