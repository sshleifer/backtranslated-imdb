Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be happy. This woman is amazingly beautiful and talented actress. This is a difficult combination to find the days now. And Jeremy Northam. I have heard his name many times, but never noticed him. My advice to Hollywood is: “use it more.” <br /> <br /> Now about the film: I watched it in one of the shifts in the cemetery. I do not recommend this to anyone. It is a little complicated and mysterious for this. I still can not believe that I did not see the end. I will not say why it will spoil the film about the hole. although to say that it is spoiled enough. <br /> <br /> Now I believe that I will vote for this film. I love a dark mystical story, the actors have done a good job, and I love directing (natali) work in the past. For such things is not a very large audience, it is also quite risky. You know that, I’ll just give this job 8, because everyone should see it. Again, deduct 1 point, because there is always room for improvement.
