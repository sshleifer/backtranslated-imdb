This is absolutely one of the best films I've ever seen. It takes me on a roller coaster of emotions. I laugh, cry, feel disgust, joy and love! All this in just over two hours! <br /> <br /> Actors are all great! I have to mention the main actor, of course, Michael Nyquist. He does a wonderful job! I also admire the actor who plays Torah, who plays this mentally retarded young man in such a convincing way! He kind of reminded me of the Leonardo DiCaprio roll in Gilbert Grape! And then - the most beautiful song in the world: Gabriella's song. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone and everyone to see and enjoy!
