With all of this happening with MJ right now, I started listening to his music, watching a weird documentary here and there, watching The Wiz and watching Moonwalker again. Maybe I just want to get a certain idea about this guy, who, it seemed to me, was very cool in the eighties, just to decide if he was guilty or not guilty. Moonwalker is partly a biography, a full-length film that I remember when I looked at the cinema when it was first released. Some of them have subtle reports about the feelings of MD to the press, as well as obvious reports of drugs - this is bad, good. <br /> <br /> Visually impressive, but of course it's all about Michael Jackson, so if you don’t like MJ remotely anyway, then you will hate it and you will be bored. Some may call MJ selfish for accepting the creation of this film, BUT MJ, and most of his fans would say that he did it for the fans, which, if true, is very kind of him. <br /> <br /> The actual feature of the Bit movie, when it finally starts, is only 20 minutes or so, except for the episode of “Smoothed Crime”, and Joe Peski is convincing as a psychopathic influential drug lord. Why does he want MJ to die so badly outside of me. Because MD overheard his plans? No, the character Joe Sands said that he wants people to know that he delivers drugs, etc., so I don't know, maybe he just hates the music of MJ. <br /> <br /> This is a lot of cool stuff like MJ turning into a car and a robot and the entire Speed ​​Demon sequence. In addition, the director had to have the patience of a saint when it came to filming the episode "Bad Child", as directors usually hate working with one child, not to mention the whole group of them performing a complicated dance scene. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this film is for people who love MJ at one level or another (which I think most people do). If not, stay away. It really tries to give useful information, and ironically, MJ's best friend in this film is a girl! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people who ever graced this planet, but is he to blame? Well, with all the attention I paid to this topic ... hmmm, well, I don't know, because people can be different behind closed doors, I know that for sure. He is either a very good, but stupid guy, or one of the sickest liars. I hope he is not the last.
