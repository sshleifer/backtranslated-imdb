Rudy does it again with this hot on-street trail to Dolemit. This entry is filled with the obligatory Rudy Ray Moore Runy, humor and martial arts. Rudy avoids the crazy red-necked sheriff in this film, which also features the infamous scene where Rudy dives from a steep hill. Watch it for a laugh and for the awesome hit of Blaxploitation magic.
