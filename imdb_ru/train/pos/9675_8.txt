Most people can say that if you spend Saturday night watching a movie, you must be very bored. In fact, I had just returned home from home and turned on the TV, and there was Poly. <br /> <br /> I missed the opening credits, so I didn’t know its name, but I saw that it had Cheech Marin, so I naturally thought that I tuned in to “Born In East L.A.” When I saw him talking to a talking parrot, I was ready to dismiss it like a flop film that they show late at night. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to say that it was better than that. As you know, if you have not done so, Paulie is lost and tries to return to her original owner. It seems it took years to find her. What should be an advantage to Poly is actually a disadvantage in a sense. People are faced with a literate parrot, and all they see is a way to make money or benefit yourself. <br /> <br /> Although the character Chicha Marina "earns money from him", he is not evil for him. Dance episodes with parrots - this is what children seem cute, I found them funny. <br /> <br /> Paul, who is naive, quickly learns that not all people are good people. Especially the owner of the animal research lab. The man lies to him, saying that he will help him find his master, while he helps in his studies of animal communication. Pauli is now stuck, but decides to make a man a fool to demonstrate to Pauli’s other vocal abilities. <br /> <br /> Throughout the entire movie, Paulie tells her story to a janitor who eventually frees him, several other animals and find the location of the owner of Poly. This is a touching reunion. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, the wing clipping scene should have been accepted, not shown. This part may disturb young children. Otherwise, this is a great movie for older children and adults who are children at heart. (END)
