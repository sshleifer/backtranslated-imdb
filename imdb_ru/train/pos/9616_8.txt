Worth seeing twice because of the rapidly changing causal relationships between several compelling stories. The Beetle turns into a fully satisfying work of art that always plays optimistic love against countless examples of disappointing reality. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie characters are Wallace (John Carroll Lynch), whose main concern for life, from a cockroach to airline passengers, for which he is partially responsible, creates frames for the film; Olive (Christina Kirk), who spends a lot of time creating surrealistic but tasty dishes for her impossible husband Ernie (Chris Bauer); and Mitchell, a cable TV specialist, who believes in the messages of “cookies of happiness”: “You will meet the girl of your dreams.” <br /> <br /> Against such optimism, the forces of bizarre reality, generated by the actions of the characters: parking tickets, clogged sewage in the store of Chinese food / donuts, TV breakdown, broken car wing, destroyed dinner reservations, which ultimately leads to cancel the Hawaiian holidays. <br /> <br /> Funny Olive film, getting drunk at a Chippendale performance, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock), as a customer service representative, is trying to deal with an angry microbial customer Cyre (Brian Cox) faced by a restaurant inspector , Dwight (Jamie Kennedy), reacting to his girlfriend Refusing to have children, writing hostile Chinese cookies: "Your girlfriend is lying to you" and the guy who falls asleep working with a jackhammer because he spent the night in search of his girlfriend's missing cat. <br /> <br /> A small public story The host of access (Darryl Tissa) and a local acting teacher who read "The Boy in a Bubble" express the main theme: love comes from the heart. <br /> <br /> “The Beetle” has fun almost at the same level as the boy. “Trains, airplanes, and cars,” but with a smaller budget and a more fresh look.
