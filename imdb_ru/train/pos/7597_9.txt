Lost contains something interesting for everyone. You can say a lot about this series, and a lot has been said, so I will not be the one who again presents everything for you. Just read the people who liked it, and you will understand why you want to watch it. The most pleasant thing in this series is that it is completely new. There are not many films - and even fewer - TV shows based on the subject of only obscurity, but Lost is proudly matching this theme. It's all about the inexplicable, and if you combine it with an exotic location, good plot twists, an excellent cast and a good format (present and past are combined in separate episodes), you will have a series in which each episode is a story on its own. but part of a larger story. You want to get an idea about the characters, see the big picture and find out where the writers are leading you. The result of this is that it is a series that does not let you go. On a more skeptical note, the series in the second season failed a little, probably because of its own success. It is well known that “Lost” was originally written only for one season, and when the overwhelming success ensued, the writers were also stunned. In my opinion, they made a mistake by adding even more mysteries and at a higher pace in the second season, and then deciding those (or, at least partially) that in season 1. At the end of season 2, you ended up with a big blur of secrets , plot twists and unexplained phenomena, but the viewer can only take so much. The difference between season 2 and 3, however, was huge. Season 3 distributed a lot of ideas to partially replace them with new questions. And that is how they should write; You want to move from one plot to another turn, not to spread tsunami secrets to you, and then take a few to explain to the audience. They got it in the 3rd season and bring us a promising future series for the 4th season. It's nice to see that such a different series format can be so popular.
