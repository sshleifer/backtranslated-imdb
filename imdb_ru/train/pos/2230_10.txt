I have been searching for the title of this film for many years. I was 14 years old when I believe it was shown on television in 1983. All I can remember is that it was a teenage girl who alone survived the plane crash and survived the Amazon. I remember that people were looking for her (family) and that she knew how to take care of herself — she tells a story, and I remember very well how she knew that the mistakes were under her skin. I don’t remember anything else about this movie and want to see it again - if this is the same movie - and if any of you have a copy, could you email me at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I would be curious to get a copy to see if this is really the same film that I remember. It was shown on Thanksgiving Day (USA) in 1983, and I had my own problems, and this film influenced me a lot. Thank you in advance!
