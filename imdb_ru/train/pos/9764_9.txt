I saw this movie in cinemas when I was 6 or 7 years old. I liked it then, and I recently purchased a VHS version. <br /> <br /> My 4â€“6-year-olds love this film and ask it again and again. <br /> <br /> I, too, enjoyed watching it again. Although I have to admit that it is not so good on a small TV. <br /> <br /> I do not have older children, so I do not know what they will think about it. <br /> <br /> The songs are very cute. My daughter continues to sing them again and again. <br /> <br /> Hope this helps.
