Children's “sexual exploitation” is one of the most serious problems facing our world today, and I was afraid that any film on this subject would jump directly into scenes of a clearly sexual nature in order to shock and disturb the audience. After watching the films “Trade” and “Holly”, one film made me want to see changes in international law. The other felt like an unsuccessful attempt to make me cry for five minutes with emotional music and strange suicide. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that turning this issue into a Hollywood jerk of hearing is a useful or necessary strategy for adoption, and I have to thank “Holly” for the subtle but powerful struggle with the terrible conditions in which these children are sadly forced to endure. "Trade" ranged between serious and stupid scenes, including the death of a cat after images depicting children forced to do some terrible things. It seemed to me uninteresting and sometimes offensive. If I wanted a cheap laugh, I would not subscribe to a film about the sale of children. <br /> <br /> For those who would like to see a powerful film that actually means something, I would advise to save on a movie ticket for the release of “Holly”.
