I saw Brother's Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and found that I still think about it two days later. The story of the prodigal son (Scott Cohen), returning to the furniture business of his family after being in prison, offers all the necessary qualities of a solid drama - memorable characters; sharp, observant dialogue; careful use of the camera by a cinematographer who thinks visually. <br /> <br /> But moreover, there is something very rare in multiplex today: an uncompromising vision of mature sensitivity. The talent of screenwriter Todd S. Jellin seems to be fully manifested, but we understand that he (like his main character) paid his dues. He knows how real people fight in this world, and he knows how we strive to see - or at least experience for ourselves - success. Yet, the Greeks respect their audience too much to choke with happiness. In the end, we see that the triumph of Jake is not in the commission or even in the respect of his family, but in the "work" he can not refuse if he tries. <br /> <br /> This is an essential topic in the world (and especially in the film industry), which cannot rise above the “bottom line”. This film deserves a wide audience.
