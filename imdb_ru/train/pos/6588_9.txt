After watching several episodes of this series, I came to the conclusion that television producers are completely devoid of any form of originality. Here is an old reserve of science fiction, ingeniously wrapped up in the form of a truly original concept - and yet they can only - almost - make it work. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is good! Male actors are quite experienced in their professions. Most of the characters are well drawn, with special praise to the hero and his more than pleasant side impact. And most of the plot episodes seem acceptable. So what could be wrong? What about the female characters and cosmetically perfect actresses chosen for their image? <br /> <br /> Manufacturers insist on the image of female characters in this almost good series, so that the final product seems to be an inappropriate cheerleader. Why, I ask, why? <br /> <br /> All episodes fail whenever a guest star or a repeated character appears on the screen. These actresses are absolutely incredible in their roles, and you donâ€™t have to see them in order to understand that they are not able to fulfill their acting duties. The blind could say. Just listen to their conversation. They come up with a dialogue with all the drama and effect of a 16-year high school graduation. Who could believe that these women are doctors of science, senators, corporate leaders and doctors? <br /> <br /> If we talk about nonsense, if manufacturers have a choice: Stockard Channing or Morgan Fairchild, guess who they choose - every time? And of course, the series suffers for it. Very bad!
