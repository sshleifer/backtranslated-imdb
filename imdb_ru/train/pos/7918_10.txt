I like this movie. Actually, I liked being an actress in this film. I was a pregnant girl in the second half of the film. You can remember me more clearly on the stage in the class when the werewolf put himself on tape. I was a woman in the front row with hands set on my face, in response to the fact that we were watching a film projector. In fact, they took me twice a few times, so this error is hard to miss. Thumbs up to the full moon. I wish him to come to the telegram soon. Cheryl Lockett Alexander Lisville, Louisiana I really liked this movie. Actually, I liked being an actress in this film.
