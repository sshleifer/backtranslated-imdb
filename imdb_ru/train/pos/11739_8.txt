"Elvira, Mistress of Darkness" is a kind of "Harper Valley P.T.A." with touches of the supernatural. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) leaves her job as the hostess of television horror films after the owner of the new station handles it in a new way. Now she relies on a show in Las Vegas to conduct her, but she finds out that she needs more money to start the show. Things look hopeless to collect this money until she receives a notice of her aunt's death, which then takes Elvira to Massachusetts to read the will. A house in need of repair, a dog and a cookbook are all that her aunt left for her, and again, it seems that Elvira cannot find money for a show in Las Vegas. Adult people from a small and narrow-minded city exacerbate the situation, complicating Elvira. Only a local guy (Daniel Green) and a group of teenagers will be friends with her. Elvira’s uncle Winnie (W. Morgan Sheppard) is trying to make a deal with Elvira for a culinary book, but Elvira soon learns about her powerful legacy, which includes witchcraft and a couple of very effective pots. Elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle, but he is determined to get it, knowing her strength. Then Elvira is threatened with burning at the stake on the old city accusation of witchcraft and a clash between her and her uncle. The plot is pretty simple, but the humor and well-developed characters make it move at a good pace. "Elvira, Lady of Darkness" is full of sweet, rough, rough and clever humor, permeated with a multitude of spectacles, pun, props, songs and parodies. The touch of the film to the occult makes it one of the best horror parodies ever made. This is a well-made film with an amazing game of all performers; including Edie McClurg and Jeff Conaway (from "Grease"). There are also good special effects. Many people (including me) wondered if Elvira’s character could make a feature film, and the answer to this question is amazing, YES!
