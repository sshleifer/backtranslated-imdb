After watching all the films of Jesse James, Quantrill, Jehoker, etc. In the fifties, it was very exciting to see this film from a new point of view of director Ang Lee. Laurence, Kansas attack scene is amazing. The romance between Jewel and Toby McGuire turns out to be one of the best, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers stands out as a bad guy. All the time this film makes you feel the horror of the war and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they will survive in the next few hours. Definitely worth a look.
