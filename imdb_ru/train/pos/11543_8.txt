Neil Simon has a lot of work, but it was the Strange Couple that brought him fame. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthew have excellent chemistry. The cast for this film is also stellar. <br /> <br /> These are about two people living together from opposite planets. The script is replete with humor from this situation. This has been done in some forms previously. This is the one that combines all this into a very good package. <br /> <br /> Simon did another decent job, but this is really his best work, which made all his work possible. It's hard to imagine Simon ever taking the lead.
