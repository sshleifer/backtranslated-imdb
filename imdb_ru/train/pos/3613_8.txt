When “Girlfight” came out, the reviews praised him, but I did not bother to see him. I finally saw him when he was released on video, and understood the glowing reviews. <br /> <br /> The film opens in a high school in the center of the ghetto. We quickly get acquainted with student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). There is an ominous expression on her face, and any thought about Diana that we could extract from this expression is soon confirmed when she enters the fray. When Diana has problems because of this, we meet her father, an aggressive person; Obviously, we cannot completely blame Diana for her attitude. <br /> <br /> But then the film really begins to evolve, since a new thought is emerging in Diana’s head: boxing as a way to escape this grim existence. Her older brother has already taken up boxing, but her father will most likely not approve. Only Diana herself can decide what to do. <br /> <br /> Only the first few minutes determined that a very rough, not Hollywood film was waiting for me, but the short appearance of John Sales in the role of the second plan really confirmed this. Even before they get into any of the boxing scenes, you feel as if you are being slapped in the face when you see Diana’s ugly life. And when they finally reach the main plot of the film, there will be no going back. <br /> <br /> In general, I definitely recommend this movie. I admit that using boxing as a means to show that someone is trying to do something himself has, over the years, been a kind of cliché in the movie (Rocky, Baby for a Million), but I still think that they did a great job with this here. In fact, it may have brought the genre to its top. Really good. It is a pity that Michelle Rodriguez was spending herself in Hollywood films after that.
