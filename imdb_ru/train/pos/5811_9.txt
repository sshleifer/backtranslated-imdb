Only 9/10 from me, the ideal ten would be if the film had more plot, but still Moonwalker to this day remains a fun festival of music, dance and entertainment. Starting with editing video clips from Jackson's long career, he reminds the viewer about why he is often considered the “king of pop”. From his hit “I want you to return” to “We are the World” - a charity record for many African awards. Following this, a short film, albeit dim in the Oscar winning scenario, nevertheless provides a fantastic and interesting drama for the audience. Ends with the perfect (sexy!) Performance of 'Come Together'. Something that the whole family can watch and enjoy.
