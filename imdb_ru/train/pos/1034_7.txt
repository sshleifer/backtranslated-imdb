I think this film may have been much more powerful when it first debuted in 1943, although at present it seems too preaching and static to elevate it to greatness. The film takes place in 1940 - shortly before the United States entered the war. Paul Lucas plays the most serious and decent head of his family. He is a German who fought Nazis for seven years and avoided capture. Bette Davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife, who was able from time to time to raise and educate children without him. When the film begins, they cross the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in many years they are going to relax and stop running. <br /> <br /> For me, the problem was that the family was too perfect and too decent - they seem to be obvious positive propaganda, and not a real family suffering from real problems. Although at the time it was a very noble goal, today it seems to be just fake. In particular, the incredibly strange and extremely scripted dialogue used by children simply did not sound believable. It sounded more like anti-fascist speeches than the voices of real children. As a result, they were extremely annoying - especially the smallest, which sometimes came off as a brat. The only ones who seemed real were Bette Davis and her large American family, as well as the rogue Romanians who lived with them (although he did not have a noticeable accent). <br /> <br /> It is really hard to believe that the ultra Famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialogue, since it does not sound true for life. The story was based on a play by his lover Lillian Hellman. Both the main plot idea and the plot are good, but sometimes the dialogue is simply bad. In general, an interesting surprise and a film with some wonderful moments, but that's really all.
