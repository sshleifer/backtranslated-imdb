For persons of a certain age, W.W. II was the determining time of their lives, and what followed it could never be compared. When the film opens, the recently widowed but still alive woman (Judi Dench) hears the street musician playfully trying to play the classic song “Star Dust”. <br /> <br /> This reminds her of the memories of how she played almost all the girls in the group who had fun between the bombings during the war. Drummer Patrick (Jan Holm) happily avoided the draft and enjoyed the ladies. <br /> <br /> Patrick and Dench's characters meet and decide to reunite the group, which leads them into a series of mini-adventures. Despite its ups and downs, the group reunites and returns successfully. <br /> <br /> The film is elegantly written and undervalued, with great performances by all participants. The characters are well developed and all the people who have not left to live, despite their years. And there is all this gorgeous old swing music! <br /> <br /> This is not a pontiff Steven Spielberg, but a serious film. The war has affected everyone, and this lesson is not forgotten in the film, which is not afraid to entertain, as he teaches.
