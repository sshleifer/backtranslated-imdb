This is the early film “Pilot” for the hit Canadian TV show Trailer Park Boys. He was shown to the executives of several networks before Showcase decided to sign them up for the series. Magnificent acting and very funny cast make this film one of the best cult comedy films. The plot of the film is such that these two petty criminals are walking around, “exterminating” national pets for money. If you have a dog next door that barks all night, these are the guys you go to! But they get into trouble when faced with work that is too big for them to deal with and end the exchange of fire. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the series. I highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> Rated R for swearing, violence and drug use. <br /> <br /> This is not too offensive (in fact, they do not show the killing of animals)
