This is my favorite movie by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The dialogue between them is so cute, funny and very clever. Not to mention that this film contains some of the best songs recorded by two; as if I put all my eggs in one basket, and let's face it in music and dancing. If I remember correctly, it was a film that introduced me to Fred Astaire, so, I believe, because of this, he will always hold a special place in my heart (sorry for the sentimental Cree * r, but I am a woman, so put up ) in all this the film gets 8/10 from me. The choreography was great, and the fact that Lucille Ball is present makes it even more amazing.
