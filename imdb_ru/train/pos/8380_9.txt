Now I have always been a fan of Full Moon puppetry. But I have to say that Robot Jox is one of the best projects. Yes, you heard me. The story works great, the atmosphere really works, and the actors do first-class work. Gary Graham, who really makes his mark on television in shows such as Alien Nations and Star Trek, shows that he can be an action movie star who kicks his ass and takes a name. The effects of a stop motion might be a little better. The color was wrong, they look plastic for me, not for the metal they were supposed to be. But this is a small complaint compared to everything that is a Robot Jocks. If you like Gary Graham or other films about the full moon, then you will love this movie. 9 STARS FROM 10.
