Iâ€™m never tired of saying that this is one of the best political thrillers in history. The story takes place in a fictional state, but, obviously, it is about the murder of Kennedy. The truthful and honest district attorney (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by one Daslow man (= Oswald), and although all other officials want to close the case, which he continues to investigate in his team. br /> <br /> The script is written tightly and quickly and keeps the tension through. Only the part concerning Milgram's authority authority experiment, although uninteresting, is a bit out of place. The final sequence, explaining who Icarus really is, partially shot in slow motion and enhanced by the soundtrack for Morricone, is the most powerful sequence I've ever seen in a movie.
