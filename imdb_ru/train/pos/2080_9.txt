The quote I used for my resume is about halfway to Good Land, because the captain of the Chinese revolutionary army (played by Philip Anh) apologizes to the crowd for not having shot MORE of the marauders among them, since his squad just called back to the front. Of course, the next marauder who will soon be discovered and shot is the main character of the film, a former slave in the kitchen of O-Lan (for whose role Louise Rainer, who is now 99 years old, won her second best actress in a row of Oscar)). <br /> <br /> The next scene reveals that O-Lan submissively delivers his bag of plundered jewels to her undervalued husband, farmer Van Lungu (Paul Mooney), setting in motion this classic dichotomy of human financial growth. mobility is the direct opposite of its moral decline. <br /> <br /> For the film, which covers topics such as slavery, false accusations, misogyny, famine, home invasion, eating domestic animals, mental retardation, infanticide, exploited refugees, insurrections, civil war, mass street executions , bigamia, beating children, adultery, incest and the epidemic of biblical-sized insects. “Good Land” is an amazingly touching movie. <br /> <br /> My farewell thought is in the form of another classic quote from O-Lan herself (for the time being the precious soup bone that her son just admitted to stealing from the old woman back to the pan after her husband Van Lung is angry threw it on the dirty floor on the other side of their hut): "Meat is meat."
