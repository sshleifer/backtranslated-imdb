I originally rented this film for my daughter, as she is fond of football - and I was not disappointed that way (except for the fact that the plot interfered with the football scenes). As a dad, I suppose I was a little surprised by the introduction of the theme of lesbianism - but I have to admit that as a parent, these problems are fully accessible to children now (as uncomfortable as I feel this topic). In a sense, this emotion was the embodiment of the main premise of the film - that at some age you must trust your children to make their choice. This dilemma is a young girl of British origin - Jasminder (Jess) - from the East Indian heritage, who dreams of playing professional football. The upcoming marriage of her older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage provides her with many rich opportunities to study (in a good way) her hopes and concerns for her future. <br /> <br /> The multicultural challenge was a very interesting method of exploring Jess’s disappointment in the expectations of her parents - again, in essence, it does not differ from most relationships between children and parents. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY of football scenes BIG (a lot of things can be learned in slow motion), and although I didn’t need a storyline - something was needed for the film to go on.
