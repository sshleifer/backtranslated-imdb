Seeing Kayfer Sutherland playing my favorite character in the history of television, it was decided that I would go to the movies and spend $ 15 on it. I also think this applies to fans of Eva Longoria. <br /> <br /> The film tells about a leak of information that the Secret Service agent plans to kill by the President. As the investigation unfolds, it seems that the only likely candidate is highly decorated Pete (Michael Douglas). Acknowledging his innocence, Pete goes for a fun, fluent style in search of truth. <br /> <br /> This is convincing, but definitely not impressive. A decent cast, a decent story, but I felt a little empty, but you could certainly do a lot worse.
