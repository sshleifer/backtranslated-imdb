I saw this film again as an assignment for my management class. It is worth basically commenting on different management styles and ideas on quality (of a product). I shot it back in the eighties, and I remember that it was a good (but not very) film. I always liked Michael Keaton’s style and delivery. He was perfect for the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see some low marks on this film. Yes, yes, it is not an Oscar winner, but it has a decent comedic value. This is rather a thin comedy, not a total comedic farce. I also find some of those who believe that it was an inaccurate film about cultural and business differences. I beg to differ. Once again, I confirm that there are many similarities and dramas, but again, this is a Hollywood film, not a documentary. From what I read about the differences between automakers on both sides of the Pacific at that time, many of the basic ideas were accurate for that time. <br /> <br /> Some of the main differences were that the Japanese workers felt as part of the company as a whole. Teamwork was underlined. Perhaps they made the company above all. Where American workers had more type of labor management poems. The man was more important than the company. I will probably get a hate letter about this comment, I am sure. <br /> <br /> Another difference was in how the quality was assessed and whose responsibility it had to correct. In many Japanese factories, defects or problems are considered and eliminated at the time of their discovery. Rather, as one character in the film said: “It was the problem of dealers (that is, car dealers).” <br /> <br /> Many of these things are probably outdated, but I’m sure that some of them still have as many American car manufacturers still trying to keep up with the Japanese. If someone is more interested in the topics of American, European and Japanese automakers, I can recommend a book that studies this topic in more detail and was made at about the same time. The book is called The Machine That Changed the World by James Womack, Daniel Jones and Daniel Rousse. We are talking about the study of automakers during and before the period of time that covers this film. The pieces are a bit dry, but I think you will find that it also supports the film.
