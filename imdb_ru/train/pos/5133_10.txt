Each of the major studios in the thirties and forties performed with jazz singles (led by Universal). While most looked as cheap on screen as they should have been, Warner Bros. (who suddenly stopped making them in 1946) often distinguished them with original angles, mirrors and optical effects, thanks to some creative directors such as Jean Negulesco. It is appropriate that the best of this genre should come from this studio. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes “Jammin 'The Blues” from the rest of the package is that it looks more like an avant-garde experiment than a Hollywood musical. Filmed in July 1944, it turns an ordinary jam session into a “trippy” dream-dream from military problems, as evidenced by the tune “On the sunny side of the street”. Gion Miles and cameraman Robert Berks (he later worked with Hitchcock) were given greater creative freedom, perhaps because Lester Young was not Glenn Miller, and the studio didn’t care how he and his fellow musicians were represented. An optical printer is well used, since several images of the same artist appear simultaneously. (Norman McLaren actually did this process two decades later at Pas De Deux, while Linwood Dunn's team achieved various effects at Citizen Kane.) The strong emphasis on silhouettes and lit cigarette smoke also outpaced his time; to some extent this preceded the psychedelic sixties, but with a distinctly stylistic style of the film of the forties.
