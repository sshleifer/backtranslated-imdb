I saw this film several times and watched it today (at TCM) solely because of Geraldine Fitzgerald. She is a very underrated actress, and I must admit that I have been in love with her since I first saw her (probably on Wuthering Heights 40 or more years ago). The real star in this film, however, is Paul Lucas, and he deserved all the awards he received. He makes it clear whether we like it or not, that the end justifies the means. Nazism had to be stopped, and everything that helped to do this was good. He told his children that they were bad, and that they should not be bad, but, as he said earlier, when talking to adults, he would do such things again and again without thinking. Lucas really showed a great person in this situation and made it clear that what he did was very difficult. <br /> <br /> Some people think that his victim was a Nazi, but I don’t Think, I think he was only after money. His Nazi associates knew this, and therefore they did not have much benefit for him. <br /> <br /> One interesting point in the film, and probably also in the play, is the fact that Muller (Lucas) is German. While the anti-German hysteria of World War I did not recur in World War II, there were significant anti-German sentiments, and some Germans were buried similar to what happened in California with people of Japanese origin. For Hellman, it was a bit of a courage to write a play about good Germans (perhaps she thought that it was they who signed the Soviet-Nazi treaty!). In the end, the US and British air forces bombed German cities and did not hesitate to kill civilians. However, I think that the explosion in Dresden and the fire storm occurred later, after the release of “Watch on the Rhine”. <br /> <br /> The name is a play on words, since the “clock” is facing west. , from Germany. In fact, “Watch am Rhein” was a marching song of the German army — used in World War II, but the Nazis had their own marching song, which was also used. But Muller is German, and he is busy with his own "Wach am Rhein". <br /> <br /> All other actors did an excellent job here; although Bodo was too much, there are children like him. I am surprised that he did not share his father’s secret. In real life, he could do it.
