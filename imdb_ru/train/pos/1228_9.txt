This 1991 NBC-TV film was released six months before the release of a widescreen version of John Goodman about the life of kids Ruth. For my money there is no comparison between these two. TV production is not perfect, but it represents the story of Kids with greater depth and complexity than the one-dimensional stories of Goodman. I especially liked the film about the complex relationship of love and hate that Ruth had with manager Yanka Miller Huggins, who always understood the brilliance of his star player and also tried to point out why Ruth’s own character flaws would never allow him to become a manager or a leader. The television film rightly notes that Ruth never realized her dream of controlling the Yankees due to his flaws, while Goodman’s horrible version tries to push the lie that Ruth was denied what was supposed to be for him to take. <br /> /> This film is a great addition to the film Eight Men, as the story begins with Ruth's arrival in New York in 1920, a year after the Black Sox scandal, and when his feats in the home run literally saved baseball from death. Indeed, the continuity between the two films is even emphasized by the fact that John Anderson reiterates his role as "Eight Men" as Commissioner Keneso Mountain Landis.
