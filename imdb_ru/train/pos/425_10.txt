I would like to comment on the film April Love. This is one of my favorites for all time, because my father, Nelson Malone, plays the equestrian trainer. I clearly remember when Hollywood arrived in Lexington, Kentucky, where we lived at the time, to arrange April Love. My dad was in numerous plays and was a talented person. I persuaded him to try to try one of the proposed parts, and, behold, he came home with a script. How interesting it is! In addition, several of my classmates were in crowd scenes - especially those that showed in the amusement park. This is very nostalgic every April when I see the film being shown again, and the April Love song Pat Boone is still playing on the radio. Eternal and reminiscent of a long past time, when you watch the films they make today with all the sex, obscene language and violence. It would be great to see more films like April Love, again in focus ...
