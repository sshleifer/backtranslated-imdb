For those of you who have read the highly respected Rohinton Mistry novel, this film will surely amaze you because it is a worthy adaptation. With the exception of one minor plot, the debut of the feature film Sturla Gunnarson is almost a dead game of the book (up to the last line). <br /> <br /> For those of you who have not read the novel, this film may be a little more difficult. This, of course, is not a big cinematic drama. Instead, it has a strong element of realism, but I would have no other way. The best way to describe such a long journey to movie fans would be to say that this is a small Hindu version of Fiddler On The Roof. Instead of the Jewish / Russian milkman, the main character Gustav Noble is a banker in Bombay of the 1970s during the Muslim war with Hindi against Pakistan. He has to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his older individualist son, a distant friend who involves him in dirty money, and an unhealthy neighborhood. The ending is not happy and not sad, but this is realism. <br /> <br /> Such a long journey is a good little movie, but if you want to watch it, then good luck with your search. Unlike the novel, he received very little release.
