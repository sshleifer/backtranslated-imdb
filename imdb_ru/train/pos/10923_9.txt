This movie is really good. The plot, which works like a puzzle, makes the viewer think and guess what will happen next. This trick brings many surprises and makes the viewer look forward to solving the riddle. The fighting scenes are very good. There are many different styles of combat (although one of the styles was a bit unreal for me, but this is just my opinion) to watch, and this is an exciting show. The only thing that can be annoying is watching the actors. Too feminine (at least for me). Hong Kong has always been good in kung fu movies, especially in the 70s and 80s, so Five Poisons (or its other versions) is a great choice.
