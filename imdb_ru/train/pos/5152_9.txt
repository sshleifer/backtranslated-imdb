"Hitler, the uprising of evil" clearly comes from people emotionally burdened with the horrors of World War II, which makes observation refreshing. <br /> <br /> I think his greatest value lies in his crystal clear disclosure of the Nazi mechanism. Of the completely flawed ways, Hitler used it to get to the top. Arriving there, this film ends. <br /> <br /> When the Führer was on top (German for “leader”), he led his Germany to the largest and most destructive war in the history of mankind. Ends six years later in complete defeat of Germany. As a result, Germany lost its eastern provinces (= about 35% of its prewar land) and was forced to accept the division of the remaining territory by 44 years. Both West and East Germany were to be recovered from scrap metal, their reputation seriously affected by the many atrocities of the Nazis caused by racism. <br /> <br /> As I said, “Hitler, the rebellion of evil” makes a good watch, Set in an acceptable environment of the thirties, with (more than) competent acting game. In particular, the role of Peter O'Toole as an elderly president von Hindenburg stands out, even adds an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> My copy of “Hitler, Rise of Evil” also contains a second DVD with two good documentaries. films. One concerns the personality of Hitler, the second concerns the forgery of Hitler’s diaries. In 1983, this fake caused a cheerful scandal in England and Germany, damaging the reputation of several historians and journalists.
