In the hands of a more experienced director, this film would be considered a masterpiece of horror. Despite the simple leadership of Michael "Deadly Desire", the film is interesting, original and more than frightening. <br /> <br /> The script removes more than one horrible cliche from the back (can’t shake it a little)) including Chris Sarandon as the heroine guy who actually listens to her, as she insists that creepy things go down. Burgess Meredith is amazing as an insanely attractive neighbor. Eva Gardner pursues young Beverly D'Angelo as a dumb and agitated lesbian. John Carradine does a hell of a lot of work sitting in a chair. And beware of a short cameo from the unknown at the time of Chris Walken! This movie is creepy and creative. The plot twists are beautiful, if a bit predictable. The climax, about which I will not go into details, is alarming and quite impressive. Again, the best director could have done more with it, but this is quite satisfactory - at least for those who feel the horror of the seventies. <br /> <br /> If you like the modern, reproducible fantasy of torture with body counting, you won’t like it. There are almost no mountains. The direction is quite spartan. There are few effects, although near the end there is a wonderful makeup - most of which are not really makeup ... but maybe I have already said too much. <br /> <br /> I rated it a little higher than its quality can justify, but I enjoyed it just like any 8 movie I’ve seen.
