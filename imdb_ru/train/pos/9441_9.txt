The creators of this beautiful film did an amazing job of bringing you to the characters, because they survived this terrible ordeal. The terrible scene in the forest was made so great that you forgot that these people were just actors playing roles. I have never been as immersed in a movie as I have this one. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight were never better on the screen, as well as the wonderful performances of Ned Beatty, Ronnie Cox, Bill McKinney, and although he appeared briefly, James Dickey, The Man who wrote the book on which the film is based, like Sheriff Aintree. This is somewhat disturbing, and children, of course, must be protected from it, but this is a great, dramatic movie.
