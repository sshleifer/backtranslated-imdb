I thought it was a wonderful movie. This applies to every fiber person. Love in the film is very intense. I thought it was Will's best performance to date. Great direction. Liked the editing. The music was great. Good use of memories. This is the film that everyone should watch. I hope people get something great from this. Overall a great movie. I think Hollywood should make more movies with content. Even action films can have a caring story. I like the fact that Will was very thin in his game. He had a purpose and dedication that is rarely seen. I would advise to watch it alone or with someone you really care about. For me, I discovered that the world stopped, and I focused only on the film. The outside world was momentarily suspended. It was a pleasant feeling with all this chaos occurring in this world. And with this generation, it was great for me to see something (someone) that cared about other people more than it did about itself.
