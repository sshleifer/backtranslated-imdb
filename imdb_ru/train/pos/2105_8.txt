This is the story of an ambitious store clerk, in love with a mysterious woman, with whom he exchanged romantic letters, and discovers that a mysterious woman is nothing more than a saleswoman from his store. who seems to be constantly quarreling with a colleague. Add a small twist (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee, Stewart, has an affair with the owner's wife), and Stewart is “fired” for a while along with the recognition that the saleswoman “loved” Stewart all the time, the happy ending is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Although VERY outdated (references to poverty and - I have a wife and two children to consider) - are used too often, and also indicates that many small objects of pleasure, such as a cigar box , inaccessible to the pleasure of ordinary people), this film is much more effective (and more believable) than the 1990 reprint of "You Got Mail". In the rework with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the real chances of a chain of events are so incredible that the viewer's intellect is greatly offended. <br /> <br /> “Shop around the corner” is an innocent stroll through a memory lane to a less complex, less hectic, and more romantic time and place known as the writer's utopia. Lovers of classic romantic comedies will love this picture!
