Great pleasure. I went with 8 friends to preview this movie. We came to see something else, but after 10 minutes we wondered what the hell we got ourselves into this time, the jokes became funny and they remained funny throughout the whole movie. In the first part, you just keep asking yourself “Malinsky” and “Bellini” (there are many more examples of this jargon), and since they continue to repeat the same jokes (with different turns), they are becoming funnier and funnier. . In search of this Malinsky, all the main characters are represented first, even more strange than the next. Until half of the film was finished, we didn’t even know the name of this film, because there were no opening credits, and we went to this secret preview, but we, of course, had a good time. The house was loaded (about 250 people), and I think about half of them did not like it, and the other half liked the movie. If you like weird comic movies with great dialogue, you'll like it. Besides Clooney. This film deserves much better than the IMDB rating of 5.6, which he had at the time when I was writing this, but when more people see him, I am sure that he will rise. 7.0 - reasonable, I think I would give 8 out of 10 (10 out of 10 after a few bottles of beer) <br /> <br />
