I began to lose faith in recent films, flooded with a typical genre Hollywood film. The plot lines fail, and the camera work is simply copied from the latest movie of a similar taste. But then I saw Zentropa (Europe), and my faith was updated. Not only an exciting metaphorical storyline, but also the use of color and black and white visually stimulates. The narrator (Max von Sydow) takes you through an exciting journey every step of the way and immerses you in 1945 Europe. We have all seen death, depicted on the screen in hundreds of thousands of ways, but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow moment that leads you to death. Unlike many films, it does not cut after one second the display (for example) of a knife, but makes you watch the destructive but sensual beauty of the final moments of a person. I think we all can step back from what this film is trying to say, but itâ€™s definitely worth the time to find out what it really means. I would like to tell you more about the film for anyone who wants to send me an email. Enjoy it!
