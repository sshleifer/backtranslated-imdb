Where the pavement ends (1950) <br /> <br /> Where one ends, another begins <br /> <br /> This is a prototype of a film noir, and, as such, quite flawless, both in terms of style and terms of content. Look. Photography and night settings are first-class (cinematographer Joseph Lancel allows drama to ooze scene-by-stage), and close-ups on faces are pure expressionism. I can only watch this movie for visual effects, even when the actors fight and the plot stinks. <br /> <br /> But acting is first-class, and the plot shows what I consider to be the basis of most noir films, alienated male leadership (representing many men returning home to the altered United States after the war and feeling lost). In fact, Dana Andrews is not only really convincing, as a concerned, lonely detective, he has a small but important partner in the film, the (first) husband of the main woman, adorned with an ex-soldier, caught up in difficult times and drinks. The fact that one man kills another can make a huge difference in general - an ordinary guy struggles with his internal problems for success, while a soldier wearing medals gets into an accident with a silver plaque in his head. A woman moves from one to another - we assume that they marry and have children, as suggested earlier in the film. Even if it pushes interpretation to this after the fact, we can still see the path of one person with some kind of psychological baggage, experiencing a crisis to the highest moral order - he who surrenders himself for a minor crime at the very moment he really got away with it. <br /> <br /> This movie belongs to Andrews. He plays a much more restrained and agile type than Kirk Douglas in a similar role in William Wyler's “Detective Story”, filmed just a year later, and Andrews is certainly less theatrical. You could easily see both films side by side for comparison textbook and contrast session. The fact that Andrews as a detective Dixon is morally struggling with all this, and Douglas as a detective MacLeod does not, can explain why one man gets his girlfriend and the other does not. Gene Tierney removes an extremely sympathetic, modest and, ultimately, ordinary and “pretty” woman - not just the desired cardboard, but the one for whom you want Dixon to really marry. <br /> <br /> The criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama, but is quite effective in the game with types and cliches. Portions of bits are saved quickly, small details (for example, a portable dice table) are pleasant to the touch, away from the characters and glamor of casino games in Casablanca. But then, Curtis' remarkable film is cult even in the details - it doesn’t make an effort to be subtle, real and insightful, but instead is wide, memorable and inspiring. They come at opposite ends of the war and present opposing opportunities for their leading people. Bogart begins his active duty, Dixon, and the man whom Dixon killed, to the end. Through, thoroughly, but not washed. <br /> <br /> It’s not by chance that many, if not most, of moviegoers have what you would call “happy” endings. The man conquers his opponents and transforms his inner essence, and the cinema-goer then and now understands how wonderful it must feel.
