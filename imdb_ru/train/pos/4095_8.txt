Now my friends, films such as “La Bête” (aka “The Beast” or “O Monstro”), can only be shot on the old continent :), in this film we see everything: dirty sex of horses, a kind of gorilla nymphomaniac , meaningless dialogues, etc., etc. ... In serious terms, this is now an allegory that men can sometimes be bestial, visceral and cruel, Valerian Borovchik (director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape cruelty. This is an amazing cinematic experience, whimsical and full of grotesque scenes. For all fans of European shocking exploitation, I recommend this film. If you like this one, I recommend: “Eagles vs. Invisible Man” and “Altered States”.
