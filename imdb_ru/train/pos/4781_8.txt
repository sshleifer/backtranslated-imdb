MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me a real fan of David Lynch. He is a modern genius, because he is not only a director. His stories and his style have a spell that crosses the screen. So DIRECT HISTORY was a surprise for me, with its easy-to-understand plot and sunny scenery. However, Lynch is there, and, although it is far from his best, this is a film not to be missed. Late speech by Richard Farnsworth is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> 8/10
