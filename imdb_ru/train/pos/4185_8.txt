This film has everything that makes a bad film worth seeing - sloppy editing, continuity with little or no madness, crazy dialogue, bad (one might even say non-existent) game, meaningless plot lines, frames that go on FAR for too long ... and it's perfect for MST3K style riffs, not to mention “drunk corpses game”: sketch on forms ... take a picture - sign your name ... take a picture - catch a bad Foley edit ... take many, many pictures . <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn’t rate him above 8 is because there is not enough unpaid nudity and because, despite her insane badness, it lasts only an hour - hell, such a film should at least 20-30 minutes longer!
