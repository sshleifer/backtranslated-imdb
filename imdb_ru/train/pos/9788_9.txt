I was at the same screenwriter conference and saw the film. I thought the author, Sue Smith, very clearly summarized what the film was about. However, the film really did not need an explanation. I thought the topics were completely clear and inspiring. The film, which tells about the ability to dare, to resist fear, especially fear emanating from parents, to overcome it and, thereby, to use the possibilities of life, is a film that needs to be appreciated and savored. I enjoyed it a lot more than the so-called “Flip”. I also think Mandy62 was a bit unfriendly to Hugo Weaving. As a guy about my vintage, I must look so good! I agree that many Australian films have been dim lately, but Peaches are delivering goods. I'm glad I saw it.
