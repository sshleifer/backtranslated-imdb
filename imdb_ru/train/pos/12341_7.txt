Although Lang's version is better known, Borzazh’s work is not without interest, far from it: its “heavenly” sequences are even better. The metaphor of the train (perhaps borrowed from the end of la roue by Abel Gans) is ultimately more convincing than the heavenly world “above”. <br /> <br /> The tenderness of Borzazh for his characters is manifested in the character of Mary, and love behind the grave is one of his favorite themes (the end of the "three comrades"). Amusement Park seems to be everywhere: we see it, even when we are in the poor house of Marie. I do not think that the scenery is so cheesy, they are stylized for wine. The fair at a distance almost gives a scientific feel to the film. <br /> <br /> Borzazh never forgets about his social worries: in the heavenly train going upwards, Rich cannot be mixed with scum, but, as the “chief judge” says, “there is no longer any difference.” < br /> <br /> Not the main job for Borzage (also not the Lang version), but look if you are interested in the career of a great director.
