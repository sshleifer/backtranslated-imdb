Hitchcock demonstrates his already well-developed understanding of the visual effects in this early silent film. The plot of the film, which involves two boxers who are fighting for a girl, is a direct drama without much recommendation. Hitchcock's talent, however, lies in its terrific use of images. Almost every shot is filled with visual characters. Especially memorable are the decorations that one boxer gives to a girl before she marries another boxer. He glides over her arm clearly sexy, and in one simple motion Hitch showed us everything we need to know. Boxing scenes are well handled with some interesting shots from a point of view, which once again prove how far Hitchcock was ahead of his time. The film also gives an idea of ​​his later treatment with women. Boxers are driven by money and lust, not reason or love. The only other women in the film are either beautiful girls at a party who make open sex offers, or old partners who help to break happy relationships. In general, the Ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early work and his development as a visual narrator.
