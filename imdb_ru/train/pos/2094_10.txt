Of course, 65 years have passed since the filming of the last Talberg film. But friends IMDB, come on, this film is definitely one of the masterpieces of the 30s! This is 10. <br /> <br /> This was the first film I saw in the New York Museum of Modern Art, around 1970 (I was a teenager). Expensive looking at scenes of such poverty, skillfully photographed, often exciting and always attractive, for me it was the creation of MGM at its best. What did the audience feel when they saw the locust attack, the destruction of the mansion, the terrible poverty, and then the splendor of wealth. <br /> <br /> Last week, those who watched the Academy Awards saw the “senior” Oscar winner, Louise Reiner. It is great to see an actress who may have made one of the most skillful and memorable performances in history, deciding to return to the feast. <br /> <br /> Okay, so she shouldn’t win a year ago (the Great Zigfeld), but don’t blame Louise. The rally was only ten years old when it was released, and its dialogue was limited. But, like Olan, its use of visual and vocal data is remembered. <br /> <br /> Large-scale and touching, what else can a movie lover!
