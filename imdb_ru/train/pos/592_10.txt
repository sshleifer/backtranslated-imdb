In Arlington Heights, Illinois, we never had a canteen at any of the elementary schools (1961), so I cycled home from school for lunch and always watched this game. True, I was 11 years old, but I thought it was the best thing! I drew hidden pictures on the blackboard and looked to see if my family or friends could find it. I also remember how I won great cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if the participant received the final game with hidden pictures. I even had a home version! <br /> <br /> I wonder why this game lasted so long? I enjoyed the music and the hidden photos â€” the only one I could get was a lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a stream in the garden. <br /> <br /> Really good memories associated with camouflage.
