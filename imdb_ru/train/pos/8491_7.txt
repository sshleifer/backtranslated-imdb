I saw this movie when it was new. Later, I rented it in Japan, having stayed here for three years, fearing that I would cringe after seeing it in the harsh light of my expanded international experience. The film pleasantly surprised me by how accurately it portrays the clash of cultures between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I am from). Not all things are really accurate, but the tone is perfect. <br /> <br /> I am still in Japan many years later, and I continue to enjoy this film for its impartial attitude to two parties. in history. Interestingly, although Japanese-American actors spoke Japanese in the original, the dialogue in the Japanese version is shortened to hide obvious problems with delivery in a second language. <br /> <br /> I noticed that one reviewer uses this in the Japanese class. I think you can learn more about what to expect from meeting with Japan by watching this film than by reading any of the “serious” books. on this issue (most of which were written in the 80s and were funded by the propaganda of Japanese companies). br /> <br /> Don't be fooled if the average rating caused by one-star reviewers, who, among other things, were considered implausible, the Japanese will want to produce cars in the USA. (Of course, the Japanese manage a lot of factories to be close to customers and avoid trade friction.) This is a very warm and funny film, which I would rate more if it were not for some 80s cliches like dancing around Dirty electronic disco music. Michael Keaton was never funnier.
