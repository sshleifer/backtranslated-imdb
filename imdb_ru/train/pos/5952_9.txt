This film is humorous, charming and easily becomes a favorite for those who like light entertainment. There are hardly any serious lessons from history in Hollywood, so I just accept it as it is. Bing, in his usual inimitable style, performs well in the role of the blacksmith Hank Martin, who was accidentally transferred to another century, in the time of King Arthur. Beautiful Rhonda Fleming is breathtaking when Alisande or Sandy is Hank's love object, although she is engaged to the courageous and formidable Sir Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon. <br /> <br /> I just like this episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwick), Sir Sagramor (Wm. Bendix) and Hank (Bing Crosby) dress in torn clothes and go on the road with their backpacks to experience the kingdom first-hand. King Arthur’s commentary “I say we are not alone,” although it gives scratching good clothes, is one of those fun moments in the film. The image of William Bendix is ​​incredibly funny, not to mention his attempts at the mysterious “you old British”. <br /> <br /> The story is not deep, but, in my opinion, it is well done, and I get pleasure from it every time I see it. This is great family fun. <br /> <br />
