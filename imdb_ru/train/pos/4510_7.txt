Insisting that the inspirational spirit of Martin Luther King was laid not only in American civil liberties, but also in the hearts and minds of people all over the world, Danish aide Nils Arden Olevl conveys this belief in Danish high school in 1969. More specifically, he embarks on a crusade of a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Ratke) against his brutally and cruelly offensive director Svendsen (Bent Making). Adapted from the real story, the performances are performed with a certain aplomb, and the refreshing team on its various characters supports them. The battle of ideologies between a 13-year-old and a mad student is inferior to innate humor, but clumsy changes in mood, despite the fact that he is shrewdly cynical in the same spirit as the Society of Dead Poets, and not Matilda. He follows a familiar path, but the constant and accurate service to his young hero, including a personal story that Fritz completes, when the young man becomes a young man, he manages to turn the film into an inspiring family film with a nose right on the money.
