Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. She gives it all the time when she is on stage. Whether we laugh at her jokes and pranks or plunge into the eyes of one of her stunning ballads, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you don't see it live (this is the best way to see Bette), then this is the next best thing. It is interesting to look at how incredibly her voice has changed and matured over the years, but has never lost its power. Her more “vocally correct” version of “Stay with Me” never loses anything in spirit from ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS. Here she is simply more pure and sincere, as before. I will cherish this concert for a very long time.
