I saw the movie at the Nashville Film Festival. It was beautifully made, from cinematography to acting. This is the story of a father and son, and how they begin to appreciate each other during a family crisis. Beautifully written with a dialogue that never sounds fake, the film demonstrates the acting talents of Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, among others in this outstanding cast. The film begins with an aging father (Peter Falk) trying to figure out why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) left him. Without warning, a father represents himself on the threshold of his son and daughter-in-law. The next day, father and son go to inspect some real estate and eventually go on a classic trip. They catch fish, play billiards, watch baseball games, get drunk, get involved in a bar fight and dance with strange women. But more importantly, each of them confronts unspoken tensions that can affect any family. This is a movie that touches the heart and allows you to appreciate those who are closer to them.
