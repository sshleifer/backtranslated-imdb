Moonstruck is a love story. There are no novels, there are at least three, but they all relate to the same family. Loretta family. Loretta (Cher) is going to marry Johnny Kammariri (Danny Aiello). She does not love him, but he is a sweet and kind person. When he leaves to visit his dying mother in Italy, Loretta meets brother Johnny Ronnie (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny have not talked to each other for five years, and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course, they immediately fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> As this story and the love stories of parents, uncles and aunts Loretta develop, you just have to see for yourself. Anything you see is admiration, Cher is a bright star in the center of everything. She won and really deserved an Oscar this year. Cage is pretty good, and also stupid, and Olympia Dukakis, like Loretta's mother, and Vincent Gardenia, like her father, are amazing. This film is funny, charming and therefore very pleasant.
