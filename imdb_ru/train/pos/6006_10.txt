When I saw it in childhood, he answered all my questions and dispelled all my fears or delusions. It is easy to look at it, because it is animated, which makes it harmless. He has no moral prejudices or “preaching” aspects, so no one should have any objection to this. This is a pleasant film that simply tells the facts of menstruation encouraging, "in essence." I hope to show this to my daughter.
