I have a feeling that the musicals of the Warners Bros depression era will become much more relevant in the next couple of years. Yes, we are in economic decline (or you lived under a rock), and the times look bleak. But we always have films as a way to avoid our troubles. In the 30s cinema was extremely popular even in the midst of economic darkness. “Footlight Parade (1933)” was one of those films where viewers flocked. Although this musical, dedicated to Lloyd Bacon, does not quite reflect the social problems of the time, as the “Golden Diggers of 1933 (1933)” do, it is still an excellent demonstration of talent. We have to wait for the end of the film to see the three numbers of the Busby Berkeley extravaganza, but they are worth it to wait for me. Yes, little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress, and her audition is so-so, but the magical “At the Falls” Busby takes her and, it seems, a hundred other chorus girls to a dizzying aquatic wonderland. Of course, the Busby numbers could never be performed on stage (they, firstly, defy the limitations of gravity), and they terribly contrast with the realistic hard, magic non-musical scenes. And in Footlight there is also James Cagney in one of his too few musicals (is it true that this man could not do?). He can even take responsibility from the lead man, Don Sailor Gharb and fawn over sex — then Shanghai Lil (who is really little Ruby in a wig girl from China!). He is filmed along with Joan Blondell, his charming, adoring secretary, Cagney somehow goes in favor of other women (before the final video, that is). Apparently, Blondel was the only woman Cagney loved besides his wife. And you can see mutual adoration in every scene.
