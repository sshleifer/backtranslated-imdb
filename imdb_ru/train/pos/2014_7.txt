Mel Tormé and Victor Borga in their youth make this film interesting - and especially young Sinatra is watching, on the sunny side of the 1930s, and they definitely say that it was “yes, I’m a popular singer, but the actor is hardly a scene.” Michelle Morgan is an annoying, senseless presence, and Jack Haley is an actor whose appeal has always been completely lost to me. Leon Erroll, as always, is stupid, but overall quite amusing. 7 stars out of a potential 10 is the correct “score”, because with a combination of its positive aspects, the absence of much of the story, and the stupid at it, and the aforementioned irritations, this is generally average at best. Most of the fascination for watching the three entertainment icons in their early years.
