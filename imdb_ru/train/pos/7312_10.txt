It took me a while to truly appreciate John Carpenter’s Halloween. When I was a kid, I remember that I really liked the sequels, especially “The Return of Michael Myers”, which I still consider the best continuation of Halloween. But I thought the first one was slow and took too long to get to the bottom. I recently watched it a couple of times, and now I know that I was wrong. Today I really understand this film, the meaning that it has, the whole feeling of this masterpiece of horror. It's not about blood and gore. This is not about naked tiptoe and slop jokes. This is about the worst night in the short life of Lori Strode. Exactly at night, his crazy brother returns home to finish what he started 15 years ago. This film must be scary, and I think it is very good. This is also one of the first slasher horror genre I have always loved. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, eerie music and talented young actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role. Do I need to say more? Anyone who has never seen it, a horror fan or not, should do his cinema homework right now. Highly recommended!
