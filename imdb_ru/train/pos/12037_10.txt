The woman in black was British, made for a television film that was first shown on the BBC on Christmas Eve, 89th, and then in 92nd. I believe it made a round on American television on A & E. It was released on VHS in the UK in the early 90s, but it was out of print. The American company later released it on DVD, but this version was also sold out. According to the website of the author of the book, the rights to the film now belong to someone else, and that it will no longer be released, as well as that informal bootlegs are sold on ebay. <br /> <br /> I first heard about this movie just recently on a bulletin board and I had to check it out. I found a copy on ebay for about 28 dollars. This is probably a fake from a seller in the Far East, although the DVD says “made in Canada,” haha. But it's a good copy, and you can't blame bootleg labels for releasing items that are rare, out of print, and lost in litigation. <br /> <br /> I like the movie. This is a period created in the 1920s, with all the very authentic and bizarre British settings of the time. The woman in black is very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the film is very discreet, but effective and scary. In special effects, there is no indulgence in their own bloodshed, violence, or much more, but The Woman In Black is still able to create absolutely scary moments. This is a stunning ghost movie in a classic style. The film itself looks as if it was shot in the 1930s, except for color. I am afraid that without any flash of all modern horror films this film will always be a lost adornment. For me, this place is one of my all-time favorites.
