Life Pod is one of those films that you just watch and try not to analyze too much. The game is rather amateurish at best. Special effects are clearly low-budget, but not too bad. Storyline rather stock, but with an interesting twist. The computer is running, but not exactly the computer, and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. Nevertheless, the film has its moments and is quite watchable. For me, at least part of the charm of this film is the outstanding role of Christine DeBell. She may not be the best actress in the world, but, being a former girlfriend of the month, she is pretty sweet. In general, Life Pod is in many ways similar to other low-cost science fiction films of the 1980s and is somewhat predictable. <br /> <br /> The White Star bit is cute, though completely inaccurate. The last of the shares of White Star Lines was acquired by Cunard Lines in 1947, and the last ship sailed under the colors of White Star was Britannic (not Titanicâ€™s sister) who was sold for scrap in 1960.
