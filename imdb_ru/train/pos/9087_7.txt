Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a studio contract and goes to Hollywood. He stays at the Hollywwod hotel (of course). At the same time, the great selfish star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) is hysterical and refuses to attend the premiere of his new film. In a panic, the studio hires a similar Virginia (Rosemary Lane) to impersonate her, and that Bowers take her to the premiere, DO NOT tell him that this is not Marshall. Naturally, they fall in love. You can pretty much deal with the rest of the story yourself. <br /> <br /> The plot is old (to put it mildly), but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a very nice pair and have beautiful singing voices. The score is good (highlighted “Hooray Hollywood”), and director Busby Berkeley demonstrates his unique visual effects in a really fun driving sequence (with Edgar Kennedy who has patented the slow burning). In addition, Glenda Farrell has several funny roles, like sister Monas Johnsi. <br /> <br /> Still, the film is not so good. The rest of the cast mugs are fierce, and most of the humor is simply not funny. Lola Lane is especially lousy trying to play Mona for a comedy. There is also racism - the stereotypical black maid is played for laughter, and at some point there is a really terrifying racist “humor”. This is probably what hides it from the TV most of the time. I understand that this was accepted at the time, but today it sounds disgusting. <br /> <br /> In general, so-so film with some serious problems, helped by a good cast and great songs. I give him 7.
