In 1948 it was my favorite movie. Betty Grable's costumes were so adorable that I wanted to grow up to be her and dress like that. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was irresistible in the role of a dashing Hungarian officer. Stupid and fluffy, as this film may seem at first glance, when I was eight years old, it seemed to me that he had to say something important about the relationship between men and women. I saw it again the other day; I was surprised to find that it still did.
