“The Thing About My People” is a wonderful film about relationships - first of all, about an adult son and his father, as well as a son with his wife, sisters and mother. Paul Reiser wrote a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The film is funny, sharp and thought-provoking. This led me to re-evaluate my relationship with my late father and my adult son. Peter Falk is great as Paul's father - the role could not be better played. I hope that both Mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser will receive awards for the film next year for their efforts - Falk for his work and Reiser for his script.
