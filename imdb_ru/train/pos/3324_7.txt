Someone coped with the difficult task of merging sports with romance. In fact, sport and romance go together, like oil and water. So, to successfully connect them together on the screen ... well, that’s about the equivalent of splitting an atom. I never thought it could be done. I will be the first to say that overall I don’t like romantic comedies ... but I love sports and most sports films. This film was a pretty good mix of the two. As a baseball fan, I could truly appreciate the comedy test with Ben Reitman (Jimmy Falon), who is a rabid Boston Redox fan. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curse of the Kid, which has tormented Redsox for 86 years, and they know how crazy many Redsox fans are in baseball. The Farrelli Brothers did a great job removing it, and it was a good comedy. It was a very good movie that many people might like.
