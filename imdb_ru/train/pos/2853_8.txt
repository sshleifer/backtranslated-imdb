I finally saw this movie tonight, renting it at Blockbuster (VHS). I have to agree that this is wildly original. Yes, the characters may not have been fully realized, but this is not one of those films. Rather, we turn to the directorâ€™s eye, his vision of what the story is about. And it does not stop. And honestly, I did not want this. I really think that Sabu should have influenced the directors "Lock, reserve and two smoking barrels" and "Run, Lola, run." But I really liked the way these three lead to SEE a beautiful woman on the street to distract them for a moment. I really need to watch the other works of this director, because this film really intrigued me. If you want insights into culture, storming and drinking, go somewhere else. If you want to laugh, camera movement and criminal fun, look here.
