Well, was Morgan Freeman more unusual, like God, than George Burns? This film was certainly better than this boredom "Oh my God." I was completely consumed and lmao all the time. Kerry was beautiful as an extraordinary presenter, and Aniston performed her role as an upset friend in her usually well-played performance. I, for example, do not consider it ugly or worthless. I think my favorite scene was when Kerry opened the filing cabinet, thinking that she could never save his life story. See if you can find the file in the cabinet where the events of his humor are stored in the bathroom: I turned it over. Well written and even better played, this comedy will be among the best in this ridiculous man.
