I have never understood why MacDonald-Eddy's swan song has always been so mercilessly paned - not only by their detractors, but also by almost everyone. For me, "I married an angel" is more lively and creative than any of the more famous duet performances. The sets and costumes are as luxurious as everything that can be found in the MGM musical, the script is written by reliable Anita Loos (San Francisco, Women, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, etc.), Rodgers and Hart. melodies (albeit slightly modified by McDonald-Eddy’s regulars by Bob Wright and Chet Forrest) are processed by Herbert Stothart (Oscar winner for The Wizard of Oz), and, best of all, “singing lovers” look great in their modern clothes and seems to be having fun with fancy procedures. Try showing Rose Marie or Sweethearts to the uninitiated today, and it can be very difficult for them to sit still, but this unusual, fast-paced fantasy is sure to entertain.
