I have a girlfriend who is currently in a relationship with SOB, who has a long-time girlfriend. Of course, SOB is very beautiful, charming, etc., and my friend is a very smart woman. Watching Jean Pierre Lod's character at work is like watching what happens in real life when such guys destroy the lives of our girlfriends. This is tragic, and you know that she will end up suffering badly, but you can’t do anything. Leo is great. Absolutely empty. Blank everywhere, he pulls the face and tells the stories that, in his opinion, will get the reaction he wants. <br /> <br /> Scene two hours later, when Lo and Lebrun make love, and the next morning he puts on a record and, very sweetly and charmingly, sings together to entertain her brilliantly. The expression “What the hell am I doing here with this idiot,” which flickers back and forth across her face, will be remembered to me for a long time. <br /> <br /> This is a long film, but watch it at a time, preferably in a movie. It takes some time to enter, but then the time just disappears.
