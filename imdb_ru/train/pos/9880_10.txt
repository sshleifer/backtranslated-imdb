This film was made in 1943, when I think Judy has reached its peak (it looks wise). In her previous film “For me and my girlfriend,” people often say that she looks exhausted. Well, in this movie, she looks perfect. She is beautiful and shows that she has a talent for comedy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is hilarious, especially at the beginning when she tries to audition with John Thornway. In my opinion, one of the funniest scenes is the performance of Judy Lady Macbeth, and when John is looking for her at a party to give her a spanking (laughs). <br /> <br /> I have one criticism: a hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love. I mean one minute when he despises her, and the next time they go out on a date, and then when they meet after that date when they fall in love. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I didn’t like was at the opening, If I were Lily, I would have pissed off at John, but she didn’t ... it just doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> But overall, I would have to give this film 10, because it’s just great and almost perfect.
