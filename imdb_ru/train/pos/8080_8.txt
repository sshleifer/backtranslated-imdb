Well, after a while I got used to reading comments about these films, which do not reflect my experience at all. For me, Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous films. He was a stupid villain, a wicked man without an apology. For me, it was a breath of fresh air when I saw him in a role where his villainy was somehow not undermined. <br /> <br /> The guy who played Ariana must have been over his head. There I think that perhaps the director could have done better. But honestly, the best part of this film was Shernaz Patel. She is an overlooked heroine, a real veteran who is too skilled for every role she is offered. But I must say that I highly appreciated her contribution, since she played the wife of Virendra Sahi. She may have little to do, but she does everything with complete confidence. I'm sure she floated right over the heads of most of the audience. <br /> <br /> So, if you are used to agreeing to the average Ballywood level, you wonâ€™t get much benefit from this film. But if you are constantly looking for something more, then this may give you what you have missed.
