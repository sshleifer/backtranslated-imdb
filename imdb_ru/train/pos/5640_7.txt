I really think this film is great, personally. But in every film there is a depressant. Some of you may not have watched “Raise Your Voice” by Hilary Duff, but if you think about it, these two shows are very similar, if you know what I mean. In Brave New Girl, Holly wants so much to get into the conservatory of poverty. In Raise Your Voice, Terry wants to go to the Los Angeles Conservatory (I don't remember the name of the conservatory there). They are both in the music field, and they both have to sing at the end of the semester. It's really funny how these two films look like. I personally like “Brave New Girl” more than “Raise Your Voice”.
