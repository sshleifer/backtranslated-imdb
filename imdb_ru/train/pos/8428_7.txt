If this were done earlier in the Zatoichi series, this could be one of the best. This is good enough, like most of them, but the plot and characters seem too complicated for the series at the moment. The situation is extremely intriguing: the farmers in the province have two champions, a benevolent boss (this time) and a samurai philosopher, who begins a kind of Grange; both run counter to the usual local gangsters who want the crop to fail, because it increases their gambling revenues and their chances of getting some land; their main or powerful ally is the seeming puritan who died of drunkenness and gambling, but secretly indulges his perverted appetites. (He also recalls Dracula as the villains in later Zatoichi films tend to do this more often.) These characters have a lot of meaning, so they deserve to be opposed to Zatoichi, as he was originally drawn, but by now he lost many of his nuances. and changes in some characters, such as the good boss and evil sister of the man Zatoichi killed, need more time than the movie should give, so the story seems choppy, as if some scenes are missing. In addition, the film shows the merits of most of the others in the series: good acting, sometimes lyrical photography, creating a bright, believable and uniquely recognizable landscape (the absence of which is evident in the episodic episode where the director just misses it) nature masks itself: an imaginary variety of use of limited sets, so their limitations, apparently, do not exist. And, of course, there is a main actor whose presence, like his performance, makes it all work. This should be one of the longest-running TV shows in film history.
