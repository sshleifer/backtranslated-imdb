Well, before we consider, I have to ask: why is it not listed individually? Perhaps it was just a television film in Italy, but for international fans, Lamberto Bava is his own film. In America, this film is distributed on VHS and DVD as "Ogre" or "Demons 3". Yes, I know that this has nothing to do with “Demons”, except for one actor and team. But yes, I was personally upset that it was so hard to find on this site that otherwise it would be very helpful. <br /> <br /> Finally, let's look at the Ogre. I saw this trailer many times on YouTube and, frankly, it was pretty scary. The film itself (this is a full-length film, which is why it makes it a film) has many strengths and is scary. I was unhappy with the last act, but overall I don’t regret having bought the DVD before watching it (available on Shriek Show). I think the origin of the film explains the last act. I will not give out any spoilers. <br /> <br /> The plot is somewhat familiar: an American horror writer, resting in an ancient creepy castle with her husband and son just to find him, exactly matches the setting of her childhood nightmares. There are faint echoes of "Shining", but this is another brand of supernatural horror. The woman (Virginia Bryant) is finding more and more evidence that this is the real place of her nightmares, but her husband will not believe her. This is followed by a great atmosphere and horror. <br /> <br /> Several nightmares were rather strange. The Ogre cocoon effect was good; it reminded me a bit of Uncle Frank's resurrection from the first Hellraiser. There are also some good shocks and a well-made underwater scene. I tell them that the film never imitated American films with similar concepts, namely “A Nightmare on Elm Street.” Ogre is the original. And the monster itself was scary when it was presented correctly. <br /> <br /> There is an interview with Lamberto Bava on the DVD from Shrik Shaw, in which he cautiously notes that this is not part of his classics. Demons. He also appreciates the real castle in which the film was shot. Indeed, this parameter makes a big contribution to the film. Helps and music of Simon Boswell. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of good things. The Ogre is not perfect, but it is very worth seeing. Take this lesser achievement Lamberto Bava.
