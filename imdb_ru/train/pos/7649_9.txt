Jim Belushi entertainment car, modern cheeky version of It's A Wonderful Life. Michael Caine plays a kind of angel, which allows Belush to see what life would be like if he “made her big”. Jim is at his best with a good story and cast; it seems real chemistry between him and Hamilton. Not a contender for an Oscar, but kindhearted fun.
