Since September of last year, I have been borrowing four or six films every week at the Harold Washington Library, which boasts an impressive DVD collection. (HWL is indeed a circulating library: three-quarters of its films are released at any time!) Recently, I was very happy to find David Lynch's Short Films. Yesterday, knowing little about the animated series, I picked up Dumland. I'm here to report that for David Lynch fans, watching eight episodes is half an hour well spent. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable feature of these short pieces is their soundtracks. Each episode has its own rhythm. Respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion. Outrageous voices underline the pause. Physical abuse supplies rhythms. The chirping of birds and the buzz of rosettes are swept along the edges. Many other elements fill the orchestra. The coarse animation tempo is often synchronized with the sound, but the soundtrack itself struck me as Lynch's main interest in creating and distributing this work. In a sense, these eight shorts are unique Lynch rhythms. <br /> <br /> However, the situations are strange, ugly, deep, stupid and funny like hell. And they have enough space to think about how absurd we humans can be. I can not say that I will look at the collection again, but for those who enjoy the movements that are suites in Inland Empire, Dumbland costs half an hour of your time.
