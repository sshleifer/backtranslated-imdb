In addition to airplanes, trains and cars and Uncle Buck, this is John Candyâ€™s funniest movie. When he is hypnotized using a playing card (similar to the Manchurian candidate) and he becomes an excited guy who doesn't know what he is saying, he makes two very memorable quotes (both are related to male anatomy). The scene of love in which grocery products are involved must be visible, impossible to describe. <br /> <br />
