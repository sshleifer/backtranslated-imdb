This film is really special. This is a very beautiful film. It begins with three orphans, Sho, his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi. They are poor children, live on the street, but once they managed to steal a bag full of money, and then they were able to live to buy a house, and their life seems to be getting much better. They make new friends, lifelong friends. But something went wrong, and they become enemies, and it all ends with the fact that they kill each other. <br /> <br /> At first I was negative about this film because when I sing (Gackt - Solo, former singer) in Malice Mizer, Hyde - Solo, singer in L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel, very famous in Japan, and Wang Lee-Hom - Taiwanese singer), trying to become actors, but it is not like other singers, actors, films. They do an excellent job with their work, and previously they had no experience in cinema (with the exception of Lee-Homa, who previously starred in two films). <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite movies. Maybe it's a bit because I'm a very big fan of Hyde, but it was this film that made me discover it. <br /> <br /> Well, Gackt (playing the main character - orphan Sho) was part of the group that wrote the script, and it was he who insisted that Hyde play the role of Sho, Kay's vampire. At that time, they did not know each other, at least not as friends. But after the film, they became really good friends, and it also shows us that they really worked hard on this film and that they had good cooperation. <br /> <br /> The film has many different feelings going through the whole story, Love Hate, Sadness, Pain, Loneliness, Happiness and so on. I think that the first hour is the best, it is so beautiful. After that, people die, Kay leaves, and everything changes so much. But, nevertheless, this is a great film, this is the only film that made me cry, in the end it is so sad, but still beautiful. <br /> <br /> So if you havenâ€™t seen this movie yet, you really should. Because it is beautiful, but sad. You will not regret it. ^^
