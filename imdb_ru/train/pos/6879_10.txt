"The Groove Tube" was one of Ken Shapiro's two films, and the other, "Contemporary Issues." This is just a full-blown parody of television. In addition to Shapiro, who obviously did not do anything after Modern Problems, Chevy Chase and Henry Winkler’s cousin Richard Belzer also participate in the film. Three cast members (plus some other people in small roles) appear in different scenes. One of the most amusing is Chase in a fake geritola tv commercial, in which he describes the remedy, how his wife undresses, and this ends with pushing him. There are also pornographic news programs, an annoying cooking show, and an epic tale of some drug dealers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all this is just a real honk. In my opinion, the three best television spoofs are the movie “Tunnelvision” and “Kentucky Fried Movie” (although I could also include the “Truman Show”). Really funny. <br /> <br /> I wonder what happened to Ken Shapiro?
