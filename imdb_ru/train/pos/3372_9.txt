It's time to pay tribute to the great Sharton Heston after his recent demise, but this film is not the one. His other films of the past generation were Ben Hur, Ten Commanders, Omega Man and Planet of the Apes, which were his best works. <br /> <br /> This film, shot in 1973 in an attempt to prophesy about the future earth, in 2022, is so overcrowded that the authorities manipulated the human race to eat a universally produced food product called "Soylent Green", which produced with human flesh. This strange and implausible film was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now, and suggests that the population of India, which at this stage will be about 2 billion, will then be meat-eaters, not knowing about it. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston Characterize this secret international conspiracy that world powers have gathered to meet the needs of overpopulation in food with cannibalism. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for the producers of this film, the Green Message that they convey is not a Green Party in the modern spirit of Praise God. Cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous people of New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo just 40 years before this film was shot, but for a long time was left by human civilization. <br /> <br /> Another stupid prediction in the film is that women become quasi-sex slaves, reversing the wave of radical feminism that was on the rise in 1972 when this film was shot. <br /> <br /> The film was then stupid and just as stupid, but it did contain the last memorable film by the late and great Edward G. Robinson, but still not a good reason to watch the film except for academic reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid movie, and I wouldn't even recommend it to baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All other reviews of this film, which I read, sound the same with reference to the anti-utopian society, in the future of which the centralized theme seems to concern only the United States, in which an ecological disaster has occurred. <br /> <br /> The only merit in the film is that the land is facing overpopulation.
