This is one of the few films where I believe that playing a movie is an improvement on the original book. The story is clear, accessible, fun and interesting, and the musical numbers are no doubt exceptional. I admired the cyclical rendition of Old House Guard and charming Portobello Road, a great combination of early animation + real actors who, although outdated, do not detract from the charm of the piece. The background of World War II worked well and was not left out, as the film began, which so often happens in the 'evacuated' stories. <br /> <br /> Often too underrated film, it does not give end to the pleasure for people of all ages. The performances of the actors are exceptionally well done, and the entire text is neatly connected and well thought out. Guaranteed smile on his face!
