“Mother” is one of those films that, as you know, are good, maybe even great, but it’s like eating vegetables or doing maths homework for a child — too much work and a lot of pain to invest. <br /> <br /> The story is potentially unpleasant in many ways: the death of a character in the first half hour, a love affair with December-May, the idea that a man cheats on his wife and then cheats on his mistress with his mother, a collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty-year-old characters , the apparent indifference of adults to the children in their lives. This film was shot in 2002 or 2003, but he dropped the collection of British (usually for television) films of the late 1980s - he has a moral austerity that never weakens, causing enveloping trembling fear. <br /> <br /> Mother is flawless, but this is partly a problem; if there are any flaws in a film dedicated to such a number of sensitive issues - inconsistencies of the script, some less significant actors - this takes an advantage, but if such a film is so perfect, then watch it raw and painful. Even technical qualities - lighting, installation, etc., - make the viewer hurt; London in this film is bright and open, filled with harsh, harsh light. <br /> <br /> If you are as tough as a nail or one of those hypersensitive people who like to torture themselves with painful torment, sad films or novels, then you will enjoy The Mother. Anyone between them, skip it or be ready for the cramps. And be careful: no matter how hard the movie is from beginning to end, the worst is yet to come. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up. for this (for sleeping with her boyfriend), and her daughter calmly says that she thought about it and wanted to hit her. The mother agrees with this, they both get up, and — instead of a well-closed slap — the daughter clenches her fist and stabs the boxer. Argh !!!
