This comic-style movie is fun, has a pleasant pace and a great futuristic style. Writer Stephen de Souza, who also wrote “Commando”, gives Arnie many lines to play: “Send me a copy” after signing the contract and sticking a pen into lawyers; "What a pain in the neck" after strangulation minus barbed wire; "He should have split," after cutting his body between his legs; and finally, when Killian slams through a billboard with his own face, Arnie concludes: "Now it has struck." Oddly enough, he has some similarities, another sci-fi film with Schwarzenegger in the lead role.
