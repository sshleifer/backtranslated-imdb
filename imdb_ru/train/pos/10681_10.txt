While in the 1990s, the British released some funny and pleasant sitcoms - “Ab Fab”, “Men behave badly”, “One foot in the grave”, etc. - the 70s were a real golden age. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s, whole new explored territories, including the sexual revolution, feminism, and the slowly evolving awareness of the need for “sensitivity”, which in twenty years will become politically correct. Attempts to cope with the confusion in this completely modern world were subtle and not very subtle topics in everything - from Monty Python's Flying Circus parodies to comedy TV shows such as Man About the House. (By the end of the 70s, this “fight” led to the emergence of more meditative and bitter-sweet comedies, such as the masterpiece “Butterflies.”) a bit refined, bold, fresh, inventive, sometimes outrageous, with some well-made observations of modern life. Compare this with the cynical show of the 90s, such as Ab Fab, and it’s hard to believe that they were created in one country. <br /> <br /> “The Man about the House” is one of the great britkoms of the 70s, true there with Good Neighbors (Good Life), and George and Mildred will promote the House. Its quality is confirmed by the fact that, as in the case of "Good Neighbors", its creators, writers and many of its actors have had constant success on British television.
