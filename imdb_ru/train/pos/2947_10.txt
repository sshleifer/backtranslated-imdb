If you have not seen this, you do not know what you are missing. When you do this for the first time, it will hurt you a little if you lie on the floor, breaking free from such laughter and probably wetting yourself too. <br /> <br /> This is THIS funny. At this date there was not a single comedy performance, which, as I saw, stands on top or even approaches. So many classic liners, stories and segways. <br /> <br /> Drunken uncle at the barbecue, Joe Joe, Mr. T, crazy crazy guy with ice cream, you say all these things to everyone I saw this show and I will give you dollars on donuts kind and burst out laughing or start telling the rest of the dialogue from the act. <br /> <br /> Pure classic !! It is a pity that you can not get it on DVD .. <br /> <br /> Rating 10+ out of 10
