This smooth and gritty film consistently delivers. This is one of the best and most underrated films of Frankenheimer, and this is by far the best adaptation of Elmore Leonard to date (and if you scratch your head, thinking: “But I loved GET SHORT,” you should be hit in the face). In my opinion, no one will catch Leonard's “feel” of the characters better than John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. Moving the story from Detroit (a novel) to Hollywood (the film) raises the untidiness factor of the story to amazing heights. Be a man, have a beer and watch this movie. For reference, my favorite books are Leonard: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and MANCHUR CANDIDATE. I also have a special place in my cold heart movie for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
