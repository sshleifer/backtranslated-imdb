I recently purchased the complete series "American Gothic" on DVD, and it justified my memories of this. I was very grateful for the opportunity to watch episodes for the first time that were never broadcast on television. I especially liked The Ring of Fire, in particular the stories I didn’t see for the first time. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole is fantastic, as the “evil, sexy” Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also an excellent player. I thought that Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombes was great in her image. In fact, the whole cast was fantastically talented and had excellent chemistry with each other. <br /> <br /> It’s a shame that the series was messed up with the network (in collusion with a growing group of censors) because it was really designed for adults to watch. A mixture of comedies, tragedies, farce, satire, gothic romance and horror genres, offered brilliant characteristics supported by the game at the level of genius. <br /> <br /> I experienced the greatest thirst for the devil in my life. Long live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the most juicy "fallen angel" in history.
