The Twelfth Animated Disney Classic is a sensible movie told through a simple story. Despite the fact that he is a bit outdated, he deserves a place in the list of Disney classics. <br /> <br /> It is not among the best works of Disney, but satisfies. Yes, one of the most "simple" works of Disney, but retains a certain magic and charm (which is well known for the old Disney). It was an important film, because it saved Disney from a delicate situation. If it was a failure, then there would be no more animated Disney classics. <br /> <br /> “Cinderella” is a bit like returning to the first animated Disney classics (“Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”), because it returns the fairy tale genre. It is not clear where this story takes place, but I guess it is somewhere in France because it is based on the tale of Charles Perrault. <br /> <br /> There are many cute characters, such as Cinderella, Prince, Bruno (dog), Jacques and Gus (two main mice), Good Fairy (for fairies, she is, of course, funny), birds, King and Grand Duke. <br /> <br /> Jacques is very clever and funny. I love his voice. It actually has this mouse quality. Gus may not be that smart, but he’s with humor. <br /> <br /> King is cheerful, but I think what makes him so funny is his temper. The Great Prince is a very cool guy and also funny. They are two of my favorite characters in this film and are responsible for many of the funniest moments. <br /> <br /> Prince is certainly one of the most charming in Disney. Without a doubt, Prince Philip from Sleeping Beauty was inspired by this prince, because they are very similar. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (stepmother) should not be pretty because she is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastasia and Drizella) are not much better than her. However, the stepmother is not as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is tender, kind, sweet and sweet. By the way, I think her beautiful pink dress is much better than the dress the Fairy gave. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (the cat) is ridiculously malicious. The way he walks, sticking his nose into the air, and these arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny. Ironically, he is very much like a stepmother when it comes to personality. He always agrees with the stepmother's attitude towards Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him, because he is such a diabolical and mean cat. However, there is nothing annoying about it. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is simple but enjoyable, although not the best at Disney. The best song in this movie is "Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo". <br /> <br /> There are many famous talented actors in this film, such as James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleonora Audley, Verna Felton and Louis Van Ruten. <br /> <br /> Although the film is simple, it has good artwork as well as nice details, although it is never something “from this world”. Nevertheless, the royal palace is an impressive masterpiece, being truly majestic and colossal.
