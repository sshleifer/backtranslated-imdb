I do not watch soap. My grandmother is still looking at her with an hourglass. I made fun of them when I was ten (it was so easy). <br /> <br /> But this film takes a parody and pronounces it in new ways. I found the story pretty damn funny. 80s fashion - shoulder pails, sequins and polyester - just completes it. Huge hair, high heels and histrionic - what a combination. <br /> <br /> All the actors just go to the city, chewing their pieces and spitting them into a big, well-written script. Sally, Kevin, Elizabeth - great! Whoopi - great! Robert Downey - nice to see him when he had such potential, up to the tabloids. And Harry: why did we wait so long to see him in the film? Lisa Gibbons - did not miss her, but it's nice to include her as a reporter for entertainment programs in real life (and in general, where do you apply for this work?). <br /> <br /> Admittedly, I could do without Sally climbs the drainpipe. Lucy Ricardo did this, how many times? Like every comedian from Carol Burnett to "I don't know who, and I did away with it, I could spit peanuts if I had them." Apparently, this is what you do when you are having fun in a tall building in New York. I'm just grateful that they didn't pull out a little flagpole. <br /> <br /> But it was cute, it was funny, he had plot twists, he had captions after the end, before it was spread, he had clothes worthy of a second look, she had a great cast, and I still have personal memories. Really, what else do you need?
