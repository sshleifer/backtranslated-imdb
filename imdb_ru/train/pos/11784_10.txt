As it was well documented by the previous posters, the real stars of Rockstar: INXS - and, indeed, this continuation, Rockstar: Supernova - are Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. Do not know who they are? This is an amazing, tough, rock'n house group, whose music, talent and talent made this show something more than just a clone of an American idol. <br /> <br /> Remember the night of the "strings"? It was musical accuracy and perfection, if I ever saw it. Susie MacNeil's epic rendition of “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Quinn, Taylor’s memorable cover “Stones you cannot always get”, J. D. Fortuna sings “Suspicious Minds”. The common denominator here is the amazing House Band. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that INXS were in their prime, they unfortunately had a shadow of their former essence, although JD's live performance somewhat breathed new life into their music, this show is dedicated to HB. <br /> <br /> Memo to producers: the third season (if we are blessed enough to make it happen) should be the Rockstar: House Band. Get these boys as a good vocalist and they will go.
