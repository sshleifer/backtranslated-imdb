“Written in the wind” - Douglas Sirk's melodrama. Douglas Sirk was re-opened by Cahiers du Cinema, Fassbinder, etc., who welcomed him as chief director - I think it was because of the sophistication of his cinematography - "Written in the wind" offers rich color images and great decors But I ask myself: is it enough to carry the film? The action in “Written in the Wind” varies from weak to fair (excluding Robert Stack - he is convincing as weak and spoiled by a playboy). Lauren Bacall, as a rule, a powerful presence on the screen, in this film is mistaken. Dorothy Malone, as a temptress, a carefree “femme fatale,” is fine, but she lacks the strength for this role. Rock Hudson is effective, but useless. <br /> <br /> There are very interesting ingredients in the story. The main characters: <br /> <br /> hard patriarch <br /> <br /> his alcoholic son Kyle (Robert Stack) (never loved by a disappointed father) <br /> <br /> his disappointed and daughter- Nympho Marily (Dorothy Malone) <br /> <br /> Lucy (Lauren Bacall) is a principled woman, past secretary, and now married to Kyle. <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought along with Kyle and beloved by the patriarch. <br /> <br /> Secrets behind the door, a love triangle, frustration, fisticuffs, laughter, death, etc. - well, when I read a brief summary of the story on the back cover of the DVD, I thought that I was waiting to be treated. To blame! What for? I will try to explain: “Written in the wind” takes itself seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. As I said before, acting is not good enough in general - there is not enough intensity. The plot has a lot of strong scenes, but the actors just do an effective job. I think that perhaps with Italian or Spanish actors these scenes would be fully explored - they will end (for us) with a burst of laughter or tears. <br /> <br /> What remains for us is the beautiful cinematography of Douglas Sirk. For me, this is not enough. If you want to enjoy a good melodrama, see "Aventure".
