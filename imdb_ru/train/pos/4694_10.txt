If you are a fan of “airplane” films, this is a must-see! Recruitment in the 1920s and 30s, Johnny Dangerlius has not only great actors, but also great roles. "knock down the data wall, knock down the data wall and knock down the wall dat # @ $% # @ $." "You must not hang me on the hook, Johnny," or "Looks like Johnnis was lying." This is definitely a parody of old James Cagney films and often mentions them. There is a great scene when Johnnis walks on death row and is assigned a priest for his escape. Listen carefully to the false testimony of the priests, it is quite funny. Another great scene when House Deleuze plays the Pope. See how he reacts to Johnny after he tips the pope, as many people say without making a sound. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to laugh or is a lover of old movies.
