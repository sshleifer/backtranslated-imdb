Before George Clooney shot Sam Rockwell in his directorial debut, Confession of a Dangerous Mind, they co-starred in this film. George Clooney was also associated with this film as a producer, along with Stephen Soderbergh, which shows that they really believed in this project. In potential, it also looks like a wonderful and interesting project that is in line with the film’s remakes, such as Eleven Oceans and Italian Work, but somehow this film is only half successful, or at least not this way. as good as it could be. <br /> <br /> In the film, where all the characters play, well-known actors play, but the shame is that the characters do not have enough space for development. Despite the fact that, in terms of their potential, they could turn into funny and enjoyable characters, now they are only characters who entertain themselves gently, mainly due to some more bizarre episodes that are in the film. The fact that they are played does not change anything in this, although they do not allow their characters to become boring, annoying or something like that. <br /> <br /> This is of course due to the writing that characters do not use their full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian film “I Soliti ignoti” works much better than this film. The film relies too much on its simple story and predictable storytelling. <br /> <br /> However, the film is still very interesting to watch, perhaps because of the same simplicity. It’s a small, harmless caper film in which you just don’t need to worry much about history. In this regard, Welcome to Collinwood is still a film that works well and just performs its task well. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you will not regret watching it, but it is also a movie that you can really easily make without even seeing it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
