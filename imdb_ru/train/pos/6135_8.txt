Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another of Disney's masterpieces. It was filmed with animation sequences and actors and actresses interacting with the animations. (A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins, when the children and Mary disappear into the art of the sidewalk.) I basically appreciate this film through the eyes of a child, because I have not seen it for years. Then it was one of my favorite movies. It was magical and mystical, and the last scenes (the conflict starting with ghostly armor going into battle) were my favorites. There was also a lot of stop animation used with spells (that is, people turning into rabbits), which can be a bit outdated and dumb. (In addition, I believe that the film begins slowly.) Through the eyes of a child, this is a funny film, and it is easy for children to put themselves in the place of children in the film. This is a creative film, which, unfortunately, is largely forgotten today.
