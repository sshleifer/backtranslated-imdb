Written by the author, who wrote the awesome “Kill Rooms” series, which described the adventures of ACD with Dr. Joseph Bell, I was looking forward to it and was not disappointed. It was a rather slow move, with a lot of emphasis on Doyle’s disappointment at Sherlock Holmes, which was very accurate and beautifully depicted. It was an interesting character study and a very good shot (on digital video, unusual for a period). The acting was excellent, especially Tim McKinneri and Brian Cox, although the actor who portrayed ACD, whose name I don’t remember, struck me without end. An excellent character study that has about the same amount of turns as any ordinary case of Sherlock Holmes. See if you have a chance
