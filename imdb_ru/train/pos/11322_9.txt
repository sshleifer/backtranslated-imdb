This anime seriously shook my socks. When the anime first opened, I felt that it was too slow; the story did not advance, and Shirou was a completely unimpressive man. As soon as he learns more about tracing, and you learn more about Saber and about the Holy Grail War itself, the story unfolds, and you see how several of its aspects move together. It was awesome. <br /> <br /> In addition, I felt that the way in which the characters evolved was quite likely to correspond to the pattern of development of real people in the real world. There were no stupid, completely obvious things going on; It was interesting to observe the development of Ilya and Rin, but I think how Shiro and Saber grew up in their own personalities, it was just interesting to watch all this. The few “unexpected” people who appear (Gilgamesh?) Somehow seemed unique among the rest of the actors, that is, we didn’t have a replacement for Generic Bad-ass A for Generic Bad B, as soon as A died. <br /> <br /> And I also loved music. The opening music swayed, and the final theme from the last episode is just ... Seriously advanced the theme of the last episode even more. Good job, Tip-Luna!
