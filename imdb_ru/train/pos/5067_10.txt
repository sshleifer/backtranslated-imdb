Here, on IMDb.com, I read the opinion that the Gray Owl is the best Pierce Brosnan character ever to speak. I donâ€™t know if his roles were better or worse, I'm not his fan, but this one was really exceptional. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the impressive hand of the director. I respect. The tranquility, the beauty and the spirit of the wild nature have really been illustrated exclusively, I have never met such an affinity for it in any film before. <br /> <br /> Another thing left in my memory after the film is the movie closest to the original books and the atmosphere in it. <br /> <br /> And a little more. I respect the original Gray Owl.
