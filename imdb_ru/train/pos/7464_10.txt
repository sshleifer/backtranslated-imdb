Made me think about it for a few days after I saw it. For me, this is a great feature of the movie. Eyes Wide Shut had the same effect on me. I'm tired of these people demanding these happy Hollywood cookie endings. I plan to see him again tonight in order to understand the plot a little better - but, nevertheless, the filmâ€™s emotional messages were completely tangible.
