It is very funny. He has an excellent cast, each of which gives an excellent presentation. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. This is a well-written script by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon In Vegas). I don't like soap operas, although I never watch them. But I really like this film because it is so crazy and hidden from the walls that it damn surpasses any silly soap that they have on daytime television. In my opinion, this is the best film of 1991.
