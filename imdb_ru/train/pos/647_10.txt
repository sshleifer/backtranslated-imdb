Well, of course not, women are, on average, overly sensitive and in need, which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore, although not pseudo-artistic, extravagant or impudently stops at this. Unlike many of you, I have seen La Maman et La Putain only twice. As in many good films, I noticed that my opinion of this improved after the second viewing. All I know is what I saw, and I still have to go into further exploits, until I get the DVD myself. I have yet to find out why I like this film so much, but in fact, why should I care, why? Although I'm sure I can and will form some wonderful explanation. Good, so you may disagree, maybe sometimes it's a bit boring, I'm not an expert. The blonde reminds me of the beautiful Grushenka.
