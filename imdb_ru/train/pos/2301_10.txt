Indeed ... and an incredible film, although not very popular ... extremely touching and almost life-changing ... was at least for me. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing and buying ..... Added to my list of favorite movies .... now it is number one .... <br /> <br /> This is a very touching movie that must see all the people. <br /> <br /> Man in the Moon ..... we are just incredible. Now this is my favorite movie, and I only watched it today, and I would recommend it to anyone over 15, if you are a little mature ... If you really don’t try to feel the characters ’emotions, then you’ll never understand the true meaning of the values ​​of this movie ... But it's really incredible ... just watch it, because it will change the way some people look at life ... Worth seeing 5/5
