Frownland is like one of those extremely awkward situations where you end up laughing loudly at the wrong time; and just at that moment, when you understand that you should not laugh, you have already reached the top of the vocal sound; and when you look around at ghostly-white faces with wide-open mouths and glazed eyes, you feel a piercing pain, starting in the depths of the abdomen and suddenly breaking in the throat, and ... well, you understand. <br /> <br /> But despite all its troubles and blows to the face, Frowland really does a great job, which after watching the unintelligible mess of the main character and all his pathetic problems and failures makes you want to scratch your eyes, and at the same time time you are terribly sorry for him. <br /> <br /> It would have been much easier for me just to get out of the Ronald Bronstein film, but for some madmen of reason, I felt the unshakable determination to stay on course and experience all the grainy annoyance the film had to offer. If someone sets you on fire, you usually want to put out: Stop! Drop it! And roll! But with this movie, you want to watch the flames slowly cover your entire body. You suffer pain - perhaps because of anger or some unknown masochistic curiosity, which I cannot even try to explain. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the usual movie will never allow this film to come to your nearest theater. But if you have a chance to catch him, get ready: bring a bag for a dog.
