I work in a movie theater, and therefore I am always looking for a great movie. I decided to check out Nothing, as it sat in our Canadian section, and I tried to support the film industry of my country. A surprise was waiting for me. In the film, David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a very entertaining story that seems to delve into so many of our minds and relationships ... without work that it is difficult. This is constantly comedic through the interaction of two characters, as well as some funny exchanges (“We cannot be dead, we have a telegram!”). What else can be said without noticing that it is worth a try, even if you give it up within the first half hour.
