Uggh! I was not really impressed with this film, although I must admit that it is technically well made. He gets 7 for very high production figures, but as far as entertainment values ​​are concerned, he is pretty bad. In fact, I think this is one of the most overrated films of the 50s. He received an Oscar for Best Picture, but sometimes the film is just boring: so much dancing, dancing and dancing. This is because, unlike some musicals that have a sufficient number of songs, as well as a strong history and acting game (for example, MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS), almost everyone in this film is singing and dancing. In fact, this film tells about the longest song and dance number in history, and if you are not interested in this, the film will quickly get bored. Give me more stories! As a result, with bloated production numbers and a weak history, this film is like a stable meringue diet - it simply does not satisfy in the long run. <br /> <br /> To think ... this is a film in which the “Tram called Desire” and “Place in the Sun” won for the best picture! And, even worse, the "African Queen" and "Ace in the hole" were not even nominated in this category! Even more surprising for me is that “Ace in the Hole” lost for the best script, the script for this film, although “American in Paris” could hardly have been told a story, and it was mainly motivated by dances and songs.
