<br /> <br /> I must admit, I was expecting something completely different from my first viewing of 'Cut' last night, even though I was delighted with the unexpected Australian terrible horror. I’m a true horror fan, as truthful as they are, and found that Cut is not only the best genre Australia has ever produced, but also one of the greatest parody / comedy films of late. <br /> <br /> What worries me is that the mainstream audience may not catch many comedic elements - the film was not too clever in its application, but made me laugh at every step, trying to fit into EVERY possible horror genre cliche, which they could. I’m sure it was intended as humor .... I hope it was meant as humor. <br /> <br /> And of course there was blood. <br /> <br /> Use Garden shears were great - besides the expected punches and shots. In short, there was a lot of variety and creativity in many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptics of this film. <br /> <br /> The appearance of both Kylie Minogue (in short, that her appearance was) and Molly Ringwald was just another reason to watch the film - both performances were fantastic, and also Simon Bossella (“The Castle”) in brilliant the role of technician-prankster. <br /> <br /> In general, I think that this film is one of the best works of horror in the last couple of years, as well as a great satire / parody - ruthlessness to the very end. <br /> <br /> Loved it. Go look!
