I saw the film recently during the Boston Film Festival. The film was very interesting and this is what I believe in the world, and black America is ready to see it. This is a comedy, drama, great soundtrack. This is a good movie. The characters were well crafted, and the film had many outstanding actors such as Wood Harris (Remember the Titans, fully paid), Brian J. White (Trois 3, Mr. 3000) and the wonderful Zoe Saldana (Drumline), Pirates of the Caribbean) The film touches on many current topics of modern society in a short period of time and does so with class and grace. This is not only a story about life in a hospital, but it is a story about people and their personal journey to find out who they are or who they will be.
