(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was amazed by this movie. I rented a movielink for a bit and decided to check out this movie. Many boxing films seem to be full of blood. In this film, he shows it on an amazing level. Although I would like to, perhaps, more attention was paid, perhaps, to its improvement of their assessments. The film tells about the problems that some families face with the floor. <br /> <br /> I was a little concerned about the ending. But the final did not disappoint either. <br /> <br /> I think the name made it clear that she would win. What was unexpected was that they both came together again at the end. <br /> <br /> I liked the score for some scenes. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Entertainment: 10/10 <br /> <br /> Playability: 10 / ten
