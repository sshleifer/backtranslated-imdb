A simple comment ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... this is a wonderful movie that I can watch again and again. This is definitely one of the top ten comedies. With a great cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau formulate Neil Simon's perfect script based on his play. <br /> <br /> This is real for a life situation that is perfect. If you have a digital cable, you will see a menu at the bottom of the screen to show what is included. This usually gives this film ***% of stars, but in reality it deserves **** stars. If you really watch this film, you can say that it will be just as funny and fresh in a hundred years.
