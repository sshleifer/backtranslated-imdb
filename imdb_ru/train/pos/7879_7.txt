As with most of Eleanor Powell's films, this one is played along the most fragile of the plots. For some reason - oh, that explains! - it is selected to transport magnetic mines to Cuba. Good guys and bad guys compete for the mine, and who gets confused. But, as always, Powell's dances are excellent and worth the cost of admission. And in this Lahr plays his cowardly lion, evoking fond memories of the 1939 Technicolor film. A tangible advantage is to hear young Frank with that wonderful voice and thin vulnerability, which he later left for his wise person. In addition, the great drummer Buddy Rich perfectly demonstrates his virtuosity. Especially watch out for his unique duet with trumpeter Dorsey, Ziggy Elman. I say “unique,” ​​perhaps unknowingly, but I don’t know of any other drum / pipe sequence like this one in a movie or recording. This movie is fun. Even the stupid persona of Skelton is relatively restrained. Powell again shows that she is the greatest dancer in the movie.
