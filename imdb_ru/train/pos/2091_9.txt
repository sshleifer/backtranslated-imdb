What Irving Talberg did in creating this film today will never again be undertaken. Making Chinese history with Western players, even if they are, among others, Paul Muni, Louise Rainer, Charlie Grapevine and Walter Connolly. <br /> <br /> Perhaps partly because the story was written by a Westerner, Pearl Buck, who won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel in 1932. Mrs. Buck, the daughter of Chinese missionaries, probably brought China closer to the consciousness of America than anyone else. Not the political struggle of China, but the life and hard work of the people we are in the Good Earth. Unfortunately, Pearl Bak later became an apologist for Kuomintang China Chiang Kai-shek in all its virtues and excesses. The rest of her literary work never matched the Good Land. <br /> <br /> In The Sundowners there is an excellent description of the comparison of China with Australia by Peter Ustinov. When asked about the difference, Ustinov said that China was very big and very full, and Australia was very big and very empty. This is what you see in “Good Land”, in China there is a very big and very big people, with whom it sometimes cannot cope. <br /> <br /> “Good Land” tells the story of Van Lung (Paul Muni) as a young man who buys his wife in a big house where she was a slave. The woman O-Lan (Louise Rainer) will give birth to his two sons and sees him in all the good and bad times that they are experiencing: drought, famine, revolution and climatic locust. <br /> <br /> Louise Rainer won the second of two consecutive Oscars for the image of O-Lana. Perhaps she set some kind of record in that it should be the leading Oscar game with the least amount of dialogue. Everything she does in practice is done with a facial expression, her performance could be in a silent film with very minimal subtitles. I think that only John Mills in “Ryan's Daughter” had fewer words, and he played a mentally retarded man. <br /> <br /> Muni doesn’t always appreciate how much she supports this male-dominated culture. Rainer helps in the field, gives birth and brings up children, does housework. When Muni becomes a property man, he takes the second Chinese trophy wife, which causes him a lot of grief. Yet Rainer stoically carries all this. However, Muni is not a bad person, and this is a tribute to the film, his acting skills and the writings of Buck that you do not hate him, and the cultural gap has been bridged. <br /> <br /> We now have a group of Eastern players who make more than just Kung Fu movies. I'm surprised that the Good Land of all films was not redone at this moment. I can bet that the Chinese government will even allow some American company to do it in a real place. <br /> <br /> Until then we will have a wonderful classic that will be appreciated and enjoyed.
