This series may well be the best in the entire history of Britcom, and it says a lot, given the competitors (Fawlty Towers, Good Neighbors, to name just two). <br /> <br /> What made the Butterflies so superb, even for the best of the best, is that she not only illustrated the great, classic, classy and intelligent comedy, but also broadened the horizons, reflecting - flawlessly, softly and in each the details are the great social changes that occurred in the UK in time. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this show as a teenager and was delighted with it all. The pictured way of life was wonderful in itself. It was the first time I saw real people using cordless phones. And the wardrobe of all the characters was far from the silly outfit of the seventies, still found in North America at the time. Then there were decors, windows, cars. These people - even simple sons with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor - were sophisticated. They were examples of “new Europeans” that will affect life and style throughout the world in the coming decade (1980s). <br /> <br /> Of course, the premise was strange and fantastic. The idea that someone who lives in a suburban dream could be so unhappy and restless was revolutionary, especially for North Americans, for whom happiness was always defined as money and things (of course, the situation was portrayed in American films and on television, but not with such intensity). butterflies or film Montenegro). And, if the premise was not surprising enough, the means by which it was expressed brought it to the extreme. A potential romance that wasn't really related to sex or even romance? Butterflies blinded many, but this must have led some people to disbelieve their foreheads ... at least at that time. <br /> <br /> Butterflies turned out to be - in many ways - prophetic. He documented, ahead of his time - the postmodern longing, all-pervading lifestyle, the concept of emotional infidelity, disunity of generations and male discontent (ideally portrayed by the tense relationship of father and son). It is a pity that this series was not rediscovered to a great extent, and everyone who participated in this series was given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place, and foreseeing all the attractiveness and longing that should have come.
