I saw a lady with red hair when she appeared, and did not remember that it was something to be cherished. The truth is that, despite its foundation in real history, his screen version is stupid and incredible. The real merit of the picture - the cast. The constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30s and 40s creates a backdrop for the delicate, smart work of the always underrated Miriam Hopkins and the wonderful, impressive performance of Claude Raines, who, as usual, is the best in image. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he is in the good company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps the Lady with the red hair contains her best work in the movies. Watch and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
