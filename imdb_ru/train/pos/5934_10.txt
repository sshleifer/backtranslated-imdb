Sorry I do not know what Hollywood does. Of course, give us movies like Batman. Oh, by the way, Hollywood, I think they can cover the storyline in the movie “Batman,” but please don't entertain us with what we really would like to see with Batman and Superman. I really hated this trailer because it left me wanting more. I looked around to see when it comes out. It was like a terrible practical joke. Graphics with a good storyline seemed solid, and it contained all the attributes of a great movie. Unfortunately, this will not happen yet. For producers, directors, and all the actors, great work, but I hate you for doing this to me. You left me wanting more.
