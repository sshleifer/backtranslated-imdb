Something surprised me in this film - it was really original. This was not the same old rubbish that comes out of Hollywood every month. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on video because I didnâ€™t even know about it before I saw it in my local video store. If you see this movie in stock - rent it - you will not regret it. Waiting accumulates everywhere, and the twist final is excellent. <br /> <br />
