Due to the fact that Harry Callahan was waking up over the years, inevitably there should have been a story about "an old man with a chip on his shoulder." Callahan, sometimes looking frail and inappropriate, his behavior still remained unchanged. Fortunately, this film had some time to develop a different type of story that could reinvent Garry and the whole genre. Although the film failed in this, it was still a great addition to the series, even if it became a little out of place during the times of the silly fashion trends and music of New Wave.
