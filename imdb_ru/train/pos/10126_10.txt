Much has been said about the Shinjuku Triad Society as the first real film, Miike, and I thought that such a description could be a cliche. But, like all clichés, it is based on truth. All Miike trademarks are present here: violence, black humor, homosexuality, taboos, testing, and a complex central character. Shinjuku, however, is one of Miike's most beautifully formed films. In an interview, he says that if he does it again, everything will be different, but not necessarily better. I think that he means that the film has really charming energy and a raw edge that seems so fresh that, although he could make a more visually or technically complex film, he could not reproduce or improve the purity of this film. <br /> <br /> As was to be expected, violence is extremely intuitive in nature, gushing blood and brutal beatings is complemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a broken face on a chair. (Only the film “Miike” can allow you to come up with such a proposal.) The film has a fantastic pace, unlike Dead or Alive, which begins and ends strongly and goes down the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar problems, Miike is clearly concerned about the relationship between the Japanese and the Chinese in the post-war period, and this emotional subject is well considered here, the central character really comes alive when you begin to understand its past. <br /> <br /> I can't sing Shinjuku's praise enough. I do not want to give too much. This is Miike, before he started using CGI to animate his films and almost resembles something like Sonatine Kitano. The main characters are superbly implemented, and the final twist ensures that as soon as the movie ends, you turn it on again to solve it all.
