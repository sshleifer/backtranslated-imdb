What the other reviewer called the lack of character development, I call an understatement. The film did not hit on the head with an excessive explanation or unnecessary backstory. Yes, there were many unwritten stories about which we only caught a glimpse, but this was primarily a one-day snapshot of the event, which became a catalyst for changes in all the lives of the characters. Henry Thomas's performance was truly an excellent exploration of acting power, which focuses on reaction rather than action. Good rental.
