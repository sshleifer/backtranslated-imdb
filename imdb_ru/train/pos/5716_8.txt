I haven't seen a single Japanese Grudge movie, but I really like it. I rarely fear watching movies. I can jump if the effect and sound are quite striking, but the scare from the movie is rare for me. But I was scared by Grudge. Maybe because I did not expect anything when I watched it. I did not expect to get scared. I didn't know anything about that either. It was probably good. <br /> <br /> This is a film that you obviously either love or hate. Most people seem to compare it with Japanese Grudge films, but even if I haven’t seen them, I find it really wrong to compare any film. This film stands alone. <br /> <br /> A weak story, many say. I do not agree History is minimalist and made specifically. The storytelling methods used — for example, with deadlines — are well done. The director knows exactly what he is doing, and I believe that he realized his vision the way he wanted it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 8 out of 10. This is a movie that you enjoy watching or hating. It is so simple.
