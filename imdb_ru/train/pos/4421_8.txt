Gojo is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema, in which very creative directors, editors and photographers work, and they are working on historical themes that the Japanese call “historical plays”. Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Brilliant, even. A new wave of Japanese films about samurai allows you to look at the traditional beliefs in shamanism, demons and occult forces, which, of course, were part of their ancient culture, but not really explored in the epics of Kurosawa samurai or the series "Zaytochi". Another great example of this genre is Onmyoji (2001). I would call the director Sogo Ichiya one of the most interesting and creative Japanese directors of the new wave. Other recent Japanese plays that I would highly recommend include The Twilight Samurai by Yomadi (2002) and Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman by Shintaro Katsu (2003).
