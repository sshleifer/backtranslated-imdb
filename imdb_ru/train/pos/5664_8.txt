I really like this show. I easily see how he attained cult status. It is original and makes you wonder. For some reason, I never felt the resonance I could have. It does not look like an open door, a winter cold that was supposed to be from such an amazing room. Every time I watch an episode, I push him to answer some unnamed, formless question. <br /> <br /> Before continuing, let me preface it by saying that my opinion and my opinion is only an opinion. Different strokes for different people. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more scenes in “American Gothic”, filmed at night. There is too much daylight on this show, and I think he had a tendency to counteract uncertainty. In the end, we are not afraid of daylight. We are concerned about what is in the shadows. The devil is not always in the details. What we do not see is often the most frightening. <br /> <br /> Secondly, and this is what will probably lead to tar and feathers: Gary Cole is an incredibly talented actor ... the character of the actor. I followed his career in the Brady Bunch films, so it hurts me to say that he was probably mistaken for Lucas Buck. It is almost too Petrikans, too pleasant to be the embodiment of evil, even by biblical standards. Lucas Buck is a drug. He is heroin. He works in a kitchen lab next to a gallon of Drain-O. You keep coming back, even if you know that the end will be madness and death. He should be like the ultimate usurer. He is the creator of books, but also of unheard of condemnation. Of course. You have money, and soon your fingers will also be broken; a severed hand, a headless head, and, finally, a damned soul. Appeal to Baku is an act of despair, and whenever it is near, there must be some immediate, final atmosphere in the air with a daily interest. <br /> <br /> This is all generosity, all strings, and by the time you understand this, you will also realize that it is already too late. <br /> <br /> Which leads me to three: they too often showed Buck. In fact, he is in most scenes because of which he could lose the advantage. The sheriff would be similar to the neighboring mythology. He is an apocryphal acquaintance. Many would know about him, but only the unfortunate would know him. He would be the subject of memories and mysterious conversations, and the hero that Nick Sirsi would portray could be the ideal person for displaying this storyline exposition. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the show could be very selfless. Some may say that this is a reverence - for wine - and this is typical of the whistle “Meet me on a fishing trip” in the pilot series. I think we have already established that what Cassidy and Raimi shot for was anti-Andy Taylor. We probably didn't need the concept that we delivered through Fed Ex. I realized that for the first five minutes the piano on my head was unnecessary for me. <br /> <br /> All these comments are about what would make a great show great for me. I also understand that the producers had their own unique style, and that there were many hands in the soup. In their eternal pursuit of programming, the LCD network played a part in the demise of this series. <br /> <br /> The minimum that these stupid costumes could do was to show the episodes in order. <Br /> <br /> Become a real one. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a sad loss for both fans of the genre and casual viewers.
