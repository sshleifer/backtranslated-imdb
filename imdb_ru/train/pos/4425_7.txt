Another attempt by modern Japanese directors to revise the genre of Chambara. Successful, but not to varying degrees. <br /> <br /> A Buddhist monk sees that he must kill the legendary (and very active) demon on the Gojo bridge in order to achieve enlightenment. Being not at the forefront, Buddhist thought underlies this film, much like Kurosawa's Run. This probably made the film the most interesting for me, although it is far from being in the Ran League. <br /> <br /> Stylish visual orientation and great photography make the film mostly interesting for two hours and eighteen minutes. The main actors are equally excellent. The music is really good. Two weaknesses are history and battle scenes. The film stretches in the middle, which could be corrected with some careful editing. And the fighting scenes are mostly filmed in blurry close-ups. This works for most of the film, but the final seems to be a hoax. Another recent film like this is Tsui Hark's Seven Swords, a great movie, but the promised battle scenes are disappointing. Asano doesn't really move like a demon wielding a sword, his game is gorgeous, but he would be extra in the traditional scene of a battle with Shambara. <br /> <br /> A good movie, you will probably find it interesting, just donâ€™t expect traditional sword fights.
