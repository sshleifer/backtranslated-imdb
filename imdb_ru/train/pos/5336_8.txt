I really like this movie because in Australia, Chinese films never show in prime time. I have to say that this is one of the best serious films in the whole story, which tells about the difference between the people of Hong Kong and mainland China. It does show that there is discomfort between them, but he can only get better as HK learn Mandarin. It also showed me how there is an indie rock scene in mainland China, and that the Chinese know how to play the guitar and have fun at home! Who said China is not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely superb, with his clear and crisp voice, fair play and a full chick magnet. I recommend this movie to those who know little about Asians, to clear themselves of typical Western stereotypes, and to people who simply love Chinese / Asian cinema, like me. Check this!
