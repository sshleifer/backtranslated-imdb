Jack Frost is a really cool movie. I mean .... This is ridiculous. This is Violent. and very enjoyable. Most people say that this is a B rating, but this could not be further from the truth. He has great special effects and a good game. The only thing that is strange, of course, is the snowman killer. I think this film was actually one of the best films of the late nineties. Most of the films these days lack the criteria for Clive Barker's master part. That is, be original and give the viewer what he does not expect. Jack Frost is very cool. 10 out of 10. Rating: A +. Ed also recommends Uncle Sam to Jack Frost fans.
