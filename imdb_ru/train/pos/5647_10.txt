I do not want to bore everyone by repeating what was said, but this is one of the best episodes! It was a big shame when it was canceled, and I hope that someone will have the common sense to pick it up and start the series again. The good news is that it is on DVD !!!! I rushed to the store and took a copy, and I am happy to say that it is as good as I remembered it. Gary Cole is an amazingly dark and creepy character, and all the actors were very good. It's a shame that the network did not continue it. Sean Cassidy, this is a masterpiece. Anyone who uses the genre and who has not seen it should do it. You will not be disappointed. My daughter, who was too young to watch her on TV (she was 20 years old), was very interested and would soon become her fan. She finds it "very distorted" and enjoyed the episodes she saw. I can't wait to watch episodes that haven't been broadcast. <br /> <br /> This show is awesome !!!!
