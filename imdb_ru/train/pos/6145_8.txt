Mary Poppins is definitely much better, but, nevertheless, it's a great movie. Angela Lansbury is super crazy, like Engletin Price, and David Tomlinson is a lot of fun, like Mr. Brown. Their chemistry was just great. The children, however, simply lacked the same brilliance, although Paul is very cheerful and cute. The songs were not really as bad as some say, “Beautiful Salt Sea” - the best, in fact, all the songs are outstanding. The special effects were great, there was a lot of magic in them, and the story is quite original. The highlights, though, like Mary Poppins, were lively sequences. The underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favorite was a football match that was absolutely fun. The only other criticism was that I did not quite understand the ending when I first saw it. In general, a wonderful film, which is unlikely to ever come out. 8/10 Bethany Cox
