Who wouldnâ€™t like to travel with Peter Falk? This guy's right eye has more character than most modern actors. This is the funny and touching film that we are all looking for as a counterweight to all the pompous effects of special effects. Women will love him for all the awakening tips for men, and men will love him for studying the role of father / son - one great little scene after another. And he has enough sharpness to be a real indie find. Obviously, this is a labor of love for Paul Reiser, who understands what it means to be both a father and a son, and also to have laughter and tears as you move through life. However, the most interesting thing was to observe how Reiser looks at Falk. You could say that this was both his character coming to his father's new assessment, and fellow actor who really enjoyed the special craft of Peter Falk. Really amazing. Hopefully, this film will soon appear in cinemas across the country so that everyone has the opportunity to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and other people.
