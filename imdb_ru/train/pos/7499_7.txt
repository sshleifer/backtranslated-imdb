But it's pretty fun, at least if you grew up in a Strange Ale, like me. This is a model of his life and career, starting with the superstar and ending with the tracking of the sources. Mostly uneven, but some segments are still very funny, especially when he goes to Japan. Although he is not as emotionally textured as “Lost in Translation”, and he does not find love, even fleeting, it captures an absolutely strange cultural melange, which is Tokyo's street life, in a bottle. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the strange Al is not recognized by the astute cultural commentator he is; perhaps a rose under any other name smells just as sweet. However, this is a funny movie.
