really great movie, one of the best i've seen. It is touching and simple - like life, sometimes you cry, sometimes you laugh, and that's just fine. not too much, as it should be. I really liked the idea of ​​the film, no one is bad or good, everyone or only people sometimes make mistakes, mainly due to the pressure of society, everyone tries to stay strong, and some do better than others, and the most important thing is that you don’t do you have a reason to get angry - you can do it, but in the end the anger will go away, and then you will need to let love come back, although it is difficult, this is true happiness. <br /> <br /> Great actors and actors, the film really gives you a movie feel. <br /> <br /> very nice nice. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching it, especially if you want to see the life of the Italians ..,
