There are no people like “Show People” Marion Davis (like Peggy Pepper) and William Haynes (like Billy Boone). My acquaintance with Miss Davis was a “clip” from this film; a delightful cheat in which she lowers her scarf to show different emotions. My acquaintance with Mr. Haynes was now at the time of this movie; although perhaps I saw him in a less memorable role. Haynes makes an incredible impression when he joins Davis for a commissary dinner — throws his hat into the ring with some wonderful pieces at the dinner table. Indeed, Haines and Davis perform with excellent comics. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper) taking daughter Davis to Hollywood, confident that she will become the new Tinzeltown sensation. Indeed, Davis and the already arrived Haynes become comedy stars. But Davis is eager to be the real drama queen. Davis leaves Haynes and collaborates with the incredibly dramatic Paul Rally. But viewers prefer Davis in more comic roles; Maybe the director King Vidor offers arguments for art imitating life? <br /> <br /> Full of Hollywood shots, both on the set and outside. Full of great "cameos"; at lunch in the studio, at the star table, Davis sits between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. Nevertheless, the best "beaten" player is Charlie Chaplin, who has the courage to ask Davis to give her an autograph! While cameos are funny, they, and episodic sequences, help "Show People" become a less important film, and a more important historical document. <br /> <br /> ******** Show People (11/11/28) King Widor ~ Marion Davis, William Haines, Dell Henderson
