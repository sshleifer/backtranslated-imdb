I liked that this film recognizes the viewer's intelligence, allowing the layers to separate from the characters through their interaction with each other about the unspoken loss that has affected each of them so much. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is beautiful and inspires people who, in my opinion, are extremely talented cinematographers with maturity and artistic insight who tell a story that other people with much more experience have failed to perform. I see a bright future for this writer / producer / director who has had the opportunity to focus on the goal and to fulfill it in good faith. <br /> <br /> Kudos for this achievement.
