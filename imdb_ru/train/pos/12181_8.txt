"Lady from Shanghai" is known as one of the most problematic productions in Hollywood. The original Welles cut was selected by the manufacturers and cut into ribbons. This made the already intricate mysterious story even harder to track down. They published a large number of his dialogues due to the density of the Irish accent, and the duplication is too obvious and poorly done. The worst thing is that Wells and his actress on the screen, as well as the real leading lady Rita Hayworth, break up in their relationship, and their boisterous chemistry is shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, all this is overcome only by the fantastic direction of Orson Welles. It makes the film incredibly stylish and atmospheric - each scene seems to breathe backs away from the screen. In addition, the characters and scenes are so bizarre that they border on the fabulous and surreal. This feeling of strangeness brings up scenes that are often found in these films, such as shots in the middle of the courtroom. I usually find dramas in the courtroom a bore, but the direction of Wells and his whimsical touches make them just as exciting as everything else. The ending at the carnival almost reminds one of David Lynch. <br /> <br /> It is also very good to play. Despite the unsatisfactory relationship, Wells and Hayworth both show decent results - but their interaction is just a bit lacking. Everyone else is gorgeous and amazing, especially Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders. The Lady from Shanghai obviously has its own problems, but itâ€™s worth a look to see one of the movie masters at its best. (8/10)
