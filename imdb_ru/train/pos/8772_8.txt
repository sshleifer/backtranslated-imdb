Director Raul Walsh was like Michael Bay of the 40s and many years before. And I mean this positively, since I'm definitely not a hater. His films are just plain high-quality entertainment, just like Raoul Walsh’s films were in his days. <br /> <br /> “Gentleman Jim” is great fun. In addition to the director of the first class, it also has a first-class cast with permanent lead Raoul Walsh Errol Flynn in the lead role. <br /> <br /> What surprised me was how well boxing fights were displayed. They used very dynamic cinematography, which also made boxing fights inspiring and exciting to watch, and the final championship bout against John L. Sullivan was a high-profile event. <br /> <br /> The biography of the 40s and earlier years was obviously still very different from the biographies made today. Modern biographies often glorify his main subject and show his / her life from birth to death and everything, mostly emotional aspects, between them. “Old” biographical films were made in the same way as films that were not based on real people from real life, which also means that directors would often use creative freedom with the personality of the main character and the events that occurred in his film. /her life. This film is also not just a biography about the legend of boxing, but also represents a good depiction of the period when illegal fist fights entered the modern era of boxing. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn does an excellent job of depicting the real life of the famous boxer James Corbett aka Gentleman Jim. Few people know about this, but Flynn in the 40s did an excellent acting job, one of which is this film. Physically, he also looks in great shape. By the way, in this film, he looks very different, without the antennae characteristic of this brand. The film also has some great supporting actors and some great actors all over the place. <br /> <br /> An excellent and fascinating film that is still very well kept. <br /> <br /> 8/10
