I love the occult Horror, and the great British studios Hammer, which made one of their greatest films with The Devil Rides Out (1968), turned out to be more than capable in this area of ​​horror. This occult tenth episode of Hammer’s short film Hummer House of Terror (1980), The Keeper of the Abyss, is indeed a horrible record in the series. Director Don Sharp, who had previously enriched Hammer’s work with the films Kiss of the Vampire (1963) and Rasputin: The Mad Monk (1966), and also shot two films of Fu Machu, starring Christopher Lee. more famous names among the directors of HHH, and he also delivers here. Antique merchant Michael (Ray Lonnen) stumbles upon a mysterious old glass. The washing glass turns out to be the object of the desire of the worship cult of the devil who wants to use it for his satanic rites. When he sheltered a beautiful young girl named Allison (Rosalyn Landor), with whom he had to sacrifice a cult, Michael experiences deeper problems with the cult and their sinister leader (John Carson) ... Although this is not one of my absolute favorite episodes " Hummer's House of Horror "(the best of them, of course, is the brilliant seventh episode" Silent Cry "), very creepy and atmospheric. The plot has several interesting twists and turns and remains tense and strange throughout the film. Ray Lonnen behaves well, young Rosalyn Landor is convincing as an innocent beauty, and John Carson is really creepy as the leader of Satanists. Overall, “Guardian of the Abyss” is another interesting and creepy story of HHH, and my fellow Hammer fans should not miss it.
