Two things happen to a severely wounded Tony in a provoked coma: Tony imagines that he is leading the life of a salesman present at a business congress, while his family and friends go through hell trying to cope with the possible loss of a big man. The sequence of dreams right from the old episode of TWILIGHT ZONE, when Tony turns into an ordinary Joe, trying to cope with the missing wallet and confused personalities during a business trip around the country. His intonation as a lace-up in a blazer and khaki is more likely to be of average American character and less than that of the Italian gangster from Noo Joyce. Nice touch. Shockingly long-haired hippie hooligan AJ (whom Paulie calls “Van Helsing” at one point) has a good scene with his comatose old man. The best moment is the big boys trying to talk about life without Tony, who immediately splits into a territorial dispute. Vito says that the recently deceased Jin may have been a secret affair, which is interesting in the light of what we are going to learn about Vito.
