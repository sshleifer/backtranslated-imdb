"Turkish bath" in the film "Noir", located in the 50s in New York, it should be a hint of something! Something that is curious that in all previous comments no one indicated, but it seems to me necessary to understand this film <br /> <br /> The sequence of Turkish baths: an alley at night, the entrance to a dirty sauna, and Scalis wrapped in a sheet massaging his hips. Steve, a masseuse from a young coarse boxer (Beefcake!), And another guy, a bodyguard? finishes dressing up. Dixon clearly hates what he sees there, and immediately becomes rude. We know that he has a reputation as rude suspects. Good cop, but easy to get out of control. Why does he hate them so much? <br /> <br /> Maybe he hates himself. Is this part of himself he inherited from his father? This dark side, which can lead him right at the end of the sidewalk, into the gutter? What if this dark side is hidden in the “closet”? Remember: whenever Dixon meets with Scalise (3 times), the guy is lying on the bed, and around him are only men for the company (the irony of the “Girls” poster attached to the wall near his bed!). /> <br /> Scalis behaves funny: startled manners, arrogantly bending his neck, boldly, shoving his inhaler (poppers?) into his nostrils every time he talks to Dixon. Dixon with a vengeful force is trying to pin down Scalis, who does not seem to understand: “I have never seen a man so full of hatred as you. I find it almost ridiculous when you came for me alone. ” Four years have jumped on me as if I was someone special! What for? “<br /> <br /> Because Scalis is really a special person: he is the direct heir of Dixon’s father:“ Your father loved me, ”“ Your father set me up for business. ” He acts as the criminal brother of Dixon, his dark side is embodied. And to top it all, he prefers a company of people. Dixon knows this well: “Who killed him (Payne)? Are you or one of your playmates? “Friends of the game! Notice how every time they meet, Dixon addresses Scalis: he takes the address book out of his jacket, slaps his face, hits his fist. ". Dixon's homophobia is obvious. Or, to put it another way: his unexpressed homosexuality. Dixon, he is the son of Dixon, the son of a thief. In response, he decided to become a good cop, but there is a criminal in him cruel bowler, murderer, liar. In addition, he is not married, from time to time he brings a dizzying blonde to his familiar cafe, but nothing more. The waitress’s mockery says he doesn’t know how to make love to a woman. hates himself for these reasons. ”Kapu he is a thug, like his old man. The blood will tell. " Finally, in order to achieve redemption, Dixon decides to sacrifice himself: if he forces his alter ego to Skalise to kill him, he will be freed from guilt and free the girl and her father. <br /> <br /> The end of the film returns us to the initial stage: Skyliz is pushed into the gutter, and Dixon deserves the right to walk on the pavement and wins the love of the ladies. Finally he is straight. <br /> <br /> The name of the film may well be the topic of a man who, in order to hide his repressed feelings, wants to experience the love of a woman (Jean Daucher) <br /> <br /> (These recordings should comment on the film Jean Dosha on French DVD edited by CarlottaI
