I rented Zero Day at a local video store last week. I have never heard of a movie, and I had doubts about it. Just looking at the box, I realized that this is an indie film, and therefore its quality will be less than that of the mainstream. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that after I finished watching Zero Day, I immediately launched it from the very beginning. The film clearly followed the basic plan of what happened at Columbine High School in April 1999, but I was struck by how plausible the two main actors were. When I first watched this film, I was not completely sure that what I was watching was real ribbons left by the arrows in Columbine. Deep down, I knew that what I was looking for could not be real, but at the same time the game was so convincing that you had to shake your head all the time. <br /> <br /> Does the film get in the way? Absolutely! Are you going to see things that make you doubt the merits of the film? Probably. I think most people will find it disturbing that they really will have feelings for the two leading characters, Calvin and Andre (played by Cal Robertson and Andre Kick). Why is this problematic for some people? Calvin and Andre are planning a slaughter in their high school. I know for myself, I felt a great sadness for Andre and Calvin. I had sympathy for them, because their lives had come at such a terrible moment. They fell so deep through the cracks that they began to travel along a road that could have been stopped if only the people around them had noticed their plight. <br /> <br /> Zero Day is a phenomenal movie. It gives you the opportunity to carefully and personally look at the events that most of us see only in the conclusions. That leaves you thinking about the lives involved. And it leaves you puzzled how people get to this point. A week after watching this movie, I still think about it. <br /> <br /> Those of you who have not seen “Zero Day” should bear in mind the following: the film is independent, with almost no budget, and the film was shot on video cameras. The material in the film is disturbing. This is not the mainstream of Hollywood, and there is no happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you can put it all aside, Zero Day is a movie that will stay with you and maybe help you open your eyes a little.
