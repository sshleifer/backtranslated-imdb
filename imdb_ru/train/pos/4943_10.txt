This is filmmaking, it is the simplest and best. <br /> <br /> I had doubts because, although Freeman is a great actor, sometimes he gets involved in bad projects; This is not one of those times. <br /> <br /> This is a small story that lasts just over an hour and fifteen, at a time when we get used to the fact that films are getting longer and longer, and not necessarily better, the director uses a short time to his advantage because the characters from the very beginning are so well defined (excellent images of Freeman and Vega, by the way), that a little background information about them seems real, Morgan himself, although his name is not mentioned, he did not act in films for several years, because that he was full of business, and he has a belt ilsya fear of making the script, and he is looking for a character in the indie film, where he plays a shop / supermarket manager. The story begins with the fact that he jumped into a supermarket in an uneasy area, where he meets a cashier of 10 or less items (Vega) and has to ride with her because the “production” forgot to pick it up. br /> <br /> In many ways, this is a road film, Morgan laughs and amazes with her unrivaled smile and positive look at everything, showing the perfect actor who trained his mind to be able to determine everyone he sees in the character he could play, and Paz (by the way, what an extraordinarily beautiful woman, even more gorgeous than Penelope Cruz) introduces the vulnerability of a 25-year-old separated woman who works harder than everyone else, without receiving any praise to finish work in a shitty super market. <br /> <br /> This is a talker, a lot of dialogue, but the balance between light, fun, seriousness and sadness is well maintained, the characters immediately become so attractive that you spend the last 20 minutes asking for more time on the screen of this Strange couple, but brevity in the nature of history, so it was a good call from the director not to give up.
