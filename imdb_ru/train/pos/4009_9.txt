Children of any age do not want to know about the sex of their parents. And adult children are often seriously bewildered and embarrassed by any evidence that older parents have active libido. Finally, it is very inconvenient for many moviegoers to look at the silly, languid widow who would pass unnoticed almost everywhere where she would find her aching ability and need for coarse passion with a handsome man at half his age. <br /> <br /> “Mother” is a provocative look at a barely filmed reality - a woman who is not ready to stay at home, watch TV and grow for almost three decades after her husband, and the controlling, dominant guy in this, packs it with massive heart attack. <br /> <br /> May (Ann Reed) and her husband have two children, each of whom is incompetent in his own way. The male son lives with a beautiful wife, who may well lead him to bankruptcy proceedings with her extravagant commercial enterprise. Paula (Catherine Bradshaw), a teacher with a desire to excel as a writer. She is attractive, not cute, and she seems to have a close relationship with her mother - first. <br /> <br /> Returning to his home after her husband’s funeral, May decides not to stay there. Rejecting typical widowhood with his legacy of boring days and without adventures, she goes to Paula, who has a little son. Paula's boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig), is a crudely beautiful contractor who seems to be spending a lot of time to complete the extension to the son May's house. May is quite pleased with drunk coke-sniffing Darren, whose treatment of Paula should have warned May that he is undoubtedly a member of the Royal Academy of Cadres. <br /> <br /> This is followed by a hot romance between Darren and the befuddled and now boiling life (dare I say, revived?) widow. Love scenes are graphic, but they take second place among the pen and ink sketches of their dating artist, amateur artist May, who then play a role in the unfolding drama (or failure, choose yourself). <br /> <br /> The Manhattan Theater was packed for early tonight, featuring more than half the audience before May. The fact that some were shocked or alarmed to see that she erotically leaves herself in the arms of a much younger person is an understatement. <br /> <br /> This blindingly honest look at an elderly woman’s awakened passion after decades of obedient obedience to her husband’s desire to stay at home and raise children (she also mentions that she didn’t like having friends — what a boyfriend). While May Darren’s infatuation is not incest, there are real psychological aspects and problems associated with the fact that the mother is sleeping with her daughter's lover. And Paula is not made of the strongest things from the very beginning. Once the story is revealed, it reveals the relationship between mother and daughter, which, from Paula's point of view, leaves much to be desired. Ms. Bradshaw does an excellent job with the role of the daughter, who wants her mother to support and also love - she was not let down by a terrible hand, but this is not a bed of roses. <br /> <br /> May is firmly committed to acknowledging her sexuality and expecting, indeed, to demand future happiness. But she is also inevitably vulnerable. She catches fish in uncharted emotional waters. Who controls her relationship with Darren and why it is difficult to understand, much less solve. In its sixties, it is still under development. <br /> <br /> “Something's Gotta Give” has recently demonstrated mature sexuality, but in a funny antiseptic way, asserting that no viewer will be embarrassed. In the end, it's Jack Nicholson and always beautiful Diane Keaton, jumping in the world of the rich. And to ensure that no major psychosocial problems were investigated, Keaton’s young girl, Amanda Pete, Keaton’s daughter, not only blesses the match, but also ensures that viewers know that she and her old (and) potential lover have never jumped in bag. <br /> <br /> It's not easy here. Inspired by the performance of Anna Reid, some feel discomfort and cause respect from others. Her naked body generates sexuality for some and seems to be an absurd object of physical attraction to others (the comments of today's viewers reflect all these views). <br /> <br /> Kudos to director Roger Michell for taking up the exciting story with inspiration and sympathy. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
