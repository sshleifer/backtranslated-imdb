Of course, the original is better, but it's not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it consists of 3 stories, but hey, so what ?! I thought it was pretty good, to be honest. I really liked how Anastasia changed a little when she fell in love, it shows what love can do. The stories were not so bad. <br /> <br /> I liked Cinderella's voice more. I have nothing against her voice in the original, but I just think it sounds better, better. I also liked her personality, she had more spine, but she was still kind. <br /> <br /> So, I'll give Cinderella II: Dreams come true 7/10.
