I was one of about 200 people who were lucky enough to see an early film about this film. <br /> <br /> “Star dust” pursues Tristan, a young man, in search of a fallen star and return it to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her. The only catch is that the star fell on the other side of the wall, the doorway between England and the magical kingdom, known as Stormhold. <br /> <br /> This film was just a joy to watch, there is something for everyone in it, all the action scenes are played beautifully, and the comedy is distributed throughout the film, making it funny without being banal. If I had to compare likes with another film, it would probably be Princess Bride, a classic. <br /> <br /> All the performances are outstanding, the beautiful Claire Danes makes you love her in her image Nero ... In every scene he puts down, he steals a show ... <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a funny fantasy love story, then this is a movie. The guys are not distracted by the description of the fact that there are enough action movies in the comedy, not to mention having fun with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to entertain you everywhere. Cinematography is dead and holding on with a movie sensation ... nothing in the film seems forced.
