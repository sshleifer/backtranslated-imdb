I am a member of the canoe club and can tell you the truth that Deliverance is synonymous with the serenity and serenity of this experience. When we put our boats into the water, a banjo echoes in the depths of consciousness. This film is timeless, because it philosophically talks about the place of man in nature and the influence of technology on man’s relationship with nature. We see it in bow fishing. We see it in a homemade tent. There is also urban urban disdain and a sense of superiority over the burglar lumberjack. The fact that a banker from Atlanta (Ned Beatty) has “bad teeth” is meant to put him on a par with foresters who also have bad teeth. Ultimately, the struggle of life and death crowds out the “civilized” human conviction of the “Law”. This canoe trip ends too soon for the viewer, but, alas, not soon for the characters.
