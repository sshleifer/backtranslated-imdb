I saw it when I was in Disney's Wonderful World as a child, so I remembered almost nothing. When I watched it recently, I sat and thought: "This is the strangest thing I have seen." <br /> <br /> Travels look like something caused by an overdose of LSD. The animated characters are mostly strangely colored / voiced versions of the characters "The Jungle Book" and "Robin Hood." I noticed some not quite Disney things: children were threatened with a knife and prostitutes (during a song on Portobello Road). <br /> <br /> It was very interesting, although the musical numbers were long, and I do not see much that children miss them. In addition, the plot style was a bit dark, seeing how it was established during World War II.
