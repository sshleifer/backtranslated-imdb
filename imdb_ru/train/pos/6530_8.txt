The last time I read a book about Nancy Drew about 20 years ago, so my memory of a fictional character is probably mistaken. From what I collected, the books were presented to me in an era when teenage detectives were popular among children who grew up at that time (for my case, in the 80s and early 90s), with Hardy Boys, Famous Five and, of course, Nancy Drew's "Carolyn Keane" is among the most famous. I still remember these hardcover books with very outdated illustrations on the covers, usually quite heavy (for a child) so that they can be dragged around, and the thickness of the book may be explained by the fact that the words are printed in large fonts. <br /> <br /> Well, the character received some updates along the way, as I recall, the following books of my sister Nancy Drew became less thick, soft-bound, with the updated and more chic Nancy pictured on the cover. I cannot remember whether these stories were the same as the old hardcover books, but I believe that these books written by ghosts have a fair share of updates for themselves. <br /> <br /> In this issue of Warner Brothers Nancy Drew, the character, no doubt, gets its update according to time, but somehow the authors Andrew Fleming and Tiffany Paulsen retained their 50-year-old feelings for the small town, thus preserving the charm and color that people like me will appreciate. Her fashionable feeling, her sensitivity and correctness, even some strange little behavioral traits that make her, well, Nancy Drew. <br /> <br /> Her marital status remains more or less the same, living with her single father, Carson Drew. (Tate Donovan), who takes his daughter and herself to the big city for a better employment opportunity and wean her daughter from surveillance in the city of River Heights. Mom is just a distant memory, and the maid takes off in a cameo. But what made Nancy Drew work was the role of Emma Roberts in the title role. The niece of her famous aunt Julia, she also has this bouncy behavior, this unmistakable red hair and this megawatt smile. Her Nancy Drew, while at the beginning, seems to be losing you in the wrong direction, will in fact grow on you. And almost in what I thought, it was a scene from “Pretty Woman,” which was abandoned, the characters went to a chic shop with an almost opposite reaction. <br /> <br /> While Papa Carson Drew is struggling to get Nancy out of control of the environment and assimilation into ordinary teenage life, trust Nancy that she lives in a house whose owner, Hollywood type, has been found killed under suspicious circumstances. Solving secrets is her comfortable food when she turns out to be an outcast of the local fraternity, and soon we enjoy with her in her adventure on the big screen. <br /> <br /> In this game, there is nothing that Black Dahlia is a crime and mystery, and instead it’s a rather simple task that Nancy has to solve between Corky's girlfriend (Josh Flitter), the plump friend from school, and the placating jealous boyfriend Ned (Max Thieriot), while hiding the truth about her extra learning activities from her father. The story is imbued with foolish fun and sentimentality of the old man, which enchants, and together it becomes a little Scooby-Doo. With minimal violence and no big skirmishes or explosions, this is serious - a genre that is clearly marked with the warning "Chick Flick." <br /> <br /> I think that the film will trigger a new generation of fans, ignite the memories of the old ones, and perhaps just probably could trigger a new fashionable trend of sports penny idlers.
