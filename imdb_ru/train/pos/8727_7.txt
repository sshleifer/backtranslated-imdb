Bugs life is a good movie. But for me it is not quite similar to such films as Toy Story and so on. Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie, but it wasn’t as good as Toy Story. The film has visual effects, laughter and others that were in the history of toys. But the movie wasn’t that way ... I don’t know, but I thought it was still a pretty good movie. <br /> <br /> Life bugs ... I do not want to say this, this is a film that I do not remember. I saw it many years ago. Of course, I have not seen the story of toys for many years, but I still remember it. I should not have reviewed this film, but me. I approve of it, although this is not the best job Pixar has done. <br /> <br /> Life bugs: *** / ****
