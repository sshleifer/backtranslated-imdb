If you research UFO facts, this video is very important. The "meat" video is the comments of Buzz Aldrin. He is without doubt the best of America. Trained to be objective, honest and factual in his reports. Many astronauts from America of all ages reported some kind of contact or UFO compliance, and there are videos from some of these missions. At least something happened that requires further objective ongoing investigation. I think that this testimony of Buzz Aldrin shows that it is possible that other worlds may be interested in our progress. Like all supposed documentary videos, it may be oblique, but it contains additional information and opinions from an experienced American hero. Those do not come every day. Therefore, the fact that some people are not interested in the details should not prevent you from watching this video. If nothing else, this is interesting, and I recommend that you look with an open heart.
