In the film, there are several references to Blade Runner, but one of the most obvious is the fact that Cain 607 and his squad are genetic constructs that breed to become expendable warriors. But, as my favorite quotation from the movie says: “You should have made them smart and fast.” Kurt Russell did an incredible job, his facial expressions or absence in the films gave more ways to relate the story than the rest of the cast together. Even when he falls in love with Sandra, but does not know how to deal with these emotions, and his tears after being removed from the group, or his shudder when he is embraced, and his attachment to a dumb young boy, who in many ways reminded Todd of himself about what he could become if it were not for his choice to be a soldier.
