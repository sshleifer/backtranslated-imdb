The unlikely duo Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte team up to give us some interesting gigs and a story in The Angel Levine. This is one interesting twist on “This is a wonderful life.” <br /> <br /> Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky, and they both belong to a special class of the elderly Jewish poor in New York. Mostel was a tailor and was proud of his profession, but his back and arthritis prevented him from working. Kaminsky is mostly bedridden. It comes down to applying for social security. In desperation, like Jimmy Stewart, he calls on God for help. <br /> <br /> Now, maybe, if he got someone like Henry Trevers, things could have been different, but even Stewart had problems with taking Traverse. But Traverse had one thing: he was at a distance of more than 100 years from this mortal spiral, and all his connections with earthly things disappeared. God sent Mostell something completely different: the recently deceased Harry Belafonte, who had to at least undergo some basic training for the angels, before he was given the task. <br /> <br /> Belafte did not accept that he died, he still has many problems. He also has a wife, Gloria Foster, who does not know that he was handed over, hit by a car at the very beginning of the film. You put his problems and problems of Mostel, and you have a good conflict, starting with the fact that Mostel cannot believe in a black Jew named Levin. <br /> <br /> This was a farewell performance for Polish / Jewish Actress Ida Kaminski, who was nominated for the best female role in The Shop on Main Street a few years ago. Another prominent role is the role of Irish actor Milo O'Shea, who plays a good Jewish doctor. Recalling the story of O'Shea from Verdict, I was very surprised to see and hear him take the doctor away. <br /> <br /> Angel Levine raises some interesting and troubling questions about faith and race in this society. This is brought to you by a star cast and of course created by the famous writer Bernard Malamud. Be sure to catch him during the broadcast.
