I think that most people who posted comments on this film do not understand how to watch a movie, and / or have a slight sense of elegance. First, to appreciate the film, you need to understand how everything in the film works together. Modern feelings require great drama. No, I do not mean the excellent location of the characters and stories, but they seem to require emotional trajectories that are very tragic or comedy. This is a thin film. Its beauty lies in its subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity). Neither the story nor the characters are simple in this film. This is a beautifully made film, which combines sensuality, politics, human weakness, venality ... you name it. The world in which it is located will be alien and misunderstood today ... a world in which, if you have it, you must flaunt NOW and LOUDLY, even if you think you have it. <br /> <br /> Many people today do not understand that Victorian society was not really Victorian, because people understand this term today. <br /> <br /> This movie helps set a record.
