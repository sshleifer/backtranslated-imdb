I have never seen many online films in my entire life, but if I had chosen any of them, I would have chosen Spatula Madness, a clever link to most films, such as Star Troopers (and so on. D.) Using a camera with a steel mind, Jason Steele mastered the art of turning a regular image into a picture, and then connected it all with time-lapse animation to get the world populated by blades. the story starts from the middle, how is it for the directors delight? then the middle at the beginning, and so on, when I first looked at it, I expected a dull pixel look, but Jason, like me, loves the looks, so I brought every detail to the maximum. although I do not recommend it for children, or someone other than me will like it, but please find it on the web (this is a short film, watch the film “The Cow”), its style reminds me of a south park, but less cruel. 10 for a look, 6 for a laugh, and 6 for a story, it all comes down to 10/10, good work <br /> <br /> Jason Steele, I really want to watch a movie.
