Golden Child was Eddie Murphy's first film since his Beghend Hills Police Megahit. And although he is not as good as the "Policeman", this is a funny comic adventure. Murphy plays a major role in the search for the lost children, who are assigned the most unusual case. His task: to find the title character, a child with mystical abilities. This film could be called the Beverly Hills Policeman and the Temple of Doom, as some parts of this film resemble Spielbergâ€™s adventure, like the Indiana Jones comedy. This is a comedy with laughter and adventure with special effects. Very funny. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
