This film was beautiful. He was full of unforgettable images, a good game and a touching topic. It would be very easy to write it off as too sentimental, but these are the feelings that this type of film is trying to achieve. I was fully involved in the unfolding of the story and the presentation. There were some stupid frames, but this can be expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can cause is that there were not tons of details. However, this film was not created to explain every element of Joseph Smithâ€™s life, ministry, triumph, controversy, failure, etc.; it was designed to take a quick look at a few highlights of one of the most amazing American and historical religious figures of all time.
