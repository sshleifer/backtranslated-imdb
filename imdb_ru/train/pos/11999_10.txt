I saw this wonderful production, and I wonder if anyone can tell me something about the actress who played the blacksmith’s wife — I’m not sure of her character’s name. I went with her to the BUU and lost contact with her - her maiden name was Kim Luke, and I wonder if anyone has any information about her. It is not listed in the credits. This production was outstanding, jerky in every respect, an excellent action for all. I think I don’t even want to refer it to the general category of “acting”, rather “to depict with a sense of amazing events that led to the opening of Heaven for this last dispensation” ... that. If someone has worked with Kim or has a website or something else, please let me know !!! By the way, she was fantastic in her role ... Thank you, Melissa Thorn
