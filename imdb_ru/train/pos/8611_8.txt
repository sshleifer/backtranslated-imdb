I really enjoyed watching this movie. I recorded it on tape while watching so I could watch it later. In fact, I liked the second viewing more, since I was able to absorb more of the intelligent dialogue between Natalie and Adam, the two main characters. I thought that the development of this story was very provocative. I was very intrigued by how Natalie was going to communicate with her daughter's friends, at first it seemed that she was going to spew a lot of hostility, but as soon as she began to interact more pleasantly, I had to see how this visit would unfold. I was not disappointed. Little by little, the secrets that Sarah was hiding from her mother began to reveal a daughter who was not so perfect, a vicious person, like most of us who wanted to free her from an imperious mother who thought she knew her daughter, but Unfortunately, I had to learn very painfully that sometimes, in order to truly love someone, you need to give them freedom. The audience who got stuck in this movie to the end saw a very touching performance from Diane Keaton (which is always beautiful, even in some of her less well-received films - I think City and Country). The final scene of Diane Keaton on the way home was worth the wait, and it showed that anyone who loves another person should know that we should live our lives, we love others, but we donâ€™t own them, and ultimately we should let go This is a hard lesson, but it is worth thinking from time to time. Thanks to CBS for this broadcast, it was worth the long wait.
