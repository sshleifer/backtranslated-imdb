Photographing this budget setting is surprisingly bad. The colors are dirty and brownish, and the photo looks very 80. Directing and editing is often quite boring and similar to television films. * And * at first glance, the film seems to want to torment its viewers with grim images of sex and violence. The score of Hans Zimmer is also typically simple and boring work of this overvalued, talentless composer. <br /> <br /> But if you want to watch the film further, you will be rewarded with a very touching family history, a kind of European version of the Edina Ferber Giant family epic. Although at first you wonder why Clara married this stupid man, even his character is gaining ever greater depth and more experience by which one can judge him. Clara gives a spiritual lesson in the film, a wonderful and touching statement against the terrible events in her country. Her daughter, whose lover is a young Antonio Banderas at the beginning of his international career, understands this lesson and ultimately tries to use it. The way the plot was built with the ending reflecting the beginning was great. All the actors also do an excellent job. I was wondering "Who is the actress playing Blanca?" all the time, but, of course, it was really young Winona Ryder! <br /> <br /> In general, this film really made me want to read a book.
