From the very beginning, I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is perhaps the funniest I've ever seen in a movie. I immediately bought one for my hostel this September. <br /> <br /> Each element in this film is gathered so beautifully. Not often do you see a movie with so many penises, gays and racial jokes that critics praise so much. Carell and the rest of the cast deliver every bawdy joke sensationally. Carell remains sweet throughout the film, where by the end of the film you support him so that he can succeed in his relationship more than you do for keeping it up. The supporting cast is cruel, each of them has some problems with the ladies themselves. <br /> <br /> One of the features of this film is the abundance of memorable scenes that are given to us. This is what makes the film memorable with love. This film will often pop up when the words “breast wax” and “condoms” are mentioned in a conversation. <br /> <br /> Watching him in the cinema, I wondered how many older people watched him. I saw a group of four women from the mid 60s. Despite an older audience, this film still filled the laughter of the whole theater. <br /> <br /> I think the type of people who like it is Office fans and Steve Carell. Many jokes remind me of the type of jokes that you would see in Family Guy. The film is rather shallow for teenage boys, but sweet enough and smart for middle-aged women. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend going to this film if you are not a fan of profanity or if you are easily offended. However, when you are in a film, just remember that this film is all in a good mood. Jokes are not “funny jokes”, they are just jokes. And they are funny.
