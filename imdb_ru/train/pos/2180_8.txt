Louise Brooks gives a beautiful performance in this well-made French melodrama. She plays a typist named Lucien, who, despite her love for a man named Andre, dreams of rising above her life position. She sees the opportunity in a beauty contest for Miss Europe, but Andre is furious when he discovers that she has entered, and then demands that she leave. She is trying to return her record, only to discover that she has already been chosen as Miss France and will now proceed to the main competition. <br /> <br /> This is a love story, a loss and a decision, played out for its Passionate end. The film is very energetically filmed by director Augusto Jenin and cameramen Rudolf Mate and Louis Nee. The style of filming is more like modern films than Hollywood films of the 30s, and shows a different style used by Europeans. There are many quick cuts and travel shots, mostly made with great skill and enthusiasm. The high energy of the first third of the film fades slightly in the middle, but is gaining momentum again in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> All the directors played very well, but the role of Louise Brooks was especially well remembered. Louise relies heavily on her silent screen skills, even though this is a phrase book, but since her style of silence was surprisingly modern, understated, she very well switched to conversational speech. The long, early scene at the fair was particularly acute, as Louise used her amazingly expressive eyes to convey her growing sense of suffering and alienation, to be trapped in a life in which she no longer wants. I doubt that this has ever been done better. <br /> <br /> The film goes into an excellent finale, skillfully shot, powerful and stylish. This is really one of the best things of the first days of cinema. And the tragic storyline only underlines the great tragedy that this is the last major role for Louise Brooks. She was not just a beautiful beauty, who looked fantastic in a swimsuit, she really was a great acting talent, which basically threw it all away. We are all poorer. <br /> <br /> This film is less known than its German films featuring G.W. Pabst, but I think it is better. I think this team is better at storytelling than Pabst, and although Prio might lack the deep moral complexity of Pabst’s films, it’s much easier to follow, and overall it’s more orderly, focused work. And it does not hurt that the singing party of Louise made by Edith Piaf. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a classic Louise Brooks movie that is worth looking for.
