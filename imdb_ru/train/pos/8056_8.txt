In 1935, this film was performed with all sorts of Ocars for the best director, John Ford, actor Victor McLaughn and music by Max Seiner. Victor McLaughlin, (Gypo Nolan), "Call Out the Marines", 42, gave an outstanding performance as an Irish rebel who belonged to a rough and tough crowd, everyone fought for the cause and at the same time became poorer and poorer with more drinking . Hypo Nolan made a serious mistake when he decided to become an informant for his best friend in order to go on a journey with his girlfriend to America and live in a new way. Preston Foster (Don Gallagher), "The Diary of Guadalcanal", 43, gave a large supporting role as leader of the Irish uprising and sought to capture the informant of his group. Gypo Nolan becomes persecuted by his betrayal of his friend and begins to feel exactly like Judas. A great 1935 film and a great acting McLaglen, but rather depressing in all aspects of the film.
