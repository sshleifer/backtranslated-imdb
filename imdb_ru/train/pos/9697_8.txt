This is really a soulful family movie. He has an absolutely brilliant animal training and “acting skills” (if you can call him that) (just think about the dog in “How the Grinch Stole Christmas ...” it was just a bad learning) The story of Poly is very well done, well reproduced, and on the whole, the characters are really worked out. No more than to say, except that it is a BIG MOVIE! <br /> <br /> My ratings: history 8.5 / 10, acting 7.5 / 10, animals + FX 8.5 / 10, cinematography 8/10. <br /> My overall rating: 8/10 is a BIG FAMILY FILM AND IS VERY WORTH WATCHING!
