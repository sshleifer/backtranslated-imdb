I really liked this documentary about Kenny and Spencer’s attempt to convey Dawn. There was a great look at how outsiders are trying to get inside to make it big. <br /> <br /> The story was well composed and organized in an interesting manner, thanks to which the film developed well. Of course, worth a look. My only complaint is that they were without closure. Perhaps this is part of the question. We expect this, but in reality this is not what happened (or usually happens). <br /> <br /> The film is also a great way to see Kenny and Spencer’s identity outside their Canadian television show. You can see a bit of what's ahead. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing the Papal chase.
