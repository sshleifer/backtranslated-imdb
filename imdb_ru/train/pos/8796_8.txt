<br /> <br /> From the very beginning, this set of eleven plays by eleven directors seems relative from the very beginning. That is, what may be the number one priority for people like Bush, Blair and the Company may not be the same as for many other people, ordinary people. From the opening scene in which the Iranian teacher is trying to impress her little students with the most important thing that happened, and as a result, the children are not impressed, since the death of a neighbor and the like obviously affects them much more closely than anything that could occurring in New York, USA, anywhere else, this series of almost documented plays establishes that not all things are equal to all people, as some world leaders would try to prophesy. <br /> <br /> Although it is obvious that the attack on the WTC was a vile event on the part of any criterion, it seems that both politicians and cameramen tend to blow things up from all proportions - wonderfully manifest in one of these parts. Would the same reaction occur internationally if the attack was carried out, say, on Lagos, say, on Jakarta or even on Rio de Janeiro? I rather do not think so. It seems that the news suffers from distortion depending on where something is happening: say, much more television time is given to an earthquake in Italy than, say, ten times more destructive in Outer Mongolia. Long distances seem to reduce the scale of the disaster. <br /> <br /> This series of eleven pieces helps to look at things better, or maybe I should say that some of them help, as each director created his own story, his own translated perspective with full freedom , such that it is impossible to judge all the merits, but individually for each eleven-minute segment. <br /> <br /> In no case can we conclude that this is an anti-American film: it would be too simple to read a variety of messages, manifested in different segments. However, this is not pro-American. In eleven segments, different approaches are used, and the general connection - if there is one - is that the WTC attack disaster must be viewed in perspective from different points of view. Only then people like George Bush will begin to understand the planet on which he lives. <br /> <br /> Clearly stated in one segment is my belief that I have been feeding on for two years now: America has not learned a lesson. And the lesson is that the United States should share this planet with the rest of humanity, and not dominate it with ruthless economic convictions or just force. Instead of realizing that the United States cannot continue to just tread on everyone and everywhere, their political leaders, who are assisted by Blair (and even Aznar), are becoming even more arrogant and even more intolerant that they are of no use to anyone in Afghanistan. or Iraq now, not to mention many others. The White House mentality is completely disgusting: the United States and the United Kingdom invaded Iraq and caused all the chaos, and therefore the disorder they caused should be sorted out - not to insist that the UN and other countries penetrate with help and thus find an easy way out of the turmoil . <br /> <br /> The radical positions adopted by the United States (or even Israel) will be met only by radical positions of Islamic people who for years strengthened fanatical fundamentalism, at least in order to cover up their macho. uselessness, i.e., stoning women to death or just sheltering them from crown to dusty ground. <br /> <br /> The world is in terrible disorder, fueled by the greed of several rich countries that seem eager not to see or understand anything from more multilateral positions. This film in eleven separate parts accurately depicts this dark and stupid pose.
