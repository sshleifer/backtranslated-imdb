I have just returned from the first show of Basic Instinct 2. I thought that it would be shit because of the criticism of the preview, and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original Basic Instinct, I think you will like # 2 as much, if not more. Great story that always makes you think and think. The music is gorgeous, repeating the theme of the original. Do not wait for the material "Oscar", look at it for pleasure and pleasure. That's what films are for escapism. I can't think of a better way to escape than running away with Sharon Stone, who is as sexy as she is. I'm going to see him again this weekend. Go look!
