I remember seeing it when it was released, in the theater in Palo Alto, and did not expect much. I mean - an Australian movie? But it is finally up to me. Here is the scene. Richard Chamberlain is sitting on the floor in a shabby apartment in Sydney, with his legs crossed, face to face with an Australian elder named Charlie. <br /> <br /> Chamberlain: “You were at my house last night. You scared my wife. you? "And Charlie answers at a deliberate pace:" Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? ... Are you a fish? Are you a snake? You are a man? ... Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? This is an amazing scene, shot at close range, with Chamberlain’s softly handsome face filling the screen as opposed to Charlie’s black broad-bearded face. <br /> <br /> Two guys could not be more different and this film tells about Chamberlain by chance stumbles upon his absurd lawyer's existence in the inexplicable, almost unspeakable enigmas of Charlie’s world. <br /> <br /> I don’t think I'll talk a lot about the plot. It's a kind of apocalyptic story. But I have to say that the person who conducted the study of the Australian belief systems of Aboriginal people should get a plus. They have everything here: from pointing bones to sleeping time, some parallel universe, in which dreams are real. This is a very creepy movie with no musical bites or great special effects. Charlie’s world just starts to invade Chamberlain’s dreams for reasons that were never fully understood. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the script, that's all. Nothing clears up completely. Did Chamberlain, who seems to have an extraordinary connection with the aborigines, die in the last wave? Are there any aborigines? Is Sydney Fully? The basic premise is also a bit difficult to accept, although it is believed to be a fantasy. Aboriginal people are endowed with the spiritual power that Americans give American Indians, while the fact is that mythology is a mythology, and while a person can be more complex or satisfying - more elegant and beautiful, if you like - all mythology there is still an attempt to transcend the ordinary, demanding, and sometimes disappointing physical existence. Charlie's mysticism is more convincing than the miracles of Moses in Cecil B. DeMille's Ten Commandments, but they are brothers under the skin. <br /> <br /> But I don’t care. Taken like a film, this film is pretty good, and it is especially important to celebrate the celebrity director Peter Weir and the Australian film industry. It was the first of the great waves of antipode films, some hoarse, like Mad Max, and some subtle and dramatic like Lantana. I like the Weyr things that resemble Nicholas Horn's things in that they are pregnant with subconscious fear. Try “Hanging Rock Picnic” to learn how to make a truly amazing movie without a drop of blood.
