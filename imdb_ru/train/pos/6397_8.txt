I gave him an 8 star rating. The story may not have reached 3/4 of the way to the film, but the performances remained strong everywhere. People of Honor have been replaced by Navy Diver for obvious reasons. Anyone who has served in any part of the armed forces will probably feel that “Honor” is the right word to use in the name.
