I just watched this movie and I must say that I was very impressed. It is very creepy and has many moments that will make you jump from your seat! Along the way, I had to smoke a few "emergency" cigarettes to calm my nerves! If I had to criticize, I would say that maybe, in any case, there were too many moments of jump. It got to the point that each new scene reached a climax with a jump, and this gradually erased the amazing effect, because you were like a new thing that was coming. <br /> <br /> Although it contains almost all the cliches in the ghost genre, they were all made so well that it supported the eerie factor of fear. It contained the elements of "Shining", "The Sixth Sense" and "Changeling" (in particular, the soundtrack reminded me of "Changeling"). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an old-fashioned panic!
