Dick Tracy was originally a comic created in 1931 by Chester Gould. He is a civilian detective who tracks down a team of villains, ranging from all types of visually original characters such as Flattop, The Blank and Big Boy Caprice. (These villains became so popular in the 40s that Warner Bros. created their own look at the Tracy villains in cartoons such as Duffy Duck). Tracy's comics were known for their liberal use of firefights and modern technological advances (especially the wrist watch communicator), which got its share of the time on the screen in this excellent film. The music was wonderfully written by Danny Elfman, and Madonna's original songs were interesting, but they were not the culmination of her career. This is strange, because when you watch a movie and see tense moments, the movie is very reminiscent of Batman because of the memorable sound of the Elf in his plays. <br /> <br /> I love a hard-talking child, Pacino plays the role of the Big Boy Caprice (and that chin!), Madonna took on the atrocities, and the cinema and the direction were flawless. This film was made very professionally, and it features tons of great actors who were known as great actors even before this film was shot (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsyth, Dustin Hoffman, Katie Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Katherine O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke). The film was filmed by Beatty himself, which was interesting. This is similar to the way Beatty considered himself Tracy in a past life or something else, because he really matched the role. <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie 8/10 for everything he brought to the movie that was missed (for any reason). There were a lot of misunderstandings about the rating of this film on IMDb, and I still do not understand why. The characters were completely original and vibrant, as was the style of the scenery, the wardrobe, the lighting and everything in this film. Go buy it today. You will not regret.
