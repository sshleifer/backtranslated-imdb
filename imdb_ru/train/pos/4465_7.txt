ANCHORS AWEIGH is an MGM entertaining musical that fans of the genre will love, but I wouldn't rate it with classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON. It was the first of three musicals in which Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared together. Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two sailors on vacation in Hollywood who made friends with a young boy (Dean Stockwell), who introduces them to her attractive young aunt (Catherine Grayson), a struggling actress who works as an additional MGM. Although Grayson is initially attracted to both guys, she ultimately prefers Joe, but later Clarence is associated with a waitress (Pamela Britton), who, as he learns, is from her native city of Brooklyn. The thin paper story leaves room for several great musical numbers, including “We Hate To Leave,” Joe and Clarence's complaints to their fellow sailors when they leave the ship; Grayson's Hot Shutter Blinds; Sinatra's dreamy rendition of “I Fall in Too Easy” (a number that, unfortunately, has been removed from some of the impressions of this film), and Anxiety Song, a fantastic dance that Kelly performs with the animated Jerry Mouse from the glory of Tom and Jerry, Kelly also does a kind of fantasy ballet "The Kiss of the Bandit", which competes with his pirate ballet in the later movie "The Pirate". Here Kelly is in great shape, energetic and energetic, which brought him the only Oscar nomination for Best Actor, and the charmingly shy Sinatra character here is undoubtedly sexy. Entertainment program for fans of the MGM music factory.
