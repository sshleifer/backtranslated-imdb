I like this movie. It was fun, cute, stupid and interesting. He had a good cast, and some critics actually beat him for reasons that I really don't understand. No, it was not “Grapes of Wrath,” “Casablanca,” or even “Moonstroke,” but it was a nice movie. <br /> <br /> Julia played a great psychotic "man behind man." Of course, the story is a bit silly, but this is not a big drama, guys. I accidentally saw a review of the film, probably the only good one he received, and one night I stumbled upon it when I was looking for a movie. I never heard it stink until I saw it, and I'm glad I saw it. In the end, I bought a VHS tape for a bunch of deals, and I watch it a couple of times a year.
