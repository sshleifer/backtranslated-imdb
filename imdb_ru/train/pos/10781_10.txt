Road Rovers is a great show about superhero dogs chosen by the Master to fight crime around the world. The show was fun to say the least. Simple and complex jokes that may appeal to all ages. Jokes throughout the series that can spawn a drinking game. The action was fascinating and deftly tuned. The characters were very original, each with a completely different personality. But most of all I liked the show - the depth of the characters. Each of them has a struggle and emotional difficulties that are never expressed, but are implied in the subtext. I hope one day there will be some way to see the Rovers in action again.
