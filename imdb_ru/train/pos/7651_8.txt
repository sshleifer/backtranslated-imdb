An interesting television film based on real events, dedicated to the description of one of the main characters, a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother, whose subtle mission is to decide whether he will go to court for the death penalty of his brother. But when he goes to visit him and enters Elias Koteas, the problem begins. This has nothing to do with Coteas' acting ability. It simply looks like a version of a prisoner of proletarian roots, according to G.Q. magazine, whose language is too complicated for someone who spent most of his life behind bars. This awareness came to me after a meeting with an old friend whom I had not seen for almost 15 years, which he spent in several Panamanian prisons. The young man I knew left, not only because he was older, but also because he had been under the influence of the prison system for a long time. I must say that there are prisons and prisons, but this prisoner in the film “Shot in the Heart” is definitely not from this world.
