Robin Williams does his best to combine comedy and pathos, but looks a little shrill. Donald Moffat is too one-sided, like his father-in-law. Jeff Bridges is great as a defender, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are amazing, carrying the film through most of his uneven spots. It fills time well, but a little more.
