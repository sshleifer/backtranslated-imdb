Talk about opening an explosion, "Trampa Infernal" has the coolest initial credits ever! Guided by musical tones, which may be slightly inspired by the legendary theme “Friday, the 13th” (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha), the names of the leading players appear on the screen in the form of giant syllables. The promising introduction of a completely obscure Mexican thriller about slasher / backwood style survival, and with every minute it only gets cooler According to a newspaper article, in the nearby forest there is a wild bear, which has already killed many hunters who tried to catch it. The challenge is that the one who kills the bear will be declared the main macho hero with the largest set of balls. Upon arrival, however, it quickly becomes apparent that they are not against the bear, but an astounded and completely manic war veteran with a rather arsenal of weapons in his shelter and numerous combat tricks up his sleeve. After a whole decade of tamed and derived American slashers, this Mexican effort from the early 90s looks and feels very refreshing and vibrant. The formula is simple, but effective, the main characters are fairly plausible, and the preparation for a confrontation with a sadistic murderer is quite tense. Maniac must have been a fan of Freddie Kruger and Michael Myers, since he also uses a homemade glove with sharp knives and a white mask to cover his face. The killings are pleasantly disgusting and barbaric, which I really hoped for, starting with the amazing aforementioned opening episodes, and wasting a lot of free blood. The forest setting and especially disguised booby traps are joyfully impressive. Trampa Internal is a Mexican hit slasher that is hotly recommended by fans of the genre.
