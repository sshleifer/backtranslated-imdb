Not the most successful television project that John Cleese ever did, “Strange Case” reminds of the first project that was put into production before any changes could be made. There are some stupid and even some clever ideas everywhere, but, unfortunately, the story as a whole means nothing. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a scream, though, like Dr. Watson, the bionic bits are all. "Oh my God."
