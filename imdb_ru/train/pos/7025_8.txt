I found this a charming adaptation, very lively and full of fun. With the exception of a few serious mistakes, the cast is wonderful. I have to repeat some of the earlier comments - Chinna Phillips is terribly mistaken as a teenager. At 27, sheâ€™s just too old (yes, it REALLY shows), and she lacks singing chops for Broadway music. Vanessa Williams is a decent enough singer, and she is adequate for a dancer. However, she is not a Latina, and her character is definitely there. In addition, she is very STRANDENT, and it is exhausting. <br /> <br /> Sweet Apple's Conrad Birdie fanclub girls really shine, thanks to Brigitte Dow and Chiare Zanni. I also liked Tyne Daly's performance, although I am not usually a fan of her work. Finally, the Shriners dancing is a riot, especially the three silly ones in the bar. <br /> <br /> The film is suitable for the whole family, and I highly recommend it.
