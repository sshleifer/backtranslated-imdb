me and my sister saw the premiere last night ... it was so good that we were glued together for all this .. hahaha .. i think i hooked for the season !! .... they have some really good actors in this thing .. the head coach and the player who loves Pete were very good and the plot already understood me, but I donâ€™t really understand how they will keep him stretched for the whole season ... probably will be some big one can not wait for Tuesday ... finally, Jeremy Sampter, who is he? I can say that he will be great !! he was so good that we immediately fell in love with his character .. can not wait for the next episode .. GO Jeremy! <br /> <br /> Aimee
