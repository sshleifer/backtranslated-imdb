Does anyone know what kind of truck John T drove? I look like a Ford mid and late 70s. This film is my favorite, like my wife. It was the first memorable film that we saw as a married couple. The pickup is of interest because it looks like the first truck I drove and recently found another one that looks like it. I would like to restore the pickup, which should resemble a movie in a movie. Also the music was awesome, and the acting was great. Where and what is the lady who portrayed Aunt John? Also did John have an understudy for the scene on the tower when he almost fell? In addition, in which year Mustang Debra W drove in this show. It looked like a 60s model. Thank,
