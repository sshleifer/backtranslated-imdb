Dog Days are one of the most accurate films I've ever seen describing life in modern cities. It is very cruel and cruel in some moments, and, unfortunately, it is very close to reality. Isolation, despair, deep emotional deadlocks, problem cases, perversion, complexes, madness. All things that are present in large developed cities today. This makes you once again realize the pitiful state in which people lead society. <br /> <br /> The negative side of life in the city has never been displayed on the screen so correctly. I just wish it was a lie. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Therefore ... 10/10.
