Hitokiri (which translates roughly as “murder”), a / k / a “Tenchu”, which translates roughly as “divine punishment”), demonstrates Hideo Goshi on top of his form. Do not miss this or Goshin, another classic Goyokin! Hitokiri is not only one of the best Gosha films, it is one of the best samurai and Chambara films, and perhaps one of the best Japanese films ever exported. <br /> <br /> Be careful, all the intricate details of the plot in Hitokiri can be a bit complicated for those who are not familiar with the Japanese history of the 19th century. Despite this, the basic human drama is obvious and open to all viewers. In accordance with the norm for Gosha, Chitokiri proposes another variation of his traditional theme “loyalty to his master” against “doing the right thing.” Nevertheless, Gosh develops his favorite subject with such sophistication that it is really _the_ film that needs to be watched (along with Goyokin, of course). <br /> <br /> I believe that it breaks down like this: if you want simpler, more action-oriented Tale, you can see Goykin. However, if you want a more thoughtful, multilayered (albeit dark) drama, look at this. <br /> <br /> (Well, well, in fact, the historical background is a powerful seizure of power between many different samurai clans who either (1) reform work, but save the Tokugawa Shogunate, and (2) those trying to establish the Meiji Emperor as the supreme ruler of Japan.Of course, those clans who worked "on" the Emperor Meiji were often less interested in "reforming" Japan, rather than in giving their own clan more power in the "new world order." the twist of fate the whole feudal system was official abolished as one of the first reforms of the Meiji government. These are such ironic turns - big Gosha ironically - this makes the whole story even more bitter-sweet.) <br /> <br /> What distinguishes “Hitokiri” from other Gosha films , so this is a mature sense of cinema Gosha. Each frame is thought out to the smallest detail, and (as with Barrick Lyndon Kubrick) each frame of the film can sustain its fixed composition. Of course, this is a typical gosh. Hitokiri really stands out with stunning backgrounds, including (as is the case with Gökin) many breathtaking seascapes. Just watch the sequence of discoveries, and you are hooked! Make no mistake, this is not an English periodical: Hitokiri is extremely cruel (do not say that you were not warned). <br /> <br /> What else besides cool camera work does Hitokiri highlight? The performances seem (to me) a little more subtle in this. Katsu Shintaro (from the glory of Zatoichi and Hanzo-razor) plays a stellar role in the role of the protagonist / anti-hero Okada Izo. Katsu manages to instill humanity in a character who seems almost wilder animals than a villain. Throughout the film, you will never be sure that you are engaged or outraged by the character Okada. At the same time, Okada’s image of Katsu’s hunger of hunger for respect and his later pitiful attempts at redemption seem so human that you cannot help but feel sympathy / sympathy. Of course, after Nakadai Tatsuya played the tortured hero in Gyokin, it's great to see him play such a ruthless villain in Chitokiri. He's just perfect, nothing more to say! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, perhaps more interesting for lovers than for ordinary fans, do not miss Mishima Yukio’s latest appearance on the screen (yes, the hidden gay right-wing ultranationalist novelist who committed suppku before a crowd of mocking Japanese soldiers, whom he “kidnapped” in 1970 and made a film about his life and work, shot by Paul Schröder), which actually works quite solidly, depicting the Honorable (for an assassin) Shinbei Tanaka.
