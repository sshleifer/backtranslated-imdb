Like many here, I grew up on Scooby Doo. Unlike many here who did, I love this show! I think it was very well done and thought out. Everything in it is marked as a by-product that should not be taken seriously. The formula is simple - it's a parody of other cartoons with one bad guy trying to beat a good guy. Using the well-known characters Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, it is much easier to attract the viewer to parody humor from the very beginning of each 30-minute episode. <br /> <br /> There have always been side effects of Scooby-Doo. that annoyed the fans. Classic Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts from the 80s. These by-products had their place: they allowed them to sell new content, created new fans, and kept Scooby-Doo products on the shelves. I would agree that "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: get the key!" does not fit into this traditional role, but this is probably what I have always wanted Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts to be: an action show that focuses on Scooby-Doo's best / funniest characters! Good features of the show: animation, voices, attention to detail, bad guys, “best friend” relationship between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, constant humor! Bad features: no, although the updated Mystery Machine is sometimes quite close. <br /> <br /> Great Warner Bros. animation One of the smartest cartoons in a long time!
