I love this film. It is well written and acted and has good cinematography. The story combines action, humor, mysticism and tenderness with magnificent scenery and beautiful shots. Look, buy, show your friends. <br /> <br /> The game is good, and Murphy especially portrays the reluctant / unlikely hero. I liked all the characters, and I found them interesting and well developed thanks to the dynamic interaction. <br /> <br /> I took care of what happened to these people, and although the result was quite predictable (the good guys win, the hero is a surprisingly attractive girl and the holy child save lives - who doesn't see what's coming?) it still made me happy when in the end everything turned out well. Thank God, the dignity of this film has never been destroyed by a shitty sequel. Take some popcorn, cuddle on the couch and watch this funny, fun and interesting movie.
