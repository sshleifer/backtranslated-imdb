What a fun, sexy movie! They, of course, no longer make them so. 4 sexual helpers arrive in London and commit all sorts of sexual misadventures. The tone is strangely innocent, since considerable nudity develops from ordinary farcical situations, and not from any obvious sexual desires on the part of the characters. Only when the actress accidentally lose their clothes, male characters become unrestrained. Richard O'Sullivan literally gets 'Randy' (sic). The film definitely betrays the origin of the erotic character, as in the films about the naked and the old school naturism. My particular interest in 'Au Pair Girls' is that I am a big fan of Gabrielle Drake. If any actress ever looked better naked (she is slim but wonderfully seductive), or dressed, come to this (I loved her from the very first UFO launch - who else could wear a purple wig!), I will eat my hat.
