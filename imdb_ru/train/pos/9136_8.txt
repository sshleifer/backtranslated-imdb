This is not such a bad film as some reviewers, and, as stated in the summary on the IMDB page for this film. What for? Firstly, it is the fact that in 1984 the filmmakers were bold enough to solve the problem of domestic violence as one of the elements of the plot, therefore, reviewers who complain about the plot, unfortunately, miss one of the main points! Secondly, without the plot of Prince’s relationship with his abusive father, the music climax doesn’t work as well as it’s - so those reviewers who say that only music is good have missed one of the points - in particular, WHY is that good ... because all the music in this film has a background story element that makes the music more effective. Third, give this movie a break! For novice producers and directors, this is not so bad! There are much worse movies from experienced movie people !! Finally, reviewers who say that the music is “good,” also missed the moment — familiarize yourself with the range of stylistic musical treatments, diversity, musicality and theatrical performance of the prince - truly one of a kind, musically, where no one went during the 1980s , and with the style seen in the work of other artists (clothing and movement: which elements of the costume were the first, Michael Jackson or the Prince? before the eyes, what the prince does in this film, long before Quentin Tarentino "Pulp Fiction"). As the sum of its parts, the film is not bad at all.
