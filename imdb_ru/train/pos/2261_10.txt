I saw this film and the play, and I must add that it was the most touching story I have ever seen. Until I watched this film, I did not know how terrible life was, and probably still for South African children and adults who were and live in that era. It caused tears in my eyes and great sadness in my heart that every person had to struggle in order to stay alive and bring the children straight from this area and teach them how to act and transform and give them the freedom to tell their own story. awesome. It just surpasses five stars, I rate it ten. Thank you, Mr. Mbongeni Nguema, for such an amazing story. Although 12 years have passed since this story was told, it is still in my heart. If the play has a VHS or DVD, please let me know as soon as possible. Thank. PS There is nothing wrong with children wanting to bring information about their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in the hope that someone will have a heart and offer help.
