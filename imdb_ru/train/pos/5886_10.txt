Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper can still make the world their smiles. The combined talent of these two great stars makes this film reunion / newcomer film work. Watch it and look forward to hitting sixty! Mary challenges a youth-oriented society with wit and charm. A touch of drama adds 2000 realism. The subsequent series will expand the new characters and give us the opportunity to see Lou Grant, Phyllis, Sue Ann, Murray and Georgette by chance!
