If you have any appreciation for the character and dialogue, as well as some sense of American cultural history, you will find a lot of very exciting material in this film. It was probably originally a game, which is why this is a difficult dialogue, but I cannot help emphasizing how these icons, which we only superficially understand, turn into really complex and wonderful characters. Better than any college course, the film tells how to create a character-driven story. <br /> <br />
