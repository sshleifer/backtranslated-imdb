I saw a long day dying, when he first came out at the cinema, I thought that the film gave a good soldier's point of view, realistically told about people at war. The storyline moves at a good pace, showing a group of people behind enemy lines and trying to get back to their lines with an enemy prisoner. Characters are well developed and believable. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings is a good actor and plays a major role with conviction, as does Alan Dobi (like the German Helmut). find this film on a VHS or DVD, and I feel that it has become a forgotten film, which is sad, because it surpasses many other war films I have seen.
