After a slow start, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny movie that wanted to say something positive. This was not one of Jim Carrey’s best performances, but he was still fine. Morgan Freeman was right like God. Jennifer Aniston had good moments. I miss Steve Correll in the film “DAILY SHOW!”. <br /> <br /> I like the choice of films directed by Tom Shadyak. He also made "Liar, Liar", "Patch Adams" and "Nutty Professor." In all three of them and in Bruce Almighty, he takes a great comedic star and tells a human story with him. A director who knows the comedy can receive talent that he gains and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story that is hard to find. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that they should use more biblical references. I remember only three specific Bible references, and they were the three funniest parts of the entire film. I assume that the first few drafts of the script had more biblical references, but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people. This is very bad, because I thought it was a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> My rating: <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
