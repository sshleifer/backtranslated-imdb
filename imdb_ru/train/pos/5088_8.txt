While watching the film, I never suspected that it was intended for an idiot box. I always thought it was a very good, successful film from the late 90s. But after I saw on the Internet that it was intended for television, I was shocked, because for a television movie itâ€™s just fantastic! <br /> <br /> I was most interested in length. I felt that the one-on-one battle scene had to be removed, as this was completely unnecessary. In addition, he began to reach the end, as if it seemed that the adventure would never end. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is a strong, very interesting and exciting story with great performances of each. I just felt like Patrick Fraze looked a bit haggard. I also felt that Goguol, who looked insane, became a little stupid in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by the beautiful landscapes of Africa. In addition, the first half of the film would make me give this film 9. Nevertheless, this is a great film for television. 8 out of 10.
