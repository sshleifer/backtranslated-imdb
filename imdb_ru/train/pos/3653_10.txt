Why is a good actress like the stars of Elizabeth Berkley in this banal movie ??? !!! The cast gives good results (Elizabeth Berkley as Barbie girl, El Keats as motherless girl and Justin Valin, the boy who has always diminished due to concern), but the direction is extremely boring and the story is NOT so interesting and original. I can not believe that such a film was created for the big screen! Julie Korman (producer): are you crazy ??? !!!
