Carefree comedy. Nothing shows us the world into which we sometimes want to escape: the world is nothing. Anything you don’t like, be it a pile of bills, a bad memory, or even hunger, can disappear at your will. They approached this film very well, and with a pleasant duet starring there were only a few things I didn’t like about Nothing, and they were not even part of the main film. <br /> <br /> First, the post-credit scene (and yes, there is one): good for a laugh, but what did they try to achieve with it? I was embarrassed and wanted to see a return to anything after the whole movie from nothing. Instead, we just hear a random set of noises, and they scream. He tries to create a sequel, in my opinion, and was not really necessary, and it was not funny after the tortoise got out of the frame. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the trailer: I saw the trailer on a DVD and, as others have said about it, it promotes a horror film that never appeared. Well, bad marketing, I think. <br /> <br /> If you see this when you rent a movie, take a look, because Nothing is a good movie to watch. If you have a big screen, you can wear curtains.
