Imagination is a terrible thing to spend ... especially if you have talented actors. Writer / director Jones does not spend time to add the viewer to his hero. <br /> <br /> Anyone who lived in the same apartment with saliva, crying with laughter. Anyone who arrives while the meter maid puts a ticket on your windshield will just cry. We all wanted to rip a terrible wig from a manâ€™s head. These are just excerpts from what is in the store when watching "Cross Eyed," a spiritual film that should be a springboard for Jones and his strange sense of humor both in front of and behind the camera.
