I really liked the performances of the main composition. Emma Lung is bold and interesting. The director has developed performances where the characters are not one-dimensional. Difficult history with change of epochs. They also praised the fundamental story that unions are losing power and the influence of a large employer on the closure of a small city. I do not agree with the comment that an elderly man should be attractive. There was a lot of relationship with older men and younger women â€” and the man does not look good. The depth of the character may be attractive for not so shallow. The film has a good appearance, and the cinema is also good.
