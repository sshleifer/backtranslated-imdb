This is my favorite movie about three bears. Once again I liked all the songs. However, a big problem, as most people pointed out, was that this story contradicts the original. For those who watched the first film, they recall that the bears met their “cousins”, which they obviously never knew. Of course, only to the end cousins ​​got their stomach symbols after they proved how much they cared. In this story, however, cousins ​​grow with caring bears and all the time have stomach symbols. That being said, this is not a bad movie as long as you keep it separate from the first one. I thought that the character of the Dark Heart is much angrier than the first Nikolay. But at the same time, I felt that it adds a certain balance of sweetness to caring bears. I also liked our caring part at the end, although I know that other people had mixed feelings about this scene. And, of course, I loved the songs. My favorites are "Grow and Forever Young." Bear care films have always had such good songs. Ten stars for a very good movie.
