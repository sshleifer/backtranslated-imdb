At one time this film was controversial, like all other projects of Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Contains very graphic images of death scenes; A parachute that does not reveal * slaps * the body of the guys on the floor. The guy who ate the teeth of Leo * chomp * in the throat. And the guy who is hit by a speedboat * zoom * is a bloody corpse coming down. <br /> <br /> But besides blood, this film also has some brilliant (and stunningly beautiful) scenes shot in the city of gray fisherman who is Vlissingen; <br /> <br /> Thousands of rosebuds flew over the screen, in some unrelated part, a beautiful (holy) woman puts flowers in a jar of milk, surrounded by pieces of bleeding meat and a hot love scene between two male characters at the cemetery. <br /> <br /> The story ends with an insane but intense 10 minutes that does not disappoint and make you sigh of relief. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are also disadvantages to pluses, some special effects are too superfluous, and, obviously, they are made to see how strongly Verhoeven can push the blood factor (for example, the hang of several eyeballs). from their sockets). In addition, while the two main actors (Jeroen Krabbe and René Southendijk) are great at breathing life into their characters, the character Hermann (pictured rather not charming by Tom Hoffman) just feels extremely underdeveloped, which makes him difficult to take care of. even after his tragic death. <br /> <br /> I did my best to give you a small idea of ​​what to expect from this amazing film, and, as you can see, it is not easy to sum up in words. So do yourself a favor, if you happen to find this movie anywhere, watch it! And enjoy the unique style and content of this masterpiece.
