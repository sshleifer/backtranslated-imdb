This story is beautifully played. It is sad and heartbreaking that a young girl travels to find out where she is and where she is going. Stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father died in a car accident, and since she was called a “miracle baby”, she has been suffering from dyslexia and finds life a little difficult. Her finds along the way affect those near her. Her relationship with her guardian and her boyfriend’s former boyfriend is handled very delicately and sensitively, and the entire cast is genuine, three-dimensional and believable. This warm, tender, erotic film, located around a peach canning factory in a small town in Australia, leaves a pleasant feeling when loans are closed. After reading some other rather small comments about Hugo Weaving, I would like to add that I think he was brilliantly played and extremely sexy. No, he is not Brad Pitt, but this does not mean that he is not attractive.
