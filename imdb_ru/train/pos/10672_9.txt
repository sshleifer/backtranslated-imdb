Anyone who has seen this film and revised it poorly, I refer them to Roger Ebert's review of this film. He is one of the most respected critics in the industry, and he gave him 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. It may not be perfect or impressive, but I liked it. The Choir Line is not so much a story as a group of stories about the lives of Broadway applicants. I read reviews where people said that too much time was spent on the affair between Zach and Cassie. This is the wrong view. This is a different story along with all the other stories that tell about each of the Broadway applicants. People do not understand that the dancers of Broadway shows go through the same thing as an ordinary person. And this, I think, is actually the meaning of the whole show. This should demonstrate not only the talent of these special dancers, but also give us some poignant things to think about life in general. This is a study of life as a Broadway star. Anyone who has dreamed of becoming a Broadway star watches this film with a wonderful sense of relationship, because they have gone through what the heroes are going through. <br /> <br /> This is a great musical. It has its slow points, and from time to time it is a little confused with the rhythm of certain storylines, but on the whole I fully enjoyed it. Look at the film, and then, perhaps, you will understand what I'm talking about.
