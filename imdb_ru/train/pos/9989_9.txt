I recently had the opportunity to watch a movie show. I believe it will be in cinemas in Canada sometime around Mother's Day. If it's in the theater next to you ... GO! This is not a funny movie about well-being - it looks more like a movie about feelings and thoughts. <br /> <br /> The director copes well with character development, allowing Hagar to penetrate into the heart, mind, and suffering. little by little At first, her attitude and behavior does not make much sense. As her story unfolds, she becomes one you can understand. As in life ... understanding brings sympathy. I found her pretty by the end of the film - especially when she opens her heart to a young man in a shack by the lake. <br /> <br /> The relations of Hagar with her two sons are painful and reflect many of our own experiences in this world. Her youngest son, John, full of life and adventure, takes the viewer to the very edge of his place - and turns him into raw emotions, such genuine and rare. <br /> <br /> Nice to see Ellen Page starring in this movie. She is so different from a young woman that she plays in Juno. It gives me even more appreciation of her acting skills. If you loved her in Juno, you would love her in The Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Of course, Ellen Bernstein as Hagar. Most likely, there is no way to express the power of action as much as an actor’s ability to make you forget all the characters they have ever played. Never during this film have I ever thought about Ellen Bernstein - I always thought only of Hagar. She fascinated me with her character - hook, fishing line and loader. <br /> <br /> Kari Skogland’s ability to film this famous book by one of Canada’s most cherished authors is impressive. She brilliantly displays on the screen both the stone and the angelic parts of this complex woman, Hagar, the stone angel.
