Perhaps the most honed and perfect of all Indian films - Pakeezah does not fall into any of the traps usually associated with a Bollywood film (i.e. stickiness, farce, wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of western themes / genres of the film). Pakeezah is a native of the subcontinent and is genuine, like Madame Butterfly. The characters are well developed, the direction, although sometimes not defined by modern standards, shrewdly and convincingly. The Urdu-speaking environment at the time of Packesa was a master of understatement and how dialogue conveys the finer points of the era! Acting (especially “appearance” and dynamics between characters) is an admiration, although the nuances can be lost to modern viewers or those who are not familiar with the customs and customs of Muslim India. <br /> <br /> In conjunction with an exciting scenario, an excellent musical score, supplemented by the main character, demonstrating an outstanding team of classical Indian dance (kathak). As is the case with most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but she does not leave the public until the viewer feels like a participant in a truly unforgettable movie experience. Pakeezah is certainly the pinnacle of what Indian cinema produced, and is unlikely to be parallel.
