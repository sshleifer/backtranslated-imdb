Anarchy and lawlessness prevail in the farm of the subnonies in Elk Hills. City elders appoint a tough, dexterous Vietnamese veteran Aaron (surprisingly strong and fascinating performance of Chris Christofferson) and several of his fellow veterinarians to remove this place. The plan fades away when Aaron and his cruel friends decide to capture Elk Hills after they get rid of all the bad elements. Aaron's decent good brother, Ben (who is played in a friendly manner by Ian-Michael Vincent) must stop him before the situation gets out of control. Writer / director George (“Miami Blues”, “Gross Pointe Blank”) Armitage plays a delightfully amoral, cynical and viciously disruptive goon-beater of the modern Western winner: he skillfully creates a rough, not meaningless tone, maintains a vigorous and unflagging pace in everything, and puts abundant action scenes with considerable muscular aplomb (causing an explosive climax especially strong and exciting). The first-class acting cast of familiar faces with b-fint is the main asset: Victoria Principal as Ben Lind's sweet girlfriend, fabulous Bernadette Peters as singer-weak-minded sedan Little Di, Brad Dexter as incompetent mayor, David Doyle as mucous bank president, Andrew Stevens as a friendly gas station attendant, John Carpenter, a regular participant in the film Charles Sayfers as one of the Nam veterinarians, Anthony Carbone as a smart casino manager, John Stedman as an old-fashioned diner owner, Paul Gleason as a strong hand hooligan shakedown and Dick Miller as a mediocre pianist. Moral: don't hire other people for dirty work. The smooth cinematography of William Kronyager, the lively, harmonious, harmonious score of Gerald Fried and the abundance of brutal violence further reinforce the general foolish merriment of this unfairly neglected little fool.
