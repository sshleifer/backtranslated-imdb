I often wondered how much CASPER was meant for children ... with all the problems revolving around his personality (in this film we behave to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child, as his house is a cemetery plot), and alarm message brought by this particular movie. Perhaps Casper was conceived rather as a game of morality, or Famous Studios wanted to open new horizons in the "reality" cartoons. <br /> <br /> “Good books today” is a well-animated project - no doubt there. But the development of the story with the participation of the fox (which becomes a friend of Casper, but meets a tragic end) is disturbing. <br /> <br /> Give tribute to renowned studios - they treat death with respect ... but the stern image of Casper’s grief is quite obvious and alarming for children (although the denouement does offer a happy ending, but I will not give up the end), and violence is pretty cool, even for the standards of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> This may be a good cartoon for parents to help explain the death to the children - but I wouldn’t poke it in the video recorder for a fun-filled cartoon break.
