This is without a doubt one of the best films I've ever seen. The first time I saw this, I was 9 or 10 years old. I started looking somewhere in front of the rape scene. And when I saw this, I was really shocked thinking: “What kind of a sick film is this?”. Today I saw it from the very beginning and really understood how good this film is. It is exciting, frightening, shocking and exciting in its own way. But the best thing about this is the final, where viewers are shown that this experience will pursue the characters for the rest of their lives. This torments their conscience, and they will worry all their life about the bodies found in this river. And they can't do anything about it, this is what they have to live with. This ending is one of the most miserable ends in cinema history and is very clever, brilliant and terrifying. <br /> <br /> And the acting is also great, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. Great game in this movie. In general, John Boorman created one of the best films in the history of cinema based on the novel by Dick Cheney. Be sure to look for all movie lovers
