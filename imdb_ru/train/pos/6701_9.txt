I really liked the first 2 seasons. because a lot of good characters disappeared later. like most shows, a little slower at first, and then better in later seasons, but this is the absolute opposite. Jenny from season 1 and Valari from season 2 were Sabrina's friends, I really didn’t care about others, Jenny and Valari were her coolest friends. I think for some reason the producers wanted us to dislike her college friends, they were so cruel to Sabrina. but my favorite episode from the first season is the opening of the cats, and my favorite episode from the second season is the witch, this is the most funny episode. I also thought it was funny how Libby was popular, but she was always jealous of Sabrina, and she never had a real boyfriend, but she always wanted to be with Harvey. I just wanted them to do more better. I also liked how, during the first two seasons, during the opening credits, Sabrina spoke a few words while wearing the costume, as in the pilot episode where she was dressed as a witch, I liked how she said “it's not me,” and then She kept trying to change herself to something else, that's what I think, but this is a really cool show. This is similar to the Andy Griffith show, because at first it was good, but as soon as it changed color, and Barney left, it became longer good. but I still love to watch it, but the only reason I watch later seasons is Sabrina. What I had in mind in the opening sequence: in the opening credits of season 1-3, Sabrina is depicted in front of a mirror, posing in several different costumes and outfits, and the names of the actors quickly flash at the bottom of the screen. In the end, Sabrina will say something like a pun that is related to her clothes and disappear. The initial sequence of the fourth season includes characters in bubbles. Season 5-7 opening credits show Sabrina in various places around Boston
