One of the most nihilistic and cruel films I've ever seen, but also one of the most tragic and touching. This action-melodrama, which the world has never seen before. Sometimes the plot brought me to tears, and the next moment delivered shocking revelations, like a crushing blow to the guts. The terrible performance of Edison Chen. The story that the HK Cop and the Cambodian assassin hunt each other, gradually losing their humanity, is strong. Possessing very little dialogue in favor of pursuing images and sandy camera work, “A dog bites a dog” is pure bloodshed without heroism.
