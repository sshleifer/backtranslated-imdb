I found this film tense almost from the beginning. When Miss Stanvik begins her narration, there are only a few minutes left until you realize that trouble is coming. A deserted area, a lock on an abandoned gas station door, everything makes you wait for it ... here it is. At first you think it will be a little boy, but too soon you begin to hold your breath as you watch the tide. I found this film really stressful, even though I watched it before and was preparing for a denouement. Now a film that can keep you on your toes, even if youâ€™ve seen it before, deserves some special rating, maybe a reward for white fists?
