Everyone has to watch this movie, because each of us is somewhat broken, and this can help us understand 1) My life is not as bad as I thought, and 2) How important it is to adopt a child in need. There are so many. The idea that the film is actually based on a real person made us think deeply about life, about how the world was and will be. Corrupt, but this corruption should not reach your home. We all have a choice! I definitely recommend this one ... and while you're on it, I would like to add "The Purple Purple" and "Woman, Thou Art Loosed" from TD Jakes. <br /> <br /> These are all films that are based on life and give us an idea of ​​life.
