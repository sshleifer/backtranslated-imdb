I just saw The Saint Strikes Back for the first time and found it pretty good. It was the first appearance of George Sanders in the role of the Saint, where he replaced Louis Hayward. <br /> <br /> In this episode, the Holy goes to San Francisco to investigate the shooting at a nightclub. With the help of their friend Inspector Fernac, who came from New York, they are helping the daughter of crime boss. <br /> <br /> Wendy Barry and Jonathan Hale participate in the Sanders movie. <br /> Not a bad holy movie. Worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
