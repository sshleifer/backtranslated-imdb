I have no idea what people are complaining about. I saw this movie yesterday, and I really liked it. The stone once again delivered a wonderful character. She was as good as the first basic instinct. She still has those clever but tricky answers. Although Sharon may be 48 years old ... she looks amazing! I don't care if she is fake, like Barbie. She looks good, that's all. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the start. Sex, violence and a great ending that makes you think and talk about it for hours! Half the people commenting on this film have not even seen it. So do not listen to them.
