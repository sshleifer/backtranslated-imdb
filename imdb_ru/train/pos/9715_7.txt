That skinny, it seems that he is much older than I thought. But this is still cool. Bike bellows are cool and the story works for the most part. There are some character issues that I hope to solve on my own in part 2, and my biggest complaint about everything is that it seems like a MACROSS failure. Not only animation style, but also several characters. For example, all the girls in this film look like LIN MINI MACROSS. Mechs are like MACROSS just like other characters. This is really not for young children, it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. In short, I give this cool game MACROSS 7 STARS.
