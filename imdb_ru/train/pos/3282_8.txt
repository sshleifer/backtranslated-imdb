Not knowing what this film was about, I checked it in the video store and saw it, enjoyed it. A little-known multi-genre film directed by Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Great story and characters. As a fan of Glenne Healdy's, I was surprised by her British accent. The only exception to this movie was the final. However, it is worth the rent.
