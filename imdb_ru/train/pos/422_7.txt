“An ordinary person” represents Cecil B. Demil's directing skills in his most inaccurate and not actual form. He sets up parallel plots for a no less stellar entourage than Wild Bill Hicock (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, although in reality Lincoln was already dead at the time when the story takes place. From time to time, DeMille comes dangerously close to the truth, but with the same ease leaves her in a shameless spectacle and spectacle. The film is an attempt to reinforce the last position of Custer with a heap of fiction based only on the lives of people who were already the product of things produced and legends. Truly, this world, according to DeMille, is the spirit of the time in the annals of entertainment, but by today's standards is a pretty relic. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER: Considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately attractive translation with often pure white and extremely solid black. In some scenes there is a significant amount of film grain, while in others there is a lack of it. In general, image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it is never bad or good. a little better than the middle of the road. Age artifacts are minimized, and digital anomalies do not distract. The sound is mono but well balanced. <br /> <br /> ADDITIONAL: Forget it. It is universal! BOTTOM LINE: Because pseudohistory is written in celluloid, this western is irresistible and fun. Just take your heroes and the story of the salt of the grain ?? in some cases ?? The whole box seems more suitable!
