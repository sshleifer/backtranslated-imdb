I really liked this film, I saw the original classics several times, but I could hardly remember any details. I think this film is much better than a cartoon, it is not as black and white as it is. I especially liked how they made Grinch such a complete character and explained why he was what he is, the villain in this film was not a real Grinch, but a major, very different from the original cartoon. Jim Carrey was the perfect participant in the whole great movie, made for both children and adults.
