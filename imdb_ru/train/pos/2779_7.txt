“Bend It Like Beckham” may mean little to us Americans who know very little about other football (soccer), but for English sports fans, this is equivalent to “Hit it Like Bonds” or “Dunk it Like Jordan”. Any young soccer player dreams of bending the soccer ball around one player and netting it, like star player David Beckham, like the young Indian girl Jess (Parminder Nagra) in the movie "Bend like Beckham" banned by her traditionalist mother. However, playing once, a passing friend named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her play and invites her to try herself in the entire women's football team. After satisfying coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), she creates a team that, as she knows, her mother will not approve. The film is not about parents' disobedience, but about the fact that a girl does what she wants, even if it goes against culture, and not just with her parents. There is humor in the film, especially when Jules's mother thinks she is a lesbian. The film resorts to some clichés, since a big football game takes place on the same day as Sister Jess's wedding, but not funny, but fun and easy. The football event looks good, so sports fans will love it, and the story of girls growing up in the world of boys and the world of football will inspire some viewers. Bend It Like Beckham is not just football, but rather a girl who is trying to find herself and at the same time please her parents, which turns out to be quite a difficult task.
