This film will tell you why Amitabh Bachchan is an industry of one person. This film will also tell you why Indian moviegoers are astute shoppers. <br /> <br /> Amitabh was at the peak of his domination in Bollywood when his former godfather Prakash Mehra decided to use his image again. Prakash has a habit of choosing topics and building stories from them, adding to them liberal doses of Bollywood feelings and clichés. Zanzier saw the creation of the Angry Young Man. Lavaris was about the bastard, and Namak Halal about the loyalty of the master servant. <br /> <br /> But then the topic was limited to push the script through the three hours of song, dance and drama regulations. The film depicts a caricature of Haryanavi, which is sent to Mumbai and turns into an ordinary hero. Amitabha’s vocal skills and diction allowed the film to earn big money thanks to its immaculate accent of Haryanvi. For me, this is one of the biggest attractions in the film. Everything else is a typical Bollywood script. <br /> <br /> By now Amitabha should have had typical comedic scenes in each of his films. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This film had a good dose of them. Capers shoes at the party, a monologue about the stories of Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazara, the fight against mosquitoes in the meeting room and the usual scene of a drunkard, which has now become the standard fare for Amitabha. <br /> <br /> Shashi Kapur added an extra mile to the film with his capricious, choosy character (Remember how he asked Ranjit "Shaaadaaaap" after the poisoned cake incident. ") He was the master role of the master, while Amitabh was his faithful servant. But Prakash Mehra knew the Indian mind ... and therefore Shashi had to carry his act with the rest of the film. It was one character who could be more developed to make a serious film. But this is capers, remember? And as long as they stayed this way, people came and saw that Amitabh in a new hat and returned home happy. The end is always predictable, and the good guys get the girl, and the bad go to jail, the age-old theme of loyalty once emphasized once again, and all is well that ends well. <br /> <br /> So, we What makes this film almost classic? Amitabh Bachchan as Haryanvi. Prakash Mehra created another icon in the name of the story. Chuck is a story, characters and plot.
