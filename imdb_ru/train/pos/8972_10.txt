My opening of the Jan Swankmayer cinema opened my eyes to the whole tradition of Czech animation, the pioneer of which was JÃ¼ri Trnka. His Hand is one of the best, most technically impressive animation films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Potter wakes up and waters his plant. Then he makes a pot. But a huge hand comes that breaks the pot and demands that the potter make himself a statue. He throws his hand, but soon she returns and puts him in a bird cage, where he is forced to sculpt a stone hand. He proceeds to this, fainting from exhaustion, but in the end he fulfills the task. <br /> <br /> In an amazing series of meta-cinema, the potter uses a candle to burn the visible puppet strings that hold him captive, running away. He closes and is accidentally killed by his favorite plant when it falls on his head. <br /> <br /> This film does not hide the fact that it is pure animation, in contrast to modern films that tend to be realistic (why?). A hand, for example, is clearly someone's gloved hand. Everything else is clay. The strings are visible and are part of the narration, which makes it the predecessor of the Strings movie. The atmosphere is gloomy: this hand, following the little potter, was able to instill more fear in me than many horror films put together. <br /> <br /> The film is obvious, but it avoids manipulating its simplicity. This is a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny, which cannot but win the heart and mind of everyone who considers freedom a natural right.
