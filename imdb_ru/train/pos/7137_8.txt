The plot of GOODNIGHT MR TOM on paper makes it clear that we are waiting for a large portion of a painful, painful mood. But the talented director Jack Gold is an expert in the correct handling of emotions, and instead he becomes a convincing, deeply touching war drama with excellent staged and leading performances. One of the best, if not the best television films of the 1990s, which could have been even more successful if it was released in theaters. <br /> <br /> Evacuation of children to rural cities and villages in the Second World War was, of course, common practice, but in the case of a small boy it was doubly important here because of the terrible family life in the capital of Great Britain. The horrors of war to the forefront are not shifted, although, and the construction of the film, until it fusses in our throats, a hazy look ends us with a sense of optimism in spite of what has happened before. It is almost (but not quite) worthy of comparison with the final IT WONDERFUL LIFE (1946). All in all, modern classics.
