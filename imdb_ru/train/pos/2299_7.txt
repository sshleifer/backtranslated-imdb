Who would say that horror is not a genre of educational film, eh? Thanks to this amazing short film “The Hammer” I now, at least, know, NEVER to offer a strange visitor any wine and a piece of bread and salt in my own house, because he may just be a hypnotist, and this combination will give him the ability to control my thoughts and thoughts forever! Thanks, Hummer! The tenth episode of the Horror House series is another episode I was looking forward to, mainly because the guy in the director's chair was Don Sharp; one of the best British filmmakers, but still sadly underestimated. Sharpe was responsible for several very cool Hammer films, such as Vampire's Kiss and Rasputin: The Mad Monk, as well as some independent films, such as Dark Places and Psychomania. His contribution to the “House of Horrors” is one of the best in the series, with a complex, but exciting storyline and spin on delightful occult themes. In the center of the plot are two antique dealers who stumble upon a strange object resembling a mirror, but in fact this is an ancient search device that can be used to call Choronzhon; demonic keeper of the abyss. The mirror is highly demanded by the satanic cult, because it is necessary for them for ceremonies, but Michael does not want to sell it before he finds out the real value of the device. When he picks up a clearly petrified girl who runs from the cult to avoid casualties, Michael is drawn deeper into the occult conspiracy. Satanic cults and carnal sacrifices of young women are typical British horror themes, but the script of David Fisher is never boring and offers many neat plot attacks, including a very inventive climax. There is also a lot of tension to admire, the dialogues are witty, and the acting is great (especially John Carson, as the leader of the cult, is really creepy). Featured!
