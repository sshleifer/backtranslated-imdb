Since it was just a kid, when this show was originally broadcast, I just recently picked up a DVD set, and I wish there were more episodes filmed. This show was a version of the popular television series of the 90s, The X-Files, of the 70s, but with a slightly more comedic / frivolous approach. But donâ€™t get me wrong, some of these episodes are entirely devoted to horror themes, many of which have pretty cute plots (of course, provided to the imagination - it was in the early 70s). Some of the plots, where a bit silly, as well as acting, but this is the charm and appeal of this series. Whether you love secret crime dramas, comedies, or sci-fi / horrible stories, this series brings it all together. Each episode lasted about 50 minutes or so (1 hour with ads), and the 50 minutes pass quickly, always leaving me waiting for more. Great classic show that is underrated in my book!
