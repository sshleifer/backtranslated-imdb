it was one of the most fun and informative shows i have ever seen. This MUST be seen by anyone over the age of 16. In this show, I and my 2 boys from the very beginning laughed out loud. I don’t know if everything in the show was true, but the way it was presented left no doubt that Mr. Woole was not only very knowledgeable, but he was also pleased to present this information to very happy college students who attended. If Mr. Woul ever decides to repeat this format, he will have to rent a building the size of the Georgia Dome to accommodate all the people who want to see it. I agree with the idea of ​​making this HBO series. It would be an amazing follower.
