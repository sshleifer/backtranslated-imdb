My rating refers to the first 4 seasons of Stargate SG-1, which are surprisingly fresh, creative and addictive. When the cast went through the gate, you never knew what lay on the other side! Starting around the 5th season, the show was focused on something else - still good, but different. <br /> <br /> The series tells about the adventures of a group of people (and one newcomer) who regularly work out a planetary transport device called Stargate. The prehistory of the series is based on the characters and events of the Stargate movie, in which the device was discovered during archaeological excavations in Egypt. <br /> <br /> Episodes are easy (innocent and easy to see) and very creative. Many of the inventive stories could easily be turned into your own fantastic films. What happens next has always been unpredictable. <br /> <br /> Characters on which the spectacle of the show is also clearly defined and brilliantly performed. They have a serious tone, but the dialogue is filled with incredible wit and humor. They are just fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Starting around the 5th season, the series began to evolve into a continuous storyline based on the fight against one enemy (Goauld, then Ori). Plots are becoming more complex (much more politically / strategically oriented) and interdependent. The characters were still as gorgeous as before, but the show was different in character. <br /> <br /> One thing worth mentioning is to watch episodes on the 100th and 200th episodes. They just can't miss the show. They demonstrate the creative and wildly humorous genius who has done the series for 10 seasons. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of science fiction, watch a few episodes of the first 4 seasons, and you will probably be hooked. If you like evolving storylines between the two warring parties, you have 10 seasons of the show that are eagerly awaiting.
