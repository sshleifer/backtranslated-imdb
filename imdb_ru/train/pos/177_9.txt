This is a good movie and nothing more. And it's very fun to watch. Of course, it slips on political issues. So what? I am sure she did not try to do "Good night and good luck" here. Let's not try to do something else, except that it is ... a light snack. <br /> <br /> And it is very nice! <br /> <br /> We remember what year was 1984? We have become very sophisticated on the part of the media as to what we are watching or not. I tend to disagree on this. Goldie knew it was funny, and she went ahead and did it. <br /> <br /> Like her easiest fare: protocol, overboard, babysitter, wild cats, Private Benjamin, looks like old times, foul play, death becomes her GOLDIE knows what she is doing, First Wives Club and a Out-of-Towners remake ... she plays every role in the camp you can get from this! Goldie knows herself very well, and she knows that she can do very well. <br /> <br /> She always made me laugh fun and innocent. I loved her in "Laugh-In" and in all the things she had ever been in. She never tried to be someone other than who she is ... and this is the boiling, giggling girl next door who turns out to be very beautiful and with a smile and a laugh that will always delight me and remind me that life is quite short, and you just need to light up, because before you know it ... you are old, wrinkled, and suffer from one of the inevitable ailments of life. If it happens so late. <br /> <br /> I appreciate Goldie for being an attractive, comedic actress.
