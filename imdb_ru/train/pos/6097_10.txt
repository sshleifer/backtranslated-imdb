I do not understand how you can say that Freddie's Nightmares are stupid and plagiarism. You obviously do not know a good TV when you see it. The episodes are filled with drama and blood. Freddie is ingenious in the way he kills people. I love Freddie's Nightmares and I hope to release all 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes: Special Saturday Night, School Astonishment and Love Stinks. If you think that this show sucks, then you are entitled to your opinion, but remember that this is just your opinion, and it means nothing. Freddieâ€™s nightmares will always be one of the best TV shows ever created, and you will soon accept this fact. If you do not like it, do not look at it, but do not deny that it is brilliance.
