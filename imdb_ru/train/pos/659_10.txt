One of the latest classic of the French New Wave. As a director, the cinematographer Jean Yustasch used the simplicity of the cinema of the turn of the century; for the story, Eustache attracted the torment of his own difficult love life. There is so much to say about this film - and this is wonderful; I am indulgently too long; sometimes cheerful; emotionally draining ... etc, etc. In my opinion, any complaints that may be directed to this film are easily overshadowed by its many merits. Each student of the film, a writer or simply anyone who wants to work with a 3-hour film without abrupt cuts, without excessive styling of music videos, without plot twists in the spirit of a soap opera and without a banal dialogue, should not give a reason to watch this film. Everyone needs to be admired: writing (laconic, clever, surprisingly funny), acting (everyone, everything is simple, flawless in their roles) and simple leadership (the viewer feels like a casual observer in the film) make this film unforgettable. This is undoubtedly a movie that stays with you.
