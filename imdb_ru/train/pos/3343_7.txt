My daughter is very annoyed when I turn to Drew Barrymore, who looks like sheâ€™s been hit in the face with a frying pan, not to mention her chin Dudley Durlight, for whom Jay Leno will die. How wonderful it is when I discovered at Fever Pitch that I really like Miss Barrymore; and Jimmy Fallon; and Red Sox; and Boston! This film is probably best described as a sweet, light comedy. To be completely stereotypical, girls will love the film for its romantic charm and the vulnerability of Jimmy Fallon, and the boys will like everything between men and the image of sports mania. <br /> <br /> My sporting hate wife, my teenage daughter, and I all found something I like about the movie. It speaks for itself. It's a nice way to spend an hour and a half or so, and probably a really good date movie, too.
