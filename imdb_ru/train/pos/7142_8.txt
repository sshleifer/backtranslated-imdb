Holes, originally a novel by Louis Sachar, was successfully turned into a fascinating and well-made film. Starring Sigourney Weaver as an overseer, Shea Labeuf in the role of Stanley and Cleo Thomas in the role of Zero, the roles were very well dismantled, and the actors played their roles well. <br /> <br /> In the film were intertwined storylines, which brought to the end. The main storyline is about Stanley Yelnats and his punishment for having spent a year and a half in the Greenlake camp. The second storyline is about Sam and Kate Barlow. This plot deals with racism, and this is a deeper plot of the film. The third tells about Ilya Yelnats and Madame Zeroni, which explains the 100-year curse of the Yelnat family. In my opinion, these storylines were woven very well. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the beliefs of many people, I think that you donâ€™t have to read the book to understand the film. The film is quite simple to understand. <br /> <br /> The cast in the film was well done, especially Shea Labeuf (Stanley), Cleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (overseer) and John Voight (Mr. Sir) Other members D-Tent, Jake Smith (Squid), Max Kasch (Zig-Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Armpit) and Brenden Jefferson (Roentgen), reinforced the comic relief of the film, However, Zero and Stanley, who together have created a great team. <br /> <br /> Although Hole is a Disney movie, it addresses some serious issues such as racism, gunfights and violence. In some moments, the dramatization of the film is very well done. <br /> <br /> I would like to offer this film to people of all ages, regardless of whether they read the book or not. You should not miss it.
