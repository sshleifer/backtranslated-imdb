Dog Bite Dog will not be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Full of slapping, stabbing and shooting (but don't worry - lead is a terrible blow), it can best be described as a cruel dash through Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pan, a Cambodian assassin in the city, to kill a lawyer. Despite the fact that he was dirty in his journey, he almost immediately sat down at a huge table in the middle of a clearly expensive restaurant. If this seems incredibly improbable to you, you should probably avoid this movie. This served as my clue to suspend disbelief, and I was much more fun. <br /> <br /> Chasing Pang is played by Wai (Sam Lee), a young nervous cop who likes to spank people almost as much as he likes to smoke. Wai is walking along a thin line, on which he is investigated by the Ministry of the Interior, and his father, the legendary Good Policeman, is in a coma after a drug deal that went south. ). <br /> <br /> There are car accidents, lots of murders, and a weird and awkward love story played out almost in the style of comics. I suspect that the humor was deliberate (no one uses giant concrete batons unattended for the extravagantly absurd), although the excessive nature has lost many of my colleagues in the audience. There are at least three points in which the film could end, and in 109 minutes it could benefit from more ruthless editing or removal of one of the narrative streams (light-hearted material worked well, so I would not interact with the three fathers) . <br /> <br /> I tend to give him a (high) pass, however, at least because of the end ?? I rarely heard so many people laugh so loudly at what was supposed to be painful. This is one to see with a group of friends who love funny
