This film I loved since childhood! It is perfectly. Although it may seem a bit difficult for an ordinary movie viewer, if you can't interpret some subtleties in the film (for example, our hero is Achilles, and in the last battle between him and Alexander, he shot the heel with a rocket, as Achilles was shot in heels ). It's just a little fact, which is a little fun! In any case, a great movie, a good story, it would be great to see it converted with today's special effects! Strangely enough, Gary Graham had an average success, acting in the lead role on the TV show "Alien Nation". This movie is a fun watch and you need to appreciate it more!
