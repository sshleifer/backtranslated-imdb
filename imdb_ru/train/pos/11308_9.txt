TCM keeps me awake all the time ... they keep coming up with films that I have never heard of ... Senso ... now Ossessione ... a very early Visconti film !! ... wow ... The Italian version of "The Postman always calls twice ... brilliantly!" beautifully acted and directed ... Never heard of great roles, Klara Kalamai in the role of Giovanna, and especially Massimo Girotte in the role of Gino ... sensual man !! more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the 1943 screen !!! His look ahead of his time ... many 1950s male stars were probably inspired by him ... he was supposed to be the main world star !! The film is much better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version, and less glossy than the MGM version (which I really like) with John Garfield and Lana Turner, remember this white outfit? who can forget .... This Italian version is different ... more realistic and with a completely different ending ... look, look ... I'm going to buy it !!
