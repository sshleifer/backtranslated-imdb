This is, so to speak, the continuation of "Batman - animation," and it is pretty much as good as before, and for the same reasons there is a lot of action in it; Kevin Conroy as Batman, Mark Hamil as Joker, etc. Villains are really good, such as Joker, Two-Faced, Catwoman, Clay, etc. So I'm sure you won't be disappointed with the new adventures of Batman because it is really good. So make sure you watch it on TV or rent it, or buy a collector's edition, because it is really good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ********* from ****** **** <br /> <br /> **** from *****
