I'm a big fan of Simon Pegg, and still watched a lot of his films, and none of them stopped making me laugh. How not to lose friends and alienate people. <br /> <br /> This film, in fact, tells about a man who knows how to anger people. However, he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing what can make him famous. But in the end he ends up making them, the culture of life. <br /> <br /> The film is well toned with humor, romance, good acting and a bit of dancing on your knees. This is one of those movies where you can just be happy when it ends.
