Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority ruled by South Africa, much like Gandhi tried to resist the colonialism of the British Empire in India. Richard Attenboroughâ€™s Freedom of Freedom film is not so much about Biko or Apartheid, but about Donald Woods, the white liberal newspaper editor who risked his life trying to tell the story of Biko. The film has a dramatic change in perspective after Biko dies in prison of tortuous behavior at the hands of the South African "police". Woods, played by Kevin Kline, must decide whether to do the right thing and run out of the country in order to publish books about Biko or let his wife, played by Penelope Wilton, make him forget about the books. In this case, Biko dies in vain. What begins with the life-changing friendship between Biko and Woods, degenerates into a standard for the number of shoots across the border yarn after Biko's death. Nominated for Oscar, Denzel Washington is only good in his fourth film as Biko, but something is wrong in a film that tries to portray the struggle of apartheid, focusing more on the trials of the white family for more than half the film. Attenborough would have served his subject better, focusing on Biko's elevation, and not on the place where Biko became friends with Woods. Perhaps the black actor in the lead role in the movie for two and a half hours did not quite contribute to the big box office, but the film was still a huge box-office failure. Leaving film politics aside, the film still entertains and sends a message or two, albeit in a disinfected PG-style. *** out of 4 stars.
