I was bored one night, and Red Eye was turned on and wondered why not. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is one of the best movies in a long time. <br /> <br /> I mean, I just got into a movie because it was just great. <br /> <br /> History is new and different. <br /> <br /> The film also has two excellent roles in a film with Rachel McAdams as Lisa Reisert and Killian. Murphy in the role of Jackson Rippner. <br /> <br /> The game is simply gorgeous, and you will feel the people in the film. <br /> <br /> The music is just great, it gives you a chill and it can also make you feel relaxed. <br /> <br /> I just like how the film was so well made, and it is never boring. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is simply phenomenal. No more and no less. <br /> <br /> This is a great thriller. <br /> <br /> In general, I enjoy the red-eye effect so much that I can watch it again and again. <br /> If you like Red Eye, then I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf. <br /> <br /> I give Red Eye 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Great movie
