"Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is a magical adventure film with a certain charm, although it is not one of Disney's best works. He generally has a good story, good songs, great characters, good actors, magical and amazing special effects, good settings and beautiful landscapes of England. <br /> <br /> It also combines live action and animation very well. The animation itself is, of course, very good. The animation is very similar to the 1973 animated film “Robin Hood”, and the same can be said about the animated characters: there are many wild animals, such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and others, like in Robin Hood. ". In addition, the king (lion) seems to be a mixture of Prince John and King Richard, not to mention that the bear really looks like Little John. <br /> <br /> This film is often compared to “Mary Poppins” with reason. Both combine live action and animation with a similar design. Both have similar settings in London. Both have their own magic and magical woman. The kids (Carrie, Charlie, and cute little Paul) are a bit like Banks kids. Both films were shot by Robert Stevenson, and both by David Tomlinson. However, instead of a very serious man such as George Banks, David Tomlinson plays a funny and magical man - Professor Emelius Brown. With his magic, this film also has a slight but significant resemblance to the Harry Potter stories. <br /> <br /> Most songs are good. The Epoch of Unbelief and the Beautiful Salt Sea are the best. Portobello Road is also good. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson is great again in this film. Angela Lansbury is great in the role of Miss Price, and all three young actors are also fine: Cindy O'Callaghan in the role of Carrie, Ian Weigill in the role of Charlie (the boy aged unbelievers) and Roy Snart as the younger brother Paul. br /> <br /> I like the black cat. This is pretty cool. It's a bit like Salem, a black cat from the TV series "Sabrina, the Young Witch." I find it cute whenever one of the characters in the film turns into a white rabbit. Rabbits are really cute, fluffy and charming animals. I just adore them! Even funnier, when Professor Emelius Brown turns into a white rabbit, because when he turns into a man again, he shakes his nose like a rabbit. This is really fun, combined with his funny figure and mustache. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good film, but its end is pretty bad. The first minutes of the film are nothing special, but then they are greatly improved. The ending, however, is weak. This is my main criticism of this, largely because the animated knights are too much for me, but also because of the feeling of war.
