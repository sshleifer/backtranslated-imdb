This, in my opinion, is a very good film, especially for fans of Michael Jackson. It contains a message about drugs, amazing special effects and amazing music video. <br /> <br /> The main film is about the Smooth Criminal song and music video. Unlike the four-minute music video, it has a normal speed and, in my opinion, much easier to watch. <br /> <br /> However, the plot is rather strange. Michael Jackson plays a magical "gangster" who, when he sees a shooting star, turns into a mechanism. Throughout the film, he turns into a race car, a giant robot and a spaceship. <br /> <br /> In particular, the scene of the robot is a bit stretched and strange. I found it to be a bit unusual compared to the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The child is kidnapped, Michael tries to save her, is tortured and beaten, and suddenly turns into a giant robot, blows up all the bad guys. A little weird? Yes. <br /> <br /> But besides the strange scene with robots, this is a very good movie, and any Michael Jackson fan will enjoy both the Smooth Criminal music video and the movie.
