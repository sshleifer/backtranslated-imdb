If you've ever wondered why they don't do porn with the plot, watch Dream Quest. On the one hand, you should pay tribute to Armstrong for making efforts to take advantage of this idea, and for using such a strong adult cast to give it the strength of a name. On the other hand, it also quickly becomes apparent why most people never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialogue connecting the sex scenes together. These people simply cannot act (and history, unfortunately, is absurd to the point of absurdity). <br /> <br /> However, I gave her 7, because it was a good attempt, and it looks like there was a bit of effort to cut corners. In addition, I would like to see more attempts like this. Maybe someday I will see a great combination of porn and plot.
