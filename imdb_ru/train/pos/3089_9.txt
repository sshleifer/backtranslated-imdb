I got hooked on it, apparently ABC licensed this show to Pearl TV in Hong Kong. It was a surprise to me, since it was a break from listening to anything Chinese. But I started to flirt, because the actors and storylines are rather New York and thoughtful. Nothing too incredible, although I think itâ€™s very stereotypical for them to write Damien as a potential black man with a sheet !!!! It was the most disappointing aspect. The rest is great, and I'm sad to find out on IMDb that I can't look forward to watching the second season when I return to the USA. I am as disappointed as other commentators are that it showed a lot of promise, quality and taste. But just as it shows that the characters are getting closer, people will probably find it harder to watch if they start watching several episodes. Which is obviously too late for active networks.
