This superb drama kept me waiting. I could not take my eyes off the screen for a second, because every word connected pieces with this mysterious murder. This film really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be. In the end, I really cried (which I do not want to give!). It also allowed me to understand how cruel and disgusting people can be when it comes to murder. <br /> <br /> The cast was also very good. The only bad actor was the actress who played Anna Marie. The actress did an excellent job, but the director did not. I say this because he found a man who does not look like anything, like Anna Marie Fahe herself.
