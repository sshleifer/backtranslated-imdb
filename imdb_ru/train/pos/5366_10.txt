I sit here in November 2006 and still can not help but say about this film. The best films of Arnold came out in 4-5 years. Running Man, Predator and Full Reminder (1990). All 3 are awesome. Arnold's trashy liners in this movie will make you laugh more than once. I think the acting in this film is surprisingly good, as it was in Predator and Totall Recall. They did a great job trying to make the scenes futuristic, as it should have happened in 2017, but you can't help but make fun of 80s-style haircuts for men and women in the crowd and ordinary TV monitors Running Man Studio, which we all know here in 2006, is on the verge of the emergence of flat panels and high-definition televisions. In addition, the computer graphics of the entry to the game “Running Man” will not look like this in 2017. Nevertheless, the storyline is absolutely fantastic. Never during this film did I want to get up and not take care of the end, which I often do with today's film. I really think that Arnold's game is much better than he thinks. Now I would not have elected him governor, but this is California for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are also fantastic "stalkers", and I believe that the producers are not trying to overdo the fighting scenes. When a stalker is dead ... he is dead. It does not last for 20 minutes each. The pursuit scenes are quick and entertaining, but they do not try to replay them. I put this movie on 10/10, and it comes from someone who doesn't like a lot of films these days. If you get the right actors and the right story, the futuristic graphic displays that you would see in 2006 are not important or unnecessary.
