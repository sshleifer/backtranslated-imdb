I really enjoyed watching this film about Delaney's sisters. I knew about them, but that was all. This film opened my eyes to their bravado and courage. What a couple. What sacrifices they made to live on their own terms. This is not only a film for African Americans, but for all Americans. This is a kind of history lesson and documentary film, combined into one and combined with an interesting biography of the film. The game was excellent in all respects, and we really got an idea of ​​the difficulties that these two sisters had experienced over the years. Both sisters are very different from each other. They came from a very loving and very strict family with high, perhaps even impossible standards of excellence. It's sad to see Sadie’s father refuse to let his daughter continue to see his boyfriend because of a possible misunderstanding. I fully recommend this film, and I am glad that I saw him on TV the other day.
