I seriously loved this movie ... I started reading a book, and I liked it ... the way everything worked and everyone had a goal ... I think this movie was successful because Louis Sachar wrote the script. .and, of course, director Andrew Davis ... Shea Lebuf gives a great presentation for her first film ... the storyline is very cool and interesting ... there is humor, heart and intensity ... it is very similar to the book ... I I find this film no less boring ... I really liked it ... and I urge everyone to read the book ... everything in this film is very well built and carefully processed ... two thumbs up for me in all respects
