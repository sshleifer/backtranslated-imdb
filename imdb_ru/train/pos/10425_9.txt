THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at Radio City Music Hall in a year when most “travel enthusiasts” sat at home and watched their new 7 Motorola TVs. Almost all the latest box office numbers are wrong - because they cannot control inflation. Obviously, today's films for $ 10 will dominate. In 1951, they cost from $ 90 to $ 1.60 in Radio City, first from 44 to 75 cents at Loew's Palace in Washington, or 35 to 50 cents in the neighborhood. What is important is the number of people responding on the picture, not the unadjusted box office “back in the media.” The genius of THE GREAT CARUSO was that the filmmakers took away most of real life Enrico Caruso (really, in any case, not a good story) and threw it into the trash a bucket. Instead, 90% of the film’s attention was focused on music, so MGM gave us the best live opera singer, MARIO LANZA, performing the music of the best opera singer in history, ENRICO CARUSO. The result was a wonderful film. It is a pity that LANZA would give up his life and career on overeating. Too fat to play as a STUDENT PRINCE, Edmund Purdom took his place - with the double voice of Lanza and with the previously beautiful and not fat Lancia depicted in advertising. If you want to see BIG CAROS, it's almost always on eBay for $ 2.00 or less. Do not be discouraged by the low price, since it reflects only the easy availability of copies, and not the quality of the film.
