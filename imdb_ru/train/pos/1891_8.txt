When you see this movie, you begin to realize that the extremely underused asset was the late Dudley Moore. There should be a dozen of such films in our archive. <br /> <br /> He was a talented actor before he went to Hollywood as a comedian and musician. But mostly he is remembered for his collaboration with Peter Cook on television and in one or two indifferent British films. Perhaps the best of them was "Blinded." <br /> <br /> Cook always overshadowed him, and his jealousy and meanness contributed to their partnership and allowed Moore to realize his true potential in America. "Arthur" is the result. <br /> <br /> This is really a great movie. Moore's clown comedy as a drunkard is undeniable. The script is perfect for his manner with a lot of funny, almost surreal conversational digressions. There is something so British in him that I’m actually surprised that he found such an appeal to American tastes. Tommy Cooper, an anarchic comedian after the same method, usually draw empty. This is Moore’s almost childish vulnerability, which is so charming. <br /> <br /> Liza Minnelli and John Gilgud tend to play direct roles against him, but still have excellent one-liners. In particular, John Gilgud has a sarcastic and sharp authority, which is worth watching. He invariably steals any scene in which he figures, and fully deserves his Oscar. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he never played any other comic role. <br /> <br /> There is an additional film called “Arthur 2 - On the Rocks”. He will never reach the same sublime level of fun, like this one, but he is still pretty good. Guilgud only appears in a cameo at the beginning and as a ghost. It is darker. And there is an interesting revaluation of values. It will disappoint if you see Arthur first. <br /> <br /> Hollywood seems to have lost interest in pleasant Dudley after these two walks. In the end, he returned to the UK, dejected and clearly dying. <br /> <br /> But “Arthur” is a model of what could be. We can only present other great films that he was supposed to make. <br /> <br /> You really miss, Dudley.
