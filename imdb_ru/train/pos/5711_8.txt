In the film “Le Million”, Rene Claire, one of the great directors and pioneers of cinema, created a pearl of bright comedy, which, for all its lightness, is an innovative and technically brilliant film that clearly influenced the following directors, such as the Marx brothers, Lubich, and Mamoulian . The plot, the witty story of a poor artist who wins a huge lottery jackpot, but must frantically search for a missing ticket throughout the city, is just a device to support a series of amazingly witty comic scenes taking place in the world of dreams of the director's imagination. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive things in this film is that, although it is located in the center of Paris and contains nothing impossible, it creates a steady and exciting fairy tale / fantasy atmosphere that seems completely natural. that people sing as much as they say, or that a fight over a stolen jacket should take the form of a football match. Another memorable element - Le Million includes, perhaps, the most ridiculous opera ever made of films (oh, this soprano, braided by a blonde! "I laugh, ha! Ha!"). Also, the casting is admirable: Claire gathered a group of amazing ones. These are completely different characters, each of which illustrates the bourgeois French “type” with deadly satirical precision, so the film looks like a collection of Daumier prints. <br /> <br /> Fun takes a little time to start playing, and I found that the characters are not as emotionally attractive as they can even be in a light comedy (as, for example, in many Lubic films). For these reasons, I refrained from giving him the highest rating. But these minor issues should not distract from the enthusiastic recommendation. <br /> <br /> Is it worth seeing? In all senses. It is strongly recommended, whether you want a classic and influential work in the cinema or just a funny comedy.
