MPAA: Rated R for violence, language, nudity and short-term drug use. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> Today I saw Coonskin. This film is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight. After watching Fritz The Cat, I wanted to see more Baska films. I saw Cool World and thought it was mediocre, and I saw it. When it was first released, the film was very controversial. It was considered racist, and Al Sharpton wanted the film to be banned, he even held protests outside the theater where the film was The Game. The film was released only on VHS called "Street Fight". He is now considered a cult classic film, and such African-American celebrities as comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and rap group The Wu-Tang Clan They say that I liked this movie. I personally thought that Fritz The Cat was a much better movie, but it was also very nice. Worth watching fans of the movie Baska or Blaxploitation. The film mixes live action and animation, as in the movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I would prefer it in full animation, but what atever. The film begins with the Reverend and another man who runs to rescue his two friends from prison. While the prisoners are waiting, the elder tells the story of three people he knew. Then the film switches to the animation format, we see three black men who sold their house to this man. They decide to make names for themselves in Harlem. So, the leader, the black rabbit, kills a major player in Harlem, and he basically becomes a big shot. The film continues as the Italian mafia want it. The Mafia includes a godfather, his three homosexual sons and an Italian clown. Coonskin is an entertaining animated film that is worth seeing if you can find it.
