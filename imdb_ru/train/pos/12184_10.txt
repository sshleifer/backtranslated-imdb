In many of his films (“Citizen Kane”, “Confidential Report”, “Touch of Evil”), Orson Welles gave him the role of a violent man. In The Lady of Shanghai, this is the only time I see him as a victim. The role of the culprit, he gave it to Rita Hayworth, I think it was because he was in love with her. Therefore, it is an interesting film. But I also find the story excellent. The direction is brilliant, as usual with Wells: two scenes are especially brilliant: one in the aquarium and the last with mirrors. This film is brilliant. (10/10)
