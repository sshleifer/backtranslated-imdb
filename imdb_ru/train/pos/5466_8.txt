An excellent, pre-coded amoral tale with Barbara Stanwyk as recently inspired (by Nietzsche's writings!), To banish her sensitivity and exploit herself, use men to your advantage Not entirely fair to the German philosopher, but it is interesting that this was the year when Hitler came to power. Stanvik, even in this young version, is not very much for me, but she certainly performs well here, ever moving herself and the film forward. It shows not so much meat as one would expect, but a lot of risky situations, amazing jokes and insinuations. Great pleasure, if not a particularly attractive presentation of men, and I suppose, frankly, not a very attractive look at the gold digger. However, this is life!
