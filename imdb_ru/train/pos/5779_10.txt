To begin with, I did not even know about this show from year to year because of the Internet. I have never seen it on TV in my country, and many people usually don’t know about this show. It is a pity, because this is perhaps the most original and clever animation that I have seen in recent years. <br /> <br /> I don’t give out 10 points a lot, but this is one show that really deserves only 10 points. Although at first glance it may seem like a typical cartoon, but keep in mind that this is not a children's show. When the full story unfolds by itself, you know that this is a really deep storyline with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of history is largely based on spiritual animals, old Indian beliefs, which have been preserved for many years. This gives the show an original twist, which you can't often see in animated series. <br /> <br /> The overall design is also different. At times it is a bit like Spawn in terms of sand design, and sometimes it requires a more cartoony approach. I believe that David Faith, who also created and directed Cow and Chicken, was revived by one of the episodes of the show (just as he drew this episode in a comic book). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an incredible show, show that accepts various objects, such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something you should not miss. As you begin to look, you are likely to watch it to the end. One minor fact may be that the show uses less material from the comic, but this is not too annoying. The only question remains, where is the DVD ?!
