I lay back to watch “Read My Lips,” a plate of fries in front of me. The food was quickly forgotten when I was absorbed by the original and excellent thriller of the director and co-author of the film Jacques Audiiard. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuel Devos) is the secretary of a company that develops large construction projects. In fact, she has some important responsibilities that often fall on the secretaries, and she is capable and ambitious. And obsessed male hierarchy, which will exploit, but does not reward her. <br /> <br /> Carla is accumulating work faster than she can handle it, Carla is told to hire a secretary. Enter the ex-con man and general peacemaker Paul (Vincent Cassel). He lies about his skills and in fact has nothing that any legitimate enterprise may require. After Paul’s initial serious misunderstanding regarding Carla’s interest in him, they both became allies. A strange friendship begins. In a stunt that would make the real Karl the main contender for the “Apprentice,” she surpasses her selfish male opponent at work with the connivance of Paul. Get out of the opponent. <br /> <br /> Karla hardly hears without a hearing aid. With this, she hears almost normal. She turns off the hearing aid to isolate herself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people. She is also very lonely. A heroic make-up attempt was made to make it look simple, but it is really beautiful. She doesn't have a boyfriend. She looks after the child so that her friend has a connection (this is a French film). Worse and humiliating, she agrees with her friend's request that she hangs out somewhere, while this married friend has her lover in Carla's bed. Not good. <br /> <br /> When Carla and Paul get to know each other better, a subdued kidnapped side of a not-too-criminal criminal appears. By the way, there is another story about Paul’s relationship with his parole officer, which neatly complements the main plot and has a big surprise ending. <br /> <br /> “Reading my lips?” Genius Paul recognizes that Carla's ability to read lips even at a considerable distance is more than a funny trick in the living room, which she initially thinks. <br /> <br /> From there the caper develops. Enough said. <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are a real criminal pair of eccentrics. She wants love, but she also accepts money. He wants her, sort of, but the business must come before a possible erotic saturation. Together, Cassel and Devo are strong actors who very convincingly carry an unusual criminal story. <br /> <br /> Rent it or buy it, but if you enjoy a good crime story, you will choose "Read My Lips." And you may well want to watch it several times: yes. <br /> <br /> 9/10
