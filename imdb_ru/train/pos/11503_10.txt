Kolchak is just entertainment. Great stories and great cast, and nothing more than to weight it. Darren McGavin gives an energetic presentation that pulls the audience along with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnagge and Ruth McDevitt provide McGavin solid support, which most leading actors can only dream of. Some excellent guest stars add color and excitement to individual episodes - Erik Estrada in “The Legacy of Terror”, Phil Silvers in “Terror on the Heights”, Antonio Fargas in “Zombies” Carter create the "X-Files". Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
