I really enjoyed this episode, which was a big surprise, given the bad reputation it seems to have gained. From the point of view of pure writing, the “16 mm shrine” is an absolute pleasure, with a fantastic dialogue and character analysis typical of Stirling. In particular, I really enjoyed the philosophical indulgences of this episode, considering the themes of existence and reality, while comparing them with more psychological themes, such as denial, pride, and desire. The 16 mm Temple is an episode of how these ideas, based on the reluctance to accept change, could seemingly alienate a person from the rest of the constantly changing world. It is also a fantastic example of the cerebral twilight zone; one that explores the mind, not the world beyond. All these elements are perfectly combined with each other, creating provocative thoughts and an incredibly interesting 25 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, the episode is not without flaws, which mainly lie in Lupino and Leisen shoes. Ironically, I felt that Lupino was unconvincing, just a few scenes that can be considered unforgettable. This, of course, is an absolute disgrace, considering how well Sterling wrote her character. In addition, Laisen did not seem to know what to do with the majority of his characters, sometimes forcing them to stand on the set, doing almost nothing - which probably explains why Lupino played bad performances half the time. Fortunately, Balsam well hides many weak points, helping to at least buy out the show from an actor's point of view. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, if you are a fan of classic cinema and science fiction, this should not be as bad as it sometimes seems. In addition to the script I mentioned above, there is also a fantastic photo in this episode (it still amazes me that the series looks so good almost fifty years later!) And quite a decent set-design. In general, the “Sixteen-mm Shrine” is a great episode, and, above all, it will certainly make you think.
