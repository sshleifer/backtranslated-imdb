Now, for all cinematic lovers, this film may not rank high on your list of things to see. But if you know something about the development of the plot, the deep truth and intentions that this film (series) had, you would understand my enthusiasm <br /> <br /> Of course, the specifics of the film are the authorâ€™s visualization. what happens in the end. But the film is biblically accurate and justifiably "frightening" the audience to think about what could be. I am a Christian not because of this film, but because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. The film and the potential possibility that something similar to the circumstances described in it can surprisingly frighten someone and think about their actions and decisions. This is not a cheap attempt to scare people into believing in God, but rather a way to get your attention. <br /> <br /> As a Christian, I know that I will not be left behind, and thanks to films like this, I can look beyond the superficiality of entertainment, action, and budgeting of a film to appreciate the depth that a film has to offer. This is a film that you should not only see, but also feel with your heart and soul.
