This film is wonderful. The script, directing, acting is just fantastic. Very witty and smart script. The quality performances of the actors, Ellie Sheedy is strong, dynamic and amazingly quaint. Really original and heartbreakingly unpredictable. The scenes are full of fresh energy and truly talented production.
