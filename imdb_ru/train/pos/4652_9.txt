I think this film is well made and realistic. If you are used to watching Hollywood action films and use it as a standard for evaluating this film, you will definitely be disappointed. This film is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can create, and this is what raises it above the average action movie. I have no experience with the Swedish military, and therefore I cannot point out any mistakes in their actions. But since I saw the "creation" of superfluous, I am convinced that a lot has been done to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie that I recommend watching others. High-quality realistic storyline and film.
