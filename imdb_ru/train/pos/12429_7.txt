David Duchovny plays a major role in this film. Now, many people, having learned this fact, would not even bother to look at it. Very unfair, if not more. David made a name for himself in the X-Files and is a decent actor. Dr. Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug addicted doctor who has contracted abuse of office. By pure chance, he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie played a minor role in the role of Clara Gangster Mall. She demonstrates a solid game. Timothy Hutton, who plays Blossom, is gorgeous and deeply immersed in his character. The Spiritual itself is not as bad as many think, and in the end I would rate his performance as trustworthy. His familiar monotonous tone and straightness are present, but not too distract from the film.
