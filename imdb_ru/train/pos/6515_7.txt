I almost did not rent it because of all the bad comments, but did it anyway. I thought it was like the darkness that I also liked. The only part I hated about the dental ferry is the 2 red brothers at the gas station. They were funny, and the dialogue made me laugh, but it was not a comedy. It spoiled the movie a bit because it wasn’t necessary. The rest of the film was what a horror film or an unknown should be. The make-up was good, and I have seen much worse films than this. It was a simple story with a believable acting game. This is not the worst or most horrible movie, but I wasn’t ticked off and didn’t want a refund after watching it. There were previews of other films on the DVD that all look good and I’ll check them out.
