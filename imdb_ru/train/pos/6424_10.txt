As a child I remember how I was nine or ten years old, and I loved this film. It was all kinds of Bollywood action / comedy. This is an imitation of the Bad Boys, obviously! A whole change of characters, but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out of the window, and then the arrival of colorful villains who dance and sing! The scenes in the film are not revolutionary, but still amazing scenes. The film is really very funny and was the great comeback that Amitabh Bachchan needed. Govinda, as always, is a pearl, and this is probably his best work to date, he glitters as a side impact and provides the best comedy scenes available in Indian cinema. both funny and catchy .............. proves laughter when you least expect it ... Amitabh Bachan is surprisingly very funny and makes you laugh like "Bad Miya" .... his accent ... body language ..... brilliant ... <br /> <br /> "Assi are sensitive to nabab da daal" - the best song .............. Merry.
