This musical is clearly mixed, and none of the elements fit together, but somehow it is a pleasure. The plot contains some elements of Woodhouse's novel, but none of his merits, although he co-wrote the script. The songs, although charming, have nothing to do with this particular film and are unusually roughly crammed into the plot even by the standards of Oklahoma. Burns and Allen make their usual jokes pretty well, but he loses the tone of the rest of the movie by about forty IQ points. <br /> <br /> There are several highlights. Reginald Gardiner works well when he recalls that this is a walkie-talkie, and ceases to rob, like a silent actor. And there are a few fragments that only Woodhouse could write, although most of the film resembles the staging of one of the Hollywood meetings, which he later parodied.
