In all categories, this is the best movie I've ever seen. Forget about Hollywood - their films always suck - this is art! The story of Moon Child begins with Kay, a Japanese vampire who hates what he has become and lives in denial. His desire for final death leads him to Mallepu, where refugees from several Asian countries live. Here he meets Shaw, an orphan living on the street. <br /> <br /> From here, the film is an intense experience based on the visual and emotional part of the film. It has everything; you're laughing, you're crying, you're angry, excited, sad, happy ... Not a single movie touched me like this movie. And the actors are awesome - I have never heard anyone speak in many languages ​​without a strange sound. Many thanks to the editor for creating this masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> The last comment to this brilliant film is that Gackt (former singer of Malice Mizer) and Hyde (vocalist of L'Arc) were filmed. ~ en ~ ciel) in excellent roles, like Sho and Kay. I am amazed at how Gackt can change his way of speaking and acting depending on the age at which he acts. <br /> <br /> This is a must see. If you never watch a movie, watch “Child of the Moon”, “The Crow” (Brandon Lee) and the recently released masterpiece “Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children”. Of course, everything is in the original language!
