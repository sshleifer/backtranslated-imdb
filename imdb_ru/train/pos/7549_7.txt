A young cat tries to steal his brother's soul from death, but only gets half of it, and then has to go in search of adventure in order to get the second half ... or perhaps not. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I'm not sure what happens in this film, which is full of very strange, very surreal images, some of which can cause concern to parents (for example, cats cut off the part of the pig that travels with them and fry it like bacon, which all three eat). <br /> <br /> This is a very strange film that some people compare to Hello Kitty for acid, I think itâ€™s more like Hello Kitty from Dali. , (Of course, it is more lively than the Destino, which was directly based on his work). <br /> <br /> If you are tuned to a completely unusual film that will challenge your perception of things, watch this movie. Just be prepared for some very strange images that will forever remain in your memory. <br /> <br />
