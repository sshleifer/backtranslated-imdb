For my school humanitarian project, I chose human trafficking. After some research on the Internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching this, and I'm still thinking about it. All I can say is Wow. This is such a compelling story about a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patrick who is trying to save her. The end makes you hold your breath, and although it is not completely happy, it is very realistic. This is amazing and I recommend it to everyone! You really hang out with Holly and Patrick, and your heart is breaking for her and for what happens to her. I liked it so much, and now I want to know what will happen next!
