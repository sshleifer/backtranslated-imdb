Although “Stardust” seems like a fantastic film with a predictable ending and averages, this is certainly not the case. When I saw the movie, I knew it would be one of my favorite movies. And I was right. <br /> <br /> “Star dust” is more like a fairy tale than an adventure film. It has a magical "aura" from the beginning to the very end of the film. The storyline is well written and it keeps you on the edge of your place. As in any fairy tale, it has a certain morality. Therefore, we know in our hearts that the evil brothers will take not the throne, but an innocent boy, who manages to overcome all the obstacles and difficulties that he faces during his journey. We also know that true love is Yvain, not Victoria, a material girl, petty and manipulative. <br /> <br /> I have to give additional credits to Claire Danes. She literally shines in this film. Her eyes have this spark that fits perfectly into her character. In addition, she and Cox have a chemistry that makes the romance in the film even more noticeable. The rest of the cast is famous actors and actresses who, of course, make “Star Dust” an interesting and “high-profile” film. <br /> <br /> In general, the film “FANTASTIC” places are magical, the plot is interesting. I was very disappointed that the film was not nominated for more awards. I have to give at least 9/10 stars for this.
