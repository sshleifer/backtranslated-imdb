I love hands and brooms so much that I have to cry a thousand tears of joy every time I have the great pleasure of seeing it. I would also like to repeat the simple fact that I love him so much. Too many have spoken. I have 27 copies on video and I love them all equally. I also love everyone who loves it. I love you. My favorite scene is the dance scene on Portobello Road. I learned dance moves and practice them every day. I have some audio recordings when I sing a song. If someone can play the drums or the guitar, I think about creating a group of knobs and brooms for the crib. I hope to call her "pens." love me (Liz)
