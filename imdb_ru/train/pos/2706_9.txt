I saw this film at the Brussels International Film Festival. I also met the film director. I heard that Ed Wood wrote a story in 10 years! I am sure that he thought that he would become his masterpiece - his triumph. <br /> <br /> Well, if you take the film seriously (as Mr. Wood did), this is truly one of the worst films you've ever seen, and that's cool. The big joke “I woke up early on the day I died,” is that he does not even try to be a worthy movie. <br /> <br /> This makes the movie very, very good. The script is filled with nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. The role of Billy Zane is absolutely superb. You see, this is either high art ... or low trash. <br /> <br /> **** / *****
