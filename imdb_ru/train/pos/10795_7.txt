In general, the film was pretty good, a good story with lots of explosions and battle scenes, but Chuck Norris did almost nothing except defuse the bomb and shoot several characters. The film was very similar to the events of September 11: a terrorist who resembled bin Laden sent a video to the president (Urich) and threatened to blow it up. Judson Mills had several excellent roles in action, taking off the composition of Rashid and various drum roles, but Chuck Norris was not enough. Judson took over most of the action, leaving Joshua (Chuck) with Q on his computer. But, in general, it was realistic and not devoid of action, and was done only by Mr. Norris. I gave the film 7/10.
