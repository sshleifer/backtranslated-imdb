This is one compelling great fun and technically great movie! <br /> <br /> The film presents some of the most magnificent scenery you have ever seen in a 30s film, although it’s too obvious that they are sets, not real locations. Often, if a character falls or shakes a too aggressive pigtail, the whole set obviously moves. <br /> <br /> The best moments of the film were silent, more old-fashioned, rude moments. This shows that Rene Claire’s true heart was in a silent movie. General humor is really great in this film. Also, of course, the musical moments were more than wonderful. This is a really nice light and simple nice early French musical. Although the best moments are silent moments, it does not mean that the film is not filled with some wonderful humorous dialogue, which is very well represented by the main actors, who all seemed to me stage actors, who in this case worked extremely well for the film, its overall style and pleasant, not exciting atmosphere. Not surprisingly, it worked so well, since this film is actually based on a theatrical production by Georges Berr. <br /> <br /> This is really a technical film, in which there are some great innovative camera work, and some are really great. editing, which creates quick and enjoyable pleasant episodes. There is never a dull moment in this movie! <br /> <br /> Renée Claire was such an intelligent director who knew how to create and plan comic moments in films. It is a very creative film, which, despite its simplicity, is still felt as a completely original and thoughtfully created film that will never want to have fun. <br /> <br /> The last half hour is especially memorable fun, without spoiling too much, and this is truly one of the greatest as well as the most creative moments in early comedy filmmaking. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of really nice characters in the film, which, of course, are very stereotypical and stupid. and, obviously, were abandoned because of their appearance. All this adds a pleasant light comic atmosphere and the sharpness of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable movies you have ever seen! <br /> <br /> 8/10
