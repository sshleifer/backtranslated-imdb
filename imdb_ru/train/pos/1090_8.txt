Mr. Blandings is building his dream home. Although, judging by the size, the home today will be a dream apart. Nevertheless, Carey earned good money on advertising, although he had a diabolical time when he tried to come up with a slogan for the ham with the trademark Wham. <br /> <br /> What made this film so popular was the housing shortage in the years after World War II. Returning war veterans claimed their rights in accordance with the G.I. Bill of Rights, which included mortgage loans. The problem was that there were literally not enough houses to satisfy the demand. At about the same time that Eric Hodginsâ€™s book and film became so popular, Congress passed, and President Truman signed the Taft-Allender-Wagner Housing Act, which for the first time put the government in the housing sector. <br /> <br /> I had an uncle and an aunt who at the same time built their own house, into which they moved in the early 50s. Like Cary Grant and Mirna Loy, they had two daughters, and they wanted to get out of downtown Rochester. Their place was not as majestic as an eighteen-room Connecticut house, and yet they lived there for the rest of their lives, like Cary and Myrna, most likely. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was expensive, and costs just keep rising, threatening to send Carey to the cleaners. Carey and Myrna also invite Melvin Douglas to consult, as a rule, too late. In truth, he is very sweet to Mirna, and Carey knows this. <br /> <br /> The role of Mirna Loy is simply a continuation of Nora Charles. If you can imagine that Charles is leaving for his dacha, and Cary Grant has a headache with William Powell, the film will still work fine. Blandings builds your dream home is still working well as a comedy, because situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my uncle Walter and Aunt Kate, who have lived together in their dream home for over 40 years.
