The Matador is a witty, dark-haired and tense melodrama that rises above mediocrity thanks to two very exciting and serious performances by Pierce Brosnan, who has never been better than here, and always reliable Greg Kinnier, who has played his best role here since gay Jack Nicholson's neighbor in "As good as he gets." A big plus comes in writing. Clever and sometimes very unpleasant dialogue gives pleasure to Brosnan, and the slow friendship between these two different people is completely convincing. The story takes several unexpected turns and makes the viewer constantly guess where it will go next. <br /> <br /> The director’s good artistic touches, such as good use of music, clever editing and somewhat unorthodox cinematography, sometimes set a good tone for the film and for a long period of time you don’t quite know how to label the film. But it’s also thanks to a very well written script that keeps the viewer (me anyway) on the edge of his place.
