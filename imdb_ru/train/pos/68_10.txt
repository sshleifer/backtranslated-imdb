Why a stupid, boring, stupid overrated series of films, such as Star Wars, gets so much hype, but a truly amazing film like this one goes completely unnoticed ... beyond me ... This film really opens your eyes to the dark , anxious, sad and scary world in which we live ... <br /> <br /> Unlike the boring Elephant, this film is not among the films "just an ordinary day, until someone clicks on trigger ".. this film focuses more on what happens AFTER the event ... <br /> <br /> Dina, who plays She is very hot and very talented Erika Christensen, a happy and healthy student with excellent friends and a great life ... until ... on the day of the shooting she was injured in a headshot. Fortunately, she was not killed, but was seriously injured and forced to stay in hospital for some time, causing her to experience severe emotional pain, in addition to physical ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Alicia, who also plays very gorgeous and talented Bisi Phillips, nasty, cold-blooded, rebellious, antisocial goth girl who has no positive trait on her ... and she did not suffer when they shoot ... because, it turns out, she was a FRIEND with a gunner and knew that he was going to do what he did ... which leads her to the police station and ask a few questions .. When she refuses to tell the cops, if she knew that the shooting should have happened, they constantly come to her house to convince her to say something ... and she she still doesn’t do that, so the principal makes her attend the funeral of one of the dead students, and after she comes out of it ... the director decides that is enough and forces her to go visit Dinah in the hospital .. Of course she also refuses this, but the director says that if Alicia will not do this, the police will continue to try to get her to say something ... and therefore she actually goes to see her ... <br /> <br /> Lonely, injured, and physically and emotionally wounded, Dina is more than happy Someone visits her, but, of course, Alicia is all, BUT glad to see her .. Dina tries to give her a friendly welcome, but, of course, Alicia responds only with sharp and offensive comments and a sharp statement about how she is here because they force her and they are not going to be friends with her at all. But sooner or later, this intention will change ... (and that's all I'll say :) This is really one of the most touching films in the entire history, as well as one of the darkest and most exciting ... Actually, I think that I would connect it with “American History X” as equally disturbing and simultaneously moving ... <br /> <br /> ATTENTION: Watch this film at your own risk !! It contains VERY graphic scenes and images! EXCELLENT and criminally underrated film! I am so ashamed that I am the only one who knows about this!
