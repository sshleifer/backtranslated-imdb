I really found this film "interesting"; finally one is worth my time to look and rent. This is true ... some scenes were filled with emotionality, shouts, etc. But what film does not emphasize his agenda, genre or “ax to grind”? Almost nothing! What surprised me was that I read a review made by reviewer S.Fran on another review site, but found his negative review instead of a more accurate description of his “own” review of the film; not from the movie at all. Anyone who watches this movie will realize that it’s great to recommend to family and friends; no chase yes !! Being "in" an Italian family, I can fully relate to the environment depicted on the screen. There are tear pieces in the movie. This is what real life can be in such an environment. Good film.
