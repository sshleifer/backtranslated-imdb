"La Maman et la Putain" should be watched as a film that is associated both with the time when it was released (after 68), and with the eternal in many ways. True, the actors do not "act" ... True, they talk a lot ... But what they are talking about is what makes life worthy of life ... or death. The very long monologue spoken by Francoise Lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and touching text ever written about femininity, masculinity and love. It is difficult to accurately translate though. This film is a statement about how difficult it is to be a man and a woman (or two women in this case). And IMHO Jean-Pierre Leodot - one of the greatest French actors.
