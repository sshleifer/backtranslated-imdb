Things are a rarity of rarities, a film about ideas. Many films present a vision of the future, but few try to show us how this future arose. The first part of the film, when war comes to every city, is short but powerful. (Ironically, in the year of its release, viewers laughed at reports that enemy aircraft attacked England - peace was in full swing. Wells's prediction was confirmed too early.) effective. Explanatory headlines strongly resemble the graphic design of a German expressionist. The artistic director was the great William Cameron Menzies, and his sets of the ruins of Everytown are among his best works. Margaret Scott is very seductive as the leader's mistress. Everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design. The acting in the history of the 21st century is not convincing - perhaps it was an unsuccessful attempt to oppose the technocratic rationality of this time to the barbarism of 1970. Unfortunately, model work representing angry mobs rushing along elevated aisles is ridiculously bad and could have been done much better, even with the technology of the 30s. This is especially annoying since the scenes of the giant plane are very convincing. This is redeemed by Raymond Massey's magnificent speech, which completes the film - rarely the ideal of scientific progress expressed so well. The last question Massey is now more relevant than ever, in an era of heavily curtailed manned space flights. The scene is supported by the touching music of Sir Arthur Bliss, whose name I proudly share. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the VHS versions of this film are absolutely terrible with serious technical problems. Most versions have edited a rather interesting installation of futuristic workers and machines, which takes us from 1970 to 2038. I hope a good movie exists from the whole movie.
