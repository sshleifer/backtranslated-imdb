Although I bought a DVD when it first came out, and watched it several times, I never wrote a review. <br /> <br /> I liked it when I first saw it, and I still love it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that he never earned enough money to motivate anyone to make a sequel. I have to assume that QT still controls the rights, but after “Kill Bill”, if he makes a film that is as true to comics and books as “My name is modesty”, with another tough female role, anyone who is not familiar with character, see it as a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychological anticipation rather than action movies. <br /> <br /> The pulling of the will between Modesty and Miklos is very true to the source material and is tense, tense and exciting for anyone who should not have blood and explosions. Alexandra played well, as O'Donnell's character would have taken control of the situation. <br /> <br /> I find this especially in front of the curve after the much-needed reboots of Batman and James Bond. After two gloomy early attempts, although not so widely known to the general public, this is indeed a reboot of the character of Modesty, and it’s very sad that probably no more films about her will be made.
