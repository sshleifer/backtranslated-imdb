This film revolves around Japanese culture in the same way as in the life of a modern Japanese family. For those who are over 7 (especially in public), physical contact is not approved, so it all bows, and does not embrace, even if you are close friends / relatives. Ballroom dancing implies that you embrace someone, and this is also in public! However, ballroom dancing (very) is very popular. People who practice ballroom dancing in Japan are like nudists in the west ... they would like more than they do, but are overwhelmed by culture. A delightful family movie that any amateur dancer could enjoy only for dance episodes. I understand that it was more popular than the Titanic in Japan. I think the Japanese are the same as all of us - they also like to hug.
