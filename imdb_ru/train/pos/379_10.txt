1985 was a good year for films - maybe even wonderful - but this one, missed in the gong, largely convinced fans that Oscar is more than a hood for good party members. <br /> <br /> 11 nominations and not a single name: such was the contempt of the Academy for one of their greatest directors; and the one who had to wait another 8 years before any prejudice prevented them from handing him a statue before allowing them to give him 7 for the Schindler List, which may not be so good (and I'm half Polish). br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, Schindler was a classic. And I'm not knocking out of Africa (which won this year); but, in my opinion, it was the class behind it: the epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and I'm not a big fan. <br /> <br /> It may have been music (excellent), or cinema (gorgeous), but rather simply acting: Whoopi, who proved to us all that she was much more than a comedian; Danny Glover, whom I had never heard of before; and, of course, Oprah. <br /> <br /> Everything else is history; but at the time: who knew?
