Weapons explode, buildings explode, cars crash, and this is only the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This action movie with a former CIA con artist who doesn't seem to die, no matter how many times he shoots (hence the name), is pretty decent. <br /> <br /> Steep and toothy Gary Busey, who is usually filmed as a villain in such films, has his usual crazy charm, but a little more restrained: in the end, he carries the whole show. This does not mean that there are not so many amazing roles, including William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, R.G. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Talmus Rasoulala and several other forgotten actors. <br /> <br /> There are enough smaller sequences of actions to keep the whole story: Buzie must release a group of “abducted” US military elites and return the high-tech “supertank” (an ordinary tank with a cheesy sign - pasted on top) back to the States . <br /> <br /> But does America deserve this killing machine more than the bad guys? This question, of course, is asked, as in any film dedicated to the CIA ... but without any preaching.
