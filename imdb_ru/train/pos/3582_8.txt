Here is another 80s movie that most people just don’t know about. This slow, picturesque (love shots of Montana’s landscapes are breathtaking and reminds me of Costner’s recent Open Performance, which also featured Robert Duval), and the emotionally rich film — an ideal type of film that can be watched late at night when you can’t sleep or sluggish sunday. Those who are in the right mood will receive a close look at the grief of one family and how they get together after the younger son accidentally shot and killed the eldest son during the hunt. The performances are all top notch and quietly nuanced. Glenn Close, Robert Duvall and Wilford Brimley perform well in their performances, as do all the supporting players and young actors. I especially liked how director Cain (who, unfortunately, hasn’t released anything noticeable since then except the first Young Guns) gives us a little glimpse into everyone’s personal grief. We not only see how death affects the younger brother or parents, but also the bewildered middle sister, the wayward uncle, his crazy wife and girlfriend of a dead teenager. What we essentially get here is the response of the Midwest to the villagers to “Ordinary People.” There are also shades of David Lynch's “Direct Story” in some features of the Midwest morality of the people depicted here, as well as in the lovingly pursuing pictures of the farmland they inhabit. This is one of the best and more realistic "tear" people of the era, and a nice little find for you, high-quality movie hunters.
