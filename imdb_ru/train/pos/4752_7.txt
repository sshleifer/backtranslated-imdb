Fay is a story about a Martian attempt to colonize the Earth. (It must be very bad on Mars.) Two state soldiers are investigating the scene of the UFO crash. Everything that has landed is buried beneath the ice by the Tracy pond, but there are traces in the snow leading to a nearby diner. <br /> <br /> The diner had no customers since eleven o'clock in the morning. Now there are a bunch of bus passengers sitting, waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge. The bus driver insists that there were six passengers on board, although he did not notice who they were. The problem is that now seven people are waiting for the resumption of travel. One of them is a foreigner, but which one? They are all suspicious. Of course, there is a crazy old man (Jack Elam) who seems to be smart. There is a raging businessman who must get to Boston (John Hoyt). Young couple on honeymoon. (Great performance by her husband, Ron Kipling.) With the exception of couples, no one else noticed. And even couples are suspicious of each other. The bride to her new husband: "I could swear that you have a mole on your chin." The story continues cheerfully, but slightly scary - the phone rings for no reason, the light turns on and off, the jukebox automatically turns on - and nothing should be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This is a very pleasant game for the ensemble, and the climatic revelation is worth it. There is no noticeable "depth." This is not a moral message that people who are friends are disguised as normal citizens. This is not a warning, just a fairy tale that distracts and cheers. <br /> <br /> I always like when it's on. It is especially interesting to see John Hoyt an irritable and impatient businessman, knowing that in 1954 he was a Roman senator who led the murder of Julius Caesar in the MGM version of Shakespeare's play. And here he is - with three hands. <br /> <br /> Oops.
