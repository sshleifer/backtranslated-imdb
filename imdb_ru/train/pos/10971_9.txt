Gray Gardens are shocking, funny, sad and fascinating. I watched in amazement as Edits Jr. and the elder sparred and spoke, recalling their past. Their existence in a dilapidated mansion (which they have not left for more than fifteen years) is both a comedy and a tragedy. This film you will not soon forget.
