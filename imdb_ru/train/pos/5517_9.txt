Che: Part One was a fascinating experiment that not only told a very interesting story, but also tried to do something else with the genre of "biopic". She: Part two is a great culmination of this experiment. <br /> <br /> In this film there are all the same attributes, starting with the first, from extraordinary performances (especially from Benicio del Toro) to brilliant director Stephen Soderberga, not forgetting his intention to break with the usual rules from biopik. what I admire from Soderberg's experiments ... they always try to do something unusual and unusual, and in most cases they succeed. <br /> <br /> The last message from this film is perfect, and it includes everything that we have. They told me about the life of Che Hervar. The only flaw I discovered in Che: Part Two is that some parts felt a little irrelevant. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I give Che: Part Two is very enthusiastic recommendations, because as the first, this is a bold and fascinating experiment an element that challenges the viewer and leaves us to think.
