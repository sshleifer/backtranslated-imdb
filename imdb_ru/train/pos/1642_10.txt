The film has not seen since its release, but he was remembered. The performances of Rip Torn and Kunchy Farrell were great, the picture is excellent, the touching storyline and everything else in it was at the highest level. Nevertheless, it seems that this was largely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Perhaps because the UK is a strange market for this, but I have not seen the movie on television or video, which is sad. Was he more successful in the USA, where he can rightly be considered a fairly accurate historical drama? <br /> <br /> Always consider that 50% of a good movie is music, and although I’m not sure that the title of the title was simple, it’s a touching solo of the clarinet “What is our friend in Jesus”. Then the film refuted it! Am I right or not?
