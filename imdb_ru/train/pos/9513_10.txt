Great gangster movie. Sam Mendez shot this beautiful film, demonstrating yet another camaraderie of father and son. A brilliant cast, led by Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan), did an amazing job. Great acting them again. He is an acting legend. Cast with Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig. Casting is too good. The plot is pretty good. You will love the movie. Excellent gangster image of the 1930s. Put in the 1930s, it will certainly stand out as the zenith of all the gangster films of that era. The soundtrack is pretty good for a movie. A great movie showing what a father does to protect his son. The way is undervalued for my taste. Honored fully deserved 10.
