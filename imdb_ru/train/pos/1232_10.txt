Very funny movie. The classic funny movie Eddie Murphy 80s. I saw when I was a kid, and I have a good memory. The classic irony of Murphy does not fail, the film is funny, well done. In the 80s, Murphy shot a lot of militants who were a way for him to joke about everything that was dangerous. The result can be assessed only by some, but the film has changed from 1986 to the present. The atmosphere for the film of that time is good, and the special effects are good for the film of that period. A good film to see and enjoy the appreciation of the taste of the ironic Murphy, the actor who recently disappeared. The final part is an anthology, a handsome actor who plays the role of a Tibetan monk. That's all.
