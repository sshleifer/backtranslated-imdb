Some critics found this film grim, but for me it was good enough mood and optimism to overcome this impression. For example, the quiet positive and enduring character of her daughter remains the focus of the film, often balancing the unfortunate aspects of the plot and plot. <br /> <br /> The film is full of original ideas and characters, and the final result is not predictable: I felt that he could go in any direction. <br /> <br /> By the way, many of the reviews I read mention the effective use of black and white, but the imprint I saw, shown on the SBS TV network here in Australia, was in full color. <br /> <br />
