“Cry in the Dark” is a masterful work of cinema, haunting and incredibly challenging. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who in 1980 witnessed a terrible spectacle, when she saw her 3-month-old baby being brutally taken from their family tents when he breaks camp in the Australian outback. Azaria (the child) was never seen again, and the result of her terrible disappearance caused real life riot around the world. Meryl Streep is perfectly right about the role of Lindy, as always. But the only thing that helps "Creek in the dark" never fall, this is a brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate look at this strange case, tears in his eyes. The idea is nothing but horror, and after that you are persecuted, but also inspired.
