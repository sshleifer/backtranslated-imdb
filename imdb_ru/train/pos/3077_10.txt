I missed the whole season of the show and started watching it on the ABC website in the summer of 2007. I am absolutely crazy about the show. I think the whole cast is great. This is one of my favorite shows. I just checked out the ABC program this fall and didn't see it in the schedule. This is really sad. I hope they bring it back ... maybe they wait until Bridget Moynahan gives birth to a child? Or is it just my wishful thinking? <br /> <br /> I have read some of the comments posted on the show, and I see so many vivid comments similar to mine. Of course, I hope that ABC will reconsider its decision, or, I hope, another station will accept it.
