You will notice the stars that I gave this BIG film that “... before you see it for the first time” is implied. I had never heard of this film before and I didn’t see it by chance just because this week (and the last) was very slow, but not too successful. I'm not sure how this film slipped past me - I love Lucy Liu, and Jeremy Northham is great too. However, it was. <br /> <br /> This film is a great example of what to do if you don’t have a big budget. It contained only the right amount of plot and dialogue to make it very interesting and to keep the viewer in the dark; enough. The whole film is you (the viewer), trying to figure out the plots of the many turns. I would give this movie 10/10, however, some shots looked rather false. I don’t mind this film, but I don’t think it deserves a perfect result. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think she is underestimated as a serious talent. Ignoring her beauty (which is difficult), she really takes her roles seriously and does not depend on her appearance to lead her through scenes of sophisticated emotions. And it may seem cold and even lifeless if necessary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam, at first glance, feels pretty good, like a pretty corporate rat, ready to run through any maze to prove himself. However, as it changes throughout the entire film, it's like day and night. I know that some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law, or other applicants to become the next James Bond, will hate me for it, but the North will / may / must correspond to this score. He is courteous and cultural. He has excellent posture and Bond voice. I think that he, too, can be cold, if the situation requires it, and quite mundane. <br /> <br /> A great movie, and definitely this movie buff recommends watching it at least once, if you like corporate spy movies.
