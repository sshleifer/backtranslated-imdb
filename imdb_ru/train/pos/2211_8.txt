I do not watch a lot of TVs, except for "Office", "Weeds", "Entourage" and "Soup E!". I think I spend this show in good company. <br /> <br /> I love the amazing pop culture review this show gives. The soup also helps me to be aware of what people in the office refer to when they talk about Sanjaye or Heidi Monteg (sp?). <br /> <br /> The best part is that Soup shows clips covering these moments. the shows, which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments (oh well, most people are addicted to watching American Idol because of the strange show that is listening), which is why most people claim to watch. And that means I don’t have to suffer from the other 98% of these talk shows or shocked talk shows, in one piece of “funny” or “shock.” In my opinion, the only reason Soup doesn’t get 10 points is that the sketches aren’t that funny, and in even more rare cases the comments don’t always meet the requirements. But not all of them can be at home, if this is so, then Soup will not be on E! <br /> <br /> Joel’s acumen and Soup’s writing team (including McHale) are doing a great show. I enjoy the laughs and comments from the film crew. Even when they are clearly obvious, occasionally mocking a polite laugh, it's fun, because it is violent. They are clearly ironic. And this is part of what makes this show fun.
