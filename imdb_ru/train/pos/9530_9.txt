Konrad Hall came out with a bang. The great photographer ended his famous career in this film before continuing. He was proud of himself, as it is one of the most beautiful crime films you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Of course, acting is not bad if Tom Hanks and Paul Newman play the main roles! The number of actions here is also correct: not too much; not so little. <br /> <br /> None of the characters here are, frankly, “good guys,” since Hanks is a professional killer for the city boss, Newman. The only redeeming quality of Hanks is that he does not want his little son to plant such a murderer as he, although he does teach him how to be an escape in looting! Yes? <br /> <br /> No matter how good the acting game is, and what an interesting story, the real star of this film is the cinematographer Hall, who paints a scene behind a beautiful scene with the help of his lens. His work is awesome.
