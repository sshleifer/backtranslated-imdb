This is a strange film that the British are doing so well. Low cameo roles, well performed. The story is a little bit weak, recently widowed Judy Dench decides to gather in the group “blond bombs” all (and almost all) women's groups that performed during the war in London. Obligatory son / daughter who thinks she has become small. I liked the way the film allows young people to see that they have no monopoly on feelings, love, and even lust! That "old wrinkles" can laugh too. Judi Dench, as always, was gorgeous, too bad we didn't. to see more blond bombs, the end was a bit hasty, as I thought. I kept thinking, watching how David Jason could have made Patrick even better than Ian Holm, although he was quite adequate as a “transvestite” drummer. In general , fun movie, which is worth it to spend the night with the girls :)
