The premiere of this show on the cable TV channel "Comedy Central" in the United States. He was cut to death and out of order. It was sad for the audience that it had to attract, it did not and fell into the background. Fortunately, at the same time, my cable company became digital, and I received the BBC. Thank God, because I saw the "League of gentlemen" in order, complete and uncut. <br /> <br /> Gentlemen League troupe with the British Monty Python Flying Circus and the Canadian Children in the Hall. But ... a warning. <br /> <br /> "League of gentlemen," although one step ahead. It is not only about dressing in dredges and stir up cultural ills, it goes deeper and much, much darker. I can say to many of you now - it will offend certain groups of people, it will piss off others. But remember, this is the only comedy ... dark, dark comedy. If this is not your thing, do not look. If you think that you KNOW a dark comedy, watch it - if you get angry and upset, it means that you do not quite know DARK COMEDY. <br /> <br /> These guys did everything right and right on the button. They are great, they are excellent, and I enjoyed every character creation. There is a full story that is told here from the first episode to the end. You can not watch this episode at a time, Willy Nilly, this is one of the charms of this series. Look in order. See how creative, stylish and deeply excited these guys are. No one and nothing goes beyond. This, my dear, is "dark humor." Bravo!
