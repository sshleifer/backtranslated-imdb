"Iphigenia" is a great achievement of Michael Kakoyannis. This workshop is masterfully adapted for the screen and brought to life by a wonderful actor. Kakoyanis achieved the impossible. He managed to remove the Greek tragedy on the screens without losing its effectiveness and significance. In this he is helped by the star Greek composition. Newcomer Tatyana Papamoshu is extremely impressive, as if it is. Equally impressive is Irene Pappas, who, although she sometimes seems excessive, is very realistic. Beautiful Greek film, perfectly adapted and filmed by director Michael Kakoyanis, with a magnificent score of Mikis Theodorakis, perfect for any scene. <br /> <br /> P.S. Rumors say that the film has lost the best film in a foreign language Oscar by only 1 vote !!!
