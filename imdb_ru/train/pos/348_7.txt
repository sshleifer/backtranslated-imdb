These photos, slashers have long been sold, but it is very fun. <br /> <br /> Valentines themselves are witty and well thought out. <br /> <br /> There is one “Peach” in the film. the lines ... "He is not an Angel ...." when he really is an Angel !!! Watching Buffy's repeated performances will never be the same! <br /> <br /> The cast is an amazing demonstration of young talents, but the story does not give them enough real depth. Denise Richards on the set of the DVD seemed to think that the girls on the set were well connected with each other, and it would create a feeling that you sympathize with their characters. I'm sorry but there is no! <br /> <br /> The direction is very good, you can show very little actual blood, and rely on an imaginary threat. Much can be said about this manner in which Miss Richards and Hagel do not take off their clothes ... :-( <br /> <br /> In fact, the main directorial plus is to “borrow” various other ideas from previous slashers. Psycho shower scene - a tribute, along with the "disguise" of Halloween. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, killing someone hiding in the body pack is quite original !!! <br /> <br /> Easy viewing, not very scary, but a few good leap moments. If it was a choice between “Hole” and this, choose “Hole.” Slasher had its day, and it's just another slasher. Very good slasher, but nothing revolutionary !!!
