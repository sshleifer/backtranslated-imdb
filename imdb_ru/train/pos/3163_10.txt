As a typical day begins in Point Place, Wisconsin ... <br /> <br /> First of all, Red, the tyrannical father of the Forman family and a World War II veteran, sits at the kitchen table and reads his newspaper while his delighted wife Kitty serves breakfast. Then comes their skinny son, Eric, he also sits at the table, and his father begins his daily yells, usually involving Eric's leg behind, if (specify the reason here). If his unintelligible sister with angelic face Laurie is at home, she comes, then Red stops screaming and speaks kindly to her, making Eric feel out of the family. <br /> <br /> Once this daily (painful) ritual, Eric rushes to the basement where all his friends are already hanging out. And when we see them, it becomes obvious that Eric and his red-haired tomboy, the neighbor and childhood friend Donna Pinciotti are the soundest people around. Meet Stephen Hyde, a conspiracy theorist who hates disco and doesn’t care much about what is going on until he is funny to look at; Michael Kelso, the type of guy who thinks that he will outlive his life only because of his appearance and that carrots grow on trees; Jackie Burckhardt, who considers herself the most beautiful girl of all, is spoiled by a rich father and, of course, a cheerleader; and Fez, a naive but worried foreigner who loves sweets and can't keep a secret. At first, they just hang out, gossip and make fun of Kelso, but then they all sit in a circle and let the real fun begin ... before they go to do something that they later regret. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Red comes out and meets the strange parents of Donna, Bob and Midge. He is rude, but they do not mind, because they think he is joking. Somewhere around Leo, an aging hippie who is constantly confused and plays with words without even noticing it. <br /> <br /> Have you imagined a seemingly peaceful neighborhood with all these amazing characters? Of course, the majority seems to be “cliché”, but the show takes the cliché to a new level. Now add some of the most evil plot lines the sitcom has to offer, sit down and enjoy one of the best television shows ever. One that never does the same thing twice, and which, compared to most comedy shows, which are “cute funny”, is purely hysterical. If you are hooked, do not let this show let you go. Take a bite to eat again and again, and, dude, you will see the sitcom genre from a completely new perspective.
