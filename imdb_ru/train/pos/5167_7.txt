I have to say that the worst part of the movie was the first half hour. I was really confused by who is who. For example, the character of Bill Paxon had long hair and was wearing a jacket. Then, when all the men arrived at the camp, it turned out that there was a character that looked like Bill Paxon, but not like that. I said, where is Bill Paxon? Then there was a guy with his girlfriend. He said she was 21 years old. This was to be the 20-year-old reunion of the most unforgettable camp director (Alan Arkin). Later the same girl talked and talked about her camp experience. It did not make sense. She would be one year old. However, the film turned out to be pretty good. Kevin Pollack was a good guy who was always teased. One guy was a complete daffodil and lost his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interesting as the director of an old-style camp who admits that he has lost touch with modern youth. The best part is that none of the adult vacationers had any success in their lives. None of them had a very good career. It seemed like a very real life. The film was compared with the "Big Cold." In a sense, it was not as exciting as Big Chill, but it was much more realistic. So, although the beginning did not promise, the film eventually turned into a pretty good one.
