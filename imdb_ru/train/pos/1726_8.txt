Reflecting on the Great Escape, I let my mind go back to this little gem of a film from my childhood. I read and re-read the autobiographical novel of 1949 that inspired him, and when it came to the only cinema (we never used that word in fact) in the city that showed “foreign” films, I was the first in line to buy my ticket. <br /> <br /> When someone was brought up in newsreels and propaganda films of wartime during the Second World War, I was very interested in studying the realities of this conflict, which is reflected in the memoirs and stories of people who were there personally, Later it covered a keen willingness over the years to buy any book on the subject and, ultimately, read the equally compelling novels of Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque, which provided even deeper sensitivities. Versions of the film, however, differed from this in that they rarely delivered goods. <br /> <br /> Black and white film has never been serviced as well as in those years. I have never seen the tech-color version of the war, which seems as genuine as the deep maniacs from films like The Wooden Horse. If it is true that we are destined to always be captive images of our childhood, then I will admit it freely. <br /> <br /> And there will never be another like Lev Genn as the symbolic hero of the British war on tape. Even Sir Alec.
