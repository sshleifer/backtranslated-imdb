You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, lately, he constantly shoots himself in the leg with all these stupid comedies that he shot in this decade (perhaps, except for “Death Smouty”, which bombed when she came out, but now classic). The dramas he has done lately were fantastic, especially “Insomnia” and “One Hour Photo”. The Night Listener, despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release, is one of his best works. <br /> <br /> This is a very scary story, although there is no serial killer or anyone else in it. which is physically dangerous in this regard. The concept of the film is based on actual fraud, which has not yet been officially confirmed. In high school, I read the autobiography of a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered terrible violence and as a result fell ill with AIDS. I was moved by the story until I read reports on the Internet that Johnson did not really exist. When I watched this movie, confused feelings surfaced in my mind that Robin Williams so brilliantly portrayed. <br /> <br /> Tony Collett probably also demonstrates his best dramatic qualities as a sociopathic “caretaker.” Her role was far from those that she had in films such as Little Miss Sunshine. There were even times when she looked into the camera, where I thought she was looking right at me. It takes a good actress to play such a role, and it is this understated (but well proven) role that makes Tony Collett, probably one of the best actresses of this generation, who was not even nominated for an Oscar (as of 2008). It is incredible that in this world there is at least one woman, and this is also scary. <br /> <br /> This is a good dark movie that I highly recommend. Be prepared to be unsolved, because this film leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.
