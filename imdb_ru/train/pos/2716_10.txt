Everything I remember about it was excellent ... a great cast with Sam Waterston and George Innes (before he became more familiar with the American audience) .... great scripts that only English can do - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert Mysteries of Campion type, but with a highlight of Jules Verne. It seems like MacGyver would have been in England 80 years ago ... at the very beginning of the scientific and technical revolution of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> I often wondered if it was not the creators of MacGyver who saw these shows. MacGyver first went on the air in about 3 years. <br /> <br /> I still have 1 episode on a badly damaged tape.
