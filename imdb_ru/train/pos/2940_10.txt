The first time I stumbled upon Delirius, I just heard it. I listened to the whole comedy performance and never in my life I laughed like that. Eddie’s ability to draw funny pictures in our minds and imitate them is captivating. When I finally saw him perform this act, I had to have it. Eddie Murphy's performance on “Delirius” shows his genius! Since this is the new millennium, his actions in 1983 are as funny today as they were then. My parents loved it like teenagers, and I (eighteen) love it too. From this point on, I had to watch other Murphy films, such as Coming to America and the Night of Harlem. There will be no other comedian like Eddie.
