Wow. Something amazing. Despite the shortcomings, it is much better than I expected. <br /> <br /> The brand-new Arcturus spacecraft, with approximately 3,000 passengers, is on the last days of its 16-day trip to Jupiter. Without warning, the ship Cerebral (central computer) gives the alarm and orders everyone to evacuate. <br /> <br /> Soon only a few people remained, including one of the ship astrogators (Penny), the captain (Cary) and the director of the shipping line (Kenyon). <br /> It turns out that the alarm was false, and that the main brain acts <br /> <br /> randomly. The remaining passengers and crew members must leave the ship and <br /> <br /> avoid personal conflicts in order to survive. <br /> <br /> The film starts very well. Opening ads are a very nice touch. There are obvious parallels since 2001: A Space Odyssey and the historic fall of Titanic. From time to time the film slows down and has problems with rhythm, but is usually well made and works well.
