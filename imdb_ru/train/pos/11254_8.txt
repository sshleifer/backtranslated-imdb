I have not seen this mini-series for a long time, and I am pleased to announce that its memorable virtues have stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Most of the components of the “Ideal Spy”, an adaptation of the best LeCarre novel, in my opinion, are the main ones. Outstanding aspects of this are the musical score and masterful script, the last of which was written by Arthur Hopkraft, who, I believe, was also the screenwriter for “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” with Alec Guinness a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Actors are mostly very good, some are great, such as Jack the Brotherhood of Alan Howard and Ricky Pim Ray McAully. Peter Egan is fascinating to watch, because his face changes with every angle of the camera. The time and influence on the appearance of the characters is very plausible. So much so that I wondered how old Peter Egan was at the time of filming. The only impetus comes after the character of Magnus Pym passes from the very capable hands of a young actor named Benedict Taylor to the hands of the noticeably too old Peter Egan, who has just left Oxford. But this is an insignificant and unimportant seam as a whole. <br /> <br /> Egan is hard to be convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic, and he needs to be emotionally upset, that is, to cry. None of the actors are experiencing in these moments very easily, except for the wonderful Francis Tomelty, who plays Peggy Wentworth for all that she has, and easily steals the episode. <br /> <br /> Jane Booker annoys Mary Pim. She has a piece of character under her skin, but often shows amateurish irritability, which reduces her like a tough diplomatic housewife, which is Mary Pym. Rüdiger Weigang is great as Axel, funny, ironic and ingenious. I also enjoyed Sarah Badel’s camp turn as a baroness. <br /> <br /> The British look at Americans is pronounced in some insanely funny scenes. When the Yankees arrived abroad to talk to Bo Brummell (head of MI6), the American contingent is portrayed as empty-headed jesters, who seem to have memorized many long vocabulary words and richly spiced them with American jargon and psycho. Great British contempt. <br /> <br /> Humor and sadness are subtly mixed. LeCarr is able to mix diverse elements in his stories, and Hopkraft brilliantly captured the melancholic, but brooding atmosphere of the original. <br /> <br /> Not an ideal production (what is it?) And yet the best of LeCarré devices to achieve cinema or television so far. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended to all fans of spyware thrillers, and especially to fans of LeCarré. The DVD is available from Acorn.
