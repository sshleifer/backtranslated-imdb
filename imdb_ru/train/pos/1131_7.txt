This is a really funny movie. One of those whom you can sit and mindlessly watch as the plot becomes more and more distorted; more and more funny. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (at its best), Kevin Klein, Elizabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr. If you have ever watched a soap opera and thought, “How the hell did they come up with this idea?”, You will love this movie. I have seen it several times; and every time I watch it, the more I appreciate the humor, the more I realize how good it really is. Do not expect the quality of an Oscar. This is a fun movie for fun, and not some kind of clever attempt to find "the person inside the person", etc. Sit down, relax and laugh.
