Fans of the HBO series “Tales from a Crypt” will love this episode of MOH. Those who know the main archetypical stories on which most of the classic EU comics were based will immediately recognize this. <br /> <br /> Underestimated indie favorite Martin Donovan (also a great writer who co-wrote the scripts for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BERC HER) is the type of guy whose appearance can go in any direction. He could play a really nice guy next door if he didn't understand him, or he could play the same role with a terrible tinge of corrosive negligence. In the case of “THE RIGHT TO DIE”, he uses the latter approach, and it definitely works. <br /> <br /> Donovan is a doctor who recently had an affair with his dissolute desk (Robin Sydney), much to the displeasure of his inconsolable, implacable spouse of the Abbey (Julia Anderson). When the two of them get into a terrible car accident, when they return from an unsuccessful “make-up” weekend, and she burned terribly in fire, he does not want to put a plug on her, not without some enthusiastic push from his even more sloppy advocate and best friend , nowadays looking worse for wear.) <br /> <br /> But the Abbey never gave up without a fight, and this is the theme of the episode from the EU. So-called husbands - and wives - have always been the favorite subject of the genre for some creepy (and OOKY) supernatural frauds, and this case is definitely not an exception. For that matter, Bill Gaines giggles somewhere in his mausoleum in an increased ratio of sex and blood. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the fact that in the original script by John Esposito the angle of adultery is small. twist. While you are watching, you do not understand that you know only half of the story, until you reach the end ... (think THAT FALSE TO SPEAK with a lot of courage and lawnongs, and you are there.) <br /> <br /> Not bad effort, but not the best of all. At the very least, Rob Schmidt shows this or that touch in a certain direction, especially in the scene that turns cell phone messaging into a truly terrifying experience! As in most episodes of the Ministry of Health, the theme of stratification and dismemberment prevails this season, so the extremely squeamish need is not needed here.
