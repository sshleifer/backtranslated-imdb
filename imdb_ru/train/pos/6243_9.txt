film about the cruelty of this world. I found it liberating, as only truth can be. It also contains some pretty funny bits. Some acting games are unusual, for example, Maria Hofshtetter. The director tried to portray life as realistic as possible, succeeding. Connectedly, sex scenes are explicit and no more fake than scenes from a hard movie. Although I hardly understood the proposal, I found the vision of the film in the original language with subtitles much more useful, because with half the dubbing the big work of actors is lost. The character's voice, played by Maria Hofshtetter, is especially difficult to reproduce with the help of an understudy. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie
