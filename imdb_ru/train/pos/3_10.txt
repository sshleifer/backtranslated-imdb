“The whole world is a stage, and people are actors in it” or something like that. Who the hell said that the theater stopped at the pit of the orchestra - or even at the entrance to the theater? Why the audience does not participate in theatrical experience, including the plot itself? <br /> <br /> This film was a grand experiment that said: “Hey! History is you, and it needs more than your attention, it needs “your active participation.” “Sometimes we bring you a story, sometimes you need to go to it.” <br /> <br /> Alas, nobody listened but this does not mean that it should not have been said.
