This documentary by Marian Cooper is simply awesome. I saw it tonight on the Turner Classic Movie Channel. I think I will see if I can order a copy of it on DVD. Frames of the film do not look vague and unstable, as you might think from a black and white film of 1925. Filmed in Iran in 1925, the people of a nomadic tribe in a documentary film leave their home in the desert and cross the raging river, men, women, children, animals ... Then go up and barefoot all over the snowy mountain. It sink or swim and scramble or die. Looking for grass for their animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In one scene, a man carries a mule that is too sick to climb a mountain. All the kids in the documentary look happy and healthy. They had such a hard life. I wonder if the nomadic tribes of Iran live like that. Makes appreciate the modern life in the United States.
