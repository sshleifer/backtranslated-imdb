I just bought and watched a DVD of this movie. Transfer DVD from last year 2001. This 1988 film is a really great little movie. Skipped by most people. I saw it at the theater in 1988 and since then I love it. I like the first shot from Pittsburgh (not Baltimore, as commented by another user). Makes Pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I must say that the Pitts tour in the garbage truck with Niki is very picturesque, interesting! Tom Hulse, like everyone else, gives a wonderful, wonderful presentation. DVD is a good transfer, no add-ons, but widescreen format. I recommend it to those who love the movie.
