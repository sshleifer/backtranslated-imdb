Since I am not a fan of almost no movie “Desperate Life” by John Waters after “Desperate Life”, I warmed up to Pecker. After he emerged from the underground, Waters released earlier versions of his earlier work (Plaks, Polyester, Hairspray), which for diehard fans looked and tasted like diluted liquor. “Trying not to spew out early successes” is a small, quiet, modest comment about the vagaries of celebrity and the pretentiousness of the art world. Waters clearly knows this subject, as he also exhibited and sold (at ridiculous prices) most amateur pop art ever created that you couldn’t have imagined that someone could give them away if he hadn’t been decorated By the "name" of waters. Edward Furlong is good at Pecker, and Waters’s unrealistic style is unconstrained.
