Vincent Price's sequel to HOUSE OF WAX (1953), the film that established his reputation as a symbol of horror, also revolves around the bitter ?? although resourceful ?? showman. Although a remake, the first one (shot in Technicolor) remains an excellent effort; in addition, in addition to some persistent comic relief, the obligatory resort to a cheap trick (it was another three-dimensional showcase) and random shortcomings of the narrative (what happened to the missing bag, which allegedly appeared in a police station with a severed head?), this suggests more than enough thrills of the type of the Great Guinulles and the total cost of the camp (Price, using various disguises as the inventor of illusions imitating the "lost" star conjurers who used his genius) , will be able to stand on their own two places. legs. By the way, the participation of director Brahma is not a coincidence here ?? since the narrative includes elements of two horror titles (both starring Laird Cregar), he previously led them: Lodger (1944) and Ganger's Square (1945). Young heroes are played by Mary Murphy (as an assistant to Price) and Patrick O'Neill (as her police detective, it is rather curious that he himself will lead a similar play, CHAMBER OF HORRORS [1966], which I purchased just in time for an encore to ). An interesting side effect here is the adoption of the latest detection technique, fingerprinting, which is crucial for Priceâ€™s decline (in a predictable, but rather awkward, fiery climax), although the persistent surveillance of his amateur forensic mistress has at least much in common with this in the long run. ! Watching the star in roles made to order, the film delivers a lot of pleasure ?? especially on the compact 73 minutes.
