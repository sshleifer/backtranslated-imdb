Just finished watching this movie, which really upset me. In addition, he was twice in South Africa during the filming of this film. <br /> <br /> This is, of course, a heavy blow, and the opening scenes tend to “set the stage”. A slow but steady increase in pace hardly allows for a break, and, of course, there are some easy moments. <br /> <br /> Never be able to see Nigel Hawthorne again. He seemed like a very perverted person, and I discovered that he didn’t like him every time he appeared. <br /> <br /> I fully agree with the clearly formulated and thoughtful comments by Steve-Tomp.
