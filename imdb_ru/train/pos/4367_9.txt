I have not seen this film for many years, so my knowledge is a little rusty. I remember thinking that this film was twice the film Braveheart. It's just more realistic and more believable. Reedb Roy looks like you could imagine Rob Roy with dirty hair and a beard in simple clothes. Liam Nesson also has a Celtic look, he looks like a Scotsman and, more importantly, looks like Rob Roy. This is a comparison that angers some people, but compares it to Mel Gibson as William Wallace. Gibson allegedly plays a man who, according to legend, can be called a giant 6 feet 7, and Gibson is almost a foot lower. This story contains a little romance, conspiracy and a history of losers. Sounds like a Braveheart? But instead of a film that screams “freedom,” freedom, and nationalism, we get a film that speaks of honor, love, and justice. It makes the film more interesting. Very similar to Gladiator. The cast is fantastic, and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavor. The story is gorgeous in how it copes with heroism and humanity. The scene where Mary is raped and she comes out of a burning house with a look of true Scottish power is accompanied by her washing out of the sperm from her crotch in extreme panic. This is what a Braveheart heroine would never do. In general, this is a great and almost flawless watch. Go and see!
