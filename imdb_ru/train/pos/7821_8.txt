Very rarely, Denzil Washington makes a bad film and remembers him about Kevin Klein, and in this case it should be considered one of their best films. It's more about the film about how strong friendship can be more than the story about Steve Biko, although we do get an idea of ​​how this man was and how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods went to save the man’s name and let the world know South Africa was a corrupt, rotten society. The direction is outstanding from David Attenborough, as it was for Gandhi, although, if there is any criticism to be directed, it could be in the duration of the film. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit in a historical film. It's amazing how he manages to control all the extras. Thousands of people in both films. This film really opens your eyes to what happened before the collapse of Aparthiet, and you can't help but touch it. 8 out of 10.
