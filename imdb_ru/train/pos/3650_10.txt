Sometimes Lady Luck smiles at me. I originally made - and copied - the VHS tape of this wonderful television presentation. I was heartbroken when I realized what I had done, since I could not get a copy of it anywhere else. <br /> <br /> I recently signed up for a digital cable, and when searching in future films there was my Surprise was the planned broadcast of the film. This time, however, I made a copy on DVD, so I have no chance to repeat my mistake. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was able to see her again after eight years, and she was just as exciting and tense as when I first saw it. There is a small prelude in this story: my first contact with Pandora's Clock happened to read a book live on public radio. I just had to tune in to the radio station on the way home for lunch, and from the first batch I was hooked. Every day I was looking forward to the next chapter being read. <br /> <br /> When after a few months I learned that the book would be broadcast on television in the form of a film, I definitely cleared my schedule for this event. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the film was very faithful to the book, in contrast to what another reviewer said. This in itself is a rare achievement for television films. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others about the casting. I could not have presented a better choice for Captain Holland than Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the film could break up and burn without the proper cast for this key role. Anderson was never better, and it is a shame that we did not see him anymore. In fact, all the actors did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the film and the book is the intervention of the “terrorist plot” to arm a private business jet of an air-to-air missile, in which the pilot flies and knocks down an aircraft. In essence, we are talking about less than 36 hours to organize and execute a plan like this, and guys who are simply unrealistic, considering all the players involved. It was also unrealistic how little the airliner was influenced by the fact that at first one, and then two of its engines failed. <br /> <br /> Aside from this beef, I enjoyed the building’s uncertainty and found that the reaction to the film showed both foreign governments and our own. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, do it by all means.
