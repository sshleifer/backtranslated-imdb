The lawyer is drawn into the death game of cat and mouse when he becomes a member of the femme fatale in this adaptation of the novel Grisham. Altman creates a tense, gothic atmosphere, but the script is weak. Accompanying the southern will, Bran convincingly acts as a lawyer, and David is attractive as an object of his desire. Downey is cute as a private detective. Duval plays a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his strange character. Hannah and Berenguer complete an impressive cast. After an interesting production, the film stalled and did not fulfill its original promise, but Altman is always worth seeing.
