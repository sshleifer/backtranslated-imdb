I just watched "The Last Wave" in my school's visual arts library. It is intriguing, like all things of Peter Weir, but does not always attract attention in the way I would like. I was fascinated by the ideas that were thrown to me (because the film director Weir supervises them very well), but at the same time they did not stimulate me enough. AKA I got a little bored in some places. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds an Australian lawyer who is obsessed with certain dreams, connecting him with the Aboriginal group he is protecting. <br /> <br /> It starts with an intense weather sequence and has very amazing mood effects throughout (especially the freaky, “burp” sound design) and strong direction; but it did not entertain me, as in the later Weyr films. Maybe I just need to watch it again. <br /> <br /> A good movie about obsession and mystery. Because, after all, the mystery that exists between whites and natives has very serious consequences. <br /> <br /> Although, God bless Peter Weir. Only for him this film is worth seeing ... a very organic director. How is the Australian answer Malik! I would give him 7, because he has enough good ideas to overcome the boring moments.
