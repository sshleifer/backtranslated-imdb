However incredible it may seem, Gojoe is a samurai fighter inspired by anime and Hong Kong motifs with a pacifist message. This ankle of the film is effectively portrayed through the protagonist (an excellent acting, performed by Daisuke Ryu), a killer monk who became bodhist monk Benkei. Bankey has vowed never to kill again, but he still takes the sword to fight what he considers to be an invasion of demons ... <br /> <br /> Gojoe is a film that is difficult to appreciate. His visual images are amazingly processed and beautiful, but they have too many tricks (a circular camera and high-speed discs, expressionist pictures, leech colors, digital effects, etc.), therefore the end result is somewhat tedious. However, the beginning and end of the film, however, are elegant and powerful. If only the director Sogo Ishii would be wise enough not to abuse his package of tricks. <br /> <br /> Another problem with Gojo is the amount of violence. For a film with such an opposing message, Gojo spends too much energy and screen time to portray endless battle scenes. In addition, the mode of violence is always on the verge of indulging oneself; in fact, the bloody rain against the night sky seems to be one of the signature images of the films. Fortunately, Ishii is wise enough to show the ugly and tragic side of violence. Nevertheless, it seems that Ishii is not sure whether he is shooting a traditional action movie or a deep moral allegory. Viewers also can not be sure of this until the very end of the film. The powerful (albeit cynical) end is what saves Gojo; this clearly emphasizes that this film is more than just a mountain festival.
