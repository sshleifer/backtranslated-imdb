Do not confuse the British black comedy with the same name, which came out in 1994. But this Small Grave is a worthy addition to the 80s slasher. <br /> <br /> The plot leaves 4 female girls from a convent planning a spring break for the rest of their lives in Florida, but their plans are suspended when one of them witnesses how a man kills a local woman, and when he realizes that he was seen, well, let's say, it becomes a deadly game of cat and mouse, and things get worse when he turns out to be a local sheriff. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Shallow Grave is one of the most pleasant slashers that appeared in the 80s, especially in the late 80s, when slashers seemed to come down, it was one of the few who did not did, and this film should be more famous, pity that it is not. This is one film that actually mixes stereotypes (just try to guess who will be the last girl - I got it all wrong). All the leading roles are good and you hope that this is one of those films that they all went away, which of course not. This, in combination with the fluffiness of the first half-hour cans of the film (in a good way) with some flashes of real abominations (the second murder gives a real boost) and some unexpected untidiness (even if it is not so much) in the film of the end of the 80s, in a film made in the end of the 80s, a topless woman was strangled and strangled by her own bra (accompanied by hysterical religious radio). one or two bad things in this film, well, not bad, but minor, for example, the plot with two teenage boys, which is nowhere to go, and a stupid ending, as well as the inability of the deputy to follow the logic. In SHALLOW GRAVE there are no sharp guns, but at least, in my opinion, this is a slasher through. The scenes where the evil sheriff hunts girls in the woods are tense and exciting. <br /> <br /> In general, a very pleasant and decent slasher, with excellent performances of all four main girls and this sheriff psycho.
