In fact, they are playing out in their world a version of what they saw in the adult world around them. Later we again meet three children in a sanatorium, like adults. Here we see that life has influenced each of them. One of them is a reclusive patient with sexual repression. The other person is a talker who is sick. The third child, a young lady, became a nun and serves in a sanatorium. This film is an allegory about the impact of violence on the psyche. <br /> <br /> This film has a climax, which is definitely not intended for fastidious members of the audience, but it is logical and deeply worried.
