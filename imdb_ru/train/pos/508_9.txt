In 2151, Brocken, Oklahoma, a farmer shoots Klinga Klaang with a plasma rifle after an explosion of methane storage on his farm, and Klingon goes to Starfleet Hospital. The Ambassador of the Vulcans, Soval, offers to turn off the life support system and deliver the corpse of Klaang to his warrior empire on the planet Kronos with honor.

T'Pol modifies the Enterprise sensors to track the Suliban spacecraft until it reaches the Riger X planet. They investigate and disclose that Klaang was a courier, conveying an important message about the Temporary Cold War from Suliban Sarin to the Klingon leaders. in Kronos. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I am a big Star Trek fan, I didn’t follow the Enterprise episodes on cable television. I decided to buy a DVD box of the first season, and this first episode surprised me. The adventures of the first Enterprise, Captain Jonathan Archer, the magnificent T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, Dr. Phlox, Hoshi and Trip are excellent, at least for this pilot. I noted in IMDb that this episode is actually divided into two parts, but on the DVD they are only one, so my review is valid for both. I didn’t like the theme of musical scores, which really annoyed me, but it was an exception in this great show. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Broken bow”
