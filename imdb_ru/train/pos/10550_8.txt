I looked at it as part of my course at Aberystwyth University, and it confuses me why he does not have a distributor in the UK. Well, in fact it is not, because this film is all that a non-Hollywood film - original, creative, whimsical and humorous. It seems that today no one wants to watch this type of film, since, more simply, it does not follow the general rules that most young viewers are looking for in a film. <br /> <br /> I havenâ€™t written a review of IMDb for ages, but I felt I wanted to give this movie a special mention, even if it was during my 30-minute break between lessons! In fact, we are talking about nothing, since the two main characters are immersed in their own world of non-existence through hatred of the world. The brilliance here is how the director maintains interest for most of the execution time with only two characters, and when the only stage set consists of half a house and a huge white, empty space. This is largely due to the star performances of the actors, both of whom offer excellent laughter, and at the same time can add considerable emotional depth to their roles. <br /> <br /> I would love to write some more, but I'm on a rather time constraint. However, I encourage everyone to try this film. A completely unique concept is presented on the screen smoothly and efficiently, thanks to a combination of good performances, a strong script, pleasant sound design and (quite) impressive visual effects, creating a very interesting film. <br /> <br /> It's just a shame, so few people know anything about ....
