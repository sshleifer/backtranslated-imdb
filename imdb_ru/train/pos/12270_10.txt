I have been searching for this film for years, apparently, it is not in the States, so I bought a copy from Ebay. <br /> <br /> Four young hunters and their three friends go to the forest in search of a bear. it apparently killed several vacationers. They discover that the former Vietnamese vet is crazy (he kills some of his victims using a glove with long metal nails, like Freddy Krueger) As soon as night falls, one of the girls after a short quarrel with her boyfriend goes for a walk, she is killed. After one of the groups finds her body, they all hide in their tents waiting for the daylight. As soon as the sun rises, they all try to figure it out, but become victims one by one. <br /> <br /> Seven bodies, not a lot of blood, but a couple of good killings, especially girls. deaths Guys are killed bloodlessly (blown up in a car, shot, a knife in the head). <br /> <br /> In general, INFERNAL TRAP is a good slasher film from the late 80s. Nothing new, just good acting, fast-paced and a few nice ladies. 10 out of 10.
