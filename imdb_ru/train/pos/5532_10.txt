Perhaps I am biased towards foxes, tales of foxes and everything else, but I thought it was wonderfully done. <br /> <br /> I really liked that it was shown when Lily was uncomfortable, for example, in a fire and in the room I try not to spoil much here). I think it is important for children to see and try to understand. <br /> <br /> After reading a few other comments, I was a little confused, one says that at the end — a spoiler — the mother and her son appear, as she told her son about her story. In the film I saw, there was no mother or son at the end, just a picture of a girl with a fox. Can anyone enlighten me about this? In any case, I really liked this film, although some scenes can be a bit slow, which can be difficult for children with high energy to survive. Still standing, if they can sit still.
