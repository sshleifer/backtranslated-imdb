This film took me by surprise, because in the past I was often disappointed with Adrian Pasdar, but he caught the perfect balance in this performance, avoiding farce and pathos, while delivering humor and real emotions. There is always a wonderful Julie Waters, and anyone who has not yet shot her in Teaching Rita in 1983 should immediately rent her (an amazing film). The remaining minor characters are also well played, many amazingly eccentric, without going beyond. It's fun.
