It was a very original, worthy film, and a bold move for all who participated in it. I don’t care if this isn’t the best movie of all time, the fact that Eddie Murphy is doing something informal, and that I don’t know what will happen next makes him loved, I wish more films were as creative like this one and not the same old entertainment formula.
