The couple (Janet and Richard) go hiking in the woods near the giant swamp. After hiking and enjoying nature, the couple takes refuge in an abandoned farmhouse. A couple of escaped prisoners soon appear, and after a long delay of the inevitable, they continue to rape Janet and lock Richard in a bird cage. <br /> <br /> This last film on the left one should be one of the most underrated horror films ever made. This is one of the most sick and perverted shockers of the early 70s. Moreover, I found it quite charming and beautiful in its perverted tone. I love CAGED TERROR. Music definitely helps to give the film a sense of individuality, as well as a lot of beauty. I found the film quite creepy. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages are mainly related to what is happening in the film, that is, the film is rather slow and tortuous. While I did not mind the stimulation due to the beauty and tension of the film in question, I really think that this will suit most people. The game is not too good, as are the dialogues, at least in the early scenes. This film requires a little more patience than usual, and it really isn't for everyone. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a good movie. Not the best horror movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely a lot of fun. This is not the easiest movie to search. It can be found in the USED section of many stores, if you look carefully enough. It’s not for everyone, but if you’re a junk movie fan, then it’s definitely worth checking out.
