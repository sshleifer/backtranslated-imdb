This film surprised me. Some things were “cliches”, and some technological elements reminded me of the film “Enemy of the State” with Will Smith in the lead role. But for the most part very interesting - a good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and two scum Julio and Ramundo (providing a little comic relief). This is a movie that you can watch again - let's say ... on Wednesday night, when there will be nothing more. I gave him 9 for entertainment value.
