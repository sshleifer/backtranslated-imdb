I love to buy these cheap lousy Alpha Video DVDs. Once I happened to buy this one. This is the perfect silly science fiction movie of the 50s, all covered in sex. Enjoy the unscientific ALL, scantly clothed girls and lots of melodrama, it's a nice movie for those who appreciate such things. And if you can “suspend your disbelief” enough, you can really be frightened - not only the psychotic head or the beating of an object in the closet, but towards the end, with the character of the “perfect body”, It is so. what word for mind?
