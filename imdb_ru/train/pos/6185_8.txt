I just watched MURDER AT VANITIES in the newly released Universal Pre-Code kit, and I was amazed at how much I liked the car from start to finish. Most of the other commentators covered the story, the mystery of the murder in the musical, but I wanted to add a few additional notes. Brisson and Carlisle are relatively soft compared to even the most minor players, and it seems that none of them have the right voice for what they sing. low notes). The great Victor McLaglen and Jack Okey play well with each other, with an excellent sense of time, thanks to which the ball rotates between the musical numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are girls from Vanity, but let's not forget the great jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in the “Ebony Rhapsody” number. Gail Patrick makes one of her early appearances, looking a bit like Eve Arden; Patrick will be executive producer on the Perry Mason series. Then there is Jessie Ralph as the wardrobe mistress — you'll also notice her in David Copperfield (as Aunt Peggot) and THE BANK DICK. The music is very good - Brisson presents the “Cocktails for Two” standard in two different scenes; "Sweet marijuana" with barely dressed peyote buttons in the background (blood dripping onto the white skin of a single chorin miraculously cooled); “Black Rhapsody” with the Duke Ellington Orchestra and a group of beautiful dancers, both black and white, mixing it. And I think that this is one of the few early musicals in which there is such a mixture - and the costumes leave nothing for imagination.
