This is one of the best music concerts anyone has ever seen and heard. I grew up when All My Lovin 'was completely new, and hearing it again today from the original artist today is a measure of Sir MacMag's ability to capture any crowd of any age. This document is hidden behind the scenes to show us life on the road, not only for the group, but also for everyone. I saw this guy live in Australian 1975 and I can assure you that his performance here on this DVD is no less than he gave almost 30 years ago. I have a huge 5.1 channel surround system that does it right and would recommend it to anyone, especially the Beatles fan. This is the Beatles concert closest to you today. Singer, composer, lead / rhythm / bass guitar, piano, ukulele, just pure genius. There are few artists who can stand alone with one instrument and keep the crowd in his hands. If you want to celebrate the perfect music, buy a CD recorded in the studio. If you want to hear raw music as it is intended and spontaneous for the crowd, with all the excitement and emotions of the crowd - this DVD is for you.
