I was very impressed with this small, independently made picture. The story of a couple of social outcasts who meet, become friends and provide each other with a support system, which, as it seemed, is not enough for children, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but always provocative. Music, mainly underground bands, was used with great effect, as was experimentation with camera angles, filters, and slow or fast motion techniques. The performances (the main roles are played by the writers and directors of the film) are some of the best I've seen in the last couple of years. If you have ever felt like a square peg smashes into a round slot, I truly believe that you will appreciate “By Hook or By Crook”.
