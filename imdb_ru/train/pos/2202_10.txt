I must have been only 11 when Mr. Pipers started. It was a must see for the whole family, I believe in the Sun. nights Repeated gags were when Rob opened his locker (he had to use a yardstick or a pointer to measure the right place on another cabinet and do some other things, finally knocking out the place after which his door opened) and take out the pins from the new shirt ( At the beginning of the episode, he will open a package with a new classic shirt, and for the rest of the show he will find one pin after another, which he missed when he unwrapped his shirt, time was everything, and pins were laughing a lot.) I remember the aunt who drove Rio as D same Benny, and always wanted Sonny to say something scientific. He thought and came up with a "semi-permeable membrane" or osmosis, forcing her to say how brilliant he is. (you should have been there). Marion Lorne stole the show every time she was on the screen. Why they did not continue the series with her POV, when Wally left (he was afraid that he was being shot, but by that time it was too late), I would never know. I saw somewhere that the 1st TV wedding (at least a big one) was Tini Tim at the Carson show. Horsecocky It was Rob and Nancy (I’ve had some controversy about it), and I remember that she did the TV Guide cover and got the press in all the newspapers and major magazines. The trip to the Museum of Radio Broadcasting in New York a few years ago was disappointing, because they had very few episodes, and they may not be there anymore. I still remember how wonderful it is, and it’s a pity that I didn’t get any older.
