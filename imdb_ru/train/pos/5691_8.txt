It was very interesting for me to watch this film when it first came out in cinemas, however I could not get around it. So finally, he hit the shelves, and I picked it up. Not knowing exactly what to expect, I turned on the DVD in the player, settled in for the evening of the murder, and pressed the play button. This was followed by one of the most interesting films I've seen in the last couple of years. <br /> <br /> * SOME SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is a Wonderland murder story that led to the seediest part of Los Angeles and right in the biggest early 70s porn, John Holmes (Val Kilmer). <br /> <br /> I got hooked from the very beginning, and the feeling of the film took me all the way to the most bloody end. I was surprised to find that the film was focused not so much on actual murders as on the events before and after the investigation. In addition to the few blood-spattered walls at the beginning and the actual show of the killings near the end, the film was more or less fascinating showing great dialogue and great acting. Val Kilmer is everything, but a porn star is selling me as a drug addict, and even "beautiful, but this is his." I already mentioned, the aspect of the film was the absence of a frank show of murders. This was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you could not fully see the brutal beating bestowed on the sleeping four. In addition, the sound effects of these kills were more than enough to whet my appetite. They were beaten with lead pipes, no need to say more. <br /> <br /> My only real problem is the short appearance of Carrie Fisher. I think her image of an overly religious figure was too cliche for her appearance. Maybe this person was actually part of the story, but maybe not, but they did not sell me, and for some reason Fisher seemed to her a bit “awkward” in her image. <br /> <br /> Overall, a great movie is worth seeing, even if once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
