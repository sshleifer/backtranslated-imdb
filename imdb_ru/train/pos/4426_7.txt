I'm glad I saw this movie when I saw some other director films in the past. I thought that production values ​​were great, like costumes and settings with a bridge. It was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons is handled. <br /> <br /> I agree with some other comments about the battle scenes. From time to time they were difficult to follow. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, a moral story. It would be interesting to know what some Japanese viewers think about the film. This is a movie that I would like to see again. <br /> <br /> Some scenes, such as those in which Benkay and the Prince fought on the “extrasensory” level, were well made. <br /> <br /> really got out of the movie, thinking about what just happened here. Intense.
