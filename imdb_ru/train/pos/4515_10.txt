This movie is absolutely fantastic !! If you are watching it with your friends, it can be a very good day ... Obviously, you should know that the film is stupid and the film director acted badly (Tomba / Unziker, which couple), and this is probably the worst movie in the world. but you can enjoy it very much. We watched it at 19, and it was a very good evening. The best scenes are the first when the criminals kill Alex's friend, and he tries to act as desperate, and the result is a comic scene of the first category ... And then, when he shows Leva (Antevlev, what is his name) “Palace of Justice”, and then the accident of Lyova, who once drives his car from the road, and after a second the car is completely empty! What magic!
