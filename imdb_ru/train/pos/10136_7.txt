This is one of the best episodes of the second season of the Ministry of Health, I think Mick Harris has problems with women ... He kills them all, they often become victims (Screwfly decision, Pro-life, Valerie on the stairs, I don't remember Argento’s episode Season 1, etc., Obviously, “Fingerprint.” I think he likes to see women exposed to burns, torture, injuries, and I don't know. At least, “The Right to Death” is one of best, with good twists, graphic scenes and suspense (especially with photos from the cellular scene, great). The acting is similar to you can be the worst serial like “Pro-life” or “We shout for ice cream.” I also think that the plot can be made for the film, not just for the episode. The ideology of the series is terrible: kill and kill women , maiming animals, etc. In the first season, it was better than in the second with such episodes as “cigarette burns” (“Best of all”), “Homecoming” the funny thing) “Imprint” (really shocking).
