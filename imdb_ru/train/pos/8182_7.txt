Directed by Brian Yuzna made a rough career in the horror genre, creating masterpieces such as Return of the Living Dead 3 or Bride of the Rescuer, but at the same time he shot horrible films such as Faust: Love. for the Damned "or the mediocre" Progeny. " He is clearly better at the producer, where his work on producing Stuart Gordon films was excellent. <br /> <br /> "Dentist" - one of his less significant work as a director, but a discreet profile has its advantages. the film and the lack of claims makes it a very pleasant experience. He tells the story of Dr. Alan Feynston (played beautifully by Corbin Bernsen), a successful dentist who once discovers that his ideal life is not as perfect as he thought when he discovers that his beautiful wife (Linda Hoffman) has an affair with a boy by the pool . This event violates his consciousness and brings him into terrible fun when he takes revenge on the world for being so "dirty." <br /> <br /> The idea copes very well with Yuzna, as he takes us on a trip after a day of Feynston’s revenge. What distinguishes this film from most slashers is that we are not focused on the victim, we follow Feynstone, because he is the main character. We see how in one day he moved from a respected professional to psychokilling. Yuzna manages to give the film an exact amount of indecision, but adds a good portion of dark humor that really helps the film. <br /> <br /> Much of the success of the room is in the role of Burnsen in the role of Feynston. He can make you feel empathy and hatred towards him at the same time, and his character’s subtle humor is another aspect that helps the film. The rest of the cast is not so good, and I think their minor role harms the film more than it should. A notable exception is Ken Forey, as a detective trying to catch Feynston. While his role is rather small, he does an excellent job with this. <br /> <br /> Horrible scenes are awaited with a killer dentist, and Brian Yuzna delivers a great amount of SFX. It's nice to see that he hasn't gone too far with this, as he usually does, and I dare say this is the highlight of the film. He has exactly the expected amount of blood, no less, no more. Yuzna restrained himself from his common excesses, and the result was great. <br /> <br /> Although this is not one of the most famous films of Yuzna, I would say that this is one of his best. Of course, this is not a classic material, like his masterpieces, but this is a film that entertains and never becomes tedious or boring. It is a low-budget movie, but I think it’s shocked. 7/10
