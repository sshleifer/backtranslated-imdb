I saw this Australian film about 10 years ago and never forgot it. The film shows the horror of war in such a way that Hollywood usually obscures. The relationship between the soldiers of the two warring countries is underlined by differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that, after all, we are not all really different inside. If you can find any copy of it - buy or rent it. You will not be disappointed, just awe.
