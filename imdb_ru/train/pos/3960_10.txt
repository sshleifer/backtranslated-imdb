According to the director, this film was popular in Asia. It’s hard to take Mats Helge’s films seriously, since most of his films have been shot on a very tight budget. Almost no dollars at all. But it is interesting to establish that Mats Helge eventually completes what can be called a fighter. The mission of the ninja - I think - the best of all the films made by him. Some special effects are quite enjoyable. This is not a movie "B" or "C". This is the movie "Z" - but a nice and funny movie "Z"!
