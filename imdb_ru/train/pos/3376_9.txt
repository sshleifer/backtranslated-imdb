This movie is a very good game of almost all the actors, a fascinating story with a stunning finale, great music and great visual effects without significant special effects. It is interesting to note, however, that, like most science fiction, its predictions for the future probably will not come true as early as shown. This does not mean that we are not yet in the forest, but the year 2022 is obviously too early to be in such a state. He shares this setback with a rather illustrious list of science fiction classics: “1984”, “2001: Space Odyssey (compare its space station with our International Space Station)” and “I am a robot” by Isaac Asimov (positron brains should have been invented in 1990s).
