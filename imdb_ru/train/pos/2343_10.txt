Thank God, ABC took it instead of Fox. The best description (for those who are in the know) is that Wonderfalls meets Dead Like Me well. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that experience with death and fate at an early age makes me a fan of Brian Fuller, but I certainly like his productions. I also like checkered floors, pies, talking toys, gravel and other harmful objects :) Although I am a bit “burtonetz”, I certainly think that he has his own niche that does not require J Depp or H.B. Carter was an amazingly creative playground. Here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood, crashing into each of them, which really make sense and make us want to live a full life!
