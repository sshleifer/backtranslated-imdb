When I first saw the title, I was already capturing the subject of the film - this was clearly not a reference to British currency, so it should have been Shakespeare’s language and about pounds of meat — to take them or give them. Will Smith is a good actor, so there were no serial killers. It can only be about the person who gives them, so it must be about the feeling of guilt. I messed it all up for myself by looking at it and learning the story before I looked, because the beauty of creation is how the parts of the background of the main character move to slowly illuminate the audience as to who he is and why he does what he does. <br /> <br /> Guilt is a very difficult question, because it is very uncomfortable and sad, which is not a promising prerequisite when you hope to ride a roller coaster - you know, it will be unpleasant. I would not say that the film glorifies suicide; he goes into the most extreme form of self-sacrifice — martyrdom. <br /> <br /> It is also full of symbolism everywhere, which is a sure sign that the letter has been thoughtfully thought out to the smallest detail and moves in several meanings and a deep reflective character. The most outstanding topic that struck me was that he not only gave his heart to a girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically, but also gave her physically as the greatest gift he could. Determined to die, but his plan is thwarted by falling in love - what a complication of the second act. Absolutely masterful. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a very slow pace, but I don’t know whether it would be better to use it in a shorter time frame. I did not feel the tension and his terrible inner turmoil as much as I could, but maybe it was just because I had spoiled everything for myself in advance. Having said all this, though, it is a deeply touching and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thought-provoking tragedy that deserves the awards that it will inevitably receive.
