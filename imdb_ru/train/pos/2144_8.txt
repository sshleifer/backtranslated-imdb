Sweet and absolutely charming film, Should we dance? made me laugh and cry. At first glance, Sugiyama-san was not too attractive - an excited hired employee, seemingly loyal to his family, but too easily captivated by the face in the window. The object of his obsession is distant and cold. But by the end of the film, I was in love with him, her, his wife and daughter, all dance teachers and dance students. This simple story of transformation and renewal is a little gem that I would love to see again.
