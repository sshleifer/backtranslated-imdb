I thought it was really good for the first episode of the first episode. It was really fun, and I thought the actors were great. I think itâ€™s a crime for everyone to say that this is bad because it looked at the right time. I find it really annoying when people say that it was not historically correct, because it must be a Saturday entertainment show, and not a boring history documentary, so I think the costumes and decor were right. A brilliant start, and I will love what will happen next !! I spoke to many people at my school and they love the show! we all think this is brilliant entertainment and it has wonderful stories.
