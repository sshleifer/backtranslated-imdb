Growing up in New York in the late 80s / early 90s on the club scene, I can personally say that this is one of the most important documentaries made in covering this place during this time period. Not one Madonna came up with the idea of ​​Voguing, but that's where she got it from! Instead of tolerating violence against each other or in fights of bitchy cats, fashion allowed people to "fight" within everything except touching each other (which required automatic disqualification). Seeing such extraordinarily talented / well-organized “throws” in clubs was nothing more than entertainment, and all the big names of that time are here ... Pepper La Beya, Paris Dupre, Stragavaganza, etc ... they are all marked by the similarity of such of periodical works, like Malcolm McLaren's song "Deep in Vogue" ... no matter who you were or where you came from, because when you went through these doors to this "magic kingdom" In some ways, you became part of something bigger what you yourself / were important / and most importantly - making your own moves life and imagination ... and anyone from any place could become a King (or Queen) depending on the circumstances. Words and wits were as sharp as movements on the floor. All the tension, excitement and magic of the very urban energy of New York is reflected in this film. BRILLIANT !!! PLEASE RELEASE on DVD for the world to see !!! Thank you!
