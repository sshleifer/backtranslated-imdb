The Return of the Jedi is by far the most exciting series and is the perfect ending to the Star Wars saga. With Han Solo, imprisoned by Jabba Hut and the Empire, building a new Death Star, the rebel alliance faces a tough battle against the dark side, and only our favorite heroes can handle it. <br /> <br /> Opening the sequence set on Tatooine, we see Jabbaâ€™s palace, the pit of slavery and filth, and the new home for Han Solo when Luke and the gang are preparing to save him, and thanks to Luke-Jedi forces . <br /> <br /> We are also witnessing a terrific triple battle at the end. Khan, Leia and Chewie are fighting on the endor, desperately trying to deactivate the shields protecting the Death Star. The rebel fleet, led by Lando, battles the Imperial fleet while they wait for the shields to fall, and Luke will have the final battle with Darth Vader. The epic end of the classic saga, and this is just the tempo of the first two. <br /> <br /> 10/10
