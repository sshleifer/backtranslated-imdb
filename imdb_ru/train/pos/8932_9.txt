The film does not look amazing in the conventional sense. This does not represent a series of beautiful pictures. Instead, it is a visually interesting film. This forces the viewer to constantly process or perhaps present the context of various frames. Such things are easy to try, but difficult to succeed. The film refuses to use the pillar of the genre to help the less interested viewer understand what is happening. Instead, the film touches various genres. The trick to loving a movie is to enjoy this playfulness. I suspect that 99% of North American viewers simply won’t get it. If you try to fix the narration of this film, or the philosophical message, or the symbolic structure, etc., you will lose time. There are none of them. The film at times pretends only in these and other genres. The only unifying force in the film is Claire Dany's own feeling about coming together. There are so few feature films that almost do not satisfy Kant’s description of what art is, namely, the enjoyment of the very power of judgment, and not just the immersion of experience into concepts. The film usually takes the easy way and chooses a simpler pleasure in understanding what is happening. Most films are not art. Most films do not come close to art. When a film does like this one and still likes a lot of viewers, it’s just a miracle. My negative comment is that sometimes I find a film overly simplistic to buy various narrative themes that run through it. The taist narrative of the father and the son, although not quite ordinary, ultimately makes things a little clearer and simpler. It dominates too much.
