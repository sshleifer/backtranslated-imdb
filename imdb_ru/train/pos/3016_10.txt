For those who like their mysterious murders, it is definitely worth seeing, as it is full of interesting and suspicious characters, most of which are wealthy secular types of Long Island. As a star detective, William Powell is alternately starchy and inspired, at times acting as if he and his costume went to the cleaners and crushed each other. Mary Astor is very sweet here. <br /> <br /> Powell made a career playing the main character Phil Vance in a series of films shot at several studios for several years. In the intervals between these films, he turned into a somewhat unusual romantic heroine, sometimes even writing the gangster roles of a gentleman. Already middle-aged, he was stuck in a career when this one appeared. As with many early stars in the walkie-talkie, it seemed his time had come and gone, that he was well suited for the early films of the era of forbidden depression, but with the change of time he may have been too mature and generous to tolerate. <br /> <The murder case in the nursery, led by the criminal neglecting Michael Curtis, is one of the last “old Powell”, and next year the first of the new ones, “Thin Man”, will be announced, whose success catapults its leading Hollywood players stratosphere. In the nursery, we can see films, still in a somewhat rigid, ritualized form, because the camera does not move much, and the action, like the presentation, tends to theatrical. There is no harm in this approach, though, which has its charms. This gives the film baroque quality.
