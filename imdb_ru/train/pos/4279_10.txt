A few years ago I was lucky to see this gem at the> Gypsy Film Festival in Santa Monica. You know that the ending will not be pink, and the tragedy will strike, but it is really about travel, characters and their dynamics, and how they all fit into what was “Yugoslavia”. > Although I’m not a yugoslav stalwart and tend to avoid> the current harvest of "Yugoslav" films (give me Ademir Kenovich in the late 90s Kustaritsa), I would be happy to have> a chance to stumble again on this film, as it shines in my > celluloid memories. Since I saw "Who Sings Over> There" 15 years ago, I still hear the melody that the Roma sing, thinking in my head? “Am I unhappy,> am I born like this?” With the accompanying Jew's harp. and an accordion that makes a melody both funny and sad. The late, great actor Pavle Vudzhisich (Muzamer from the film “When Father> was on a business trip”) was remembered as a bus driver on an ill-fated journey in his typical rudeness, but at the same time pleasant manner.
