Generous production value and solid ideas in this simple adaptation of satirical classics of Jane Austen about the game of marriage within and between classes in 18th-century provincial England. Northam and Paltrow are a wholesome mixture like friends who have to go through jealousy and lies to discover that they love each other. Good humor is a firm virtue that largely explains the availability of outdated source material (which is a bit softened due to its sharp skepticism). I liked the look and feel of the film and how the shots were made, and I thought that it was not very dependent on the sequence of shots to the head, like most other films from the 80s and 90s. Very good results.
