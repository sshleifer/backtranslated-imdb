Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) leaves the school of reform and returns to the slums. His sister (Anne Sheridan) is doing everything possible to keep him out of trouble, but he seems to be just following him. In addition to his connections with a gang of termites, real gangsters follow Gabe, who have arson scheme of random buildings to get insurance. They need someone to blame for the arson, and Gabe is everything. It is the termites who must pass the law in their favor and give the gangsters just their desserts. <br /> <br /> The scene that represents the Dead End Kids is really good. The boys roam the street to the furniture of the new resident and continue to prepare it on their own. They talk to each other in strange chic accents and talk about tea drinking together; Bernard Punsley napping in the chair. Then the boys start a fight with a new boy, but after he has established himself as a good fighter, they ask him to join his club. <br /> <br /> The initiating scene is also quite good, full of harm, which at first seems dangerous, but in fact it is quite clever and innocent. <br /> <br /> Later, when Billy Helop studies for mayor, he dreams of schoolwork. This is amazingly staged, with tiny holograms of children who walk around his face and shoot him with questions. <br /> <br /> “Angels wash their faces” is a great name because it plays on the success of “Angels with dirty faces”, and really tells what children do. These boys are famous for bad behavior on the set and outside. But instead of appearing insincere, it causes a big laugh. This is a preview of what many of the boys will be in the The Bowery Boys series. We even get some distorted words from Leo Gorsy.
