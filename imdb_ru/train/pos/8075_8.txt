I decided not to believe what famous film critics say. Although this film did not receive the best comments, this film made my day. It made me think. What a false world it is. <br /> <br /> What do you do when your loved ones cheat on you. It is said that no matter how often you feed a snake with milk, it will never be loyal and will bite when there is a chance. Similarly, some people are such that they are never grateful. This film is about how selfish people can be and how everyone ultimately just thinks about themselves and works for themselves. <br /> <br /> Brother accidentally dies at the hands of a gangster. The surviving brother decides to take revenge. Through this process, we learn about the futility of this world. Nothing is real, and no one is committed to anyone. <br /> <br /> Amitabh gave the fulfillment of his life. New actor Arian gave a good presentation. The actress who played Amitabhaâ€™s wife stole the show. Her role was small, but she portrayed her role so zealously that she was touched by one of her works. Chawla had a really great expression on her face, but her role was very limited and she was not allowed to fully express herself. <br /> <br /> An excellent film by Raj Kumar Santoshi. His films always give some message to the audience. His films are similar to the novels of Nanak Singh (a Punjabi novelist whose novels always had a purpose and are aimed at social evil) because they have a real message for the audience. They are interesting, and also give lessons.
