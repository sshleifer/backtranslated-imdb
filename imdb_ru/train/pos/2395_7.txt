Although it was unfortunate to get to the festival route here in Austin (SXSW Film), when we were tired of things like Shakespeare in love and Elizabeth, this film deserves an audience. An inside look at the production of the Scottish Play, which the actors call Macbeth, creating it to avoid a curse, is a clear, effective and stylish treatment of the treachery that happens to the troupe. With a surprisingly memorable score, and it looks and sounds much better than its small budget suggests, this is a quiet gem, not world-class, but completely satisfying.
