Each child has the film that he inserts in VHS, when he has nothing to do or when there is a nanny next to him. It was that movie for me. <br /> <br /> I can tell you the whole story for sure, I had to watch it at least 100 times, and I can say that this is a good film for children / family. <Br /> <br /> I still have a cassette, I haven't watched it for 5 years, but maybe I will get to it this week and be a child for the day. <br /> <br /> You just need to love caring bears and their patronage. <br /> <br />
