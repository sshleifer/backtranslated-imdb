When it first came out, my dad brought it home — we were amazed at it — it was so different from everything we saw before. Last night I was looking for a specific film and again found The Eye of the Mind. The box is falling apart, and I'm surprised that the tape is still working! Although this is not high-quality graphics "Finding Nemo", it is still very good. They have to sell it again - this is a benchmark for computer animation. Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> This is what it is: <br /> <br /> The Mind's Eye is an impressive time odyssey. Your journey begins at the dawn of creation and passes through the growth of man and technology. Travel in the world of abstractions and into the future with breathtaking computer animations. <br /> <br /> The Mind's Eye combines the imagination of more than 300 of the world's most talented computer animation artists with powerful, original soundtrack music. This unique collaboration takes you on an incredible journey to the Eye of Mind.
