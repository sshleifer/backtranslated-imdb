No, I'm not joking. If you ever, ever, have a chance to see this film, watch it. If you need to cut off your hand to see this, take a look. It's worth it. <br /> <br /> Fatty Drives The Bus is like no other movie you've ever seen. He takes the trash movie and turns it into a work of art. Although it contains bad cadres, idiotic characters, bad dialogue, strange game and cinematography that relate to public access in Iowa, it actually succeeds in achieving its goal as a film. He aspires to be the dumbest, strangest, dumbest movie you've ever seen. And the boy will succeed. <br /> <br /> I'll post a story for those of you who are worried about such things (obviously, the filmmakers have not done this), but in fact you don’t need to pay too much attention, because the whole plot of the film is presented in very long text, played before the opening credits. In any case, FDTB (as its fans call it) is the story of a Chicago bus tour led by Satan. You see, Jesus is in the city, and all the passengers on the bus must die, and all their souls would go to hell, except with Jesus in the city, the footman in hell dismisses the work, and this makes Satan angry, because Well, he doesn’t like to look a fool in front of a guy, so he decides to get the people on the bus to directly give him their souls, but he is a devil, so he needs to disguise, otherwise who would go on tour with him, so he disguises himself as Roger and gets on the bus where the driver never not mentioned by name, but he's kind of fat, so I think he lsty. The bus (and the riders) are in a dangerous collision! <br /> <br /> Examples of a madness: the name is repeated on the screen 3 times. I do not know why. The character appears in the bus in the middle of the trip without explaining the reasons or explanations, sometimes sitting next to the others, and they look at her as if she does not belong. I do not know why. Two characters fall in love and exchange longing looks, which are actually repeated again and again. I do not know why. After Satan gives a minute monologue about turning into a human form, the title card “Satan is going to transform” flashes. I do not know why. One of the characters is a woman who, obviously, is a man in drag, and other characters call her “glamorous Bridget”. I do not know why. <br /> <br /> If one good thing happened once during my internship in Trome last summer, she received my own copy of Fatty Drives The Bus.
