Not sure if it was right or wrong, but I read other comments before looking short. I have to say that I do not agree with most of the negative comments or problems that people have encountered. <br /> <br /> As the first director of the Lone Wolf, I like to see things that I can aspire to, not necessarily from professionals, but from people who just get wet, like me. <br /> <br /> If this is also true from the first timer as I read, I welcome the effort. Great job in this regard! There were some comments about the music. I thought it was pretty good for the part. Some people say that it somehow agitated for a while, but I found that it created tension without having (we) necessarily realize it, and when he pulled a hum, and the guitar began to crackle chords, as if we knew that rails was a train, but we understand that it is only now moving. Yes, there is a 180 degree slip, but it happens. Has anyone else seen how Hugh's dirty shirt turned white (near the end, in the rain) in "Australia"? See how much money and people were behind this movie! For God's sake, give the child a rest! In general, I think it was very well done. It is hardly worth mentioning only 2 things: don’t come up to a shiny brass picture frame with a camera, and I would just display the splashes on the first pictures for a photo so people don’t necessarily know what it is. <br /> <br /> My experience taught me that making a film is not difficult, it just takes time to learn how to do it, and then time to do it, and then you better spend a little more time to think about all the details. which you need to remove before calling "post-production time!" IMHO, it seems that director / screenwriter Ryan Jafri did his homework, and if this is really his first report card, I would give him an "A". The rest are accountable at the director’s office for hooliganism.
