"Guy" can not be a classic, but it is certainly a good, funny comedy. The plot focuses on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up in the morning after her bachelor party without a memory and Becky (Julia Stiles) lies naked in her bed. Before he can understand what happened, he throws Becky out of his apartment because his fiance Karen (Selma Blair) is coming. After that, as you could imagine, chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene in “A Guy Thing” makes you laugh. The funniest moments happen when Paul imagines what might happen if he says Karen. Selma Blair is a really talented comedian, and the worst thing about this film is that it is underused. Although it turns out to be more funny than Stiles' character, which is actually not that interesting. Of course, not every comedy is perfect. <br /> <br /> As I said, “A Guy Thing” is not a classic, but not bad, 7/10.
