One of the best documentaries released in recent years. Some moments ... <br /> <br /> 1. Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela in 1998, his support came mainly from the poorer regions of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, as a result of a coup, Chavez was briefly overthrown. At the time, Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnach O'Brien were in Caracas shooting a documentary on Chávez for British television. Their film tells about the coup and its consequences, and electrically captures the story unfolding in place, outside and inside the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> 3. Chavez sought to free Venezuela from the free market policies imposed on him by the United States. Despite the fact that Venezuela’s oil was already in state ownership, it was managed by private individuals who Chavez wanted to replace. <br /> <br /> 4. Although Venezuela is the fourth largest oil supplier in the world, it is still overwhelmed by poverty, its resources are literally sucked by foreign transnational corporations. <br /> <br /> 5. The documentary film begins with the image of Chávez’s early years as president before the coup. The focus is on its popularity among the poor and its various politicians who have become popular among the local residents of the working class (educational plans, the distribution of oil revenues, democracy at the grassroots level, etc.). <br /> <br /> 6. Chavez was a huge supporter of education and printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan constitution, encouraging children and adults to study and understand it. <br /> <br /> 7. When Chavez came to power, he immediately promised to redistribute the oil profits. It is clear that this unnerved the oil companies. <br /> <br /> 8. The media war has begun. Six private television channels quickly began to confront the state television channel. They questioned Chavez’s motives, sanity and sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9. Without media support, a coup would not have been successful. The film makes it clear that coups depend heavily on the media to disseminate information and that the news can be easily fabricated. <br /> <br /> 10. Under the guise of “restoring democracy,” the opposition silenced the state television station, dissolved the National Electoral Commission, the Supreme Court, the National Assembly, and took over the management of the armed forces. <br /> <br /> 11. Monetary interests, supported by the military elite (encouraged by the United States and the CIA), organized a march of citizens through the presidential palace to carry out a coup. The snipers shot Chavez’s supporters, but private media edited the footage so that it seemed that the return fire was aimed at the opposition march, which was actually safely redirected. <br /> <br /> 12. The police began a violent shooting against supporters of Chávez, which led to further bloodshed on the streets. <br /> <br /> 13. Captive Chavez refused to resign. Of course, the media / government then lied, saying that he resigned, but Chavez’s cabinet members told the truth to the international community, which eventually returned the message to Venezuela on cable television. <br /> <br /> 14. People rebelled, putting pressure on the return of their elected president, which only a referendum can constitutionally replace. <br /> <br /> 8.9 / 10 - This document takes a little over an hour, but it is too short. However, this is an exciting part of journalism, which deals with a form of “war in the media,” which is rarely affected. It is a great addition to the “Battle of Algeria”. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing once.
