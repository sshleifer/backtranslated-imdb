Disney may just be something here. First, they had “Remember the Titans” with Denzel, a story based on the truth about sports and a small town in Central America. Now with Quaid and The Rookie ... another sports story based on truth. <br /> <br /> Both films sometimes make you cry, and both make you smile and feel warm after watching. My wife and I starred in “Novice”, and we expected it to be a great movie with good health. We were not let down when we were asked if we would buy it on DVD, when it came out, it was easy. Definitely.
