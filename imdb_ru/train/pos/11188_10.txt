I'm a big fan of Stephen King, and this film made me even a big King fan. Pet Sematary about the Creed family. They have just moved to a new home and seem happy. But behind their house there is a pet graveyard. New neighbor Cred Jude (played by Fred Gwyn) explains the burial ground behind the pet graveyard. This burial ground is pure evil. Jude tells Louis Creed that when you bury a person (or any other pet) in a grave, they will come back to life. The only problem is that when they return, they are NOT the same person, they are evil. Soon after Jude explains everything about the pet, everything starts to go to hell. I will no longer explain, because I do not want to give away some of the main parts of the film. The acting that Pet Sematary had was pretty good, but it did require a bit of work. The story was one of the main parts of this film, mainly because it was so original and exciting. This movie has many makeup effects that make the movie more creepy and intimidating. One of the most important reasons why this film caused a chill behind my back was actually a makeup effect. There is one character in this movie that is really freaky. This character is "Zelda". This particular character appears in the film about three times, to be exact. Zelda is the sister of Rachel Creed, who died many years ago, but Rachel still haunts her. The first time Zelda appears in a film is usually not scary because she doesnâ€™t speak or something, but the second time is the worst, and, frankly, the second time scares me to death. There is nothing bad in this film, it is almost perfect. Pet Sematary offers excellent fears, a pretty good game, a great storyline and fascinating makeup. This is truly one of the most beloved horror movies of all time. 10 out of 10.
