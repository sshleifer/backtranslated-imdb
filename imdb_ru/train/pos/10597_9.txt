I recommend photos that try something different. Many films seem to be just a repetition of old ideas, so I highly recommend Passport to Pimlico. <br /> <br /> The film was shot immediately after the Second World War, and the post-war shortage and rationing seem to lead the Londoners to "tremble". The film focuses on a tiny area of ​​London called Pimlico. They are also tired of not being able to buy what they want, but do not see a way out of it. This happens until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and charter, which officially called this area a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago! They claim that with this document they can go around all the coupons and coupons and live as they want, because it turns out that they are really NOT British subjects! Where the film will go from and how the crisis will eventually be resolved is what you should see for yourself. Leave it to the brilliant mind of Ealing Studios to come up with this gem!
