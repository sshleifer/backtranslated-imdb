I do not know if I am strange, but I really liked this film. <br /> <br /> Returning to the Lake Hut is, of course, a continuation of another of my favorite films Lake Hut. In fact, I think I liked this film even more than the first one. I also thought the cast in this film was great, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also liked the story as a whole. I liked the fact that this second film was focused on the Stanley Lake Hut screenplay - it was not a superfluous film about how Stanley captures other girls and drowns them. - If you are looking for some deep meaning, then this film is probably not for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way to spend two hours, then watch it. I probably already killed at least ten hours while watching this movie. :)
