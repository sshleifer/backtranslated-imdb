This is how a family movie should be! There are several films of recent years that were aimed at families or children who are truly worthy of viewing by the public; but this is one of them. My whole family left the film, delighted, entertained, blinded and happy. We still quote little jokes from this place. The children loved him, and so did we (my husband and I were 36 and 32, respectively)! <br /> <br /> In addition to the beautiful and vivid animation, the characters (no matter how small they are, and imaginary, what they are)) are very well developed. There is not one of them that you cannot empathize with. Personalities embodying these little creatures are well-pronounced voice talents combined with the skill and craftsmanship of some of the best Disney animators. This is a film worthy of Walt Disney itself. I think Mr. Disney will wholeheartedly approve this new film ... Flick, Dot and their tiny heroes colleagues can become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time. <br /> <br /> This one family leaves the theater, wanting to see again .. and buy to buy on video or DVD. I am eager to see it again ... to pick up something that I could miss the first time. (Never before have I seen my children identify themselves so quickly and vividly with the characters and hug them ... my daughter still talks about the little “Point”.) <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, emotional, smart and wonderful Fun for the whole family!
