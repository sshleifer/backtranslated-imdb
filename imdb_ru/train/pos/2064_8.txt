ScareCrow was one of the funniest killers I've ever seen in this act! Plus he is really vigorous most of the time, he was jumping around, which was awesome! He also had a great voice, I mean, he was just perfect for him. The story lines were excellent too. I love how the baby shower was transferred to ScareCrow, it was awesome! In addition, he had a reason for all this murder, which I mean after what these people did to him ..... I would also be angry ScareCrows look really good! his look gives this man "OMG!" Reaction when they see it! What was great, his looks were funny! Those people were stupid who looked so long! They had to take a look and run for their lives ... although it doesnâ€™t matter!
