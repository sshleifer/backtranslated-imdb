Obvious parallels between Walt Disney's bedknobs and Broomsticks and C.S. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia are pretty obvious. There are more coincidences than in comparison between "Poor" and "Brooms" than with Mary Poppins, although there were many of the same creative talents in the two Disney films. <br /> <br /> As in the Chronicles of Narnia, some English children who leave London participate in it. during the blitz and coming to live in the country. And these children have to deal with the world of magic. But unlike C.S. Lewis, the Rawlins children have magic that invades their world and helps defeat the people who confuse it here and now. Do not retreat to a fairy kingdom such as the children of Pevensey. <br /> <br /> There is no impressive Walt Disney philosophy here, except it’s not good to associate with witches, even students like Angels of Lansbury, who learn their magic from Charlatan like David Tomlinson. Miss Lansbury did not fall into the number of the most profitable performers for nothing. She carries her own magic, which even boys with special effects at Disney could not surpass. And they got an Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in this section for this film. <br /> <br /> Two performers said goodbye to the films in Bedknob and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea played her last role in this film, she honored many films in the United Kingdom with one of her favorite performers in the music hall. And this grand actor Reginald Owen as a retired general who heads the Old House Guard in war and song is perfect for viewers around the world. <br /> <br /> The team of Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman, who wrote the score for Mary Poppins, wrote a good and useful article. The era of disbelief was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to Theme from Val. Personally, I really like David Tomlinson’s tribute to those very bright London streets, like Portabello Road. <br /> <br /> “Bloody hands” and “Brooms” is a wonderful fantasy film that still lasts well for almost 40 years. Imagine how it will be with computer graphics.
