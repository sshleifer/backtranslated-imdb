To begin with, I loved the Goth channel 1, there were a lot of classic jokes, including that hapless canoe guy who always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, he still plays the same guy in the Goethe -channel 2 film, but, in my opinion, his performance is not as funny as in the first film, in fact, you don’t notice it at all. What made me think about this film is the choice of boats, there are only racing boats in this film, of course they are fast, but they do not create waves, like the large floating mansions used in the first film, I liked the old ones better and these New boats make one of the last scenes look ridiculous when a man in a canoe suddenly jumps out of it to dodge the “big waves” of these small fast boats. True minus. You have to admit that we no longer live in the same Sweden as in 1974. This film also contains a bit more violence than the first. Although the film was great in general. I just concentrated on some of the minuses in which I was disappointed, but the rest of the film met my expectations, so take a look! It costs money.
