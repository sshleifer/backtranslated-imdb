I would not be surprised if pressure was put on Soderberg so that he would not make the pre-revolutionary Cuba as graphically corrupt as it was. Simply listing a few statistics does not help with youth. However, the first part, which is almost completely filmed in the jungle, really reflects the feeling of this place, especially when crossing the mountainous regions of Cuba. I liked Che Guevara's Del Toro interpretation. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, also did an excellent job, no matter what. It is clear that Soderberg does not look down on these people, but it is also clear that he is not going to bring their case to the “Yankees” who are far from the recent past. Some of the more important historical aspects contradict what I read. As far as I know, Castro did not care for the Soviet Union until all attempts to gain recognition from the United States were exhausted. But in other aspects, he is right, especially with regard to the robbery of expatriates, since the island has come under the control of the rebels. The treasury of the country is left empty.
