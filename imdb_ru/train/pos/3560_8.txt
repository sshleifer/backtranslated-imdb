Joseph L. Mankiewicz is not remembered by the majority today as one of the best directors in the history of Hollywood, but this film proves that it is. Having already achieved success, creating complex American dramas, such as “A Letter to Three Wives” and “Everything about Eve”, as well as successfully adapting Shakespeare to life in the film “Julius Caesar,” Mankiewicz does an amazing job of turning this Broadway hit into a film and style Marlon Brando is as beautiful as Sky Masterson, even if he cannot sing too well. He is the only actor who could handle it with his pure coldness and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and does an excellent job with the role of Nathan Detroit. Gene Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown, and her scenes with Brando sizzle with great chemistry. All the minor actors play their part, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry the Horses in a very funny role. Nevertheless, Mankiewicz should be commended for bringing to the screen a wonderful musical in such a way that it seemed authentic in many scenes, but still remains a story in his own world. In general, Guys and Dolls is a great musical, and it works on many levels, which usually should not be.
