Although I liked On the Town more, I really liked it. I'm new when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Although I heard about them, I have never seen anything with them in it until recently. The first person I saw was Singin in the Rain, which made me a Gin fan. I think this is also better. But I thought that this film is good, and, like in all films, there are some parts that are better than others, but in my book itâ€™s a terrific movie, and I love it. Frank and Gene make a good team. I have not seen them together in Take me to a baseball game. But I stick to my weapon, saying that I really enjoyed it, and that I love it!
