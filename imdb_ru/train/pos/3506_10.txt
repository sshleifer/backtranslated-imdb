Peter Sollett created a charming portrait about real people living in poverty in the Lower East Side of New York, or Loiside, as the locals know. <br /> <br /> Mr. Sollett’s heart is in the right place when he looks at this dysfunctional family, which is typical of different “inner cities” of the country. Mr. Sollett emphasizes the positive in the story he represents. These are mostly good children, children of parents who left them, and whose grandmother took under her wing. <br /> <br /> Instead of presenting his characters as losers, Mr. Sollett shows the positive side they all have. These children do not use drugs or steal because they are poor. If this story were written by Hollywood, we would see a parade of stereotypes, instead of children who are fighting, but in their hearts they are not defeated. <br /> <br /> Victor Rasuk, like Victor Vargas, was a revelation. He is natural. Like July March. Her character shows us a stupid girl who will not be deceived or forced to do what she does not want to do. Altagracia Guzman, as a grandmother is great. She expresses her disappointment at not being able to incline her grandchildren to the things she believes in and are so important to her. <br /> <br /> In general, thanks to Peter Sollett, it was a great picture.
