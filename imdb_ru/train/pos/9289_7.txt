In "The Barbarian and the Geisha," John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, the real envoy from the United States, who was responsible for actually opening Japan to international relations in the late 1850s. Before him, Commodore Perry mainly invaded Japan with gunboats and imposed a treaty in 1853 on the Japanese. Harris, who arrived a little later, worked the details and helped to ensure compliance - since many Japanese did not feel much inclined to comply with the first contract. All this is true and shown in the film. According to some other sources, I found that the romance between Harris and the Japanese geisha is mostly fantastic, and this romance is the main theme of this film (hence the name). <br /> <br /> My first reaction - the first time I saw this film was unexpected. John Wayne as a diplomat ?! When he plays diplomatically in most films, he says, please, and thank you, because he beats people !!!! So to see how he plays a person who is NOT a man of action and capable of playing a diplomatic game is really very strange. In fact, I can't remember too many actors in 1958 who would be more unusual for this role. By the way, I saw pictures of Harris and Wayne, which are almost not like him at all. <br /> <br /> However, despite the fact that there was a lot of freedom in the film with truth and strange actors, the film is still very watchable. Color cinema is good, the film shows a good understanding of Japanese customs and culture, and the acting is not bad. In general, a pleasant and watchable film, despite the fact that he is a strange cast. <br /> <br /> PS - Read the details of this movie. You will learn a little more about real characters, as well as the alleged fight between Wayne and the director (John Houston), where Wayne seems to have knocked him out !! Based on what I read about Houston and how he got along with the actors, I tend to believe in this case. And this is also a good example of John Wayne's “diplomacy”.
