A love trap is an independent film that you definitely need to watch. When I sat down to see the movie, I came with low expectations, but left with a blessing. The story is poetic, meaningful and creative. The writer pulls you on and on in every scene, allowing you to relate to realistic characters with which everyone can identify themselves. The film allowed me to think about my life and what I consider to be love. The film showed what love is, action, not emotions. I was also impressed with the quality of the cinematography and the film soundtrack. The whole presentation exceeded my expectations. I give the film with two thumbs and recommend it to all ages and backgrounds.
