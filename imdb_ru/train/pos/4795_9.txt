Whenever I hear a film being advertised, because it has no sex, violence, obscene language, special effects, and so on, my bp the detector goes out. Usually such a film is a sentimental bullshit that indulges people who don’t want to surprise anything, but claim how much they surpass us, passionless people. Therefore, when David Lynch in “True Story” began to receive such reviews, I was alarmed, especially since I was not a fan of his other “lofty” story, “Elephant”. Despite all the stunning images and the great game in this film, we were more interested in preaching to us than inspiring us. <br /> <br /> I didn't have to worry. DIRECT STORY is an honest film, not a saccharin. Most of this is due to the fact that Lynch and the writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney talk about this directly and simply for the most part. Stright has a couple of sermons I could do without, and the grains harvested are repeated too much, but this is just nagging. There are no hard messages, no sentimental lines to twitch our emotions, and no condescension towards us and his characters. Instead, they depend on a story that builds its own strength, and this is true, and to the final scene, we are genuinely touched. <br /> <br /> Of course, the cast of Richard Farnsworth adds a realistic role. He is really the one who looks as if he has experienced a lot, but is still persistent, and, with the exception of those sermons, the desire that he has to return with his brother does not seem too sentimental, because you can feel that here someone also lived for a long time and saw too much to be angry for a long time. And he knows that his time is running out, so he wants to make peace not only with his brother, but also with his life. Sissy Spacek also does an excellent, ill-mannered job as Straight's daughter. And although I'm a boy from the city and suburbs, the landscape of Iowa and Wisconsin is beautifully shot, and I want to at least someday go.
