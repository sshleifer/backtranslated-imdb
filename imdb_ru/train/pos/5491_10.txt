Although we know how the story ends, this is an exciting movie that plays almost like a political thriller. During the calm before the storm, we meet with Hugo Chavez as a charismatic man the size of life, which is inextricably linked to the mestizos, who make up 80% of the population, but were previously excluded from the political process of Venezuela and its oil wealth. He seems as loyal to them as he is to him. He travels the country at a feverish pace, reaches out to Campesino, addresses huge crowds, hugs and kisses ordinary people, accepts letters on scraps of paper and hears requests for help. People are thrilled that one of them reached the highest office in the country. There is a tense sense of hope and optimism that change for the better is approaching a purulent barrio. <br /> <br /> But not everyone is happy with the situation. Purebred Castilian Spanish elite, which is a small minority, but previously controlled all the wealth, full of bitterness and resentment. One of the most unintentionally hilarious moments in the film is the case where the twin Anne Coulter at a meeting of residents in the exclusive gated community complains about the half-breeds: "They have no idea of ​​fight or sacrifice." After a few minutes, the speaker tells the congregation that “beware of your servants — they may be supporters of Chávez.” Duh! Of course it is. <br /> <br /> In a late night interview alone with the film crew, Chavez talks about his soul, telling the story of his grandfather. He can be a sensitive, poetic person, albeit with a foolish, even clown sense of humor (as we saw when he applied to the UN and called Bush the devil). <br /> <br /> Then the storm begins to grow by force, as the coup organizers call for mass protest and cynically manipulate their supporters to change the route at the last moment and pass through the presidential palace, knowing that Chavez’s supporters surround it, and violence is inevitable . <br /> <br /> Another element of the plot falls into place when the snipers on the roofs begin to fire at Chávez’s supporters, some of whom are firing back. The local equivalent of Fox News shows this return fire and claims that supporters of Chávez are mass demonstrators. Then the camera moves away and shows that there are no protesters - the street is empty! The protesters went the other way. It goes without saying that the footage from the empty street was edited by frantic private television channels against Chávez (who conducted a constant propaganda campaign, calling Chávez mentally ill and sexually obsessed with Fidel Castro.) Immediately after the coup, we see the instigators and their propagandists in the media openly bragging on television about how they manipulated the situation, with reckless disregard for the lives of supporters and opponents. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers continue to be in the center of this chaos. The rapidly changing situation: a military coup surrounds the palace and threatens to bomb it. In the end, Chavez gives up to avoid bloodshed, but refuses to resign and is carried off to an offshore island, where the plane is waiting for him - where? United States? How can the rest of the cabinet avoid arrest and defeat this armed conspiracy of right-wing generals and ultra-rich businessmen who are closely associated with the Bush administration? Watch the movie and find out! <br /> <br /> If you are only familiar with Hugo Chavez and Venezuela from the American media, then you know nothing. He is not a "not elected tyrant" and does not "rule by decree" - he is extremely popular, having been elected and reelected several times with more than 60% of the vote (which George W. Bush never achieved) and by dedication he inspires ordinary Venezuelan people, in the end account, the reason why the coup failed. <br /> <br /> This is an unusual film about an extraordinary person in an unusual situation. The skill of cinematographers is to be unobtrusive and allow stories to unfold through the voices of Venezuelans at every level, from the barrio to the presidential palace, noisy scenes, chaos and confusion, from which a whole, tense, exciting and moving emerges. Do not miss!
