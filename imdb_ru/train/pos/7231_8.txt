Normal feline and muscular tricks abound until Jerry jumps into a bottle with invisible ink. He has a brilliant idea to torment Tom without his knowledge. The cat becomes wise and tries to do something to make him "see" Jerry, even if it does not protect him from a fool. Of course, Jerry invites Butch into the game, also known as "The Killer" or "Spike" (even if he was late in the short film, and his contribution is minimal). A vivid animated short film that reminded me of one with a white mouse that scares Tom so much. , Most of the jokes work and all forcibly, like any good Tom and Jerry. This funny cartoon can be found on one of the DVDs from the Spotlight collection "Tom & Jerry" <br /> <br /> My rating: B +
