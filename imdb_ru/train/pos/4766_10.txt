It is unusual to see a film in which the performance of one actor is so good that you can feel that the film will not be interesting, if there is one, without his presence. <br /> <br /> Despite not outstanding leadership - in fact, there are many scenes that seem to be filmed too quickly and carelessly - a seemingly low-budget, strange story about a man who wants to take the place of the retired priest, and one more week - the presence of Pierre Fresnay is so impressive that from the very beginning to the terrible end it is shocking. <br /> <br /> I’ve never seen and can’t imagine a better performance in the future, even Paul Scofield starred in Man for All Seasons. <br /> <br /> In fact, the end can even be considered ridiculous if Fresnay didn’t play as a defended priest who returns to the church after committing a crime. <br /> <br /> “Je suis Maurice Morand, prétre catholique” “(“ I am Maurice Moran, a Catholic priest ”) said so brilliantly that you can forget the madman This led to the fact that there is another scene in this film , in which Moran - who, despite being removed from execution, is still a priest - kills a huge amount of vine in the cabaret. turning it into the blood of Christ. <br /> <br /> Gerard - a person who wants to return Morand to the Church or replace him with himself - should drink it if he does not want to leave him in a cabaret. He does this in the middle of a round of applause and applause from people who think he just drinks three of four liters of wine. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, the dialogue between the Morand and the garbage collector is also remarkable. "Do you carry men too?" asks Morand, who hates himself for what he just did. “That would be too much work” is a smart answer. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film should not be commented on, but definitely worth a look because of the very strong and strangely emotional atmosphere created all the time. <br /> <br /> I think that “Le défroqué” is a very strange film, but all viewers should watch it - if they are good Catholics, then it is necessary - because it is a very rare gem in the history of cinema. <br /> <br />
