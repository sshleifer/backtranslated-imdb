“Hollywood North” is a euphemism for the film industry when they went to Canada to make films because of tax breaks and cheaper costs in a civilized city like Toronto, in this case later in Vancouver. Peter O'Brien, the director, has probably seen a lot of California invaders that this film seems to be the right way to deal with the arriving personalities trying to capitalize on the economy represented by Canada. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that Moonlight, a successful novel written by a Canadian author, turns into Flight into Bogota, which has nothing to do with the original film. Michael Baytes, obsessed with what is happening in Iran, got an excellent selfish role, and he was offered the main role, which turned out to be a disaster. <br /> <br /> The film says that too many Cooks spoiled the broth, which seems to be related to the final product, which was saved by its producer Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan, who shot a documentary about the film, which is being shot in Toronto, parts of the film are finally turning into a cohesive film. <br /> <br /> The shooting process is fun, and acting is, in general, good.
