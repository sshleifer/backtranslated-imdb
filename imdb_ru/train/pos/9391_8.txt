Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine, but what gives this neo-noir juice is the eerie, brutal nature of Hopper and the meanness of J.T. Walsh. <br /> <br /> The tramp is mistaken for an assassin and tries to make a little dough out of it, but falls through his head. <br /> <br /> I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this film, when Cage enters a trailer in Wyoming to get drilling operations, with the help of his buddy ... and the first scene in Brokeback Mountain, when the character does the same the most! But that's another story. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper is at his best here ... insolent, one step ahead of the villainous, boiling and explosively cruel. J.T. Walsh (RIP) is also great, like a man with a dark past trying to live legally (well, almost). <br /> <br /> There are only 4 real characters here, with the exception of the difficult one - working deputy in Red Rock, Wyoming. The first turn starts early, and from there it is a pleasant adventure in the neo-noir style in some sleepy town. Satisfying. 8 points
