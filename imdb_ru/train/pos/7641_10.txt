Everyone plays their part in this "little good movie" very well. Belushi gets a chance to live part of his life differently, but in the end he understands that what he had will be as good or maybe even better. The film shows us that we must take advantage of the opportunities that we have, and not those that we do not have or cannot have. If you can make this movie on video for about $ 10, it will be an investment!
