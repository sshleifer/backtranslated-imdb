I don't think I could enjoy it anymore, although some things were troubling. I'm not going to say that if you haven't seen it ... you have to figure it out for yourself. In any case, what movie might be missing from the eyes of a puppy by Robert Downey Jr.? In general, the plot was developed enough. Nothing seemed too hasty, as happens in the movies. The characters were in good condition, and there were many funny scenes in it. The basic idea is that the story is very well connected, even if some aspects may be unsatisfactory ... in opinion. But, as I said, it's hard not to like movies with Robert Downey Jr.
