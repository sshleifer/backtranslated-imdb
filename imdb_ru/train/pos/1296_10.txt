Watching this film is extremely difficult, especially because it is aimed at the very essence of our whole life. But in the end it is a very beautiful and deeply touching film. Anyone who finds it cynical should say that he must have missed the point of the entire movie message. For those who really watch the film, they will see that the way problems are solved is absolutely necessary, and the result is ultimately encouraging. Of course, it is very difficult to watch, a complex subject and even cruel. However, it is extremely important for society and for all. This shows the peak of what world cinema is doing at the moment (I will not limit this term to only France), and everyone should try to see it. I will say that itâ€™s best to go with a clear head, not giving in to a conflict of opinion, and just let the film work for you.
