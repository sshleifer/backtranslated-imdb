Jiøí Trnka made his last short animation accusation of totalitarianism, which caused him problems in his native Czechoslovakia. The elements are few, the symbolism is simple, and its branded ornaments are almost absent here, which allows the viewer to focus on the fable.

The man refuses and is pursued by an ominous gloved hand. Nowadays, when the impression of the reality factor appears to be erased from most of the animations that are trying to replace the real world, it is nice to watch a movie, which makes its technique part of the fun.
