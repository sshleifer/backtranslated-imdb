This is not sophisticated, and no one in the credits has made a great career, but in general, because there are no known personalities; the film seems more realistic than some high-budget, well-made films. <br /> <br /> A film made for a few bucks that is worth seeing should give hope to all those who become cinematographers and wantbe actors. br /> <br /> The problem with this film is that it was made at the wrong time. Television took over the profits of the film industry, and this film was easily shown on television. In 1950, all tariffs on television will qualify for a rating of "G". The film industry began to make more "adult" films that could not be shown on television in those days when television did not dare to show the floor and skin of today's commercials.
