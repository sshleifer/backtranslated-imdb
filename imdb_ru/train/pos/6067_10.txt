Although I tend to agree with other comments made by people who have seen this film, I am ashamed to say that I like it more. Not often such a huge pile of the 80s can be found outside of Wham! video, so this is definitely worth a look (£ 0.79 per night at my local store!). Beware of insanely obvious seams and fasteners on the monster's costume, the fact that “hero” is very similar to Keith Chegvin, and such classic lines as the following: Angry wizard type: “Finally we met Cor ...” Cor: “Fascinating , is not it? "<br /> <br /> Fabulous !! I also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon, like a bird carrying a handsome hero to a safe place (among other such "interesting and attractive" assumptions about what happens in a real movie , none of them really happens. No, I'm not kidding ... the sea is not really raging or a fierce bird is just trying to interest you ... a classic in my opinion. This film gets 10 for pure entertainment value !!
