This is a great film from the lost age of the reactionary drama created for television. My all-time favorite actor, Robert Culp, cleverly traced the path through tense liberal justice and faith in the system, conservative conservatism and the fear of crime, as well as murderous psychosis. Teens are a collection of pure mocking evil stereotypes, and in the end, because of this film, the episodes “Dragne” look impartial in comparison. But what really shines in this is the high tempo of the film, gradually building up fear and paranoia, as well as a sense of the entire California atmosphere. As I recall, the cars are really great. I give this movie 10 points and challenge anyone who watches this movie, rather than enjoying every minute. Remember, just because it is made for television does not mean that it is not great art.
