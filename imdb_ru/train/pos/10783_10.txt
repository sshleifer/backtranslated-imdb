I like this movie. Andy Griffith has not seen for a long time and felt that he is perfect for this role. I connected it with a comedy, but I am pleased to see that it is universal. <br /> <br /> It didn’t bother me that Dottie’s “anxiety disorder” could not be literally from a psychiatric textbook. There are millions of any phobias and neuroses, and they can take a wide range of quantitative and qualitative forms. She is clearly sensitive with extrasensory abilities, as her local Indians understood her, but not Angloses. It is no wonder that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric. <br /> <br /> Although it’s considered an easy “family film,” it’s actually more complex than it sounds. In addition, the turn of Hiram at the end was a pleasant surprise for me and tied all the previous actions into a bundle. It is interesting to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance.
