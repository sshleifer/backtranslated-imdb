After reading the book, the movie is a bit "thin", but still it is one of the greatest films ever made. Cheryl Lee is beautiful, and Nick Nolte is really "voneneguty." He does a great job expressing feelings from a book to a film. Not many films attract the feeling of a book as well as Mother's Night.
