First, this film does not have to be brilliant and suggestive, as many other reviewers compare it. The first review says something like those who love it, knows nothing about horror cinema, apparently the opposite. If you look back after the film, it really should not have been convincing, it was a low-budget ipeck. But in fact, it was all he wanted, it was intended to hit the audience with a clear shock value (and all the flaws in his visual presentation were much less noticeable in the original version of VHS). <br /> <br /> I gave this a high score because he achieved his goal, and although he was not absolutely terrible (in a non-shock sense), he made me a little sick and completely paranoid / pessimistic (I did not) do not trust anyone during the week, because I didnâ€™t want to wake up agitated and tortured)
