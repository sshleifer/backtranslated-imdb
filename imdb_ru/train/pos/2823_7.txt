MGM was not sure how to sell Garbo when she first arrived in Hollywood. Meyer really believed in her, and her appearance in Torrent justified it. She did not speak a word of English, so she must have had difficulty working, and Ricardo Cortes did not make her life so easy. <br /> <br /> The title stream is the Juskar River that flows through it. sleepy little village in spain. Leonora (Greta Garbo) someday hopes that her voice will bring great wealth and happiness to her struggling parents. Leonora and Don Raphael (Ricardo Cortez) are in love, but he is under the thumb of his mother and cannot force her to agree to his marriage. Meanwhile, Dona Brulle (Marta Mattox) evicted Leonora's parents from their home, and they sent Leonora to Paris in the hope of giving her a chance to continue her singing career. Leonora sends a note to Raphael, urging him to remember his promise and go with her. His mother is furious and forbids him to go - so, of course, he gives in to her request. <br /> <br /> Years go by. Leonora has a new personality - she became La Brunna, the toast of the Paris Opera. Rafael was the way his mother wished - he is running for office and caring for a “safe” young girl, Remedios (Gertrude Olmsted), who is the heir to the “pig”. Mack Swain plays her father. Leonora decides to visit her old house, and I agree - why she did not help her mother. Her mother still lives in the family house, works skivvi and washes the dishes. Leonora and Raphael meet, but Leonora is full of ridicule. Garbo is so charmingly handsome that it is hard to believe that he could be happy with Remedios. <br /> <br /> A dam bursts through, and the city floods a flood. Leonora's house is on the path of a raging river, but when Raphael tries to save her, he discovers that she is safe. Then they stir up their romance. In this film, there is a “horizontal” love scene, very similar to the one in the movie “Flesh and the Devil.” <br /> <br /> Donja Brill spreads rumors about how Leonora really got her wealth, and Leonora's mom believes her and tells Leonore to go. Rafael meets Leonora just before she is about to tour America. He is going to go with her again, but again brings her. He spends so much time listening to how other people ruin her reputation - “what she does for you, but pulls you down.” The irony is that she just got the highest government job for him if he goes with her. After a few years, they meet again - she is as fresh and energetic as before - he looks older than his years, bowing in mediocrity. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a good movie with a positive message that follows your heart. <br /> <br /> Lucien Littlefield does an excellent job with Cupido, a barber and an old and faithful friend of Leonora. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
