I can be biased, I am the author of the novel Club of Hungry Bachelors, which was published in 1994. The screenplay was written by my good friend and the hungry bachelor Fred Dresham who inspired the hero Marlon in the film. I could not be more pleased with the trailer, I hope to see the film in full, and I will comment further. But George Fox, who plays Delmar Young, my character, is a star. She bears the main part of emotional conductors in great shape. I could not have done better myself! It looks like real people, hardly guided by the formula, and, fortunately, leads my statement against racial prejudices at home, gracefully and cordially.
