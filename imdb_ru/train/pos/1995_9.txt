I just saw it recently, after almost forty years. This is good, especially the outstanding songs of Lionel Bart. (“Who will buy” with its magic counterpoint, is simply one of many outstanding ones.) that rating G (General) means "completely devoid of conflict." <br /> <br /> Characterizing him as unsuitable for children reminds me of a description I once saw the Wizard of Oz: a girl arrives in a strange country and kills the first person she encounters. Then she sets off on a journey with three male companions and kills her again.
