I rented dominoes at whim, not even suspecting that it was inspired by real history, and although this is the least likely and real biopic you probably will see. I find it pretty awesome. <br /> <br /> With the writing of Richard Kelly, he collects a lot of stories and narratives in 2 hours of pure entertainment. And once you have seen it more than once, you get it and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Domino is a model that has become a headhunter and leaves a perfect life in Hollywood for a not so subtle or perfect career. It has a sharp acid trip style, provided by director Tony Scott. And thanks to the dynamic music and editing, it provides a visual flash to keep your attention, with brilliant performances and unexpected comedies, the film is well made and enjoyable and should reach a wider audience. <br /> <br /> I offer this to anyone who wants to think and have fun at the same time for 2 hours.
