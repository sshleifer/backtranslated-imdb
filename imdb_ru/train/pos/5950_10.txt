This movie is great. The plot is very faithful to the book written by Mark Twain. The film begins with a scene in which Hank sings a song with a group of children called "When You Drown Your Finger at the Moon." It reminds me of Sinatra's Great Expectations song, it's fun and inspiring. The music is great everywhere, and my favorite song is sung by the King, Hank (Bing Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamor. In general, a great family movie or even a great movie about dates. This is a movie that you can watch again and again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is gorgeous. I love this film!! If you liked Danny Kay in the court jester, then you will surely enjoy this movie.
