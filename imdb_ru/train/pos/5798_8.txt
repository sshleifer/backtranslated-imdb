I first saw it when they showed it in the Easter time of 1993/4, and then I didn’t really think about it. I bought it on DVD last summer when I started to get involved in Michael Jackson (I used to like his music), and I liked him more I am older. This is a good film, but it will not be such a classic film as “The Sound of Music”, “West Side Story”, “The Wizard of Oz”, etc. Michael Jackson, as an actor, was good, like other actors. There were disturbing scenes when little girl Katie spanked the gangster Frankie Lideo, played by Joe Sands. The scene that scared me when I was younger was when Michael turns into a robot. My favorite song in the movie was Smooth Criminal, I think it was better than Thriller, in my opinion.
