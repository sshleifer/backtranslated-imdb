The collapse of the stock market in 1929 and the subsequent depression almost destroyed the American musical theater, in fact it was the last fatal blow to vaudeville. Those who were behind the curtain suffered as much as those who were ahead. <br /> <br /> In order to stimulate the economy of show business and its own economy, theater director without work, James Cagney, offers a brilliant idea. Live production of relevant prologues to films that are shown in various cinemas that arise overnight from old cinemas. Some other participants will find out about this, and the competition continues. <br /> <br /> “Light Parade” is my favorite Busby Berkeley movie. This gives James Cagney a chance to show some of his versatility as a dancer as well as a tough guy. Retiring, Cagney said that, despite the fact that he often showed his several and far away musicals from each other, he was hardly disturbed by some of his direct dramatic films. He wanted him to do some more musicals in his career, and I would like him to do it. <br /> <br /> Of course, the staging of these Busby Berkeley extravaganzas on the stage of the Palace of Cinema challenges all logic and reason. But it is so creative and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell will sing three songs in the Parade of Light, Ah, the Moon is Here, Hotel for the Newlyweds and At the Falls, the last two with Ruby Kieler further strengthen this team. Ruby sings and dances with Powell in the last two, and she collaborates with James Cagney in my favorite room from Footlight Parade, Shanghai Lil. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondel - Friday night Cagney at the theater. As in Blonde Crazy, she is the one who has a real brain in this duet, and her quick thinking helps him cope with some domestic problems that he has besides theatrical ones. One of the best roles Blondel. <br /> <br /> Look for Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sautern in the choir through the IMDb pages for both of them. John Garfield is briefly spotted in the Shanghai Lil Room. And in the scene at the beginning of the film, producer Guy Kibby leads Cagney to the cinema, where they show Western B with John Wayne in the lead role. The voice of the duke is unmistakable. But what is even more unusual is that in the short video he is shown in the scene with Frank McHugh, who plays another assistant Cagney in the Light Parade Parade. I think the Warner brothers played a little joke there. I have to believe that this clip was intentional. <br /> <br /> The Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley in his surrealistic performance.
