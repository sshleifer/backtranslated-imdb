Personally, I love this film and the novel very much (at first I read the book and decided to watch the movie). First of all, the plot is really original and one of a kind. The acting is also great and I love the cast. Judd Crandall (played by Fred Gwynn) is perfect for his role and really sells it to you. There are also some banal lines (damn it, if they were to be commonplace), but they really will lift your spirits and provide a good laugh. The atmosphere in Maine is really the perfect place to film this movie, and it seems to draw you all the way through the movie. Not only will you like it, but you will want to see it again and again, I recommend it 100% to any horror fan!
