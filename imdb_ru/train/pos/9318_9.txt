Red Skelton was another big star who moved easily from movies to television. <br /> <br /> His shows probably caused laughter in American families many years ago. <br /> <br /> He will start the show with an introductory monologue. After that we will have a lot of characters. Remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in a monologue? How can we ever forget San Fernando Red? I remember one episode when King Red introduced his queen, calling her his fatness. <br /> <br /> Know that Red used his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life. He lost his son from leukemia at the age of 11 or so. His wife, Georgia, died from suicide.
