Not to mention the best performance of Pierce Brosnon. Of course, Greg Kinnear is always great. Really, when was he really bad? I think this film is incredibly undervalued! The use of colors in this film is something completely different in the modern film world, where every other film has a blue payback filter. I also love the way they used the song Asia. Proof that even what was once considered something of a cheese can be really cool placed correctly. <br /> <br /> I did my first function when it appeared. Due to the fact that my film was a hit, I had to check out something in the genre that was released. Seeing this, I am sure that it affected me in the process. It was pretty cool when my movie got on IMDb that he would recommend this movie if you liked mine. What others have to do, I have no idea what makes an even more interesting coincidence. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
