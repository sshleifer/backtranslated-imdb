This is one of the most soothing, relaxing and beautifully made animated films I've ever seen. With beautiful music throughout the film, sounds and music can make you feel in the film! This film is great not only for children, but also for adults. He teaches you lessons, such as never forgetting who you are, you can do everything you hold on, as well as courage and boldness. This film can sometimes make you cry, which is always nice in a movie. This film is funny, sad, cute and keeps you on the edge of the place! Some films do give you a fuzzy feeling after you see them, and the film "The Spirit" is definitely one of them! With my vote of 9/10 stars for animation, music and a great idea for a movie, it gave me a lot of spirit!
