Wow. I loved the whole series, and was shocked by the comments of people who thought it ended badly. Perhaps in seasons 4 and 5, he hesitated a little, remaining better than anything else on television. But 6 and especially 6b were wonderful permutations on themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons. <br /> <br /> 6B began with such a gloomy mood, and Janice was always enthusiastic about family angst - this pompous trait of knowing Tony’s inclination to sit and watch. Anyone who missed the consequences of this for the rest of the series does not know Tony. Melfi’s discomfort due to psychiatric research and his references to the sociopath’s sentimentality self-deception for domestic animals and animals dates back to the first episodes of the series, say, with Tony’s panic attack over ducks leaving his pool, and resonate with Phil’s wave “bye bye” grandchildren before the coup of the final episode (without going into the dark humor of Chase). <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I just add that I thought the final show was starting from the initial tension of Vanilla Fudge to bring the ironic omen (“You Keep Me Hangin 'On”) to the final moments when Tony returns to complacency with his family in tow or explodes like an AJ SUV or Phil's head were, absolutely, completely IDEAL. The best tv ever. <br /> <br /> Pretty good in a dying environment, pathologically supplying “laundering fantasies” that AJ makes fun of (and then he quickly goes to). The tip of the pork pie to Mr. Chase.
