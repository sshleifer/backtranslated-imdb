Everyone has bills to pay, including Christopher Walken. <br /> <br /> In Vietnam, a group of soldiers discovers that the war is over and returns home when they notice a handful of prisoners of war, including Christopher Walken. After Mad Max 3 (!) Fight with Thunder and a short slaughter later. Walken and some Colombian guy split a dollar bill, promising this or that. <br /> <br /> Transition to the present (1991), and the Colombian guy leads the revolution against El Presidente. At first, he achieved success, but after El Presidente threatens to crush people with a tank, he is forced to surrender and shoot himself in the head. This is shown in great detail, as a news report about the American television station that forces Walken to gather the old squad (although he was not in fact part of this squad) to invade Colombia and destroy thousands of soldiers. people. <br /> <br /> “McBain” is a monumentally stupid film, but, nevertheless, it is also a funny film, and the action is saturated. This is one of those films where logic is given a wide scope - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression or even breaking a window? In addition, it seems that these guys can shoot dozens of drug dealers in New York without bothering the police. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of madness in b-films that can be chewed on because of the fiendish game of Michael Ironside in Vietnam, the sequence, to the heroic, but completely meaningless death of one of the heroes, to the side separating the confrontation between El President, and let's not forget the passionate speech of the sister of the rebel leader, who was watching on TV in America a brown tear for my lower eye, this bit). <br /> <br /> It's over there for the pound sterling. Buy it if you have a sense of humor. See how many times you can notice a film crew too.
