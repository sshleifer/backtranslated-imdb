I thought it was a very funny movie. I love dog movies and comedy movies, so they are twice as good as K-9, k-911 and k-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is hysterical, and Jerry Lee is cheerful and delightful, they make up an excellent team. The only downside is that I really do not understand how Dooley's wife died. She died before this movie, but how? If they said it, I must have missed it. In addition, I give him two thumbs / tails! These dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) must have practiced a lot. They were so funny, and all the noises that Jerry Lee would make when Dooley talked to him were so funny. my favorite was when Jerry Lee sang and when he bit ordinary people to get information, very, very funny, laughs
