The film takes a new look at the life of Gandhi, and it is good to see, and it shows what kind of person he was. His relationship with Harilal caused concern to Gandhi, and he mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> My big trouble is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly not charismatic in the film. The one who played Gandhi would be better off. Some of Gandhiâ€™s statements seemed too complacent, and it seemed that he was deliberately portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is not truly comprehensive, but focuses only on the relationship between father and son. The rest is blurred and is used only to display the time frame and general movie settings. <br /> <br /> In general, a good film, considering that it is not a complete picture.
