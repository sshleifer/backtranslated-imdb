Do not listen to critics, who are probably angry gamers are still suffering from hot Silverman, who shamefully presented them to Spike TV Video Game Awards a couple of months ago, “Sarah Silverman” is surprisingly strange, surreal, immature, funny and fits pretty well with Adult . If Silverman mutes youthful jokes and emphasizes a darker and more evil talk that the show just hints at so far, we may have one of the greatest cult comedies since Strangers with Candy was canceled. But only from the observation of the pilot, this is just a solid, not outstanding, unusual dark comedy / musical, but with great potential. <br /> <br /> Silverman created a cheerful childish female character - a prettier, younger version of the late American Jewish princess, the great Jerry Blanca, and the show features one of the most unconventional, non-stereotypical gay couple images I've ever seen seen on tv. Early reviews suggest that the next couple of episodes will surpass the pilot, so I can't wait to see how this show unfolds.
