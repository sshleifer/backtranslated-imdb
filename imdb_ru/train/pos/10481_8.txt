A cute little movie that doesn’t even hurt your grandmother, “Saving Grace” seems to have been cut from the same fabric as half a dozen other British comedies over the past two years ... the loser is facing trouble, finds the strength to challenge something about yourself in the process. <br /> <br /> A widow broken, Grace is a master gardener and she is hired to help her friend / employee Matthew grow his pot plant. He did everything wrong, so Grace helps him. They understand that she is the ideal person to collect a pot from which they both can benefit. He likes to smoke, she needs to raise funds to pay for the mortgage. <br /> <br /> The highlight is that Grace travels to London to distribute a piece of her goods, dressed in something like a white suit that John Travolta wore in Saturday Night Fever, and therefore sticking out, like a sore thumb. <br /> <br /> Bletin is always watchable, and you can't talk like that about many people ... well, I can't, anyway. Ferguson is very good, and Cheky Kario, who I liked in "La Femme Nikita", is remembered. <br /> <br /> Not deeply touching or insightful, but extremely interesting, and in a lively 90 minutes it feels like a walk with friends. 8/10.
