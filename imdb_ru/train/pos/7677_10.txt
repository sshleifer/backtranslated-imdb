Wow, this film had a huge impact on me, he touched me. This is an amazing story about a girl in Cambodia who is sold in the sex industry. I can't stop thinking about the fate of a little girl named Holly. The atmosphere of the film is realistic, the film was sensational, I can not imagine that someone would leave him, not wanting to help make changes to this terrible problem that exists. <br /> <br /> The content of the film was very very touching. It was one of the best films I have seen this year. <br /> <br /> The girl who plays Holly does an excellent job with her character. Ron Livingston gives a fantastic presentation. The film touched me to tears, it tells an important message to be heard all over the world. Everyone should go see this movie. I think this movie will matter, I liked it!
