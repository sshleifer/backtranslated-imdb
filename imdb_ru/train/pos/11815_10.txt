At the time I write this, I see that out of more than 15,000 votes, he has a rating of 5.8. Something is wrong with this picture. Personally, I give him 10. I can see 7 at the lowest or possible 8 if he was rated by people who are watching this film for what he really is. This is a movie based on a comic book hero. This film won more than its share of awards. Won 3 Oscars. 5 more victories and 26 nominations ... immediately tells me that this is better than 5.8. Some kind of great acting game from some very good actors, excellent special effects and, in my opinion, will be, if not classics, for many years. If you are looking for pure entertainment, be sure to visit Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie can be watched several times. Al Pacino is gorgeous, like Big Boy Caprice.
