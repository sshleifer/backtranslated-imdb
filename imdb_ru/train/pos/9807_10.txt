I remember this series very well. It was excellent - such strong and convincing characters, stylish and sexy ... and so different from what was offered at the time - and now ... I am sure that it also inspired the excellent Canadian drama "Traders". <br /> <br /> Both season 1 and season 2 are available on DVD 2 in the UK. Nice to watch the show again. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 13 episodes, and season 2 - 10 episodes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it ended after 2 seasons. <br /> <br /> This series was very fun. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it can be purchased on a special site Amazon.co.uk.
