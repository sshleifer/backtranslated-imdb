HLOTS was an outstanding series, this is something that NYPD Blue will never be, on HLOTS the stories are real, the dialogue is real, the relationships are real. When HLOTS returned to the cinema, tying all the ends together, it was nice to bring the whole gang together, even a few people who died (I wonâ€™t say how) The storyline was dynamic, emotional and full of spirit the series had week after week. Murder, Life on the streets, Network drama at its best !!!! 5 STARS!!!! Not bad and all that. Thanks NBC for providing us, finally, we have not received!
