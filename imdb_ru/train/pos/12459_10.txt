This film is definitely one of my favorite films of its kind. The interaction between respectable and morally incorruptible characters is an ode to knighthood and a code of honor among thieves and policemen. It covers topics such as duty, guilt, words, manipulation, and trust, as few films have done, and, unfortunately, not one of them that I can remember from the time of the death of the “policeman” in the late seventies. The sequence is delightful, right up to the essentials, without waiting for anything and thus leading the viewer to a masterly plot, right and wrong, without an accessory that attracts attention and exciting scenes that are often necessary in smaller genre samples to keep the audience conscious. There are no such scenes or they are not needed. The argument is aimless and honest with the viewer, which is an important asset in the genre, in which expectation is often achieved through betrayal of the audience. No, this is not Miss Marble ... Congratulations on the music for watching a movie and enjoying every minute, not just watching.
