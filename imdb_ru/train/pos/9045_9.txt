There is a small detail to which attention should be paid at the beginning of the film, where Homer watches the attempt on December 6, 1957 (at least it was the video he watched on TV), which showed an attempt to launch Vanguard, which failed. <br /> <br /> Next, it shows that he reads or dictates a letter of condolence to Dr. von Braun in connection with the failure. <br /> <br /> Von Braun worked at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville. for the army. The Vanguard project was developed by the early Nasa team, which soon became the Goddard spaceflight center. <br /> <br /> The army rushed to Jupiter-C, which was essentially a V2 technology manufactured in the USA, but worked on the creation of a satellite in response to Russia's success with the satellite. <br /> <br /> Homer may have made this mistake due to von Braunâ€™s ill fame, but his team did not fail. In fact, the base Redstone was flying from 52 years old and was the first American rocket booster used for the sub-orbital flight of Shepard, as well as for Grissom. <br /> <br /> That's why this film is so good, we hope that it will inspire people to read and notice these little things, and in the process see what has been done and be inspired to do more.
