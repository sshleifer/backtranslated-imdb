Great movie about two policemen loving the same woman. One of the policemen (Perier) killed her, but all the evidence seems to blame the other (Montana). Unhappy Montand does not know who the other lover who could kill her, and Perier does not know that Montana had an affair with a girl. Montand must find the killer ... and what a beautiful end! Highly recommended.
