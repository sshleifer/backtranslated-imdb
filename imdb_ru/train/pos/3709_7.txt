Any film adaptation of the story of John Grisham deserves a mainstream Hollywood approach, and Robert Altman is the last director I would like everyone to take on. But this roast in the south is pretty good. Although he is not among the best works of Altman, he is certainly not among the films he created, in which you scratch your head and wonder what he thinks about. <br /> <br /> Altman tilted his hat to a mysterious thriller with a noir note earlier, in his 1973 film “Long Farewell”. The Gingerbread Man is not nearly as good as this movie, but by itself it stands pretty well. Kenneth Branagh is a daring lawyer who is accused of murder after he contacts a client (Embeth Davidtz), who secured his protection from the cuckoo's father (Robert Duvall). The film takes place in Savannah, Georgia, during the approach of a tropical storm, which gives the film a depressing atmosphere that I really liked. The twists at the end of the film are becoming more clumsy and clumsy, and Altman proves that he is not quite skilled at shooting, but in general the film is not a bad addition to the Altman canon. <br /> <br /> Also starring Robert Downey Jr., Daryl Hanna, Tom Berenguer and Famke Janssen. <br /> <br /> Rating: B
