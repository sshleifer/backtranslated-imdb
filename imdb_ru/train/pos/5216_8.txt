Errol works in the Department of Public Security, and his job is to verify sex offenders. Sometimes he puts forward a line in his work and hits sex offenders. I do not blame him, but his boss is ready for him to retire, so Allison comes. Errol is now teaching her to do her job, and this seems to be work. At first, Ellison is somewhat naive in his work, but does not understand how dangerous she really is, and Erroll is to blame for everything. He begins to focus on his obsessive idea of ​​finding the missing girl when his job is not to be a policeman. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty decent film about a crazy guy who is pushing the limits and working on his "practice field" outside. Errol did a good job, but for the safety of Allison. There is some good secret in this too, and as soon as I understood, there was something else.
