Maybe I need to check my head, but I thought it was a pretty good movie. CG is not so bad. I have seen worse. The appearance of the creatures (and by creatures I mean a good and a bad snake) was pretty cool. Snake fighting scenes were really good, I thought. from time to time there are some errors in logic, and history does not always make sense. but for a particular creature there is much worse. many other creatures seemed cut off from other films, so this is not quite original. I think the essence of this story is original. There are few similarities with Godzilla (a large budget American version), which I liked very much. I like this movie, but I still say it was pretty good. I also liked the music. In general, I think Dragon Wars is about 7/10
