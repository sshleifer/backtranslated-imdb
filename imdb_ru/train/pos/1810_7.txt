I can understand why some people like this film and why not. For me, however, I like it very much, even if I have noticed some good moments, and not very impressive ones. The animation was really excellent, like Charlie’s dream. The characters were a mixed bag, the best of which was Anne-Marie, voiced by the late Judith Barsi. (I was physically sick when I read what happened to her). In addition, Karrich is a very convincing villain, especially voiced by the wonderful Vic Teybak. (I especially loved "Fools, I am surrounded by Fools"), and together with Rasputin and Warren T. Rath, probably the most memorable of all the villains of Don Blut. Charlie and Itch only lacked the same spark, but I loved King Gator and his song. Some films are very intrusive, like, for example, Annabelle “You will never return,” which still scares me. Unfortunately, there were some bits that I didn’t like so much. The story tended to become clumsy and unfocused, but Disney's Black Cauldron suffered from the same problem. There were also some dark scenes that small children could upset, but the ending is very sharp. However, the biggest drawback was the rather soft songs and the way they were performed. None of them, in particular, stands out, with the exception of “Let's make music together” and “Love will survive,” and Burt Reynolds cannot sing, and Dom DeLuise sang much better. In general, the film for viewing, which could be more, but he definitely remembered, and I would definitely watch it again. 7/10. Bethany Cox
