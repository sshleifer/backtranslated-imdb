I CAN see episode or 2 when the show was originally broadcast, but when I watched episode 1 on Netflix, I was also hooked. I watched the whole series in about 2 days. :) I really liked the character of Gary Cole. First, he is completely prejudicial, then you start to love the character (“These things have a thousand uses”)! His friend Andy Griffith meets Charles Manson, met with Satan. Charming, charismatic, intelligent, and, uh, dangerous and by "kind" I mean "really." I want to be like him when I grow up. Lucas Black is great too. The accents are great too. Anyway, I thought it was one of the best TV shows in history, and you must see it
