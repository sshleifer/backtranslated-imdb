I thought this film was excellent because Corrin and Sean are new to this business. He was full of action and a little romance, but there were some moments when Corrin didn’t speak very clearly (when she threatened Sean with a gun) and she gritted her teeth ... maybe she should have? I think that the roles of Joseph and Sonny were portrayed very well, and there was an obvious contrast. Also, because I was watching the next action movie star, I’m sure that Corrin and Sean did their own stunts that were done very well. I look forward to another movie of the couple, as they make up a great team, or maybe a sequel to put their lives - perhaps called “make it big in a big apple”. ', this may be this time about Carmen .. But your life is EXCELLENT!
