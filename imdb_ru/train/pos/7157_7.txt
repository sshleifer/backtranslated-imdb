This film is an entertaining, fun and high-quality film. The film very cleverly follows the instructions of the book and tries to stick to the exact lines. The actors are all suitable, and you expect them to be a part. They use some famous actors who have a great influence on the film. The graphics are a bit tricky in some details, and there are quite a few mistakes in the film. For example, there is no yellow spotted lizard. The camp is not as terrible as explained in the book, and they, as a rule, do not show events in the camp as in the book. His entire group is much mentioned in the book, but not in the film. Overall, a great movie for a rainy day.
