Panic is a little trick in the film - you think you understood it in the first half hour, only to be more than happy to understand that Henry Bromell is a much better writer / director than this one. <br /> <br /> The film is being built slowly, with one quiet destructive scene after another, everything is perfectly played by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracy Ullman, John Ritter and the most wonderful child actor Iâ€™ve been Long ago we saw David Dorfman as Macy's son, who sets out his lines as if he had completely unintelligible thoughts in his mind, rich and useful, this film will stay with you long after the captions begin.
