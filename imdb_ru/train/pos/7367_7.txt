Currently, I am studying films at the level of A.S., and “this is not a love song” - this is a film that we watched, and, in my opinion, this is a film with a very simple subject line, but a complicated story. If you scratch the surface, you will find a thriller-chase film about two men running across the countryside from the farmers after committing the murder: “it sounds pretty exciting.” <br /> <br /> However, you need to dig deeper to reveal the true feeling of the true genre. This is supposed to be a love story between two homosexual lovers, filled with trust, deception and betrayal. We are not told about this “love” directly through the film, but events that happen through and through, for example, how Heaton behaves in relation to Spike, almost shout about this intact romance on our faces. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is a good example of why British films should not be discarded as “rubbish” just because they are made with a small budget. <br /> <br /> A good movie with a complex storyline, but this is definitely a taste acquired and may not be suitable for the average Hollywood blockbuster fan.
