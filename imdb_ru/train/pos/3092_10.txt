You probably already know all this, but 5 additional episodes that have never been broadcast can be viewed on ABC.com. In recent years I have watched TV a lot, and this is probably my favorite show ever. It is a crime that this beautifully written and acting show has been reversed. The actors who played Laura, Whit, Carlos, Mae, Damien, Anne and OMG, Stephen Caseman are all incredible and so natural in these roles. Even the kids are great. Great show. So sad that it went away. Of course, I wonder why this was canceled. I would never allow myself to believe that Ms. Moynahanâ€™s pregnancy had anything to do with it. It was the perfect time in this market. I watched all the episodes on ABC.com again - I hope they will come out on DVD someday. Thanks for reading.
