Ah, I loved this movie. I think it was all. It made me laugh out loud more than a dozen times. Yes, I am a girl, so I am writing this from the point of view of a girl. I think it's a shame, he only scored 5.2 in the ranking. Too many guys vote? It was much higher than other romantic comedies. Just because I am a woman, I do not like all the smart films, on the contrary, I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies are usually petty and not as funny as they should be. But, as I said, this film was almost everything, in my opinion. Excellent script, good replicas, good acting. Although the character of Eva Longoria Parker very much reminded Gabrielle of Desperate Housewives, so what? It was awesome. I will keep this film on rainy days, days when I feel depressed and need some laughter.
