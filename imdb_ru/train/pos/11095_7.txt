I always liked this John Frankenheimer film. Elmore Leonard's good screenplay, and the main reason why it was not just another thriller, is Frankenheimer. His tight focus and attention to small details make all the difference, he even hired porn stars Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can state that this is the last good movie made by Roy Scheider. I have always said that Robert Trebor gave just an amazing presentation. Clarence Williams III gained all the fame for his terrible game, and he is also excellent, but I really thought that Trebor stood out. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as the others, but this is an effective thriller, complete blackmail, murder, sex, drugs, and real porn actors appear in the sloppy parts. What can you say about the movie in which Ann Margaret was shot because of drugs and raped? Guilty pleasure, if not more. Vanity plays a very dirty role, and very young Kelly Preston appears early. Classic exploitative thriller, which should not be forgotten.
