I did not know what to expect from partner and friend / trainer Van Damme and his battle choreographer for most of his films. It was nice to see that he plays the role of "TONG PO" in Kickboxer and other Van Damme films. Now he is on his own. He and his wife make a great team. In this film, Kissy is the director and presenter of the bad guy, and he is good. Really mean. His wife was a screenwriter, producer and director of most scenes that did not require action. She also did a good job editing the film. Together they did an excellent job. The story made sense, the fight scenes were correctly edited, the leaders were real fighters and looked good together - the story worked out well, and if you can believe it ... there is no bad language, no sex, just action. New to me. Check this !!!
