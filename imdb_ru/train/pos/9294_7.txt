Before I begin, I must point out that I know the editor of this film. We have never met, but we belong to the same fanzin (those that were before the bulletin boards), and we talked on the phone, so I have a bias. In any case ... For some reason, ironically, as the culture of "Rat Pack" of the late 50s and early to mid 60s returned in the mid-90s, this film is one son of the original Rat Pack, which was made in this way, was a flop. Moreover, it was a critical failure; I believe that Peter Travers from Rolling Stone was the only one who is not savage of this (as I recall, he gave a mixed review). And although I don’t think this is the best movie in the world, and I’m not a fan of the Rat Pack or the "cocktail" culture, I think it's worth a look. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it looks stylish, and moves straight ahead. On the other hand, the basic characteristics are good. Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly restrained here as the main gangster returning from the sanatorium, and has a foolish advantage to him. Jeff Goldblum returns to the quietly ironic speeches that he gave in the days before the blockbuster, for example, THE BIG CHILL. And although Ellen Barkin only needs to be shot in this film, she does it entertainingly. Admittedly, this is not a great film; the dialogue consists mainly of pun, and many of them do not work (like the whole speech "Zen Ben"). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are terrible here. However, I was entertained, and if you like gangster movies, you can too.
