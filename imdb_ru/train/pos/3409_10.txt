North Africa in the 1930s A beautiful woman comes to a small Arab town on the outskirts of the Sahara, looking for meaning in her life, and a beautiful Trappist monk fleeing from the crisis of faith. They will meet, and the passions will flare up, but even the Sands Divider does not know whether they will find happiness or sadness here in the GARDEN OF ALLAH. <br /> <br /> The plot is as clean as a film, but the film is still very fun and beautiful to watch. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer are a gorgeous pair on the screen. Simply put, she’s great, and Boyer demonstrates the most effective, discreet work, allowing his sensitive face to do most of his work for him. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is superb: Vasily Rathbone plays the pretty role of a count who loves the desert; Joseph Shildkraut as a friendly, talkative guide (everything “Arabic”, which he and the others speak in the film is just nonsense); Lucille Watson as the gentle Mother Mentor; Alan Marshall as an honorary young French officer; Tilly Losh as a dangerous dancer; Henry Brandon as a cartoon comic; John Carradine as the mysterious Sandman; and the magnificent Sir Aubrey Smith as a wise old priest. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers recognize Helena Jerome Eddie as a nun; Marcia May Jones and Bonita Granville (looking out from behind the nun's shoulders) as monastery girls; exhausted Nigel de Brulier as abbot; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel clerk, all without accreditation. <br /> <br /> Color films of the 1930s are rare and enjoyable to watch, and this film is no exception - the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself. GARDEN OF ALLAH was the first Tehnikolor film to be shot on the spot. Hume, Arizona, provided the filmmakers with all the sand dunes they could wish for, but polluted drinking water and 135-degree heat soon led the company to rebellion. When the daily rush showed that Boyer's face was burned with a bright red tomato, producer David O. Selznick finally gave up. The rest of the film was filmed on the Hollywood sound stage.
