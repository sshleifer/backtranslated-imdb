Maria Brown is an extraordinary woman, presented completely and very authentically, despite the fact that she is so stupid that borders on the improbability. She will do everything to make her marriage work, including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation. And thus, outside of vice, she reveals a rather sweet system of values. The film suffers from a sudden and unexpected ending, which subsequently seems completely inadequate, with the convenience familiar at the end of your school creative writing exercise “and then I woke up.” At the other end, it also ends in letters, and this is the most eccentric sequence of names I have ever seen, but do not allow any of this to alienate you.
