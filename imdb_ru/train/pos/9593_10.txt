First of all, I'm a man, just a white man. But even with this flaw, I love this movie. This is about real people. Real time and place. And of course New York in the 80s. I had many gay friends who grew up in New York in the eighties, and I always admired the fact that their courage was to live the way they wanted. No matter what the consequences. It is bold. You have to admire it. It's a great movie, watch it and see how it feels to be a bright African American or Latin American gay in New York in the eighties. This is real life. The bottom line is real life.
