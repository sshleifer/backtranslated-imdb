Honestly, I was very surprised to read some comments on this work. Some people were looking for a plot ??? Well, when this video came out more than ten years ago, I watched it the way it was: a collection of music videos. This is not a movie. It has no plot, no central storyline. This is quite an artistic anthology, consisting mainly of long videos, they are all made quite cleverly or creatively. These days, Michael Jackson can be considered abnormal, but in the end, it was this man who gave us the thriller (which many consider to be the greatest music video of all time) and set the trends with Billie Jean and Beat It. Together with Moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him again took his musical and dance moves to create several fascinating things, including clay processing, special effects, live video footage and even self-performance (“Badder” sequence), and for those who is interested in what Joe Sands was doing there, this video appeared a little earlier than it became a household word, and was one of his most memorable episodes in the movie. And, IMHO, I think the Smooth Criminal sequence (choreographic section) is superior to everything else that Michael Jackson has been doing up to this point!
