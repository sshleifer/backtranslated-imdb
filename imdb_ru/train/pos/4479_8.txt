Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, watching it on video has caused me a lot of nostalgia. At 15, it was easy for me to get into the first of the great musicals of MGM Technicolor. Now I’m probably most interested in thinking about the future career of leading players. Although Sinatra made several minor films shortly after his appearance after his days as Dorsey, as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance. As another viewer noted, it looks like warming up "On the Town". Sinatra may have had to work hard on this, but his dance with Kelly is trustworthy and he will be better off in his next couple. However, watching his physique, it is easy to understand why he was caricatured in the form of beans. Who would have thought that within a decade he would receive an academic award for acting and play many roles in the role of a tough detective or leader in battle. Although the personality and dances of Gene Kelly dominated this film, his spectacular performance did not suggest that he would become the main creative force, almost an iconic figure for MGM musicals, where he developed a dance style that complements Fred Astaire's style. Finally, it was strange to see Dean Stockwell with a new face and remember that he would later play in the “Terror” killer, based on the murder of Leopold-Loeb in the 1920s. Additional note: one reviewer praised Betty Garrett's performance as Sinatra's love interest. She later played with him in the film "About the City", but Pamela Britton was shown in this film.
