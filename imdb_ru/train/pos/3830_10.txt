The first time when I and my best friend sat down to watch this film, we watched it in honor of Alex Winter, famous Bill and Ted. We did not know what to expect, except for whom and about what. <br /> <br /> When the film ended, we knew that it was love at first sight. This film, although not quite historically accurate, was and remains the best in its genre. I have seen other films depicting the history of this famous summer, and, in my opinion, none of the others can match. In some details he slightly embellished, but these details did not distract from the elegance and romance of history. I have seen other films about this summer and I think that most of them are good, but none of them are as exciting as this one. <br /> <br /> Haunted Summer has the same qualities as the painting. Colors and settings seem like something that can be found on a canvas, framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric house. The costumes were great and, despite the fact that they were not the most comfortable clothes in the world, I wanted to find a seamstress to create such clothes for myself. The whole film was filmed on the picturesque Lake of Geneva (where I hope to go one day because of watching this film) and the tranquility that these historical figures found there. <br /> <br /> This film shows, besides the calm that all fugitives found in England’s harsh judgments, the oddity that surrounded this adventure. Yes, there were drugs. It was a fairly common practice at a time when drugs were not illegal. And the reception of laudanum (liquid opium) was not only wellness, but also therapeutic. Shelly suffered from consumption. Lord Byron suffered from prickly feet. Not surprisingly, there will be prescriptions for the potent drugs that they possessed this summer. And they were poets at the time when experience was the key. There was no time for caution. Passion and experience were a big part of the romantic era. And from the thoughts and discussions about science, religion and philosophy, a legend arose: "Frankenstein". <br /> <br /> Yes, in this film we see the beautiful and liberated Mary Godwin (not married to Shelley at that time the beautiful and talented Alice Krieg played. She is the controlling factor in everything that happens while she defies experience too But she stands her ground and relies on things on her own terms. Like the power she inherited from her mother and father. <br /> <br /> Actors and actresses were ideal for the roles they played. The direction has captured the essence of summer, as I read about it. This film is based on a wonderful Anne Edwards’s book "Haunted Summer". If you like this film, read the book. The author takes a story from what she was able to collect from the actual magazines of Mary Godwin Shelley and other participants in this story. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who loves history (even minor inaccuracies) from time to time) and romance and gothic, this is the film for you. This shows the birth of a monster who even today teaches morality “to play God.” <br /> <br /> A definite film is a must see!
