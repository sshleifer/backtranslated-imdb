“Guardian” is a film that my father recommended to me many years ago, and since then I have seen him many times. I always manage to entertain me, and at the same time he acts effectively. Memories of scenes are what really made it for me. Christina Raines' father, running around the terrible, with two terrible women, always manages to cause a chill on my spine. this is your typical good against evil, but at least he manages to amuse himself. The final, which I consider to be one of the best in horror history. He had a lot of shocks and expectations when Burgess Meredith did his job, like Chazen, made me stand on the edge of the seat. Sentinel has perfect voltage. We never feel completely comfortable when Allison is on the screen. We know that something awful is always waiting for her, and this made things even more stressful. This film is often ignored among horror fans, but I personally think that it is one of the best, and surely enough for all horror fans. <br /> <br /> Performances. Christina Raines has her own wooden moments, but for the most part, it happened a lot. It looked beautiful on her, and her chemistry with Saranadon was natural. Chris Sarandon is great as a guy, Michael. He had an instant presence on the screen, and I couldn't help but love him. Martin Balsam, Jose Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfus, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenguer all have unforgettable roles or little cameos. Burgess Meredith is awesome like Chazen. He looks like a normal old man, but what we learn is absolutely terrible. Eli Wallach and Christopher Wakeen succeed as awkward detectives. Beverly d'Angelo has one scary scene that I won't spoil. <br /> <br /> The result. Sentinel is an effective horror film that, unfortunately, horror fans tend to ignore. This will give you the thrill and fear that you need to be satisfied. Worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 7/10
