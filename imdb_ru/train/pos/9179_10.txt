This is the best (for now) version that you will see, and the most accurate work of Bronte. Dalton is a bit difficult to imagine in the role of Rochester, whom Jane Eyre declared "ugly." But his actions overcome this, and Zela Clark, likable as she is, is also full and believable Jane Eyre. It is a production of long hours, but worth it. The script contains almost direct quotes from the book, and if you want the very first real “novel” in literature, this is the way to see it. I own each copy of this film and read and re-read the original. Shooting may seem a bit outdated, but this will never happen.
