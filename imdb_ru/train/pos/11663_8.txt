The Secret of Kells is an independent animation function that tells us one of the legendary stories about the Book of Kells, an illustrated medieval manuscript with the four Gospels of the New Testament. I did not know that this book actually exists, but, knowing it now, it is much easier for me to interpret and analyze. There are several stories and ideas about how this book appeared, who wrote it and how it survived for 1000 years. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> We meet Brendan, an orphan who lives in Kells Abbey in Ireland with his uncle, Abbé Zellah (voiced by Brendan Gleason). Abbot Cellach builds a massive wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and the monks. Brendan doesn’t like walls like other monks. They are more focused on reading and writing, and Abbé Cellach no longer has time. He is afraid of "northerners", those who rob and leave cities and villages empty and burned by the bottom. <br /> <br /> Once a traveler arrives from the island of Iona near Scotland. This is brother Aidan, a very wise man who carries with him a special book that is not yet finished. Abbot Cellach gives him permission to stay, and Brendan is friends with him. Aidan has special plans for Brendan. At first he needs ink for a book, but he needs some special berries. The only way to get them is to go beyond the walls and into the forest, an area inaccessible to Brendan. Seeing that he is the only chance for Aidan to continue his work, he decides to sneak off and return with the berries, before his uncle notices his absence. <br /> <br /> In the forest, Brendan meets Ashley, a forest protector. It allows Brendan to go to the berries and along the way becomes akin to his company. She warns him of impending danger in the dark and does not interfere with it. There are worse things than the Vikings there. From there, Brendan faces a lot of book problems and looming confidence in the invasion. <br /> <br /> I like the story better, now I know what it is about. Now, knowing what the Book of Kells is and what it contains, the animation makes sense. I am sure that you saw images or copies of old texts hundreds of years ago, with ruffles, colorful pictures and extravagant patterns, creatures and inscriptions that adorn the pages. Very similar to the first shots of Disney's "The Sword in the Stone." The animation here contains many similar designs and templates. This creates a completely unique viewing experience, when the plot and animation almost try to outdo each other. <br /> <br /> I could not take my eyes off the incredible details. This is one of the best 2D animations I've seen in recent years. It is lively, stimulating and full of life. Characters are constantly surrounded by drawings, designs and patterns on trees, on walls, and in the air, just flying around. It improves the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is satisfactory, although I think the ending might be a bit tight. With a total duration of 75 minutes, I think that in the final act there could be something special. He does not give much information and does not refer to the value of the book. We are reminded of its importance, but we never fully understand. We are told that it gives hope, but never, why and how. It was really the only missing part of the film. Otherwise, I thought the story was interesting, although it was completely behind the animation. <br /> <br /> I think to a certain extent this is normal. An animation can carry a movie before it fails. The story lacks several pieces, but this is an interesting look at a fascinating piece of history. I would recommend to briefly look at the Book of Kells to understand what this film and I are about. I think this will help your viewing a lot more. This is a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that should not be missed.
