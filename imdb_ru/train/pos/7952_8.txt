This is one of my favorite family films. I liked it when I was small, and it still holds when I got older. I still laugh at all the same old jokes and could even shed a tear. I never really cared for animals talking, or at least people without animation, but Iâ€™ll stand for it. It's a pretty old movie, but it will always be in my heart. <br /> <br /> There are no other live animal films I could think of at the moment, with which I could even compare, not to mention just like it. I could give too much praise to this film, but I do not think that the show. I really adhere to the great message that "Home is where the heart is." Or at least this is the message I received from him. Definitely recommended for a good old family movie night.
