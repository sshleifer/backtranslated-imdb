Madhur Bhandarkar is doing everything possible to raise taboos and gives the most realistic picture of modern society. The impression from the director is made even from his early films, such as “Satta” and “Chandni Bar”. The problems that have just been hinted at in the last film are fully disclosed here. Casting is awesome, and on every scene you can see judgments from different sides. Basically, the film makes you think about a lot of facts. When you start guessing things, you end up close, but in many scenes you lose the mark. Ultimately, this leaves a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Actors worth seeing are Konkana Saint Sharma, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. The conversations are well written, and you feel that you have lived with some of these people. There are a few more scenes that make you think about more depth. The songs are in the background, saving time, and the voice of Lata in the very significant song “Kitne Ajib” leaves you feeling that you are left completely alone in the thick of modern society!
