First, I would like to say that, although I know my share of star wars, I am not a fanatic. I do not know how many chromosomes are in the vamp rat or in the extended family TK427. what I know is: Star Wars, all movies (albeit with episode 2) are something magical. It is difficult to say that which button Lucas found and boldly pressed, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. this is an idea. <br /> <br /> How, you ask? I will explain Star Wars affect the most universal stereotypes, good against evil. he makes it so obvious, so deep that literally anyone from any environment can understand. Episode VI does everything very well, ending the epic struggle between the son and his used and controlled father, but also, with the addition of prequels, reveals even more in the hinted story. Suddenly this is Darth Vader ahead, and viewers realize that this is a story about Anakin, and not just about Luke. but even before 1-3 there was an amazing depth of all this. it seemed real, as if the capsule had fallen from the sky onto Lucas’s lap, detailing a historical story about a galaxy far, far away. <br /> <br /> “Star Wars” are definitely more than the norm, and I have to admit whenever I see them, especially this one, I feel very small. I feel as if I have been sucked into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. I get a tingling sensation when I see them, a feeling that something touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope for.
