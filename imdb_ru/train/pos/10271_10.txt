This film should not be compared with Complaint or other caper / robbery / fraud movies. What makes him such a wonderful movie experience is what he says about relationships, deception and trust. This is also a rather harsh criticism of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a psychiatrist who is so easily deceived, and then in the finale does Mr. Mamet have a bad experience of therapy? Highly recommended!
