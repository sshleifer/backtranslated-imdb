This is a reunion, a team and a great episode of justice. From hesitation to resolution, Clark made an important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of controlled fate, to Superman, who, like the Green Arrow, postpones his emotions to his few loved ones, ready to save the entire planet. This is not just an exciting story about teamwork, loyalty and friendship; it is also a question of what is more important in life, a lesson for Clark. I do not want the series to end, but I hope that subsequent episodes will strictly adhere to what Justice shows, without any rewind and put a good end to Smallville here - and Superman's great start. <br /> In this episode, we should have seen more contrast between Lex and Team. Nine stars must give him credit.
