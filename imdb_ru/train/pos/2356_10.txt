Pushing Daisies was a great show. As with Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, you can say that it was created by Brian Fuller. I can understand how people who are not very fond of theater, cinema, musicals and the like, will be annoyed. This is not a typical television program, but fantasy â€” too much for some. These people seem to need a slightly more linear and muffled tone to be happy. This program explodes with color, winks on old movie scenes, buzzes with incredible music and talented performances. There is nothing accidental in the choice that is made from costume to leitmotif. The story takes a lot of turns, but everything is very accessible, because talking about love, honesty, courage, loss, and many other things that we encounter daily. has been cancelled. Do not approach this as a typical TV show. Think of it as a theater night, then relax and enjoy!
