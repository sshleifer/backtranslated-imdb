Despite the fact that this film is at its best, it does an excellent job with its responsibilities. This film, without a doubt, should be considered a modern classic. There are two main films that I like: films with depth (if you must - I think I am to blame), and senseless comedies in which I can relax and rest. This film is a great example of the latter. <br /> <br /> My friend included me in this film shortly after its release. Considering me a little shallow, he said to me: “You have to watch this movie. It's just your movie type. ” Anticipating an insult, I began to look. I know they mentioned The Ramones a million times, but when you actually saw them, I said, "Hey, those are the Ramones." My friend replied: "I do not know that they were a real group." I had a moment of glory. <br /> <br /> This film, although somewhat outdated, is a must-have for fans of the Ramones or anyone else for that matter.
