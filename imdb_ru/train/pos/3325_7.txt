OK, I wouldn't normally watch the Farrelli Brothers film. I can't remember ever watching one. I also don’t remember watching Jimmy Fallon’s movie. Well, I was watching a taxi, but I said repentance and was forgiven for this mistake. But in this film was Drew Barrymore, and I just think she is the cutest thing. I don't know what it is with her, but I just smile all the time when I look at her. She just fascinates me that way. I mean, I even watched Adam Sandler to see her in the first 50 dates. How sad is that? It was not the best baseball movie - it shouldn't have been. It was a love story about a sad puppy who clung to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worthwhile that he refused. He had a predictable end, but there was so much on the way that it was worth it.
