When I saw this movie, I really wasn't sure if it would be my cup of tea ... how wrong I was! I thought it was one of the best films that I watched a long time ago, a true family classic. The story of a young evacuated and his new "adoptive" father, this film sets all the framework. I did not read the book (perhaps it’s a good thing and meant that I liked the film more), but as for the story, I really can’t think of any bad points, so I scored 10 out of 10 (and I’m hardly someday think anything deserves the highest marks!). By the time William announced: “I CAN RIDE ON MY BIKE, DAD!” I was crying with all my might (everyone who saw this would understand, I am sure). Really soulful, and definitely recommended.
