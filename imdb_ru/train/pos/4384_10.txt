BASIC SPOILERS !! THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO LOOKED A MOVIE !! <br /> <br /> Commentators touched the main theme of “honor” in the film and too many comparisons with “Braveheart”. I will point out a few things about this film that I have not seen in other comments: <br /> <br /> This film has a completely different opinion about abortions. The first character to conceive is the girlfriend of the villain (Roth), and when he coldly offers an abortion, she declares that it is too late for that. The shame of her situation (“I must have a bastard”) makes her commit suicide in a much later scene. The second character to conceive is Mary, Rob's wife, after raping Roth (and at least one sex scene with her husband Rob). At the end of the film, when Rob leaves for the final confrontation with Roth, Mary asks what she should do with a pregnancy of dubious origin, with a subtle hint of an abortion. Rob responds with a noble tone: “This is not the child’s fault,” and then says that, in his opinion, there must be a name, a girl or a boy. I find this position "against life" on the part of the hero is not very Hollywood. Rob goes from darkness at home to a bright street to make this comment - a non-random symbolism. <br /> <br /> Another related topic - Mouth - bastard, who obviously does not know who his father was. and has a few kind words for his mother, although he wears her image in a case suspended from his neck. Is it a coincidence that Roth (devoid of stability in the family) is the walking definition of a psychopath, and Rob is a strong husband / father figure and, of course, a hero. In the last sword fight between Rob and the villain (Mouth), the first one cuts the last one deeply across the chest - the left side of the chest, the heart. His employer and the pseudo-father figure (John Hurth's character) holds an image of his mother in his hand and looks at him before snatching him from the neck of a dead Roth. <br /> <br /> I also found it interesting: the direction of the rape scene, which was not entirely graphic, but was also not implied. I find this surprising in terms of the description of the facts, when Mary convincingly shows the characteristics of someone who is experiencing the test and the subsequent post-traumatic stress (as we now call it). The bottom line is that rape was neither a sensation nor simply implied, which I consider to be an interesting intermediate road for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In the final battle scene, I have to correct an earlier commentator: the company of the Company of Rapier (or perhaps a short sword) chose the weapon that Rob - Claymore chose. Someone was really doing his homework throughout the whole scene. The mouth could have won in this situation, but, of course, Claymore is clearly a Scottish weapon. What is even more striking to me (for both the swordsman and the man who read this topic a little) is that this final sword fight is one of the most compelling of all the films ever made: the actors seem to be they are trying to kill each other - - not the usual strikes on the enemy's blade, which we see in most fights in the cinema (including in the battle with the discovery of films). Even more believable stories, Rota was seen several times when a rapier was used as a throwing weapon, which is its purpose by design! (The rapiers were sharp, but mostly they were throwing weapons, and the blades were used mainly to repel the opponent’s strike.) Rob uses Claymore in wide slashes, as this is the designer’s intent. The fight goes the way I expected - Mouth effectively wins. Although Rob wins the day by grabbing Roth's weapon (more symbolism) and striking him a fatal blow with a powerful slashing strike. <br /> <br /> Guys, it is rare to see this level of historical accuracy in sword fighting in the movies. <br /> I will also note that for any reason I clearly remember 1995 (year of issue) as a time of no confidence in the US government. Hollywood was clearly set up with the release of Rob Roy and Braveheart, and I think the anti-government leanings are why both films get such a big comparison. <br /> <br /> I think this perspective is refreshing to avid movie fans who are tired of the very same old, not so hidden messages from Hollywood.
