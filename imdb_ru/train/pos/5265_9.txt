I remember watching it for the first time when I was 9 years old. I wanted to be one of the barbarians. This film is still great. One of the original aspects was that the fight scenes were very short. The implication is that the "barbarian brothers" are so good that they quickly destroyed the enemies! In addition, you have chases, a cage fight, a dragon, and even a bar fight! <br /> <br /> Yes, the acting is bad, so not ten, but the plot line received a lot of criticism. I think it is quite original. Not many films in their genre have the same original plot lines or colorful dialogues. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie.
