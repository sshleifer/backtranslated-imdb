Marion Davis plays a major role in this great comedy "Show People", released by MGM in 1928. Davis plays a guy from Savannah, Georgia, who comes to Hollywood with her father (Dell Henderson). The jalopes they arrive at are a scream - like the outrageous southern costume of Davis. Davis gets a job in a farce comedy, not what she wants, but it brings her success. She meets fellow William Haynes, who immediately fights with her. Well, then Davis gets a job in a more prestigious studio (“High Art Studios”) and gets a job in periodic works. A beautiful, but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows her how to become a typical pretentious Hollywood star. Davis refuses his friends and father in farce for the sake of a good life, but of course he finds out that she is not who she really is. Marion Davis is wonderful in everything, as she is outrageous to control the range of emotions required from a "serious" actress. William Haynes - his usually wonderful comedy essence, and there are cameos by Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert and other famous stars of the day, including the director of the film King Vidor. This is a silent film with several “sound effects”, as the sound images only come into their own. The treasure of the movie.
