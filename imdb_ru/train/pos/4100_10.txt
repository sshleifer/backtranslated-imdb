Valerian Borovchik's "La Bête" is based on the story "Lokis" written by Prosper Merimee. Lucy Broadhurst (Lisabet Hammel), the American heiress, betrothed to the son of a poor Marquis, arrives at the collapsing family castle and learns about the mythical beast Ursinus, allegedly sneaking around the nearby forest. It is known that once the former mistress of the house (Sirpa Lane) once had engaged in vicious sex with a creature, and Lucy found herself absorbed in the dreams of this incident. "The Beast" is an art house mix of surrealistic horror, sheer immorality and porno. phallus. Nevertheless, this truly erotic film is wonderfully photographed and tasteless. The women here are stunningly beautiful, and they are naked most of the time. In general, “La Bête” is a visual feast. Attention to detail or visual motifs saturated with information should be carefully and carefully watched over Borovchik's masterpiece. Be sure to visit for fans of European cult cinema.
