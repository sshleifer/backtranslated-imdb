I saw this movie on TV when it came out, and I never saw it again. As for life, I could not remember the title and just stumbled upon it, checking out the captions of the film Roy Tinn. A superb, dark, and creepy horror TV movie of the same class as Crowhaven Farm; "Do not be afraid of the dark"; and Satan’s Girls' School - all have lost Satan’s classics. I also think that it has many parallels with the classic Clint Eastwood, "High Plains Drifter". Why don't they make these great little movies, especially considering all the latest problems with the rubbish that fills the discount DVD stands at Wal-Mart? Most of these films have a cult following, so sales should not be a problem.
