This film is definitely on my top 10 favorites list. The voices for the animals are beautiful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both gorgeous as a sassy cat and a young inexperienced pooch, but real success is Don Amech as an old, loyal golden retriever. This film is an excellent family film, because it can be appreciated and loved by both children and adults. With a sense of humor and tension, and guaranteed to make any animal lover cry! (happy tears!)
