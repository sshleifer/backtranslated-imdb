FUTZ is the only show that survived the experimental theater movement in New York in the 1960s (origin Off Off Broadway). Although it’s not for everyone, it’s a really brilliant, darkly ridiculous, even more deeply disturbing story about love, sex, personal freedom and revenge, a serious moral story, even more relevant now when Congress wants to ban same-sex marriage by destroying our Constitution. However, the story is not about being gay, but about love and sex, which do not meet social norms and therefore must be eliminated with the help of violence and hatred. At first glance, he tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but, like any big fable, in fact this is not about animals, but about something more - suffocating conformity in America. <br /> <br /> The stage version won international acclaim in its original production, toured the USA and Europe and, together with others, influenced almost the entire theater that appeared after it. Fortunately, we have kept the show here largely in the form in which it was originally conceived, with the original cast and original director Tom O'Horgan (who also headed the HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar series on Broadway). This is not a mainstream, easy to shoot, studio film - it is aggressive, disturbing, gorgeous, deeply emotional, wildly figurative story that you will never forget. And it can change the way you see the world ...
