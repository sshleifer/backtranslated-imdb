... Heads, Hands and Feet - a group from the past, like Strange Fruit. Triple hit there. Those who said they dislike this film are either heartless, or younger than 40 years old, and have not had any experience in real life. Sad for them. This is a very well observed little picture, which is a great way to miss an hour or two, and probably won't even fade very much in the second show. Stephen Ray, Timothy Spall as a fat drummer (in many respects a very amazing figure of all) and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - as a neurotic vocalist and frontman, everyone turns into super-performances, and Juliet Aubrey is fine Karen which tries to keep the group together while it effectively self-destructs. <br /> <br /> Echo Sid Barrett / Brian Wilson sounds loud and clear, Mott Hoopl is lagging behind. in front of one in all their inflated absurdity, and the script is never disgusting for more than a minute. Do not compare this with Spinal Tap, The Rutles or The Full Monty - this is unfair to everyone. The closest comparison is “Obligations,” and that's not bad. And any film that can recall memories of a Blodwyn Pig - a band I don’t remember, have ever seen, but the name lives - well, it shows that someone on the team knew what they were about. <br /> <br /> A little delight, and thanks for the memory. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and I have OTHER - Tough Little Fingers; ahhh, what about SteelEYE Span ... a terrible TOOTH ... Ten inches anyone? (You should watch a movie or be on the road)
