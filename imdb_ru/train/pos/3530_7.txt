I can confidently admit (as an IMDb fan) that “The Phantom Lady” will never enter my top twenty films. It may not even get to the top 50. But instead of discrediting the film for not being as good as many other classics of the film noir genre, it should be noted that the “Phantom Lady” has strong enough and long-lasting images to make it worth watching. All that is required of the viewer is the ability to go beyond the horribly slow start. <br /> <br /> The film does not prepare until Kansas (Ella Raines) tries to prove everything, but alone the innocence of her boss, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), who was convicted of murder. Kansas is Anderson's secretary by day and amateur detective at night. As a beginner, she feels good working at night on the streets of New York. Little by little, she begins to collect pieces of the murder puzzle together. Honestly, the film belongs to Raines, and only thanks to her presence the film works well. Somehow, she is able to breathe life into a film about a convicted person who is not interested in the least. I'm not sure that this split dynamics of a faceless lead person becomes the mistake of an actor or director, but it’s clear that this is where something gets terribly wrong with the film. <br /> <br /> As interesting as Rains as a novice detective, things really speed up into another hidden form when Kansas visits a wandering drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) late at night in search of some information to help her convicted to the boss. She and the drummer paint the city in new red, visiting jazz clubs "all night." An attempt to describe this scene either proves an injustice in relation to the scene, or, even worse, can destroy everything together. You will recognize the scene as soon as the last plate crash ends. If you are lucky enough to burn this movie to DVD, you will most likely rewind this scene again and again. No matter how good Raines is, it is this scene that makes this film worth seeing. Mostly because of this scene, I rate Ghost Lady 7 instead of 6. <br /> <br /> For the most part, this movie sounds cool and soft, with some great scenes and one great scene. , It is the “drum / sex scene” that separates this film from any other similar things. <br /> <br /> And just as the film says that “you are never wrong with Vanilla,” I would also like to add that “to go with vanilla” is a safe choice when you cannot choose more tasty treat. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
