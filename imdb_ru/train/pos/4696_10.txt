although this film is quite old, no matter how many times I watch it, it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> One particular quotation from the film is highlighted. <br /> <br /> When Danny (Joe Piscopo) arrives at the office and parks in a place for people with disabilities, partner Danny says that <br /> <br /> “you can't park here, it's for people with disabilities.” <br /> <br /> Danny replies: "I am disabled, I am a psychopath." <br /> <br /> This is one of the many lines of the film, no matter how many times you look, it will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Johnny Dangerously stands in my top 5 comedy / parody films of all time. <br /> <br /> As an added bonus, it also includes the legendary actor Peter Boyle to throw. So watch this movie and, like me, and many others who have watched it, you will be hooked.
