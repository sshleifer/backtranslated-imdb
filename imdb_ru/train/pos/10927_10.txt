This is one of my favorite Kung Fu movies, which is considered one of the most popular in the late 70s. The plot is interesting and winding, the characters are cool, each with its own style - a toad, a snake, a lizard, etc. display from various characters. I recommend this film to those who think that all the Shaw Brothers, especially Chan Cechâ€™s films, are the same, most of his films usually focus on 10 tigers and Shaolin conflicts against Manchus. This film is a breath of fresh air by comparison.
