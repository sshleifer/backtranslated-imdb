This is a pretty good movie, but too Americanized in its predictability. Change Kung Fu to football and the Turkish family to Pakistan, and you will almost see Bend It Like Beckham (2002) almost scene by scene. A pleasant feature that serves as the basis of the film is the continuation of battles with the mysterious ninja under the highway, starting with miserable losses and gradually progressing until the last battle becomes a victory over himself, as the Kung Fu master has repeatedly emphasized. On another level, Denmarkâ€™s life is completely different than the image it has from outsiders: non-indigenous immigrants, who make up the majority (in fact, the majority) of the Danish population, graffiti in the suburbs of Copenhagen, ridicule at the beginning of the film. Everyone portrays a different picture than anyone has in mind when he hears the word Denmark.
