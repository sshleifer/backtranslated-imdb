The horror story's bestseller Cheryl (solid and sympathetic performance by beautiful Virginia Bryant), her husband Tom (pretty Paolo Serra) and their son Bobby (nicely played by Patrizio Vinci) go to a remote castle located in the countryside for a summer vacation. Local legend claims the area is cursed. Cheryl discovers a creepy, hairy, nasty cannibal (clumsy David Flosey in a strikingly disgusting costume) who lives in the basement. Cheryl must overcome her fear of the beast, deeply rooted in childhood, so that she can defeat the dirty find. The director / co-author of the film Lamberto Bava performs expert work on creating and maintaining an eerie and unnerving nightmarish mood. Moreover, Bava avoids the standard routine of bloodshed and panic in favor of creating a convincing and provocative tale, similar to a dark adult, about how the best way to overcome what scares us is to face this source. Stabrina supports the role of Sabrina Ferilli in the role of a friendly school teacher Anna, Stephanie Montorsi in the role of babysitter Maria and Alex Serra in the role of babe Dario. The glossy cinematography of Gianfranco Transunto boasts several smooth tracks and plenty of atmospheric lighting. Fabrizio Sforza's terrible makeup f / x, Simon Boswell's gorgeously lively ghost, and the damp, dark, web-covered basement â€” everything fell into place, crawling on the skin. Worth seeing.
