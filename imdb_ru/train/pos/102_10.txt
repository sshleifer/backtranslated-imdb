I first heard about this film about 20 years ago, when I was a child in elementary school (!). It just so happened that once I was browsing encyclopedias in class, and under the entrance to the cinema (or I don’t remember the movie), there were several frames for different films from basic to experimental, and one of them, shown on the page, was for OffOn. It really intrigued me, since it stood out the most on the page (it was a frame from a scene movie with an eye and other elements superimposed on it). <br /> <br /> Approximately 18 years later, in the public library where I live, it was possible to purchase the entire set of 4 DVDs “Treasures of American Film Archives”, released by the National Cinema Preservation Foundation. So when I read the notes on the DVD enclosures for a set, I was pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the discs. After all these years, I was finally able to see the movie! After watching it, it was not what I expected (the film is usually more organic looking, not that it was bad, but I expected it to be more electronic), but it was still an impressive film, IMHO, given the methods used by Scott Bartlett to create the film, including the manual tinting of the film itself and the use of video equipment for some scenes of the film (taken from a video monitor), making it distressed, you look serene. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, the methods used in this film were completely innovative in 1972. That's why this is still one of my favorite short / experimental films, and creative inspiration for me too ...
