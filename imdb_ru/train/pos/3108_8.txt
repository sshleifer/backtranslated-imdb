This contribution makes the CIA a very stupid organization. In fact, perhaps they are. In the end, the essence of the plot is such that it is very similar to the fact that one person can sanction the killing of everyone, including his own people, to kill Jason Born. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon does a very trustworthy job as Bourne tries to stay one step ahead in order to be killed by the entire movie. He is still trying to remember who he was and how he ended up where he is. He gets help from several people, and it seems that every minute of the movie someone is trying to kill him. <br /> <br /> In this film, there is little time for rest, and the action films seem very real. There are a lot of chase sequences shot with a shaking camera, which in some way add to realism and make it seem less Hollywood than a lot of pictures. These episodes bring realism to the film. <br /> <br /> In some of these episodes, it is brilliantly done that you wonder if someone dies or Bourne can stop them. You expect to see these kind of action movies when you want to have fun, and I'm sure this movie will lead to the next movie in the series.
