I liked this movie because it did more with less. This could be more interesting if they limited the studio even more (although some elements of the plot would be more difficult to develop). <br /> <br /> The guy playing the DJ did a great job of showing someone scared and haunted by his memories. It also seemed to me that his dialogue with the callers was quite funny. <br /> <br /> Although some parts of the film can be seen a mile away, other parts that you donâ€™t expect will be as they were. <br /> <br /> I thought it was mostly a rather minimalist ghost story, focused more on the lively side of the equation. The last 5-10 minutes were pretty well made, since everything is revealed. <br /> <br /> Although it was a shorter movie, it seemed like it was time to tell a story. I would have started to pull.
