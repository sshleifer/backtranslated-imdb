It is difficult to look at it - as an earlier reviewer says. This is surprising, given the horrific films that came out immediately after World War II - especially the “liberation” of Dachau. It is clear that from the middle of the war we knew exactly what was happening with the Jews. The sequence, which shows "transport", is bright, as if based on real newsreels (the Nazis loved to fix their crimes). Knox as a Nazi is a genius. He outlined the course of the Nazi career. This graph is especially indicative if we compare it with the reaction of other Germans: first laugh at Hitler, then incredulously, and finally helplessly. This contrast, however, allows us to believe in the "transformation" of a young Nazi officer in an anti-Nazi position. This happened as evidence of several attempts against Hitler, above all the Staffenberg plot that occurred during the release of this film. A powerful, memory-efficient film that accurately predicts the routes of Nuremberg and others that will occur after the end of the war.
