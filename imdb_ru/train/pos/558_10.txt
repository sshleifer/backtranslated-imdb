Classical drama / western fighter with incredible cinematography, which is well ahead of its time (1954). The production is very good and you can say that it was done with pride and love. A unique look at the American pioneers of NORTHT WEST is very informative and interesting. The "legalists" at this particular time and place were very crooked / corrupt, like most developing countries today. The sequence of actions could be more realistic, but, nevertheless, this film really covers most of the essentials. Testosterone-type westerns for this film are more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy .......
