The Night Listener caught my attention, Robin Williams beamed as a New York radio host who falls in love with his friendship with a 14-year-old boy (Rory Culkin) who is very ill. Williams never met the boy in person, as they communicated only by telephone. However, Williams' former boyfriend (a great job from Bobby Cannavale) raises doubts about the boy, which causes Williams to arrange to meet him in person. What follows has a constant influence on Williams in ways he does not expect. I'll leave it at that. Tony Collett is also removed. <br /> <br /> I liked this film, in which Tony Collett remembers the image of Kalkinâ€™s adoptive mother. Sandra Oh also starred as a friend of Williams. The Night Listener is inspired by actual events, and he has a grim, almost eerie silence everywhere. Sometimes it is predictable, not thanks to some reviews that I read before watching a movie, and just because of the logic, but I still liked it. I like Williams in similar roles, more than his comedic characters, so this was an added bonus for me. Featured. 8/10
