This is not a bad movie. It follows the new conventions of modern horror, which is a film in the film, a famous actress running for her life in the first scene. This film removes the old agreement with the killer psycho, and he can do something new and interesting. It is also always nice to see Molly Ringwald in the attack. <br /> <br /> So this could be an example of what this genre has become. The cut affects all marks, and is actually scary in some parts. I liked it, I gave it eight.
