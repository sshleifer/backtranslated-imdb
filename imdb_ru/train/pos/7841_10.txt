it’s really fun for every Bolan fan, some might think it is off scale, and that it’s only about Ringo and Mark's ego, but I think it’s like any other live video, except for the fact that it’s Mark Bolan and not just a guy! I especially enjoyed the music video for the Revolution Children with Elton John and Ringo Starr. this clip alone is worth all the money, I can not believe that they did not release this version as a single. The film is really great, especially for us Danes. I was not alive in the 70s. but the Danes were generally completely banished from what was happening around them. The media then did not play or show any popular music, including Marc Bolan and T.Rex, they only played a bit with The Doors, only really popular songs. So, I know from my father that, having seen this, he returns to him a part of his youth, he never had to experience. <br /> <br /> I will not do this for too long, so ... If you are Mark Bolan's smallest fan, you have to see it. You might find it boring or as said before, a little over. But at least you have seen one of the best musicians in action! <br /> <br /> The only thing that a little disappoints me is that Ride A White Swan is not recorded on tape. but I forgive it, since Jeepster and Get It On are so wonderfully played.
