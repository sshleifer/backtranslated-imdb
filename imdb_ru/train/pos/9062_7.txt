This weekend, I watched this funny movie. and I really like all the cute kids who remind me of my childhood with these silly thoughts. This is a real entertainment film for a group of families at the weekend, which can cause a lot of memories and laughter Children's humor always works. good acting game. Simple story, but great shooting. good job for the director to find the way of the child. when it comes to children's film, I think of “12 and hold”. one more this year, but a different aspect in the world of the child, which is real and cruel. amazing work. H2EFW focuses on the happy childhood side that every child and family needs. postscript I think that Twitch is Nemo's voice from Finding Nemo.
