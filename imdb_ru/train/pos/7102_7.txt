Other reviewers seem to think this is a terrible movie. This is simply not true and a bit unfair. <br /> <br /> The game is of good quality, and the direction is moving with decent mobility. I do not think that there is anything wrong with the Tarantine-Esquire method of combining stories together. Perhaps this is just a new tool for directors to try. I thought it made the movie much more interesting. Perhaps some elements of the script need to be tightened, but this is the only mistake I can find. Nestor Cantillana is great in the role of Silvio, and Antonella Rios is stunning and worth the price of entry.
