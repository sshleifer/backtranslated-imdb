Hmm, yes, this episode is extremely undervalued. <br /> <br /> Despite a lot of bad letters and speeches in parts. I think that good ultimately triumphs over bad. <br /> <br /> I love the origami party and the big twist at the end. I really like this scene when Michelle confronts Tony. This is actually one of my favorite scenes from the first season. <br /> <br /> For some reason people always hated episodes of reincarnation, but I always liked them. They are not the best in terms of writing. but the topic really interests me, <br /> <br /> I'm going to give her THREE stars, but if the text were a little more consistent, I would give FOUR.
