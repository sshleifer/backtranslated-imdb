Kate Beckinsale is as good, if not better, than Gwyneth Paltrow, as Emma is in this film, although I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in another version of Emma. They are both good in different ways.

There are some things that I like more in the Gwyneth Paltrow version, for example, as the humorous side is more obvious.
