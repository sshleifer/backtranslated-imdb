I loved good times with the rest of you. I love to read INTELLIGENT and USEFUL comments. The writers on THIS show were fantastic, and the actors were out of talent. To answer Strawberry22 (the most accurate comment to another excellent and positive comment) ... It happened that James was killed in an accident (I think I remember it was a car accident or a car accident), and it was the saddest episode (when it first went on the air, and I was a tiny thing ... I was so sad ..). <br /> <br /> Florida and Children actually quit the projects, and EVEN become neighbors with Villon (Vilnona) and so the last show ended. <br /> <br /> ALL children achieved their dreams and found an opportunity in each of their dreams. It was a wonderful finale, and I cried because I was happy for them, and the show seemed so realistic that I really believed in their fate. I hope this kind of finish rings true to many. <br /> <br /> This was followed by a great show and many other great shows, including Benson and Jefferson. It was a terrific period for African-American television, and the best writers were great at the time. TV LAND Cool for memories, and I just LOVE it, because I can't LEAVE the garbage that we are seeing today. Someone ... bring back the 1970s and 1980s quickly ... your smart viewers are a dying breed, and we need the best materials. <br /> <br /> Love, the original comedy series of the 70s and 80s (as they sing in "EVERYTHING in the family" ... these were the days ......
