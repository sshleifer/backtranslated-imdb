So, I’ve already come a long way from Houston, but whenever I see this film, I’m getting back to the dream of a little cowgirl to ride the bull at Gilly's day. (It burned down before I started drinking.) If you grew up in East Texas, you know that this film is an accurate description of the modern life of that time. If you do not trust me and watch the movie. Either you join the many who love this (and at the same time strangely repulsed), or at least you can make fun of the red necks. (There is a lot of material for banter.) This film does not try to be PS (that it was in the 80s) or hide an element of white garbage, and this is fair to the time and place. <br /> <br /> Must be 10 for me!
