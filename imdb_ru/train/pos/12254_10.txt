I saw this movie after watching the Paltrow version. I found it to be very good, and I thought it would not be so good ... but I was wrong: the British version was much better and more pleasant! I found Jeremy Northam more “pleasant” than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strong catches much better than Austin Knightley. In any case, both versions are good, but anyone who loves the books of Austin should watch this movie. I agree with the * challenge *: Andrew Davis changed a few things, but still remains true to the original. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My 2 cents!
