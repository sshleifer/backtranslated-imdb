Soapdish can be called one of the most underrated films. <br /> <br /> Star, disinterested cast, who understands exactly where the film is going and what roles have played in it. While everyone hacked it, there was no single skill. Klein showed wit and great physical comedy, Goldberg and Downey knew how to have a funny conversation, while someone else was talking, I could just continue. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie!
