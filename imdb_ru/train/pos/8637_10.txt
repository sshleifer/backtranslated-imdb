“California” is a great movie that makes us look at ourselves. The film has a great cast: Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, the river flows through it and “Legends of the Autumn”) as “Early Grayness”, David Duchovny (“X-Files”)) as Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (“Star Trek : Next Generation, Murder: Streetlife and Escape from Los Angeles as Carrie Laughlin, Brian's girlfriend, and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Cape Fear and Eat Gilbert Grape) ) as Adel Corners, Early's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Brian Kessler, a liberal writer, is preparing to write a book about serial killers. Brian and his girlfriend Carrie decide to move to California. So Brian places a college ad for those who want to go to California to share the cost of the trip. <br /> <br /> Early Grace - a former crook and a parole sociologist who recently lost his job at the Mirror Plant in the city in debt, owes money to his landlord. An early parole officer stops to visit him and tells him about the job. Legends and sees an advertisement, he later tells Adele, his girlfriend about leaving to go to California. Earlier and Adele met Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and leave the city. Brian and Carrie do not know that he is the killer who just killed his Landlord. For a while, Brian and Carrie thought of the Early and Adele differently, but met them and became a kind of friend, Kerry and Adele became real good friends. <br /> <br /> Their journey is very informative. Although Brain and Carrie, not knowing early, are the killers, and later - in the film. The question Brian asks in this film about the difference between the killers and us is a very good question. Early Grace - a sociopath who does not see the error of his path, go down the hill later and pay the price. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great movie, I put it on 10 stars and 2 thumbs. I like the songs in the film, especially at the end of the film, the song "Look Up To The Sky" from the Indians.
