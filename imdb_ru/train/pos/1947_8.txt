SPOILERS. Like the other posters, I felt the ending was a bit sharp. I would like the team to return to life after returning. I believe that the authors anticipated this problem by “loading the front” some episodes of “Voyager on Earth” at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, this time the line was eliminated, so this is all debatable.) I did, like, how Admiral Janway died for the Voyager crew. As fans, we get our cake and eat it when Janeway makes the most sacrifice and continues to live. I admit that the scenes with Jenway and her elderly person talking to each other were bizarre and could so easily cross the line to the camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew (s) took it off.
