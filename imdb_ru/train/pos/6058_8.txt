This is a well-made documentary about the exciting world of Indy Car racing. The photo is simply outstanding. The scene where Mario Andretti rides an old racing roadster on the street of New England, strewn with ancient maples, takes the leaves in the direction of the speed of the car, it's incredible. The film loses some of its beauty on a small screen, but if you like to watch cars driven to the limit, you should watch this movie.
