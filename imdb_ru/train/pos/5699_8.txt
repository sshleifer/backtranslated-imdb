Began one of the most disturbing and tragic periods in American history. The members of the “Summer of Love” culture in the late seventies and early 80s eventually became tools for the love beads and all the night parties and turned into ordinary life again, whatever that means. For those who could not grow their young and sometimes irrational abundance, they were the culture of Miracles. The love of drugs and the feeling of belonging, combined with aversion to power, values ​​and the "establishment", is a world that captures the film. <br /> <br /> The sixties were a time of revolution and violent change that tore up the American “home”. After the battles were over, we all had to deal with the consequences of the slaughter. The characters in the House of Wonders are symbols of the seventies' underdogs; partly a biker, partly hippies, partly scammers, all outcasts. There is no ideology to express, only a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and no need for loyalty. Ron, Billy and David consider themselves Robin Hood with drugs. They talk about love and behave cruelly; they take from the rich and sell to the uninitiated; they steal from everyone. <br /> <br /> Holmes and company are the end result of a strange collision of antimatter, such as sex, drugs, and rock and roll, when lab technicians get bored and they leave. <br /> <br /> The film is masterfully shot and shot at a pace and reflects the crazy world of drug addicts in their element. The fact that Holmes is a porn star makes little difference. This story was told in Boogie Nights. This is a story of a transitional and forgettable era.
