I liked this movie, at first the smooth graphics seemed strange with grainy shots, but I quickly entered it. It must have been captured several thousand hours of footage, and I really admire the work done to shoot it. If you are easily shocked by drugs or violence, this may not be a movie for you, but there are some great characters here (and some real tooshers). Technically, I also liked it very much, they must have used the new deinterlacing algorithm, or maybe the footage still looked so dark, but I was not annoyed by the usual artifacts that can be seen in the video to transfer films. (“Open Water” drove me crazy, mainly because now there are cheap progressive cameras, and I see no excuse for not firing at them if you are going to show in the cinema). Sorry, this is my own little rant. I definitely recommend this film, if you have ever participated in the music scene, there are several tragic moments in it, but most of them are funny, I can be blamed for laughing at others' misfortunes, but this is a classic play.
