Let me start by saying that I am a big Kerry fan. Although I admit that I have not seen all his films * cough * magical * cough *. Bruce Almighty was pleasant. None of the other reviews really touched on how stupid it was at the end, I don't know what the authors thought. For some reason I could not help but feel that this film was an unsuccessful attempt to recreate The Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> Steve Correll from The Daily Show - HEREDITARY, like the rest of the cast, Look at Bruce Almighty, if you're a big Jim Carrey fan, or if you just want to see carefree (very soft piano music) somewhat funny comedy .
