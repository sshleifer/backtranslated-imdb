I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued by this woman artist, whom I had never heard of before. Therefore, I decided to study her life and work after her. As expected, I found that the film was not entirely historically accurate. I was a little surprised by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy. Come on guys, the film is not and should not be a biography (and not a novel!). Any historical film distorts reality, because it must be a work of art in itself. A film director has the full right to use elements from reality and history to create his own world. Artemisia is a wonderful film, and I think that it attracted many people (including those who are now making negative comments) to explore the life and work of this wonderful artist.
