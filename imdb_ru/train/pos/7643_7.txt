Spoiler!!! This film is based on the “What if?” Concept. Of course, Mr. Destiny will be able to answer this question. The main character is going through a bad day, like many of us, and asks this question. Chaos theory claims that a butterfly in China can affect someone here because of a chain reaction. The focus of this film is based on a single event during a baseball game. This event sets in motion its Fate; The same as Ashton in "Butterfly Effect", except that Mr. Destiny uses comedy instead of drama. The result is a fresh, somewhat original film. If someone's philosophy is in harmony with the “Butterfly Effect”, then most likely you will like Mr. Destiny. I give him 7 out of 10. Surprisingly, because I saw the first half of this movie 3 times and finally watched the final on TBS.
