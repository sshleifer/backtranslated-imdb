Most of the atomic age monster films that I saw on TV as a child, and some of them, including BLOBs, scared the day's rays. Films such as "Invaders from Mars" showed us too clearly, "a small fry" that children simply cannot be trusted when it comes to things attacking Homeworld; BLOB just repeated this fact. I remember with love that the late evenings on the floor watched the captors, the Martian invaders, and the droplets seep into an unsuspecting society. It was summer, in the early 1980s, when the local atomic age classics were held every weekend at the local science museum (in Richmond, Virginia). These were 16 mm films, and most of them were black and white (and the projector was noisy), and the BLOB'S “color” print turned pale pink, but it was fun. I was dragging my mom, and she enjoyed it just like me. It was there, in this science museum, that I really fell in love with a BLOB. The goal of the director was, of course, to earn money, but the sincerity of all the participants, from the directors to the “talent” (players), made me fall in love with this film. Trite? You put. Cheese? They do not become more pleasant. But man, what a movie!
