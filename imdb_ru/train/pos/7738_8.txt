After Dark, My Sweet is a great modern noir, filled with battered characters, dirt roads and, of course, sweaty characters. It seems that most of the really great noirs of the last two or three decades occurred in the south, where men shine, and ladies shine too. What for? Because it is hooooottttttttttt. And because everyone looks better wet (at least men do that - sweaty women leave me sticky). <br /> <br /> In any case - there may be some spoilers. <br /> <br /> This film is an excellent example of everything that should be noir - the constant pace (although some with attention disorders call it “slow”), clearly and widely drawn (though not simple) characters, and tons the atmosphere. Noir, in any case, about moods and relationships. That is why the greats are not marked by your traditional definitions of “great” acting (look at Bogart, Mitchum, Hurt and Nicholson - they (and their characters) were not at all real - but they had the style, daring and crime of the film is exactly what Do you want to). or fast-paced adventures (again, all the great noirs seem to be on low fire, like a cigarette). Great noirs create a setting, and you just populate it with characters for a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> After Dark My Sweet, let's do it - and this will allow you to enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters. Uncle Bad and Collie are intriguing - never letting the audience know what really makes them tick - and Patrick and Dern (by the way, I love Bruce Dern) are completely flawless, especially Dern (see previous comment). They take the basic outlines of character, give them depth and cause our sympathies. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also interesting. In the world of noir there are the best scenes (there are practically no riddles here - basically this is the unknown), but this one is solid. In any case, the “good” story has more to do with writing Jim Thompson than anything else. With Thompson, the conspiracies are almost secondary; he avoided the labyrinth tales of Hammett and Chandler for simpler stories with stronger, more confused characters. Look at the novel, like “The Murderer Inside Me,” and you will immediately see (from the title) what he is talking about. When it comes to Thompson, this is not the case, but how it is (quoting Roger Ebert). So, in fact, the relatively simple story of the abduction doesn't matter, and if you don't like it, well, a joke on you. <br /> <br /> Why this is an 8-star film, not a 10-star film, because of the female role. She's not bad on her own, but she’s not Angelica Houston or Anette Benning (see Jim Thompson’s The Grifters Adaptation if you don’t know what I’m talking about — besides, this is the best movie and you should start there for a modern noir ). - This is the best of the 90s and the test of Blood Simple for the title of the best since the days of Chinatown). She simply does not have chops (or something similar), and although she and Patrick have a little chemistry, I don’t have it. So that.
