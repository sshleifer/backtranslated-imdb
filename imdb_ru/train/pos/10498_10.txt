It is a bit simple. That's all. <br /> <br /> The graphics are clean and realistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but this is forgivable. The rest of the graphics is cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. Sounds great. Everything from conversation to SFX is nice and realistic. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the camera’s viewing angle is a little depressing, but it’s the same for every game on a platform such as Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br /> <br /> I received this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then I dutifully received 120 stars for 10 times.
