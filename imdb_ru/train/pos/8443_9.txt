My favorite police series of all time turns into a television movie. It works? Yes. Ji runs after the mayor and gets shot. Murder "Hall of Fame" is revealed. Pembleton and almost all the policemen who have ever played on this show. Many memories help those who have not seen the show, but fans also like it. The last five minutes reveal another murder, and at the very end even two dead policemen appear. And a short look from my favorite coroner, Juliana Cox. This is a good movie.
