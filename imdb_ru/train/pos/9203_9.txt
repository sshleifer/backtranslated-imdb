This is one of Dev Anand's films, which gave excellent but special films for the Hindi film industry, such as The Jewel Thief and Guide. The story is short (if you ask me what kind of story it is), the plot is simple - the brother is looking for his lost sister. Sister joined hippies who smoke pot and sing Hare Rama Hare Krishna. Nevertheless, the film tells about several significant events that the world experienced in the 70s. Hippie culture, their subordination to drugs, freedom, avoiding duties, family, and adopting something new, such as the Eastern (which was new to white) religion. They were processed perfectly. Zeenat tried her best, and Dev, as usual, was wonderful. The songs are best used (unlike when they write songs) in this movie. They were not spoiled. One fine example is “Dekho o deewano ... Ram ka naam badnam na karo”. Every word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic, but this is not the essence of the film. In general, Devji, who believes in the creation of various films, successfully showed what he wanted to show here. A must see to experience the hippie culture and beautiful Nepal of the 70s.
