I just watched this movie on Showtime. Quite by accident actually. If I hadn’t slept just 6 hours in the past two days, I wouldn’t come home from work early. If I had not come home early from work, I would not have seen this film. I would not know what I missed, but I would have missed a lot. <br /> <br /> This is the movie. This is almost a Kevin Bacon effect game. This is a causal relationship (hence my verbiage above). Ever the character is intertwined anyway. Action, reaction, interaction, non-interaction. This film is just wonderful. I'm going to find a copy to buy.
