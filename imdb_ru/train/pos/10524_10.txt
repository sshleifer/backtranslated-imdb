Jane Austen would definitely approve! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow does an amazing job fixing Emma's position. She is funny, but not too stupid, but elegant. She puts a very convincing British accent (I'm not British myself, maybe I'm not the best judge, but she fooled me ... she is also excellent in Sliding Doors ... I sometimes forget that she is American ~!), < br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam, Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Lowe (Emma Thompsonâ€™s sister and mother) as Bates women are also gorgeous. They almost steal the show ... and Miss Lowe doesn't even have lines! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
