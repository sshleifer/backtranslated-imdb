The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is a persuasive documentary on the migration of the Bakhtiar tribe from Persia. Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to get to pastures. You will feel like a spoiled wimp when you see these people graze their animals through icy water and go barefoot through the snow to cross the mountains, trying to get their animals to walk on steep and narrow mountain paths.
