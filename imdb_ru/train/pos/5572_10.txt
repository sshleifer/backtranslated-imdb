This film was hysterical. I have not laughed so long for a long time. I mean, this is not a “Goodwill Hunt,” but it should have been? In fact, I went for advanced screening, expecting a lot less, and was pleasantly surprised. Comedy hits and pretty constant. Amanda Pete is hot and cool. The whole audience with whom I took it seemed to enjoy the movie as much as I did.
