This interesting documentary tells a wonderful story about an expedition to take a blind Tibetan child hiking in the Himalayas; but also a personal clash between two great people. On the one hand, there is Eric Weyenmeyer, the first blind to climb Everest, and a team of (sighted) climbers who lead children. On the other hand, there is Sabrie Tenberken, a blind woman who runs the first school for blind Tibetans, who agrees to the expedition, but later doubts her success. At some level, Sabina simply does not understand the climber’s philosophy (with a focus on the summit); she is probably right to define the discrepancy between the goals of climbers and the wishes of the children, but her confidence in her own right makes her a difficult person to sympathize, especially since she has an effective veto. Against the background of this (sufficiently educated) collision, we get an idea of ​​the life of the children themselves. I liked the film, although it contains a message, clearly intended to raise the mood - although it tells in detail about the quarrel, the film somewhat steadily asserts how amazing everyone who participates in it is. But with such an assessment is difficult to argue, even if it seems to the viewer somewhat unconvincing.
