Attractive Marjorie (Farra Fawcett) lives in fear after being pursued by a lone biker. She is mortally shocked by the fact that her attacker knows her address. As expected, Joe (James Rousseau), the attacker sneaks into the house of Marjorie and exposes her to humiliating terror. Marjorie, bruised and bloodied, managed to beat the attacker, knocking out the living day rays from the jolt, and made him helpless with the aspen spray in his eyes and throat. Hog tied up and beat himself; Joe tries to explain himself to Marjorie's roommates (Diana Scarwid and Alrie Woodard) when they return home. There is almost a hint of mercy, but this is not from Marjorie. Should she continue to exert her own punishment? Violence, sexual abuse and harsh vocabulary make the R. rating. Fawcett really avoids the dirty roles that will forever tarnish her career. Glory to director Robert M. Young.
