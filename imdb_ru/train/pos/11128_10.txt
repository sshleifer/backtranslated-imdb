First I would like to say how great it is. This is striking, and sometimes shocking. And, to put it mildly, I'm 11 years old, and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely stand a boring movie, but it's not boring at all. It is like a journey through humanity. His absolute realism is manifested in this monumental masterpiece. This is a heartbreaking story about two people who are building mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) A naive Texas stallion comes to New York to make him rich, entertaining women. Soon he meets Rico "RATSO" Rizzo (HOFFMAN), a poor man barely able to pay for an apartment. Ratso becomes the "manager" of Joe, but soon both men cannot find Joe a job that leads to stealing food. When they try to survive on the streets of New York, we understand how difficult it is. They can't get Joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party. Joe makes some money, and soon Joe takes Ratso to a dream location in Ratso, Florida. The last five minutes are heartbreaking, but some of the greatest moments in the film. With MIDNIGHT CUBA, we get a harsh and sometimes disturbing urban outlook on life.
