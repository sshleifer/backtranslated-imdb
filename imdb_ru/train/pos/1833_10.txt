The main storyline here is as follows: Aditiya (Kumar) - the millionaireâ€™s spoiled son Ishvar (Bachan), who owns the toy industry, in the eyes of Ishvara his son Aditya cannot do anything wrong until it was too late, because Ishwar was a patient with lung cancer, and he only had 9 months to live, when his son fled and married Mitali (Chopra), Ishvar readily forgives Aditya, but when happy couple Aditya and Mitali return from honey month, Mitali is pregnant, and this forces Ishwara to drive Aditya out of the house to make him more responsible, Aditya does not know that his father suffers from lung cancer, and he also does not know that his father threw him out of the hose to make him more responsible, Ishwar cannot bring himself to the high Aditya, who is about to die, with a hungry and pregnant wife. this is a race against time, so Aditya is doing everything possible to manifest himself in front of his father, and the climax comes when Aditya gets a big breakthrough in the film industry, and his father tells him that he will die soon. <br /> This film is absolutely brilliant, it is a breakthrough in Indian cinema that was necessary for the Bollywood industry, the direction of Shah is almost flawless, but which movie has no flaws? The best part of this film is the father-son relationship that is reckless. The breaks in the songs are simply placed at the right time, the landscape is good, the only part where this film fails is where the jokes between Boman Iran and Rajpal Yadav jokes are too long and after a while they are annoying, but overall this is an Excellent film, I advise everyone who reads this review, go and see it regardless of other reviews. 9/10
