Even if you're not a big fan of the Ramones, Rock 'N' Roll High School * is still * the greatest rock and roll movie ever made. What for? Because with all impoliteness, he respects contempt, and adolescent haters often (and rightly) feel the dull, stupid, fascist world of the adult establishment. This final scene is one of the most magnificent and inspiring final scenes of the film I have ever seen. "My eyes have seen fame ..." Rock and roll! <br /> <br />
