And another run of South Park is coming to an end. It was not such a strong episode, as I had hoped, but “Night of the Living Homeless” was stronger than the Stanley Cup, CST, Bloody Mary or Erection Day. He still can not hold a candle before Christmas and the tutors of Woodland Critter, but few episodes can. <br /> <br /> “Night of the Living Homeless” is a deceiver of the zombie genre, created as only South Park would have thought. Instead of eating the meat of zombies, essences are homeless, which require change and seem to survive outside of them. <br /> <br /> Randy and the other residents are locked in the Community Center, although this time on the roof where they can see the scene. A particularly funny moment is that one of the members finds out that his house has disappeared, and becomes homeless, and Randy has no choice but to shoot him. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the four boys decided to solve this problem by using the whole story of a homeless takeover, trying to convey a message, but being seriously boring. South Park at the best when it's funny. This week, Matt and Trey carefully managed and did not criticize the problem of the homeless, but only urged it on. <br /> <br /> The shock moment of the episode begins when the scientist shoots himself, trying to avoid the homeless. This is the first suicide in South Park, and we see the poor fellow miss his brain and then try to shoot himself while he painfully dies. Another inspirational moment in South Park. <br /> <br /> Overall, the episode was funny, but it wasn’t great, hiding any real comments about the homeless and straightening right with the help of a zombie. The ending is somewhat amusing, but nothing new. <br /> <br /> Now we need to wait for the next episode until October. It is a long journey, but South Park must be welcomed for his run. The show seemed to run out last season, but now it is in full shape again.
