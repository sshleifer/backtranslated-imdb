The season finale sent mixed messages, I felt a sense of joy, as well as a sense of lies and deception. Rosanna tells all her viewers that the entire ninth season was a lie, because her husband, Dan, died. She also acknowledges that the family never won the lottery, and that the 9th season was a lie, simply because she wanted or wanted it to be. I still don't understand when she said that Becky ended up with David, and Darlene and Mark, because Becky and Mark admit that they are pregnant. Therefore, I believe that this is exactly what she wanted, but this is not so. So the season finale went well, but caused mixed feelings. I will always be a fan of the show. :)
