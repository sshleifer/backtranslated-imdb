If you have never watched this movie and love the old actors, this movie is for you. Seeing Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin with sunken cheeks and a wonderful voice that sang some great old songs. Michelle Morgan, (Millie Picot) gave an outstanding performance with a lot of dance and musical numbers. Leon Errol (Cyrus Drake) played an excellent secondary role along with Victor Borge (Sir Victor Fitzroy), who played the classical piano, not comedy, as in his career. This is not a great musical, but Frank Sinatra was very nice to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940s.
