I watched it a few years ago. I remember this as a very mysterious situation and a mixture of melancholic things, such as the fate of Dorothy and Bogdanovichâ€™s personal future. <br /> <br /> I turn to watch my VHS copy, and then I watch it more and more. I am currently waiting for the DVD version at any cost, please! <br /> <br /> Country music and light music for listening are very well chosen from the first second, a little bluish, but also happy. /> <br /> I like all the characters, with funny situations, great acting and many dialogues that have turned this into a cult film for me and many people I met on the Internet or in film clubs. This may not be accidental. <br /> <br /> I think the name is the hope of life! You should be happy and laugh as much as possible. <br /> <br /> I know that this may be a special commentary on the film, but the fact is that I like it a lot, I think the film has marked me and I will never forget it.
