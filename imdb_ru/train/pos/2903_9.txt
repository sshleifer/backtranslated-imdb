Tiempo de valientes is a very funny comedy. After his great first film entitled “El fondo del mar” and the exciting television program “Los simuladores”, Damien Sifron did another great job. Diego Peretti and Luis Luka are two great actors, and here they have great performances. The film is very funny and funny, and there are great moments in it. Timpo de Valientes is a very funny comedy that I fully recommend if you want to have a great time. And I must congratulate Scifron for all his talents. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9
