The film looked like a walkthrough to "Immoral learning." Most likely, I have never been keen on the urgent need for an actress to perpetuate naked men and, thus, all this fuss about "Now, who painted this member?!" sounded a little gratis. The conversations in this film are pretty awful, although visually this film got its moments. Iâ€™m almost digging when Tassi begins to paint a mental picture, but then the film turns into a penis again. Highly recommended for those who have not seen it once.
