There were times when this film seemed much more complicated than necessary, but I think that is part of its charm. Detective Philosan Vance's observational abilities seem more significant than all the oriental truths of an era combined when it comes to a final assessment of how the murders were committed. The fall of a dagger in a Chinese vase became a kicker for me; I mean, couldn’t someone drop it? <br /> <br /> Vance (William Powell) at the beginning of the film had a line on Archer Coe’s “psychological impossibility” to kill himself — I had to think about it for a while. I had to wonder if there was any scientific basis for this concept to be true without studying psychology itself. It seems logical, but there is always a case that does not comply with the rules. <br /> <br /> You know, I enjoyed the agitated coroner (Etienne Girardot), who reminded me of Star Trek doctor McCoy a couple of times he said: "I am a doctor, not a magician" and "I am a doctor, not a detective ". I can imagine DeForest Kelly watching a movie and saying to himself: “I will have to use it someday.” <br /> <br /> Once the identity of the killer is revealed, it will not be such a big surprise, but until then no one really guesses it. But besides Archer and Brisbane Coe, the film did not answer the central question posed by the title, and the murder that really interested me - who killed the dog of Sir Thomas MacDonald Gilly?
