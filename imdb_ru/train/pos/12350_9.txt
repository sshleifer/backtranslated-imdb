I'm not sure how I missed this movie when it first came out, but I'm glad I finally saw it. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in the Okabasho district, located in the red light district of the 19th century, Japan. It tells of prostitution, caste systems, and women who are strong in a society based on the strength of the samurai code of Japan. <br /> <br /> This is unique to Akira Kurosawa! Despite the fact that he died before he could make this film, his adaptation shows the script. His view of the Japanese world and the caste system is well known and sheds light on how these systems interact with each other. Characters can rotate around each other, but the caste system remains intact when each character returns to the world in which he is located. A samurai warrior who plunges into the world of a kind-hearted and loving prostitute returns to her life until she starts another road with a man who is part of her caste system .. the lowest of the lowest. Many people appreciate the samurai world above all others, but, nevertheless, it is the inhabitants of the lower castes who can support each other and love without restrictions. The samurai in this film is weak, and the classless lovers are noble. <br /> <br /> The film deserves a higher mark. This is a story about the survival of women in feudal Japan. During this period of time, it was believed that men are survivors. Strong, and women - just meaningless and weak property. This film tells about the strength of Japanese women and how they did what they needed to survive, and how their strength allowed Japanese culture to continue their previous work. <br /> <br /> I recommend “The Sea Looks” to anyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa, and even if they are not a fan. This is a beautiful, quiet and soulful film that you need to appreciate in any collection of films.
