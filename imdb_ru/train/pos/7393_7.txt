This film was impressive. My first experience with a foreign film was not too long and not too complicated. I enjoyed the subtitles myself; and the plot was surprisingly fresh. The story that an adult son visited his elderly father and backward brother after a long separation at first seemed boring, but turned out to be very touching and realistic. There was also some subtle humor so as not to overwhelm and not tire the audience.
