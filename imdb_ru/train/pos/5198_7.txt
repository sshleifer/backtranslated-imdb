What can you say about Mr. Moore? He is the godfather of rap, he is the king of Z-level motion pictures, and now he is back, as his most famous character, Dolemite! Can you dig it? This film is one of the insane roller coaster trips with politically incorrect humor, trip kung fu, nudity, cheese, violence, and many other things that you will never find in most modern films (or in any movies, really ha ha !) Routine, which he gives early, you can not miss! Anyway, D2 is definitely an interesting way to spend an hour or so. Dolemit: "He thinks that he is bad and he has no class! I'm going to set fire to this shotgun before his * beep * a **!"
