We must remember that the 50s were almost blank when it came to cinema. Hollywood was in the process of moving from films about patriotic war, noir, two commercials, etc. To films with a message. We had a Blackboard Jungle, On the waterfront and so on. Some people may think that this is an improvement. I do not. Who was the tycoon who said: If you want to send a message, call Western Union? He was right. These psychological thrillers are less interesting than some kind of remote therapy. <br /> <br /> This is one item. We are talking about three sisters who are trying to wrest control over the property of their late father. One of them, perhaps the only one worthy of redemption, enlists the help of the company's pilot to help her keep the rest of her family in fear. He is initially in this for bucks, but eventually falls in love with her. Meanwhile, the rest of the family plans sabotage the novel. Results are predictable. You get a little bit of everything in this movie. Sexual tension between the sisters. A bit of subtle masochism. Hereditary madness - if there is such a thing. We never meet with parents, but they must have really screwed up. The cast is virtually unknown. One or two actors sound vaguely familiar. The game is so bad, it's hard to believe. It was released under the auspices of United Artists by Bel-Air Productions. He was shot dead in and around Los Angeles mostly at night and probably without permission. The end was so strange that I thought it was a joke. As if they ran out of money, and the producer decided to wrap it in the middle of the stage. <br /> <br /> I can't explain it - even to myself - but I gave away this pile of 8/10 trash. I am familiar with the term “This is so bad, this is good,” but I don’t think I’ve ever come across this phenomenon before. Well, maybe Hot Rods to Hell, but this one definitely fits. You might want to try this if you like movies that seem to have been made in someone’s basement.
