The only film, apart from “Soilent Green”, in which the atmosphere of hopelessness reigns, is “On the Beach”. Both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet for man-made disasters. On the beach with nuclear war and Soilent Green with the ecological poisoning of the planet. <br /> <br /> Perhaps there is reason for some optimism, because as of 2007 we have not achieved any of the worlds described in these films, and we should have by now. About 8 million people still live in New York, not 22 million at the turn of the millennium, as described in Soilent Green. Environmentalists always welcome this film as a demonstration of the effects of global warming. For me, it also shows that the ethics of the right to life is not in order. It is obvious that in this world there is also no family planning. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston is a New York City police detective living with his roommate Edward G. Robinson, who is old enough to remember Earth before the crash. The murder was committed, Joseph Cotten, the head of Soylent Corporation, a multinational concern that developed a food product, a kind of plate in many colors to feed the population of the planet. His latest product is Soylent Green. <br /> <br /> An investigation reveals that Charlton Heston got his man, but it also leads to some horrific truths about Soylent and the future of humanity. When Heston at the end shouts that Soilent Green consists of people, that we have become a race of cannibals, it is terrifying that there is no alternative. We have exhausted the planet, and we must eat our dead to survive. <br /> <br /> This was Edward G. Robinson’s farewell presentation, and in his memoirs, Heston spoke touchingly about Robinson, although they had different political views. A few weeks after Robinson completed this final scene of his death on screen due to consonant euthanasia, he died in real life. Few knew, but Heston knew that Robinson was deadly, and there was no role between them in this final death scene. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the schedule was chosen, it does not mean that the world conceived by Soylent Green may not come true. I hope we will have not only intelligence, but also a sense of shared responsibility, so that this does not happen.
