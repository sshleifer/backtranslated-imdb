The premise of this film has long struck my imagination. We have all heard or read about it in some context. What would you do if you were alone in the world? What would you do if the whole world suddenly disappeared before your eyes? In fact, the last part is what happens to Dave and Andrew, two roommates living in a ruined house in the middle of the freeway. Andrew is nervous at least, and Dave is considered one of the biggest losers of society. This alone is the main reason why these two guys get along so well with each other, because they just need to talk to each other only when they need comfort. Only until ... <br /> <br /> From the very beginning of the film, many problems occur to them. Both of them are involved in a crime, Andrew suffers from paranoia and just does not dare to leave the house. Dave is unsuccessful at work, and his colleagues are not very good to him and deserve respect. The number of problems they face continues to grow until the day when they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it. This is too much for them, and they want everything to just disappear ... And, of course, this is exactly what is happening. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story puts Dave and Andrew into this world of nothingness. At first, they are surprised and have problems understanding and understanding the features of this crazy environment, but later they learn that they can do almost anything they want, because it seems that they are the only ones who are still left. <Br /> <br /> Nothing shows an incredibly small cast - in fact, apart from the first two shots from the film, we see only Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) in the entire film. It is clear that in order to accomplish this, the cast must be more than ready to perform the task, because in a world where nothing exists, there is nothing that could distract the viewer in any way. Vincenzo decided to use a reasonable number of shots at close range to make it more interesting, and in fact it works quite well. Photography director Derek Rogers also knows how to tease the audience by hiding visual information, especially in cases where the character sees something and reacts to it, but we don’t see it right away. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this cannot be an event-driven film, and it is not. Most of the action takes place outside their home when they move in the void. And it is here that some of the funniest scenes take place, especially when Andrew discovers a candy bar. <br /> <br /> Now you might think: “How does nothing look?” Well, it really looks like nothing. The whole world is nothing white ... white no matter what direction you are looking. This is the weakness of this film ... After an hour or less, it becomes extremely boring to watch, and there must be events to be more interesting. Thank God, there are some. For example, sometimes, when two guys because of the properties are not able to jump really high, as if nothing is made of ... tofu (as Andrew claims). It's nice to see how they can instantly use nothing to become the gods of their small society. <br /> <br /> One of the best parts of the film is the film set ... Production designer Jasna Stefanovich did a wonderful job in this film, the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally funny to watch, but for these two it seems right to live in a place like this. In general, the film's design is without a doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film, because the film is really worth seeing ... <br /> <br /> However, the best part of the film is the acting. Both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller really look like professional actors. The camera is installed on them every second of the film, and, as already mentioned, there are practically no supports in the film, they are really on a bare stage. With a lot of character development and some decent one-liners, an intelligent dialogue (sometimes ridiculously silly), it all works for this — and it really moves the film from a low-budget area to a well-thought out manual work. <Br /> <br /> Let's talk a little about visual effects, because they definitely deserve a mention. Nothing is different with digital visual effects and prosthetics that fit any modern horror movie. There is a rather horrific sequence of dreams in the film, and although The Drews has completely milked this scene, it’s still interesting to watch it. One of the best visual effects in the film is the end in which Andrew and Dave suddenly find their strength in this environment - they have the ability to dismiss everything, so if they can do it the other way around and make things appear? <br /> <br /> “Nothing” is a bright and well-lit film, it really helps to promote the idea that they are probably dead (in fact, it is one of their theories), but “Nothing” is comedy and he slowly destroys his own theory. We do not know where they are or what happened to them. We do not know if they will ever come out, because the film ends before we see something like that. By the way, the ending is not as good as it could be. Predicting what will happen is fairly easy, however, the authors came up with several incidents that would help make it a little more interesting, and, in the end, it is quite satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Take The Void Man, Kill Bill, The Cube, The Epoch, and many other films, and you have Nothing. It’s really a mixture of different styles, but there’s no other movie (at least, which I know about.) For those who remember the original Cube Production commentary on their DVD, you may recall that Vincenzo Natalie talked about how he came up with the story of Cube. He says that he and Andre Bizhelik were roommates at the time, and they were both in this extremely boring room, not hoping to get out. "Nothing" could well be shielded Siai origin of the story of Cuba, and for this purpose it is almost like one of the prequels of Cuba. <br /> <br /> What can I say? I liked Nothing, this is a great movie, and the various parts of the film are extremely well made with tons of smart ideas, but I still feel that something is missing in the film, and I have problems determining what it is ... Maybe if we have “Nothing 2”, I can answer this question. “Nothing” is a great movie, but not as good as I expected. <br /> <br /> Final rating: 7.5 / 10
