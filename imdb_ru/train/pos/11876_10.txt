You know, when someone today watches this film about Brian DePalm, I'm sure that he has been criticized for a long time. Also about violence. When I watched this movie on VHS, when I was 20, I thought it was ulta violent and tough. But I did not understand "this." <br /> <br /> Several decades have passed, man, how do I know how much I haven’t got in this movie !! This is a remake of an excellent film, shot back in the 30s-40s. How can you improve the classics? I'm not. But you are telling a story that has been updated by the eyes of the "new immigrants" during the decade experienced by greed, more than the indulgent 80s. DePalma, Stone and the gang represent an ambitious, disturbing and damn good movie. <br /> <br /> Yes ... Disco was dying, and New Wave / Punk was taking over, but these immigrants from Cuba, who were supposed to make a new home in Florida, could not understand the difference. It was exciting, it was what they wanted, but how to get it ???? For these immigrants, there was only one way to get it in Florida, where they had a lot of money, and in order to get money, you had to take control of the drug empire. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino for me, like Tony Montana, was a fantastic "little train that could." What an amazing way to see your main character in America: fight, kill, steal. to lie, to deceive everyone in order to get - “money, women and power”. <br /> <br /> This is what Tony considered the American dream. <br /> <br /> He wanted it, he wanted to live it and in his circle did not see anything wrong with how he went to get it. English proficiency in Tony Montana was intensely full of the word “f”, but what did you expect when finishing school for Emily Post for him and his associates? See how they came to America, that they knew what they were undergoing. That’s how Tony and his team decided to “be all they could be in America.” It was all about strength. Tony Montana would do and do ANYTHING to achieve this ... in all its cruel, deceitful, stolen, crooked, thievish glory. <br /> <br /> The part of the film that personified me in the 1980s is money laundering. The crew of Tony brings bags of drugs to the bank. Were there any worries about Tony and his team? In the clubs where he spent and drank? Nope Money was money, and with money you get power. Tony lived high above the pigs. He and his pretty blonde from the American trophy, for whom he married, played quite well Michelle Pfiffer. <br /> <br /> After Tony Montana comes to power, he learns that there really is shit. He is riddled with doubt, he is a drug addict, he is paranoid, he is surrounded by those who want to take him in a bloody seizure, his 80th-century American blonde drug addict, whom he finds out, is a bore that he must keep on his empire ... he goes down. And down he goes in a terrifying violent style, but again I ask, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> This is the most significant film of the 1980s, telling you a perverse story about how some people misunderstand the American dream ... an obsession. It is cruel, bloody, overly so ... but it distracts attention. Not all Cubans, thrown out from Cuba, who landed in Florida in the 1980s, were something of a Tony Montana. Give me a break. But showing how sad the 1980s were, with an emphasis on greed and money as the only measures in the US to “be somebody” and have power, influenced these poor characters and their lives in America. <br /> <br /> Makes you think - anything since - today learned?
