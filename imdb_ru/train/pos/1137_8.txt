This is very, very funny. You know how comedy should be. It also looks very, very good, like in a Hollywood production. So what else do you want? Hutz about very VERY good Sally Fields. Here she is much better than everything I've ever seen her, and she looks damn good. This film is all you need to understand why she is a star. This eyes! Like a silent movie star, but better. In fact, everyone has such good eyes. I used to pretend to be a bad soap show actor with my girlfriend. We would make it so that you look very quickly from one eye to another of your partner. They don't do it on the soap dish at all. Fine. There are eyes! (sorry) <br /> <br /> There are so many amazing performances, just wondering when each one of them will appear again. With Kevin Klein, there is a whole seminar on how to replay very, very subtly. Got it? Yeah, he's damn good. Just like Robert Downey Jr., who has since made a career playing Slick, Slimy Executive. Katy Moriarity, though not the most gifted actress, is so charismatic and exciting, especially when she gets angry. And even Whoopi Goldberg is decent, her natural timing gives here a little flat delivery of a little Zing. Well, no Whoopi beats, I hear you. <br /> <br /> And then there is Hair. The soap dish was made at the end of the eighties BIG Hair, so the ridiculous guys themselves are like a great character. They are getting bigger and more stupid, just like you. Yes, we have photos. <br /> <br /> Soapy plate is better than I thought, better than I wanted. I'm tired of films that tell me that I have to take care of small, self-centered, semi-talented egomaniacs, i.e. TV soap actors. The soap dish seems happy, just laughed at them. Thank you.
