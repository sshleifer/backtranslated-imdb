The review took place on September 12, 2006. The second show at the Paramount 1 theater during the Toronto International Film Festival. The world premiere of the film took place the day before in the cinema "Elegin Theater". <br /> <br /> The main plot of the film - Morgan Freeman plays one popular actor, who is on the descent of his career and plays in the film. roles that may be below him, but which he still makes with a positive attitude, knowing that he has to pay rent, etc. The downward bias is indicated by the fact that he was long between roles with previous clicks in the trash cans of the DVD and his driver is a not-so-confident production assistant who sends Freeman to the local community market, where he is going to do research on the role of the supermarket manager. Soon he discovers that the real market is controlled by an iron clerk of "10 items or less", played by Paz Vega. When Freeman's trip never returns, and Vege needs help preparing for the interview, circumstances force them to join forces on a trip around the city to get Freeman back home and get Vega work that will help her move up the career path. <br /> <br /> Although the film was enjoyable, it seemed like it was still a sketch or a work in progress. There were two extended musical sequences (one with Vega and Freeman teaching each other songs for children in the car, the other that literally plays like Paul Simon’s music video), which looked like an addition to raise time, and even then the film was only about 80 minutes . <br /> <br /> It's good that Morgan Freeman is just as pleased as he is, because without him that would be too little. Of course, it was fun piece by piece, and Paz Vega is also fascinating, but there simply wasn’t enough to say that this is a complete movie. <br /> <br /> They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car. ask for directions, and Paz Vega said that she never does. Who ever heard of a guy who wants to ask for directions, and a woman doesn’t? In the real world, everything is exactly the opposite. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay on credit. A little with saleswoman Target Store, teaching Morgan Freeman how to stimulate sales, is ridiculous! Previously, when chauffeur Freeman insisted that Freeman's voice on reading The Book on the Tape was also quite funny. <br /> <br /> Director / screenwriter Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there after short questions and answers after screening. Silberling answered one question, saying that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman and that when Freeman took on the role, he actually changed very little of what was there. It is a great compliment to both the Silberling composition and the way Freeman can simply enter the role and create the feeling that he is born to play it.
