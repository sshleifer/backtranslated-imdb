Michelle Rodriguez is a well-built high school student who discovers that she has a powerful blow and begins an amateur workout at the Brooklyn gym. Santiago Douglas is a handsome young man, barely older than her, who also trains there. They meet after the lesson, so to speak, and feel attracted to each other. No sex Santiago was instructed to save him for the next fight. <br /> <br /> Both are participants of the sports program "blind by sex", in which there is no distinction between men and women, an erroneous attempt to level the sports playing field. . <br /> <br /> A conservative broadcaster recently announced - and I swear I don’t make it up - “Let's face it; the president is black. ” I am here to make equally insightful observation - "Men and women are different." Now, in 99 cases out of 100, this should not make any difference in physical performance. But in the first percent - trained athletes, whose skills are honed to perfection - men usually have an advantage. With their narrow hips, they can run faster. And they have a lot of muscle mass and upper body strength. These differences in the structure of the body allow women to give birth and raise children, and men - to obtain and kill food for them. This sexual split is the result of a completely normal process of natural selection. Without it there could be no people at all. And that's why boys and girls, that's why they have men's and women's events at the Olympics. I speak with you as with your anthropologist. This will be a dime, preferably PayPal. <br /> <br /> That's why I called this program for the blind sex incorrect. An equally talented boxer, like Rodriguez, approaching the zenith of the game, she will eventually lose to a man. <br /> <br /> This is where this movie has difficulty. Rodriguez finally got close to his friend Douglas. Neither of them wants to be angry with the other, not to mention the rights to the ruins, but the pride of both is at stake, and pride is connected with both personal and gender aspects. Douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring. And Rodriguez is offended by the fact that she considers him a patronizing attitude. It all ends happily. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much from the movie. I thought it would be a Million Dollar Bond of Eastwood, until I discovered that it was released a few years ago. And I have never heard of the director or any of the performers. Such ambiguity, as a rule, sets in motion the poorly weeping for television, etc. But I was surprised at how neatly it was folded. The complete absence of nonsense left me with my mouth open. The same can be said about the minimum use of boxing clichés - worn ropes, blood, cuts of a swollen eye, battered people after a fight, a fat and sweaty observer screaming "Kill him!", Slow landing gloves on the nose, a spray of sweat from a disfigured head, heroic music, signaling the long-awaited apotheosis of the winner. None of this here - well, almost nothing. The whole plot can be considered formal. A cool kid finds an outlet in the ring, and so on. <br /> <br /> The feeling you have left is that this is probably almost what these amateur contests are like. Unlike those that we see on TV and in ordinary movies. For example, bells do not ring. Instead, the dancing and observant judge screams "Stop!" And "Box!" Contestants wear hats. The gym is not filled with a crowd of cheering spectators, but only by a handful of people who show particular interest in what is happening. This is a clean film, despite the rather gloomy situation and unhappy family dynamics. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez may look pretty bad, despite the fact that her muscular mass and her eyes glow under a lowered eyebrow, but as soon as you get used to the idea that this is a girl who can beat you to death in any time you want, and as soon as you hear the feminine contours of her supersegmental, it is not bad. (The scene in which she battles with her father on the floor is overdoing.) It was a little difficult to understand Douglas’s restraint when Rodriguez crawls over him in bed. Director Karin Kusama carefully selected her talent. <br /> <br /> Shows what you can do with talent, imagination and a little money. There should be more films like this. Take one of those multi-billion dollar blockbusters full of dinosaurs or spaceships, and spread out a little bounty.
