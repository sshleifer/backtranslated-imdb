This is a romantic comedy in which Albert Einstein plays Walter Mattau perfectly, and his friends play matches with his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interaction between these main roles is complemented by a stunning cast of well-known actors. This movie is cute and funny ... "sensual man"! Abundant recommendations.
