When I was a kid, it was time Lex Barker as Tarzan. I often heard from older people that Johnny Weissmuller “was” Tarzan, and I don’t understand why, since I’ve seen a couple of Weismüller’s latest films in this character, and I thought that he was out of shape. Not many years later, I stumbled upon "Tarzan and his companion," and then I understood. Weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and harsh appearance characteristic of the requirements of characters who have not yet met other Tarzans such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Christopher Lambert. <br /> <br /> Regarding this film, I was also surprised by the sensual presence of a beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan, a strong, thinking, active and “not holding back” woman, because Jane was far ahead of the times in which the film was made (Tarzan she pushes naked in a pond when she is entertained, one of the researchers surprises her, and although she does not kiss him, she somehow lets him do it a little and does not make anything special from it); such behavior was unthinkable with such "Janes" as Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Houston or Dorothy Hart, they all played a kind of too perfect nice vulnerable women, which is why it is hard to believe that they can survive in a hostile place, such like the african jungle. <br /> <br /> O'Sullivan’s character’s brilliant personality hides the show from Tarzan himself, except, of course, when it comes to action, and Weismüller easily takes the initiative; the combination is perfect. Another highlight in the film is the secondary role of Chita, and not the main role, as in the later Tarzan films, where she often saves the day. <br /> <br /> “Tarzan and his companion” is a great product in its genre (Tarzan Films) and, perhaps, as the best, although I must admit that I also liked Tarzan’s Greatest Adventures (1959) made with a higher budget and a strong cast (and in spite of the perfectly acceptable Gordon Scott starring with his all-too-good-looking “whole gymnasium”, which is not suitable for a village monkey man). <br /> <br /> Good for Jane and her boyfriend!
