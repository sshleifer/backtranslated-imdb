This is great! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding teamed up to make a powerful and very influential film. This is a true story about the first black diver of the US Navy and the obstacles that he encountered when receiving his certificate from a master racist diver. Along the way, he also has to face simple old fanaticism from all of his classmates, none of whom want him in his class. They come out of the barracks when he arrives. Ultimately, he becomes certified and continues an excellent career as a US Navy diver. Look at this! This is a great story of courage and honor. When the story unfolds, we observe racism slowly dissipating, and everyone begins to respect men one by one.
