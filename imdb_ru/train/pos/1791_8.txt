This is not a deep film; most aspects of the plot are quite predictable and “tested and true”, but they were well developed and gave some interesting points about what we could regret (our “mistakes”, as the film calls them) when we look back on our lives . I did not read the book, so I did not know anything except the story of a dying woman, who has long-standing memories that she did not tell anyone about. Fortunately, they got a first-class cast ... Meryl <br /> <br /> Stripe's daughter, Mami Gammer, plays a young Leela, and then Meryl appears at the end of the movie like old Leela ... in addition to the amazing similarity (spirit!) the young actress did a great job (maybe not quite up to her mom's level, but who?) Everyone else in this film was fine, although I would like it to be more Glen Close and think that the character Buddy was too dramatic. <br /> <br /> This is more of a film for girls than for guys, but it’s better to watch it with your mother or daughter, and maybe start a dialogue. How difficult it is to really know a parent as a “person”!
