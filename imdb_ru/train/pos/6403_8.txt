In the film MEN OF HONOR, Cuba Gooding Jr. is featured. He plays Carl Brashear, a man of high courage and heroism. He is a poor farmer from the south who wants to become a naval diver, but he has problems because of his race. The head of the diving school, played by Robert De Niro, is a racist goon who nevertheless respects Brashir. A film about how Brashear has to agree with almost insurmountable chances, not once, but twice. The performances make this film special. Gooding is great, and DeNiro, the best actor in cinema history, gives an outstanding presentation - his best dramatic work in recent years. Charlize Theron gives another solid performance in the role of De Niro's much younger wife. The film is based on too strong patriotism (although not at the same level as in “PATRIOT”), and some of the characters are simply bad in one dimension (Mr. Pappa Hal Holbrook is simply evil), but the film today is rare among films. This is uplifting and not cynical. Great movie.
