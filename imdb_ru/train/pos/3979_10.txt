I just wish all fans of this documentary knew that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I am so proud of him. This mini-series, shown on VH1, is a great look at the drug culture of the past 30 years, and my uncle has worked very hard on this. The amount of time and effort that I watched as he invested in this documentary and the book that started it all (“I can't find my way home”) makes it much better to watch on TV. I know that he loves what he does, and he does it well. His eloquence is shown in the interviews he did himself, and in the amazing additions that he himself adds to the commentary. From music to video and everything in between, this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of drug culture through the eyes of a person who has experienced it. I appreciate any comments on this from those who liked (or did not like) and would like to hear from fans! Three cheers for Uncle Martin !!!
