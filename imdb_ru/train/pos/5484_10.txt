This film is mainly a documentary about a chronologically ordered series of events that took place from 10 to 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the presidential palace of Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela. <br /> <br /> Paphos of the film is real and everyone feels the pain, sadness and joy of the people who survived this failed coup d'état of President Hugo Chávez. <br /> <br /> One person departs from watching this film that Hugo Chavez is a truly great historical figure, the person of Hugo Chávez alone, forced the Venezuelan people to overthrow the three-day junta established by the military and restore the democratically established government of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> The film shows that George W. Bush helped and promoted the Venezuelan coup d'état. The fact that the mainstream media helped and instigated George W. Bush is not surprising. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is how few people have seen this film and how few people are aware of the total corruption of the American media. <br /> <br /> In 1986, it took Ronald Reagan only 20 years to transform the doctrine of justice in 1986 to turn America into a blind and disorderly state. <br /> <br /> May Hugo Chavez reveal the truth and beauty of true American vision to the patriotic views of Americans.
