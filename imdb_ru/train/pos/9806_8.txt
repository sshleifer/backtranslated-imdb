I agree that the Capital should be on DVD. I watched this show only by chance in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans working abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved all the other roles in which he played. I can not believe that the series lasted only 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudsonâ€™s bright charming friend on the show. When they broadcast this show in the New York area, it was always late at night or after hours. The show lasts less than an hour. I felt that this show should have lasted longer, but the changes in the line-up in the second season really made the show a little less interesting. I didn't care about Sylvia, but I missed actress Julia Phillips-Lane the previous season. I felt that this show was risking, and often it worked. This was shown by Americans who loved and decided to live in London. American characters were not arrogant or attempted to outdo their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they were trying to internationalize the cast, and not to make them all British. I liked to watch Julia Ormond in one of the first roles. I felt that this show should have lasted longer. From time to time I felt that the preview lasted less than an hour. They could move the cast to New York, and it would be a hit in America.
