Leave it to Braic to have a good show. Finally, he and Zorak live outside Spac Ghost Coast To Coast. I must say that I really like both of these shows. These are what Adult Swim started with. Brack achieved success with the album, which was released in 2000. It may not have been platinum, but his show was very popular among many people who love the Adult Swims show. I have to say that of all the shows of “Adult swimming” without a plot, it should be the one on which there was not one plot. That's why I like it so much, it's just such a classic in the history of Adult Swim. I think it's just a great show if you don't like it. Hey, there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it.
