This is a series of "something else." Sometimes the European series are less accurate than the American ones, but this time the authors achieved the right goal by creating a mix that works smoothly. Edel & Starck is great, he has everything: a great plot, smart, witty, always well-set scenes, stunning theatrical performances of all stars and beautiful shots of Berlin, one of the most interesting cities in the world. It is interesting to see how things are going in the field of justice in other countries except the USA, and this time to “feel” the former European way of life. Kudos to all actors and film crew for a well-made comedy that you definitely need to see in the coming years. Watch the series in German just super.
