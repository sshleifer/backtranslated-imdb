Zero Day is a film that few people have seen, and what a shame it is. <br /> <br /> When I saw the end, when two main characters walk down the room and ruthlessly kill people, they commit suicide. and it made me grab my stomach. I was shaking, that's how strong this film is. <br /> <br /> The movie is awesome. This is too incredible not to get the perfect ten. Sadly, so few people understand the true beauty of this film. This is not a budget that makes a movie a good one, but the number of sensations that creators put into it that make it a good one. <br /> <br /> This leaves you with the constant impression that you just can't get out. It makes you aware of the real horror of filming, especially if you recognize this person, and this film makes you feel that you know these people. <br /> <br /> I recommend Zero Hour to those who feel mature. look at me is fourteen, and I feel that this film is too amazing to be expressed in words. It feels like you're watching something that actually happened.
