I have to mention two failures, so that you understand that this film did brilliantly where they failed: “The Scanner is Gloomy” and “Immortel Ad Vitam”. If you were excited by the concepts of these two films and felt sad disappointment (like me), you will probably like the Renaissance. He immerses you in the world of the future of Paris. This is not exactly dystopian. They did the animation so well that I thought it was a rotoscope, but as far as I can tell, it was not just a motion capture. Facial expressions are awesome! Since the days of TRON, I have not seen a fantastic world, so well displayed in the animation / live hybrid. The black and white medium is used to slowly direct your attention to the subject of the scene; my favorite effect was what they did with the headlamp rays, watch this. The director plays with your attention and confusion, but ultimately you are satisfied that you have found the thread that he wants you to find. The overall effect is a harsh and gritty urban world filled with small surprises. <br /> <br /> The plot is secondary but not scary. This is a noir. For most of the main characters, there is a background that gives them some depth. The weather is There are “sets”, so that you can feel in different places of Paris. There are some actions, and even a car chase. I am going to see it again to get everything. I also recommend a very large screen for viewing, since the “sets” are detailed and the credits are small.
