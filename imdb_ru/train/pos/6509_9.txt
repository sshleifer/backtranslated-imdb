I just can't believe some comments on this show! The show is simply brilliant! Of course, this does not follow the proven and truthful, but we, as consumers, always want the same things to impose on us again and again. Are we not able to relax and enjoy something new from time to time? The style is not as realistic as the previous show "Scooby Doo", but should not be. The show called “Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get a Key” (“Shaggy and Scooby Doo”) is a hint in which part of this name says that all the other cast members of other performances will constantly participate in the action. And nowhere does it say that they will unravel the mysteries, and they cannot even bear the monsters, so why should they? I'm actually glad that they put some old plot points that work on the Scooby-Doo show. They still have jokes, awkward hi-jinki, fast-changing outfits in chase scenes, standard fun in the hallway and even Scooby snacks. Actually, I'm glad this show is there, because I just love it. I am even glad that they for some time got rid of the rest of the team and concentrated only on the two main characters and the villain. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is ridiculous, it should be so! Of course, this is different, it should be. This should make you laugh at the villain and cheer on the idiotic robot butler, who will defeat all invading parasites, regardless of their size. You should get the joke "Roobi-Roo". It all stacked so well that I can't think that this is WRONG. Writing, acting, animation, all at the highest level. The title music is awesome (my computer plays “GET A CLUE!” When I download it), and the background music just captures.
