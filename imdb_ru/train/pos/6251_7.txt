There is nothing brilliant, innovative or innovative in this, but Dog Days is for some reason an extremely fascinating study of character. It's like CRASH, stumbling over a bad dose of heroin, but not quite. This is an Austrian film that tells about the life of several depressive, deranged and annoying people and their abusive relationship with each other. This is alarming, but it works very well, and it is interesting to watch the crazy little things these characters do. Of course, not for the faint of heart, this extremely pessimistic film offers no conclusions or revelations at the end, we just see the life of these disgusting people for two days. Rating: B
