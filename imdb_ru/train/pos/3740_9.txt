While it was filmed on the site of the Florida National Guard, Tigerland fully reminded me of Fort Polk, Louisiana, test sites, maneuver areas, waist depth, and so on. The film was quite authentic, and the characters were similar to those of my AIT in 1974. The difference between the year in Thigerland, 1971 and mine, in 1974, is that all the sergeants and instructors knew that they would not return to Vietnam, since that was pretty much everything, so the training was very relaxed - no problem at all. It was a forerunner of all our troubles in the 70s and 80s, which I know for sure, since I stayed there until 2004. I have never heard anyone mention Tigerland, but the army did have realistic training villages in Vietnam at various bases throughout the United States. Vietnamese veterinarians tell me that until 1972 Basic & AIT could be quite rude and rude, because the instructors were there and were authorized to teach people from Vietnam these skills to do it, although this was not always the case. And the sergeant instructor at Regiment, and later one of my veterinary sergeants in Vietnam, when we became instructors at the main training brigade in Fort Bliss, told me that they could not do anything to prepare anyone, and people just had to find out and find out for themselves. This film is rated highly.
