It seems that even the director does not like this film, but for me, I think it is a bit harsh towards myself. <br /> <br /> Of course, itâ€™s not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots, and the story is good enough to interest you everywhere. <br /> <br /> It is shot in a pretty village that also adds to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies made in England, try it. <br /> <br /> I just saw the trailer for the last directorial film, The Devil's Chair, which looks pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> There is not enough English horror movies for me, so any that appear deserve our attention, and this one is not as bad as you think
