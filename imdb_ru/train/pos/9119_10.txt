An interesting look at how we, people, so often behave, sometimes blinds our desire to achieve perfection, which sometimes destroys the basis of what we are trying to achieve. It also addresses the question of how we tend to ignore those of us who are not so frank, and at the same time may miss a great opportunity. The introduction of comedy also makes watching the movie a pleasant experience ... Be sure to look at anyone interested in a reflexive but comical view of life. I look forward to your next product. I hope that you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment. Great job ...... Joan
