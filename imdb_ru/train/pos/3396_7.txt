Very interesting. The big turn wasn't as big a shock as they might have hoped, and it was very outdated, but it made my mind work. It really made me think about a world without vegetation and livestock and made me appreciate the world in which I live, a lot more. Charlton Heston does a good job, like all the minor characters, and it was a very realistic film that was awesome. At times he lacked direction, and many of the settings and background needed additional explanation, but still it was an amazingly good and clever movie. The main mistake I could find was that I didnâ€™t want the film to end when it happened, I would like to see what happens next. <br /> <br /> 7/10
