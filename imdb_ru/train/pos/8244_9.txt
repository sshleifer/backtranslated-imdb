Loved it! What don't you like? - you have a suburb, you have a zombie, you have family problems, you have social dilemmas, you have one fine retro-style food of the 1950s under the class, held in the bay is not anxious about whether they are next crust top meal. You could not ask for more. <br /> <br /> The cast is great. Carrie Ann Moss - absolute perfection, as a debutante, a housewife in social climbing. She is both senseless and criminally conspiratorial. Every guy's dream. K'sun is really great, as the son is just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmarish existence and somehow succeeds. He is present present on the screen. Very photogenic and natural. Without naming them all, the rest of the cast is wonderful. Henry Cherni plays a suspicious cop with sharpened instincts and a little disgust, as if he were his ordinary person. Billy Connolly is adorable as Fido. Wonderful actor: I would like him to play a major role in Braveheart with director Gibson. I feel that his William Wallace would be closer to the real character. His Fido is restrained, but accessible. Nice touch. <br /> <br /> In short, a wonderful and amazing satirical blow to the manners, values, social predilections, feelings, growth, overcoming difficulties in unstable times and compensatory adaptations to impossible conditions. Real reality show.
