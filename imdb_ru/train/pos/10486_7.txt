“Salvation of grace” is never funny, but it delivers a lot of good laughter, and I greatly enjoyed it. Brenda Bletin is a great actress, and she copes with the image of the widower Grace, who resorts to growing marijuana to pay off her debts. The supporting cast also does a good job. The French actor Checky Karyo plays a funny little role. The premise alone is attractive. The idea of ​​how a woman grows and smokes grass sounds pretty funny. And the film from time to time plays with the premise wisely. Of course, there are flat moments, for example, when two elderly women take Grace's marijuana leaves for tea leaves, and they start pulling children's pranks in the store where they work. It was a meaningless joke that didn’t quite fly out. The tone of the film is dull and sometimes dull, but I laughed enough to recommend this English import. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 (out of 10)
