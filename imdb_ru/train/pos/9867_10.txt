I first saw the Ice Age in Subiaco cinemas when it came out, back in 2002. I was then only 13 years old, but even then I liked it. It was kind of warm. <br /> <br /> We shot it for several years now, and no matter how many times you watch it, it’s never boring. This is because of the one element that distinguishes it from all the other three-dimensional animations made at that time - the characters do not have a special “house” that they leave. They are nomads, and this is really refreshing and inspiring to watch. <br /> <br /> In addition, every single character on the surface seems to just put up with each other, but in fact they are all good friends. In addition, all the characters have their charms (even the bad guys). Sid the sloth is charming with its annoying, overly tender and naive look. Manny is charming with his depressive, reclusive character, and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> Another great moment in the film is the beauty of animation. All environments and characters were originally modeled with clay, giving the film an artistic advantage. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that adds to the feel of the film is that gender means very little. There are almost no female characters, but you don’t understand that until you watch them several times, and even then it has little effect on how you watch the movie. In this regard, there is also no mention of the nuclear family, which would really be pitiful in conditions similar to the Ice Age. <br /> <br /> In general, Ice Age is a great movie, and it proves how much effort was added to 3D animation before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles.
