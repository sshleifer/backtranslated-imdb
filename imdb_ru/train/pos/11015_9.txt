This film is directed by Renny Harlin of the Finnish miracle. Stallone - Gabe Walker. Cat-mouse in the mountains with ruthless terrorists. Renny Harlin knows how to manage actionmovie. Stallone needed this role to get back on track. Snow Mountain is a very good place for an action movie, and for whom it is better to make a film where there is snow, ice, cold weather and bad weather than a Finnish person. The action is good! The music in the film is impressive. The bad guy is John Lithgow, the other stars are Michael Rucker (Portrait of a TV series), Janine Turner (Powerful medicine) He's in a great place and this is a very exciting movie. In general, a good movie **** / ***** <br /> <br /> Remember Extreme ääliöt: a special collector's edition, with good additions. Comig is coming soon in Finland right on the video.
