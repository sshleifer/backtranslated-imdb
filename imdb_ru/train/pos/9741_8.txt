I was pleasantly surprised to find that “How to lose friends and alienated people” in no way was such a “funny” comedy as the trailer had expected me to do. I quickly plunged into the unfolding of the narrative and remained absorbed everywhere. I thought it was worth making more visual humorous content. (I mean, I got the impression that I witnessed Pegg’s attempts to regain lost control, so to speak, “in real time.”) At other times, it was time to share the main characters (i.e. Pegg and Dunst) thoughts about how events influenced them and what brought them to where they now find themselves. All the characters were well-played, somewhat interesting in their own right, and generally quite pretty. (Any obvious ruthless manifestation of ambition, as a rule, was restrained by appropriate good-natured resilience.) An entertaining, thoughtful script, brilliantly directed and perfectly played film, which I fully recommend.
