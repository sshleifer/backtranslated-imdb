"Radiofrekchiya" is still a good surprise in Italian cinema. The film is based on the book of Italian songwriter Luciano Ligabue, who also directs the film and records the music - of course. <br /> <br /> The film is a portrait of the life of a northern Italian province in Emilia-Romagna. region. We are in 1975, the time of the first free radio stations - one of the guys from the film creates Radioraptus. Youth desires, friendship, love, sex, individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes, but the film also talks about drugs - Frequia, the main character, is a victim of heroin slavery. <br /> <br /> Not boring and moralistic, the story flows very well; the spontaneity of the actors is strong and the way to control also. Obviously, Luciano "Liga" Ligabue is neither Fellini nor a film professional, above all he is a musician. But he succeeds in creating a good product. Unfortunately, he will not repeat the success with his second film "Da zero a dieci" - not at all good. <br /> <br /> In "Radiofreccia" the actors are not very well known at all, the only star - Stefano Accorsi is one of the most popular young Italian actors. See in the small role of another Italian songwriter - Francesco Guccini, he is a good communist bartender and football coach!
