Let me be sincere, I love the flesh. However, this is similar to one of these “light dives” that you see at the Olympics. It is necessary to mark a little, because it is easier to give a cheap thrill than to drag you into the world, say, an artist of the late Middle Ages. <br /> <br /> This is just a two-hour trip on a ghost and although it is often (or, more precisely, in most cases!) ridiculous and unlikely, it always goes ahead and always entertains. If not always right. Check out the section of memorable quotes on the subject of laughter. <br /> <br /> (However, why he was given the “Worst Film”, Razzie confuses - I bet, in 2006, a thousand of the worst films were made, but this film received treatment because he was considered a fashion victim.) <br /> <br /> Headache and popular writer Katherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London, writing a novel, but death and destruction haunt her, like flies follow a horse in hot weather. Oh my god, she can't even go to the toilet without stumbling over at least two bodies, and I am sure that if she opens the closet in her huge apartment in the penthouse, she will fly out in a grand Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> Yes, of course, a very dangerous woman who is circling around (if you like your pulse above zero), but is she personally responsible? I mean, why would someone connect two and two and think that she might be a murderer? Equally, her reaction to such accusations seems very random. However, is it only a personality disorder (some form of b / c dependence) or another proof of its guilt? <br /> <br /> For reasons that I cannot fully understand or explain, Stone is assigned to psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) for evaluation, and not removed from the cameras after another "lover found dead under mysterious circumstances." Fortunately (for Stone), he is much crazier than any of his patients, and he has a hard home / work life. In the blink of an eye, relationships change from doctor to patient, and then it's hard to say, because it all becomes a bit of a rotating blur. <br /> <br /> Roy Washburn (the weird Welsh) comes to this heady mix. sounding David Thewlis), who says that a doctor in love with a doctor is in his role as a policeman who has been standing for many years - that this woman can be dangerous. I mean, keep the title page. But now Glass has too glass eyes to realize or care for. As a dizzy boxer before prime-secret Mike Tyson, he was ripe for a big hit, but not before he discovered that Washburn could have one or two secrets. <br /> <br /> Now comes Millena Gardosh (Charlotte) Rampling, a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example (in this film) of someone who doesn’t bark crazy or is suspected of murder. Assuming she was really watching the finished film, she should look back nostalgically when her underwear was shot with Stone's ease - fortunately (at least for us), these days are long gone. Oddly enough, she does not think that Stone is as dangerous as everyone else - or she does not think that the script is good enough, or her check is big enough to perform any actions. <br /> <br /> After a few laps, the walkway, roughly outlined above, culminates, which mixes the provincial representative with the coat hanger / turn, which, while the farce, like the rest of the film, gives us plenty for Basic Instinct 3 - it is very unlikely that this may be at this point in time.
