I just saw this movie @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Hal Hartley fans will not be disappointed !! And if you are not familiar with the work of this director ... it does not matter. This film can definitely stand it all by itself. I have to go through the second show ... it was amazing, I need to see it again - and quickly !! <br /> <br /> This movie is very funny. The dialogue is very clever, and Parker Posey's performance is outstanding because she plays the main role in the lead role Fay Grim. "Fay Grim" - the latest feature that tells about the world and characters, presented in the film "Henry the Fool" (2000). Visually, the most noticeable stylistic feature uses the habitual use of the oblique (or Dutch) angle, which can often be seen in Hartley's past works, appearing in various shorts available in “Possible films”: short works from the Hal Hartley collection from 1994–2004 “Girl from Monday” (2005). <br /> <br /> I watched this movie most successfully on September 11th. Textually, the adventures of Fay Grim in this story are connected with the changed world after September 11, 2001. Without going into the main spoilers, I view this work and the world of stories as a bold political and original portrait of geopolitics, which is rarely, if ever, founded mainly in feature films after 911 (see Sirianna: note - Exec. Proc both of these films ... the most interesting, if not more). <br /> <br /> Finally, for those closely associated with the heroes of Henry the Fool, Simone, Fay and Henry, this film is witty and shy. At the same time, Fay Grimm’s character begins in the film, exactly where it was when Henry the Fool ended, but by the end of the film ... Fay’s knowledge and experience completely changed and expanded in the course of the narration. What could be the future for the Faye and Fools family? I can't wait for the third part in this story!
