Not many reviews, so I thought I would add one. <br /> <br /> DO NOT GO TO OTHER REVIEWS! It was a great movie. <br /> <br /> RKS is one of the few Indian directors who can really make a really good movie. <br /> <br /> A. B. and Akshay gave another great example of acting, as in bhoomika, which was a bit unexpected, but pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that there was not much hype around the release. <br /> <br /> Or film screenings / other awards nominations, considering how good the film was. <br /> <br /> Better than Hacks, I thought, and I thought Hakki was also a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly long movie, but definitely worth it and while watching it definitely seems long. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the next RKS movie and the next AB movie, Akshay, they always seem to succeed together ... for example Bacchus. <br /> <br /> Bhomika also played well in the film, and she should be very good if she continues in the same vein in the future.
