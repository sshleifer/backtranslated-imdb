***** Spoilers here ***** <br /> <br /> What really scares you? Killer sharks, or maybe ghosts are trying to get the message back? Maybe a psychopath with a chainsaw? <br /> <br /> Maybe. But these fears cannot even compare with horror, about which people dare not even speak or think - this is the death of their own child. The Pet Cemetery uses this base, the primitive fear of adults, and then takes it to places that most people cannot bear to research. <br /> <br /> I read comments about this film, which include a bad game, characters making stupid decisions, etc. I disagree. Acting is in fact first-rate for such a film. It may not be possible for many to imagine the despair caused by such a scenario. But the events of the film are not only logical, they can be absolutely inevitable, if such a scenario were possible. This is the true horror of Pet Seminaries: it's not that pets and people return from the dead like evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels, but that anyone who lost a child can become so desperate to crimes committed by Louis Creed. Despite the warning or even past history. <br /> <br /> Those who want to go with him into the depths of a desperate human heart. The defender's heart tries to make up for the inability to defend. And the results are terrifying. In fact, when the film sinks into the slasher area near the end, it is almost disappointing, although I think this is quite logical. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m a true horror fan, and I claim that this is one of the worst horror films ever made. If you don't think so, look again after you have children.
