I have to agree with Cal-37, this is a great movie, especially for the family, Kelly Lynch is beautiful, the little girl is really talented and sweet, of course, Jim Belushi has earned her own bands! But I want to really like the song for the piano, if you are a musician or do not watch this film just for this, you will know what it is. <br /> <br /> “You are nobody until someone loves you” “Written by Russ Morgan, Larry Stoke and James Kavano <br /> <br /> So have fun watching <br /> <br / > See you, <br /> <br /> Nelson
