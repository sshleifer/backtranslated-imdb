I totally agree that “Nothing” is a fantastic film! I didn’t laugh so much when I watched the movie for ages! and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are fantastic in this! They really work well together! This film may not please some people (I can not say why, without spoiling it!), But each in its own way! I liked it a lot and I highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> The direction is excellent and some shots are very smart. Looks like they could have fun when they shot it! <br /> <br /> Although the film is really only two main characters, and not so many props, the actors manage to make it to make the film enjoyable to watch.
