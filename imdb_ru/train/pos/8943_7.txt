The 1960s serial Bewitched owes its idea from this film. This is a film that was shot by Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak right after they were shot in Alfred Hitchcock. This one is not as intrusive as this one, but Novak is just as fascinating. <br /> <br /> This was Jack Lemmons' 10th film, and he supports well here, as does Ernie Kovacs. The film has a lot of good. Hermina Gingold is very good in this film, almost as good in support as in Musician. The cast is very solid. <br /> <br /> This film is reminiscent of the New York scene of the late 1950s and a cat that is as good as any cat in any movie. Worth seeing, because this is a love story with all the emotions and a little bit of magic. <br /> <br /> This is not “Dizziness”, but I think that the audience did not do that after this movie. appreciate it as well as he deserved - of course, glad that William Asher saw it, so the 1960s series was created. I'm not very happy about what Will Ferrell did to him on the big screen, this film is much better than that.
