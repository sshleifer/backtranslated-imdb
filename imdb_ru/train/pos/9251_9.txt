What can I say? Miss Erika Eleniak is my favorite blond girl, and as an Italian, the number one fan of female beauty, I cannot forget this film. <br /> <br /> You know, I really don’t know I don’t remember much about the plot, or situations, or other actors. I can only remember the awesome gorgeous Erika and that she looks better than ever in this film, I really don't care if it's a bad film or a good film, I only care about pleasant moments when I was a teenager in Brooklyn I think about the beauty of Erica. <br /> <br /> Well, to conclude that if you are a beauty fan of Erica Eleniak, like me, this film is for you.
