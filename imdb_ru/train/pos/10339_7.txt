I saw a trailer for this on Afro Promo, a collection of African American movie trailers. It looks like it is; a very tendentious "stupid" comedy in which an anxious black man realizes that his son is gay. It would seem that the wife of Redd Fox (RF) left him for the sake of her brother, who works with him in the "shop" in Phoenix. He took the bus to visit his son. Norman is in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> When RFF arrives, Norman, wearing only powder-blue bikini shorts, leaves the waterway to open the door. Trying to gain time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what seems to be the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake his lover, who steadfastly refuses to budge. It was just at the time when I wrote "WHY he will not wake up?" when suddenly he does it, and the jaws of me and my friend fell for the first time many times when we first saw the blue-eyed vortex Garson, the white life lover of Norman, who just had the most faaaaaabulous dream ?? "Garson is a flaming queen of the type who can be imagined ONLY as coming from Los Angeles in 1976. He has dresses, a purse and large clumsy decorations, and he seems to have modeled both his appearance and the image on Carol Brady from" Brady Bunch ". <Br /> <br /> Norman orders his lover to find another place to stay during his father's visit. Garson goes to stay with Waylon Flowers, and Madame answers the call when Norman calls. <br /> <br /> So the RF is trying to reach his wife in Mexico. While he is on the phone, while Garson is dressed to pack his dress, and Russia confronts him. With a surge of soul music from the 70s, designed to evoke his cherished revelation (but sounding like we're going to hear a very special track, The Emotions), he realizes that his son gay. <br /> <br /> His First Impulse: “I will kill him. I will kill him.” Then RFF goes for a long walk, where he sorts through all the thoughts that may arise from a confused parent, such as “ be, we taught him too early. " All his thoughts are caused by something that he sees on his walk, for example, a hefty truck driver who appears just as he reflects on what a real man does. Surprisingly, he goes to the bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality. I must say, this is about eight books about homosexuality more than my parents bought. Then he goes straight to the park bench and reads them all! <br /> <br /> After this, RF Hires Audrey, a six-meter Amazonian prostitute (in this amazing piece of fur) played by Tamara Dobson from Cleopatra Jones. He hired her for Norman to experience heterosexuality, but this angered Norman, and he hurried to stay with his girlfriend Melody. <br /> <br /> Then Garson comes and offers to take out the RF for the night. He expresses condolences over the loss of the wife of RF and tells the story of her own mother, who feeds irrational prejudices against the Philippines, because "she was sticking to the Luau." They attend the long performance of Wayon and Madame, which ends with Madame's violently knocking her head on the piano until her hair spreads. Once again, the mouths were agape. <br /> <br /> So, don't you know, RFF and Garson will have a great evening together! You see, calm, traditional older black men just have to see the cheesy, very feminine entertainment megakvin to come to EVERYTHING that the gay world has to offer! It's really that simple! It still doesn’t stop RF shouting "Rape!" when Garson wakes him up from a bad dream. It ends less predictably than you might think. <br /> <br /> There were so many things that were just turned off. What is the basis of the relationship between Norman and Garson? It seems that they have NO mutual understanding, and Norman has no doubt that Garson will be expelled, and even when he comes to stand up for himself, he never protects Garson and does not talk about his relationship. There were some pleasant strange touches, like the fact that RF I was going to buy all these books on homosexuality - and sat right on the park bench to read them! I like the idea that a parent actually tries to figure out something about homosexuality, and not just run away to get drunk or sympathize with his friends. <br /> <br /> In addition, it’s like what seems like: a small relic of a bygone era, an era in which some gay people thought that if stubborn straight people just sit down and watch a puppet show, we can all learn to love and understand each other! And because of all the naivety of this thing, the extreme stereotypes and the dialogue saturated with messages just seem to be charmingly outdated and provide plenty of opportunities to discuss how things have changed for gays over the past 30 years. I suppose the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gay girlfriends are desperately in love with them and ready to drink them to sleep with them, and, accordingly, convert them. <br /> <br /> ------ Hi, check out Cinema de Merde, my site for bad and cheesy movies (with a few good movies).
