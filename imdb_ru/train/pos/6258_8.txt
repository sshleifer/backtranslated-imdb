They probably could have missed some of the beginning — I'm not sure why this starts in the Asian part of Turkey. If this happened because of the Mediterranean, they could get closer, starting with modern Lebanon. <br /> <br /> Once the camera and film crew get to the Bakhtari tribe, this is the beginning of an amazing 48-day journey. 50,000 people with about 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses make this amazing journey along the very fast Karun River. They use rafts that are kept afloat, puffing goatskin - you can see where the head and legs were removed. The other “bank” of the river was very steep - I guess the rise will be 60 degrees. <br /> <br /> Just watching it was incredible, but there was much more ahead. To reach the pastures, they also had to cross the main mountain, where there was about 4 feet of snow, if not more. The opportunity to climb this mountain was pretty amazing in itself, but they (and all the animals) climbed this mountain barefoot! Yes, barefoot. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in this documentary was some of the titles with bad attempts at humor. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a documentary from the era of silence or incredible trials that this tribe not only faces, but also wins. This is simply an incredible document of a little-known group of people facing all sorts of problems.
