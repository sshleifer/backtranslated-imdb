Moonwalker is a great movie, you can't look away from the beginning to the end. I like all the clips of Michael singing and dancing, and I just like a bit of the "studio tour" ... so funny :) And the "mini-movie" is cool, with all the special effects, etc. Michael is a genius and always will be !!!
