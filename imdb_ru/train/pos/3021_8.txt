but it is worth seeing Boyer, Lorre and Paksin. Green’s entertainments, which were filmed during the war, demanded either a transfer to the American shores, as in the Pistol Rental, or the use of American actors in roles where they did not fit. Bacall fits this part here. I kept waiting for her to whistle and revive the Bogie; her tone of voice is simply wrong for upper-class Englishwomen. But listen to the dialogue! No, people do not say that except in books, but Green sent a message about England, which should have been aware of the dangers of the world. Another positive note: a number of Green’s characters were intact. While Mr. Mukherjee was more like a Brahmin, at least his nationality was preserved, and his last conversation with Paksin is invaluable.
