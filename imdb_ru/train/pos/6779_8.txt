George Cukor leads pensive and cynical classics. Distinctive Ronald Coleman at his best in this piece Noir is about an actor who loses himself in his roles. The famous Anthony John (Coleman) expelled his wife Brita (Signe Hasso) with his hot-tempered character and unpredictable behavior. But they manage to continue to work together to please their audience. Things are starting to change as John gets bored with his career; he reluctantly agrees to play Othello. He is deeply immersed in character as a jealous and murderous man. He starts the fine line between illusion and reality and eventually confuses his role with his own life and eventually kills his mistress (Shelley Winters), but does not remember this mean act. <br /> <br /> Coleman seems immaculate in this role. Winters is very impressive, as the young woman is determined to leave her wretched life. Also in the cast: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Whit Bissell.
