Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) were best friends from time immemorial, and after they ended they decide to go on a trip to Thailand. Because of the incident, they meet a young attractive mysterious stranger who invites them to go with him to Hong Kong for the weekend. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene are taken for the heroine of drug smuggling, and they are sent to prison. Now is the time for final survival and true friendship. It was a pretty good movie, I saw it a couple of times, and after a while you notice that they represent several holes in the plot, but the movie still entertains you. Claire Danes, as usual, did a great job, she is a great actress. I would give Brokedown Palace 8/10
