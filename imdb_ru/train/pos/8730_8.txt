Many Americans will say ... What ??? to my introductory comment. Yes, I know that my comparison is no doubt an insult to Master Akira Kurosawaâ€™s fans, but if you analyze this film, my comment is correct. We have a peasant who goes to the city in search of help against a group of grasshoppers who want to steal the harvest of the village. A huge difference in how history goes. Our samurai, a group of circus artists, as in the original, are a very complex mixture of personalities, but in the end this is what the village needs, Heroes. Please look at this incredible film again (Seven Samurai, obviously) and find other films that stole the story and tried to get the same magical effect as Akira Kurosawa's Masterpiece. Council - the 13th warrior with Antonio Banderas. Michael Crichton copied the story, wrote his bestseller, but did not find the third leg of the cat.
