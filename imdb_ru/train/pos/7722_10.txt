This is a film that has everything: a dashing hero, a beautiful girl in need, a noble figure with a tragic flaw, and a truly wonderful robot. The Forbidden Planet has retained this special magic for many years and does not lose its flavor when it is re-viewed (although young Anna Francis’s sex appeal helps a lot in this regard. <br /> <br /> Fans of the cinema recognize young Leslie Nielsen portraying the beautiful and heroic commander Adams, although those of us who loved him in comedic roles may be a little surprised by his appearance in a serious role.The outstanding and noble-looking Walter Pijon is also an outstanding player in the role of a scientist with etom (Id). Other supporting actors deserve praise, especially Warren Stevens as a clever and resourceful “Doc”, and, of course, the charms of Miss Francis, as noted above. <br /> <br /> This film was a pioneer in the use of electronic music , no less in the 1950s. The authors call them "tonality", but those of us who tried to tie together the early versions of the "Termen" device recognize the creepy and creepy cheekbones and squeals that are sometimes used in the sound track. Nevertheless, he gives the image of the exotic and alien landscape the mysterious and forbidden world of Krell. <br /> <br /> The special effects are also pretty exciting. I recall my fear in childhood, waiting for the next manifestation of the invisible monster "Id", and when it finally visualized in one battle scene, it literally shook me to my toes in surprise and fear. The magic of matte art is fully used in the dizzying scenes of the Krell science complex, when heroes wade through various mazes and passages, guided by the mysterious Dr. Morbius. <br /> <br /> I remember that I felt some measure of jealousy, that Dr. Morbius would have such a cool toy in the shape of Robbie Robot. Robbie's persona is quite charming, and in some ways he seems more humane than some other characters. Viewers of subsequent shows, such as Twilight Zone and Lost in Space, will recognize Robbie’s re-crafted footing in some of these episodes, although, as I recall, he never had the “personality” of the original Robby. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I did not fully understand the complexity of the plot until I was old enough to understand the various references to Freudian psychology and the danger of revealing hidden and usually restrained fears and rage, which we carry within, but have trained ourselves to immerse and control ourselves through the observance of social norms. Although the key to this story seems obvious after its disclosure, it remains unknown (or perhaps deliberately missed) by Dr. Morbius, until sane commander Adams points out that compels Dr. Morbius to confront the evil within him. It still gives me goosebumps when Commander Adams pushes Dr. Morbius to Crell’s machine, which gives him excellent intelligence, which opens the gates of his subconscious to the power of Crell’s machine: “Here. This is where your mind has been artificially expanded. Consciously, he still lacked the power to drive the Great Machine. But your subconscious was strong enough. "Zowee! <br /> <br /> Forbidden Planet is probably my favorite science fiction film, and remains timeless and classic thanks to a carefully thought-out plot and excellent visualization and implementation on the screen.
