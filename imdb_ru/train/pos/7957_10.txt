Hi guys, <br /> <br /> I was looking for everything where you can find these two films, and I can't find them anywhere in my area. (I'm from Australia). Could you help me and tell me where I can buy it. In general, Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best films I've ever seen, and they are good for people of all ages. It was my favorite movie when I was 5 years old, and it still is, even when I'm a teenager. This is a great movie for the whole family. My whole family loves this film, with the exception of my younger sister, because I have watched it so many times that it bothered me. I love this movie, and I can't wait to be able to buy it again on DVD. <br /> <br /> Sally
