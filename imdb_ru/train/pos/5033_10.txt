This is one of those films that you will think about and return to after a few months after watching. The acting game is impressive in that two children play the main roles (I usually hate movies with a playful kid). Bill Paxton is awesome, his directorial debut is even better than I expected from an actor whose most memorable line is “Game over, dude! The game is over! ”(From the film“ Aliens ”). <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is the dichotomy between the scenes in which the actors play the family, and when they do their “work”. It really makes the film believable and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keep it up, Bill. I will wait for more films that I will definitely love!
