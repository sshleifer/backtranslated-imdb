Disney's amazing film with Angela Lansbury in great shape, like a middle age spinter, whose interest turns into witchcraft in the 11th World War in England. <br /> <br /> Lansbury was about 51 years old at the time of the film’s release, and it’s the perfect fit. She is again Jessica Fletcher, but this time it is for the good or the children, and for the mother of England in times of great danger. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as a professor. witchcraft in an attempt to obtain certain information about witchcraft. The 3 little pets that were sent to live with Price to escape the London bombings are wonderful in this charming film for all of us, regardless of age. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Tessie O'Shea, Roddy MacDowell and Sam Jaff give me so little in this charming film. <br /> <br /> I really thought about the Ben Stiller movie “Night at the Museum” at the end of the movie, when the relics come to life to fight. with the Nazi invasion of a small British coastal city.
