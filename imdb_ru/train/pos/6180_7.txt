During the Vanties premiere, a woman was found dead on the podium above the stage. While the show is going on, the police are trying to put together those who killed what for and before the final curtain. <br /> <br /> I always heard that this is a great mystery of a classic comedy, so I was excited to find a copy. Unfortunately, no one told me about the musical numbers that go on and on. Although the numbers are definitely the type that Hollywood made during their time of glory, they become intrusive because they largely stop the film dead, despite attempts to weave the action around them. It would not be so bad if the music was half decent, but it is not. There is only one good song. Worse, as if the studio knew that they had one song, Cocktails for Two, and we had to endure four versions of it: a duet, a large amount of production, like the final of Vanities, and in the background like random music. I don't think Spike Jones and his city dudes ever played that much. The rest of the film is pretty good when Victor McLaglen sparred with Jack Okey. Charles Middleton is very funny, his scenes as an actor in love with his wardrobe mistress. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t recommend it if you think you can go through the musical numbers or want to scan through them. This is a funny movie that they no longer do.
