This film is fun, original and beautifully directed. I became a fan of BIG BAD SWIM, tracking him at film festivals whenever and wherever I can. I saw it about half a dozen times, and each time the enthusiastic audience responses confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best films to be released in recent years. At almost every festival that he showed, he either sold out or received the audience award. It is clear that people like this film, and even more clearly why. Cinematography is gorgeous, great character and great game, fantastic ending, direction filled with compassion, wisdom and the art of perfect timing. Hard to believe this is the first movie Ishai Setton. Hopefully he will be out soon so that everyone can see him.
