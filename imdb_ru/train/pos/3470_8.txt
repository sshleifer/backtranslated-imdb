Despite the fact that I'm quite young, The Beatles are my ABSOLUTELY PET bands! I never had the opportunity to hear their music because it was released, but I have loved them since I remember myself. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth trying once. I understand why it was not released in the cinema, but it is certainly an excellent film to be shown on TV. I flipped through my television guide and accidentally saw this film, there is little detail in it except for something like “John Lennon and Paul McCartney are found after the breakup of The Beatles, Jared Harris Stars” I have never heard of him (he played John) or Aiden Quinn, who played Paul. However, they are certainly underestimated actors! <br /> <br /> The film began slowly, but as it developed, I saw how well Quinn, but especially Harris, played her characters. As a big fan, I kind of know what the real Lennon and McCartney look like. The script was brilliant, and Harris gained Lennon's accent, personality, and manners! Quinn played McCartney pretty well, but sometimes shifted to his Irish accent. Makeup artists made them look great. <br /> <br /> THIS PARAGRAPH CAN BE READ AS A * SPOILER *: <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier, it all started slowly, but it soon developed and became quite an emotional film. I found a bit in the park a complete waste of time and completely out of sorts for both musicians. As for the rough line of Lennon in an Italian restaurant, completely unnecessary. The finale was very sharp and causes tears in my eyes when I watch it. <br /> <br /> It is very different from other biopic films that I saw, about how The Beatles got together and became famous, and they never made the characters so well. For example. 'Backbeat'. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would say that if you're a fan of the Beatles, John Lennon or Paul McCartney, give him a chance that you might be pleasantly surprised. The film lasts only about 95 minutes and is worth the wait. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows if the 1976 meeting really did take place, send it to the “comments page” for this movie. it would be very interesting.
