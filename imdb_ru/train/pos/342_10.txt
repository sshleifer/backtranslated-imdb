I gave him 8 just because he got such low voices ... it was definitely really about 5.5 ..... Hmmm ... it was pretty bloody, with nice, shallow characters, and he had really hot babes in that. I like the eclectic killer, because he didn't kill people the same way every time ... sometimes he gets old.
