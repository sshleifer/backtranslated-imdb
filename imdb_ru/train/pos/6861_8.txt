When you compare what Brian De Palma did in the 80s with what is being presented for entertainment today, his films continue to look better and better. "Dressed To Kill", "Blow Out", "Body Double", "Scarface" and "Carlito's Way" are all great works of the cinematographic master at the height of their abilities. The guy had a lot of good than average films. This is a pure Hitchcock with a damn perversion of the 80s, a gently told story about lust and murder with many twists, huge portions of style, a stunning score by Pinot Donaggio and a trashy, hyallo-inspired plot. De Palma's love for tricky cinematography and juicy, blood-stained visuals help overcome logical holes, while the stunning performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (good director in her own right), Nancy Allen (De Palma's wife at the time) and Michael Kane make every Special Scene. Let the virtuoso take you to a surrealistic, scary, erotically charged odyssey, and you will enjoy every shot of "Dressed To Kill".
