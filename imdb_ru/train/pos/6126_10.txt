I saw Jack Frost for £ 4 at my local store, and I thought it looked pretty good for a low budget movie, so I bought it, and I was right that it was good. For starters, this film is about a killer snowman, so you have to laugh about it, and what it looks like was funny compared to the Snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> With acting, everything was in order, and, according to Jack Frost, I laughed: “I just smoked you for the smoke” and “Worlds that looked most like a snow cone,” as is funny and indecent? The tale at the beginning was pretty funny and stupid: "Jack, be quick, Jack, be quick, Jack knocked out his eyes with candles." If you're looking for a horror movie B-Movie Comedy, which is full of puns, then look for Jack Frost. 10/10
