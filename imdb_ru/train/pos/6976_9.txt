I did not see BSG, I tried to watch it once in the middle of the show, but I could not get into it. However, yesterday I saw the revival of Caprica, I felt a little confused, so I decided to watch Pilot today, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I think this is a promising show, and the only side effect it has had on me is that now I also want to watch BSG. <br /> <br /> But I really liked the fact that I did not need to be a hardcore BSG fan to understand what was happening in Caprica. From what I read online, they tried to reach the female population, since BSG covered more men, and at least in my case it worked. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that if you are trying to watch a show, do it from the very beginning, starting with the Pilot.
