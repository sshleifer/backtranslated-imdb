The Kaabi portrays the difficulties of a woman before and during World War II, raising her children alone after her husband was imprisoned for "the crime of thought". This film was shot by Yamada Yoji, and, as expected, the atmosphere of this film is truly remarkable. Although the historical correctness of some scenes, especially the beach scene, is suspicious. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is absolutely incredible. I am puzzled by how they managed to assemble this star cast for the 2008 film. Yoshinaga Sayuri, perhaps the most decorated still active actress in Japan, will undoubtedly receive more individual awards for her role in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube in the supporting role was also really good. It was Asano Tadanobu, who, however, showed the most impressive performance, perfectly demonstrating the wit of his character and the difficult situation in which he was. <br /> <br /> Films with pre-war settings - not mine, but excellent direction and acting, I was completely absorbed in this story. In addition, this is not a left nonsense, such as "Yuunagi-no-Machi, Sakura-no-Cooney," and it addresses the controversial and delicate problem of state oppression and brainwashing that occurred in that period in Japan. Great movie, highly recommended for all viewers.
