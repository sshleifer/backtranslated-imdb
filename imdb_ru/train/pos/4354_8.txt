I saw this film back in 2005 at the International Festival in Palm Springs, and from the 14 films that I saw there, I would take 4th place. Theater 900+ was full, and at the end he received a standing ovation. It was classic Peter Falk, if you are a fan of Falk, and he showed a lot of chemistry between the characters Peter Falk and Paul Riser. The name of the film seemed to me long and too strange. I am surprised that this was not included in the general release. It was much better than most of the junk that big studios throw at you. Perhaps too grown up in that he was targeting baby boomers and a senior audience. Many people can relate to the situations in this film. It will probably enjoy a rebirth of its kind after years when people look back at this film and consider it a kind of gem. I would rate it 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and would definitely recommend it.
