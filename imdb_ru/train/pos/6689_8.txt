As a comic book reader who still considers himself a child at heart, I admit that maybe I was a little biased towards this film. I mean, there hasn't been a good superhero movie for quite some time (NOTE: Batman has never been a good superhero movie forever). I really wanted this film to be good, and unlike most of my recent movie visits (read Blair Witch Project), I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Mystery Men definitely didn’t cause strong effects, tensions The action movie filmed, it was a comedy. And on this basis it was a success. In the small theater, everyone laughed, applauded and laughed throughout the final scene. Stiller and Garofolo, as always, funny, and Azaria adds only the right touch of insanity. William H. Macy plays stunning naturals, while Kel Mitchell and energetic Paul Rubens are added just to make the children happy. <br /> <br /> Although the sets are strange (and at times seem to be robberies from both Batman and Blade Runner), and some jokes are obvious, it is still just ridiculous. There are several lines that will catch even the most tormented spectator by surprise and cause tears in our belly laugh. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. Although it is not a classic for all times, but twice as fun as the last restored Austin Powers. The writing is good, and the cast is GREAT. If you are worried, plan a matinee and pay less, but in any case you will be pleasantly surprised. I mean, which of us doesn’t root for losers from time to time?
