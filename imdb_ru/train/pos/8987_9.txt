I recently rented this document, remembering that I had heard of this from IMDb.com and was intrigued by the premise. I knew very little about one of these groups, but I remember hearing “Not if you were the last drug addict on earth” a few years ago from Dandy Warhols and enjoyed it. However, this is my view of the document: <br /> <br /> One thing I found incredible in this film is that there is no need to have any prior knowledge of any of these groups. The director (Ondi Timoner) does not waste time attracting viewers and meeting people from this film. I quickly became fascinated with the lives of both Anton and Courtney, and their respective groups, The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. I think this is part of what makes this document so good, and what makes Ondi Timoner such a great documentary. <br /> <br /> I also liked the way the “story” of these groups was told. Most of what you see is groups on tour. Both groups are starting to play in small venues and are trying to succeed in the recording industry. Throughout the film, each group seeks to remain a unique and uncontrollable rate. However, this is exactly what makes the two bands similar, and thus a brilliant look at how two bands of a pen can move in such different directions. <br /> <br /> I would mainly recommend this for ANYONE who loves the movie as a whole, you do not need to have a particular love for documentaries or for any of the groups. Evaluating music helps, but music itself relegates the love / hate relationship between The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols.
