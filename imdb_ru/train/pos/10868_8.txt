I always thought it would be a long and boring Talking Heads movie full of static duplicates, dude, I was wrong. “Elections” is a very exciting and exciting thriller-drama, deeply and realistically reflecting the origins of the Triad-Rituals. The characters are constantly in motion, and although you, as a spectator, always remain outsiders, you can still feel that the expectation comes from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. In addition, Johnny That succeeds in creating truly luxurious images thanks to carefully crafted lighting and atmospheric contrasts of light and shadow. Despite the fact that there is almost no action, the final is still shocked by the ruthless depiction of cruelty. A cool movie that deserves more attention, and I really liked the minimalist score on an acoustic guitar.
