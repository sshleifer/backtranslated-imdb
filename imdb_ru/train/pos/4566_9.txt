Daniel Day-Lewis - Christy Brown, a victim of cerebral palsy who uses “My left leg” to write and draw in this incredible 1989 film. The film also starred Brenda Fricker as Christie's mother, Ray McAnelly, Fiona Shaw and Hugh O'Conor. Their brilliant performances, a magnificent script and a wonderful guide by Jim Sheridan help to paint a vivid portrait of Christie Brown, an artist and writer who died in 1981 at the age of 49. <br /> <br /> Brown was born to a lower middle-class Catholic family, where his mother was constantly pregnant (only 22 children, 13 of whom survived). His father considered Christie mentally retarded and physically disabled, but he did not allow his son to go into the house. The children in the family said goodbye to him every day when they went to school, and then his mother fed him and talked to him. <br /> <br /> In the film, Fricker conveys the feeling of a woman with whom, despite the fact that he is surrounded by a huge family, you need someone to talk to. Christie is not responding. In the end, he finds a cart, and neighbour's children, all of whom have known him since childhood, include him in all their activities. The only part of his body that really works well is his left leg, and when the children find out how well he kicks his leg, they put him in football games for this very purpose. One of the most enjoyable parts of the film is how other children treat him calmly. <br /> <br /> There are many strong scenes, but none of them are as powerful as Christie, writing “Mother” on the floor, holding a piece of chalk between her toes. “He’s the real Brown,” says his father, lifting him onto his shoulders and carrying him to the pub. Entering the pub, he announces: "My son is a genius." Everything changes when Christie gets older because he has the desires and emotions of a young boy. He develops crush, rejected and more immersed in himself, referring to the painting. In the end, he goes to therapy at the nearest clinic and works at home with the physician Eileen (Fiona Shaw). He falls in love with her. When he learns that she is engaged, he almost goes mad. But he survives to live, draw, write (only three books) and love again. <br /> <br /> Since this is a film, it was necessary to miss something and need to combine the characters. Brown did not have a diagnosis of cerebral palsy for some time, which was excluded from the film. The therapist Eileen is actually a combination of three important therapeutic figures in Christie's life, and although we know that his mother believed that he had a good mind, she actually worked a lot with Christie when he was a child, teaching him the alphabet and D. In addition, before Mary, Christie had a 12-year relationship with a woman to whom he dedicated "My Left Foot." And the typical Hollywood finale, 9 years before his death, where neglecting his wife could be a factor, does not end the story. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, Christie Brown's biopic is incredibly powerful, all the more because of two performances: Hugh O'Conor as young Christy and Daniel Day-Lewis as adult Christie. O'Conor's expression and how he pulls his twisted body is painful. One is exhausted for him and broken with grief at the same time. <br /> <br /> And what can be said about Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the greatest actors in the world, he fully brings Christie back to life, a complete flesh intelligent man who can swear, become angry, bitter, drunk, persistent, depraved, fun and loving. Honored Oscar won the same year that Tom Cruise was nominated for "Born on the Fourth of July". I remember someone writing a letter to the editor somewhere that Cruz was so sensational, what happened to the Academy? Nothing for a change. Nothing like this. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker is amazing how Christie's mother, who never stops believing in him and what he can do, and which keeps her family and husband in difficult times. The wonderful thing about Fricker is that support, love, and work ethic seem natural to the mother. A character will never consider himself a heroine or someone who does something unusual. Fricker shows us a religious but not fanatical woman who believes that her duties on earth are to be a good wife and mother. And no matter what, even when her husband is out of work, he throws their daughter out of the house for being pregnant, whatever she rules. She is saving money on Christy's wheelchair, she gets pictures of her daughter and child, she starts building a room for Christie in the back of the house. All part of the work day. A performance worthy of an Oscar that she received. <br /> <br /> Brown’s life was more challenging than this inspirational film, but it’s an amazing achievement for all participants and a must-see.
