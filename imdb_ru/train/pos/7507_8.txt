Hello from the dark again. Mary Heron adds to the list of films that give an idea of ​​his era. Her previous "I shot Andy Warhol" and "American psychopath" were at their best when they commented on the quaintness of society during this period. Although “The Infamous Betty Page” apparently talks about Miss Page, she’s just the top backstage in the world of strange photo shoots from the 50s. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting to watch both from the point of view of history and the technical side, as it was shot and assembled. A grainy black and white film and photos captured the time and color in Miami Beach in Bunny Yeager photos. Very well done. <br /> <br /> The cast is strong in David Strathairn (just from his Edward R.) The role of Merrow), Chris Bower (as Irving Clo) and Lily Taylor. The film's star is surprisingly talented, underrated and under-performing Gretchen Mol. Miss Mole always brings sharpness and spirit to her roles. She was just fascinating from the little-known, Jason Alexander took "Just Looking" in 2000. Here she is the notorious Betty Page. Her smile is charming, and her body is flawless. It seems that she really likes this role, and she helps us understand how the girl next to Tennessee can become the queen of Pin-Up from the underworld. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, the soundtrack from that era is amazing. Patsy Kline and Peggy Lee are just two of the artists represented. Despite the fact that the film hints at the creation of history in this industry, the latter third kind does not give rest to prevent pure cinema magic. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Betty Page makes this funny movie to watch, which in the near future will bring endless shows on HBO. Now, will anyone please turn Miss Mole into the star she should be?
