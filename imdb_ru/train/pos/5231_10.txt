telling important things in a film — for example, what is life, does it make sense? - it is simply impossible. Of course, possible answers to these questions are shown in each film (story), but communication requires a direct appeal to consciousness. This happens if the input from the senses overlaps the “entrance” from our mind, that is, from our thoughts. Few directors know how to report important things. Tarkovsky, this one. His “Stalker” shows images of existence, conveys life as it shows itself, and yet eludes your mind. I think that De Zi and De Graaf do the same.
