When it comes to creating the universe, George Lucas is the undisputed master, and his latest film Star Wars is very, very good (and more adequately rated compared to the two previous films in the original saga). Having recently viewed Revenge of the Sith, you see this movie in perspective. The final battle seems even darker, knowing that Anakin Skywalker survived in the Emperor's manipulative hands. It also makes the final battle between Luke and Vader more bitter, given the love he felt for Padme and the love she felt for her children. In fact, although new films (especially Episode II) are inferior to the original, they are only good for one reason. They make old movies even better. <br /> <br /> Mark Hamill does an exceptional job in this film. He really brings the changes that Luke went through, it seems real. In fairness, I believe that he should have become a major actor based on these films, because he really does an excellent job. Harrison Ford is still good. However, you may feel that he participated in the "Raiders" and "Blade Runner" between the last two chapters of "Star Wars" because he seems to have grown a little. He adds more comedy (obviously inspired by the Raiders) to a character that works brilliantly. In short, Han Solo is better than ever. Carrie Fisher has never been a really good actress, but she does a decent job and, of course, tolerably. Ian MacDiarmid appears in this film, and, having seen Episode III, I can say with confidence that he is one of the most experienced villains in history. James Earl Jones still provides a voice for Vader, and he is still very, very good. <br /> <br /> In terms of how the film looks, it’s safe to say that the Star Wars universe looks better than any of the previous (two) films, but it has always been Lucas’s luck, so it’s really should have been expected. The final battle for Endor is very good in terms of both general effects and tensions. It was also nice to note that Lucas decided to hold three battles at the same time, as this added to the overall climax tension. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I feel is dragging a film from a well-deserved 9 is Ewoki. These little creatures are so annoying that they almost destroy every scene they are in. In addition, I find it a bit strange when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of attack aircraft with laser weapons and powerful equipment. <br /> Overall, The Return of a Jedi is a very good film, but the fact that Richard Marquain is a less experienced director than Irwin Kershner does what makes the general impression of the film less than ingenious. Also the stupid decision of George Lucas to add Ewoks to the universe makes the film not brilliant. <br /> <br /> 8/10
