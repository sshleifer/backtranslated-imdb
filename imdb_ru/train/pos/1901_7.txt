It is difficult to put a finger on it. In fact, I believe that it is a comedy about a loafing rich drunk who falls in love with a (comparatively) poor girl for whom he wants to marry, risking renouncing his family. <br /> <br /> These are funny moments, romantic moments and touching moments. Dudley Moore is funny and somehow makes her selfish character attractive, Lisa Minelli is a convincing crazy figure, because the attractive side he attracts, but John Gilgud steals the show as surprisingly sarcastic butler Arthur. <br /> <br /> This is banal but very fun with a memorable soundtrack, and ran for almost 3 months on our local flyipit.
