Gerard is a writer with a slightly hyperactive imagination. He is also homosexual and Catholic, prone to Catholic guilt and something like clairvoyance, or so it seems. During a trip to Flushing, Christina "seduces" him. When he discovers that Christine's new boyfriend is part of a rough trade that he imagined from afar, he decides to stay. After all, forced heterosexuality has its own compensation. Then he realizes that all previous three husbands of Christina died a violent death. Did Christina kill them, and would he or his boyfriend, Herman, become the “fourth man”? The overheated, partitioned melodrama of Verhoeven is a delightful mix of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of OTT eroticism and religious images, as well as a huge amount of red. In most cases, it looks and feels like a dream, and we can never be sure that what we see is real or is a figment of Gerard's imagination. The most interesting thing is to understand this. In addition, the fact that Christina is an infinitely more pleasant character, that either Gerard is balanced or bullish Herman, means that we are unlikely to root for any of the men above her. In fact, it is fair to say that Gerard’s revival cannot take place soon enough. Super performances, from Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and easily the best Verhoeven film to its amazingly subversive science fiction piece "Tropsers Starship".
