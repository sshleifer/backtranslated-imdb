I recommend watching this movie with your loved ones if you plan to spend a romantic evening with him. Chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan in the role of Tarzan and Jane is so energetic that he can sweat on the screen. <br /> <br /> After the original film, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane adapted to the jungle and each other. Jane's scant clothing in the jungle and Tarzan’s protest when Jane covers her visitors emphasize that they are not just romantic, but also sexually in love. <br /> <br /> You can supplement your imagination with a constant touch and love conversation between Tarzan and Jane, in order to depict how much Jane actually teaches Tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually. And student Jane not only hugs, but thrives thanks to her previously unrevealed sexuality. <br /> <br /> The skin show in this movie is not on the charts. In addition to Jane's two-piece sexy costume, legs and thigh, she also dives with Tarzan. (although this is not O'Sullivan, but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim, who doubles for her in this scene) Weissmuller also shows a stunning body and perfect chest muscles in his bare loincloth. Ladies will be delighted when Weissmüller comes out of the water after a long battle with a giant crocodile and utters his scream - his loincloth swollen in water will almost fall off his thighs. <br /> <br /> It’s a shame that the over-protection of the Censors reduced the adult character of Tarzan’s films after this recording. Although Weissmuller Tarzan’s films will flourish in the years to come, they rarely come close to the sex appeal of this film.
