I don’t think that someone other than Terrence Malik and perhaps Tran Anh Hung makes a movie on a cleaner level than Claire Denis. However, I do not like her, her newest film, as much as her 2001 masterpiece “Trouble Every Day” (although very close), which itself is one of my favorite films. This is only because the story here is perhaps a little too elliptical for his own good. Do not misunderstand me, the fact that there is no plot at all in this film is indeed one of the best things about it, but I think that Denis took him about one degree further than necessary, and therefore the film is flirting with incomprehensibility , and some key points of the plot had to be somehow clarified (for example, the main character goes to South Korea to transplant his heart, instead of just showing him there suddenly without any explanation of where he is or why he is there). Also, some of the other characters seemed unnecessary, and as if they were just an excuse for Denis to use the actors she loves again (in particular, the character Beatrice Dalle distracts a little because you keep expecting her to have some meaning). Nevertheless, the film is incredibly fascinating, and the cinema is incredible. This is definitely a very masterpiece in its own way. At least as well as Denis’s more famous “beau travail”, if not better. Claire Denis should be my favorite French director, even better than Leos Carax. In addition, I have to admit that the South Korean sequence really makes “Lost in Translation” better than this film itself (and I, unlike some, are also a big fan of this film).
