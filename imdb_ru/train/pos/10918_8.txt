The five deadly poisons are undoubtedly the most memorable KF a film from the stable of the Show brothers (except, perhaps, the Master Killer). He has artists who have become known as "Poisons", one of the best martial choreographers in history, and, surprisingly, for a Kung Fu movie, a great plot! One of my favorite!
