I think most people don't seem to get the right idea about the movie, at least that's my opinion. I am not sure that this is a film about drug addiction; rather, it is a film about the thinking of these genius brothers, drugs are side effects, something marginal. Again, this is not a commercial film that you see every day, and if the author wanted it, it definitely failed, as most people think it is one of the many drug-related films. I, however, think that the matter is different. As in many films depicting different cultures, viewers usually fully understand films depicting their own culture, that is, with what they grew up and with which they are well acquainted. This film should show that these “ingenious” people very often think and what problems they face. The reason they behave this way is because they are bored in their mind :) They have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept these things as if they are launching space shuttle daily. They start a pretty hard job and quickly succeed. They feel that I went to work, did not do anything, still worked twice as good as the guys around me when they were on all their projects, what do I do now with my free time. And what's even more boring? When you can begin to predict behavior, not because you are a psychologist, but because you have seen this model in the past. Thus, for them, on the one hand, this is not a difficult job, which is sometimes quite boring, and on the other, they begin to clarify the behavior of people. This is a recipe for great boredom. And the most stupid things are usually done to get out of this state. Previously, they mentioned that their biggest problem is that they try to understand life from the point of view of logic (mathematics describes logic), although life is not entirely logical, but in fact it is absolutely right.
