I always look forward to this movie when it is on TV. I have to get a DVD, I think. The range of different types of people is great. This tells me that anyone can be a dancer if he tries his best. My favorite character must be Mr. Aoki. He is so strange, but full of emotions. This is a perfect movie with beautiful dances. Unfortunately, we never had the opportunity to see them in Blackpool. Would make for the perfect continuation if they had. But I believe that this allows your imagination to understand what could have happened. <br /> <br /> A very simple and innocent story. He remains faithful to his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen a Hollywood remake. Not sure if I want to. I don't really like Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere fits the original more than Lopez. I have a feeling that the remake is not so simple and innocent.
