Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. It is damp, painful and realistic, but very interesting. The main actors John Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who became Oscar-winning actors, give amazing performances. A warrior like a Texas hooligan, Joe Buck, who migrates from the small town of Texas to New York to become a hustler. He does not apologize for the chosen profession, but it is not so simple. The women of New York, like the rich lady played by Georgen Johnson, and Cass, played by Sylvia Miles, nominated for an Oscar, are different from Texas women. Unfortunately, Buck is trying to escape from his past life in Texas. He was raised by his grandmother, Sally Buck, who was played by the wonderful actress Ruth White, who died of cancer in 1969. Places in New York are wonderful to see how the relationship between Fetso, played by Hoffman, and Buck's characters, turns into a moving male friendship. Men struggle to survive in New York life, not playing by the rules how to get a real job. As the film develops, Buck's past comes to the surface, and this is haunting, but not clear. The film is not for children, but compared to today's films and television programs, Midnight Cowboy can be more tame. I can't forget the young Brenda Vaccaro and the party you can't forget. It's also a tear film, so pull out your socks too.
