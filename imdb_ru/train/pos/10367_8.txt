When I first saw Creek in the Dark, I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw this, I was shocked by what he portrayed. When I saw him for the second time in an Australian film class, I understood the second point: communication problems. You see, when Dingo kidnapped the baby Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), she and her husband Michael (Sam Neal) were stricken with grief, but they did not show it. As Seventh-day Adventists, they believed that God wanted this to happen, and therefore they could not mourn it. But when people across Australia saw that they lacked sadness, everyone started to believe that Lindy did it herself. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the wrong message was reported to the public, and it turned people against Lindy. Despite the fact that it was a pure case, it still happened. This may be one of the biggest disasters caused by the existence of the media, regardless of the political views of any media. <br /> <br /> With regard to performances, the Strip copes with the Australian accent (not surprisingly) there), and Sam Neal is equally great. You will probably be amazed only by what you see here. Definitely one of the best Fred Shepizi films.
