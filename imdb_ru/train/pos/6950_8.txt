On the day of the presidential election in California, from midnight to 1:00 am, spy Victor Rovner sends a message from Kuala Lumpur to the United States. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, federal agent Jack Bower returned to his family and is having problems at home with her teenage daughter Kimberly, who accuses her mother Teri of dropping Jack from home. Teri and Jack decide to talk seriously with Kim, and they discover that the girl has gone home. Trying to solve an internal problem, his colleague Nina Myers calls Jack into her counterterrorism department to meet with their boss Richard Walsh, who reveals the threat to the life of Senator David Palmer running for president, you need to find an arrow. Later, Walsh leads a personal conversation with Jack and says that the agency has a conspiracy against David Palmer, and appoints Jack to search for conspirators. When an airplane explodes over the Mojave Desert, Jack has another problem. <br /> <br /> The first episode of “24” is a promising start to a successful episode in which Jack Bauer is featured. I watch this show for the first time and confess that I liked what I saw: a complex and dramatic story with many realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is flawless in the role of a family man and a reliable agent who is responsible for three complex tasks at the same time: to find the killer to protect an important politician; find a traitor in your agency; and find your teenage daughter, who is in trouble, trying to save her marriage. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “12:00”.
