Elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when people (at least people who can do such things) sit and talk about film noir. <br /> <br /> However, some of the best films of this genre, “From the Past”, “Killers”, “In a Lonely Place”, “Night and the City”, control the level of smooth refinement that raises them beyond the gloomy phrases and connotations of premonitory shadows, felts and femme fatales. <br /> <br /> “Where the sidewalk ends,” it’s quite difficult to find a movie — the only copy in perhaps the best-equipped video store in Manhattan was a rough bootleg from the AMC cable channel — the category with these classics. <br /> <br /> From the moment the black cloud of opening captions passes, a curtain appears around the crumbling world of the robber-detective Mark Dixon, and as the moments pass, he gets closer, threatening to suffocate. <br /> <br /> Of course, he is that familiar “cop with a dark past,” but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a grim look and restless tension that makes you as awkward as he seems. And yes, he spanked on suspects for too long, and the newly appointed chief (Karl Malden, as a rule, in a sensible and team campaign) warns him "for the last time." <br /> <br /> Yet Dickson hates these thugs too much to stop. And boy, they didn't have this coming? <br /> <br /> “Hoods, rags, mugs, nickel-rat drains,” he spits when the boss’s tough little nut drives him crazy and rolls out all the complaints the bureau receives about Dixon’s right hook. For him, the advice is to cool down for your own good. But instead, he takes matters into his own hands. <br /> <br /> And what a world of trouble he discovers, relying on his instincts and returning to nature, which could or could not be passed on from generation to generation before. <br /> <br /> He immediately contacted the police, the syndicate, his partner. Dixon's dubious involvement in the "investigation" of the murder threatens his work, makes him wonder if he is just as vile as those whom he swore to bring. Like Bogart in Lonely Place, can he “escape from who he is?” When he has nowhere else to turn, he discovers that he is actually doomed to an unexpected relationship with seraphic beauty (amazing Jean Tirnie ), which, it seems, can turn the existence of his barren bachelor into something worthwhile to get home to. <br /> <br /> The pace of this excellent film is very tight and exciting. The group of authors who contributed to the production brought the script to shine - the dialogue is developing rapidly, does not break up into outdated parody food, is passionate, does not become melodramatic or juicy. <br /> <br /> And all this first-class leadership and acting skills are not too smooth and indecent to ease the emotional grip of the film. Angelic, soft-focused beauty of Gene Tierney is used with great effect. She shows herself as an actress of a significant range, and her gentle, kind nature is as limitless here as her psychosis in the film “Leave her to heaven”. The scenes between Dixon Tirney and Andrews become more intense and in contact with what he seems to be self-destruct. <br /> <br /> Toward the end of his rope, cut, bruised and exhausted, Dixon sums up his fate: “Innocent people can also get into terrible traffic jams,” he says. "One wrong move, and you're above your head." <br /> <br /> It is possible that this film is so convincing that this feeling that everything can go wrong, almost for everyone - especially for those who are trying so hard to do it right - with one small wind shear wrong decision or blow, or, worst of all, due to factors you cannot control. Noir always reflected the darkest fears, brought them to the surface. "Where the pavement ends" makes it realistic. <br /> <br /> (One shred aside: in this film with an excellent sterling effect, a blond model will clearly sound that would not seem out of place in the Mystery Science Theater. How strange.) <br /> But Noir fans - damn it, ANY movie fans - who have not seen it, expect tremendous pleasure.
