I first saw this film on my way home from Paris to Newark aboard Air France in August 1996. The film itself, I believe, is a true masterpiece. This is the film that people should do. I still think Daniel Othey is one of the sexiest actors in the world. In this French film, he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost interest in life, until he collided with a man with Down syndrome who lives in an institution with other patients with Down syndrome. The actors, including the actor with Down syndrome, create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely people. Daniel's life and ours are forever changing with a person with Down Syndrome. He understands that life is not just work and not a game, but life and love, and this is what life should be. The ending is stupid, but I still think this is one of my favorite movies. This is enough to cause a tear in his eyes.
