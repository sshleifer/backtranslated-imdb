I grew up on this film and still love it as much as when I was a kid. Do not listen to critics reviews. They are not accurate in this film. Eddie Murphy really shines in his video. You can sit down with your whole family, and everyone will like it. I recommend this movie to everyone to watch. This is a comedy with a touch of fantasy. With demons, dragons, and a little bald child with God-like abilities. This film takes you from Los Angeles to Tibet, offering amazing views of the amazing temples of the mountains in Tibet. Just a beautiful view! So do yourself a favor and grab it! You will not regret it!
