This film is definitely the sweetest one I've seen in a long time! Wonderful animation and delightful characters (even the bad guys were cute!) Made him the absolute winner in my book, as well as in the books of those with whom I saw it. I still want to see it again, but did not have time. Better than Toy Story, which was also good, but not THAT good.
