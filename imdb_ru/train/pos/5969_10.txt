This film is like Kerry meets heavy metal. This is a high school boy who is chosen a lot, and he completely revenges himself with the help of the ghost of heavy metal. this is such a classic. Soundtrack A ++++. It has living legends about metal. And Mark Price was great in this movie. This is a must have for metal fans.
