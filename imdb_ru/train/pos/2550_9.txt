This is really one of Hollywood’s “golden age” that they no longer do. This is a unique, fun movie that makes you wonder what will happen next. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great and they are all great supporting actors. This is the first film I saw with Ronald Coleman, and since then I have been a fan of it. Reginald Gardiner has always been my favorite secondary actor and adds a certain quality to every film he makes. Although he played a different kind of character here, he still added to the film something that the other cast of this character would not have. added.
