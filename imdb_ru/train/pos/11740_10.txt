I have no doubt that critics have thought about this film, especially the artsy Farcese, who need a laxative. This is a great movie about vehicles in the tradition of Abbot & Costello or more recently Don Knotts. It will not shake the world and will not change films forever. What he will do is entertain. When all is said and done, this is the most important thing. Watch this movie and forget about your problems. He even has a simple and kind moral message at no extra charge. I always liked Elvira's TV show when I lived in Los Angeles. She didnâ€™t actually steal her vampire bonnet more than the Vampire from the original, Ted Bara. This kind of mythical character belongs to the one who does it best; And Cassandra Peterson does it best. Long live Elvira; we need more such films. There is never enough. The villain, William Morgan Sheppard, was also excellent. He exudes wonderful subtle malice. I could not find any technical faults. Performance is as close to perfect as art. My deep compliments to director James Signorelli and his entire team.
