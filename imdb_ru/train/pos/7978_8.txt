This film contains one ingredient, which should be in all films about revenge, and this is a real emotion. Grief, love, laughter, anger. There are so many emotions in this movie. From start to finish, this film is very exciting. The plot on paper sounds like usual garbage, which is mainly thrown on the faces of the audience, but make no mistake, this film is powerful. Washington, as always, puts great views. <br /> <br /> The plot in two words: a man suffers from depression, a young girl brings him life, children are kidnapped, a man wants revenge. It doesn't look like anything special, but it is far superior to any other similar film. For a moment, TAKEN is a similar film, but when you compare them, MAN ON FIRE wins. The characters are attractive, and everyone plays great, and the direction is great. Mexico City feels alive, looks like Mexico City, it smells like Mexico City. Everything is brilliant. The leadership style was what I liked and brought the best of Mexico. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that you will release once a year to watch again, or a movie that you ask family and friends to watch. From start to finish, you support the main character, making his journey on a roller coaster. There is enough action to make you happy, enough character development to please you, and there is Washington to bring a smile on your face. Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed
