EVENTUALLY!!!!!!!!!!! I waited for the release of this film for almost a year, and finally saw it at the premiere in SB. I met several actors who were really good and wonderful in the film. I watched the trailer so many times that I didnâ€™t know what to expect, but I was completely absorbed. The film was really beautiful, and the music was good. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Ryan Donovo, and Dominic Swain was also good at it. other actors were good and great. Hope it will be released soon on DVD !!!!! <br /> <br /> I first got to Ryan after watching OC, and then I saw him in a group of good indies such as Imaginary Heroes. He is great in this film, and all he does is indie. I also like Dominic, but I have not seen her so much. Hope to see them both soon!
