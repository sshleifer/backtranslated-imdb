Since the death of Siskel and the absence of Ebert, the show has remained in the incompetent hands of Richard Roper. Roper is not a film critic, he just criticizes everything he doesn’t like, that is, movies with country music are panned, because “I don’t like country music! and children's films get the standard “Don't watch now, wait until it’s released on DVD, and rent it for your kids!” Rouper may well be an idiot, but in some other area. Weekly guests are better off sitting at Ebert, but who wants to choose a daisy in the middle of slapping a cow? All this says that this is the only show in the city, and this in itself makes it worthy of attention. As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can talk, you too can! We strive for your mind and thoughts. Do whatever it takes to free the usurper from his self-proclaimed throne.
