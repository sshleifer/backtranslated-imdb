Soprano (now preparing for the end) is the peak of adult television and drama. When the Soprano hits the target, it really hits the target. Using excellent writing and great actors (most of whom were extras from Goodfella), the series is capable of developing in a satisfactory and unpredictable and exclusive way. The cast is headed by James Gandolfini, who for all intensive purposes is Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco, who certainly has it. The series also boasts a large collection of regular visitors who promote the plot by any means (usually violence and obscene language). Tony Sirico, Michael Imperoli, and Steve Van Zandt are great supporting characters that make each episode more interesting. Also worth noting are seasonal additions, including such names as Steve Buscemi (excellent!), Joe Pantoliano (excellent!), David Proval (good), Robert Patrick, Robert Loggia, and Frank Vincent. <br /> <br /> The soprano is a Great Family Drama and a realistic interpretation of modern mafia societies, which, despite the rare bad storylines, manage to be unique TV.
