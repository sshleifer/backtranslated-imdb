I have to admit that I am a big fan of South Park and expected Basketball to be fun, but not nearly as good as it turned out! I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. This film has so many meanings for reproduction and in no way interferes with taking yourself seriously. Slap humor mixed with Stone and Parker works flawlessly. The type of humor present in Basketball was not popular at the time of its release, and if it came out today, it would be a hit. Do not try to criticize, just leave your brain outside the door and expect infinite laughter. Recommended to everyone with a good sense of humor.
