I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I bought tickets first and then checked the IMDb reviews. I was worried about watching a bad movie. Well, I had fun watching a movie. Some of the parts that obviously should have been scary were rather humorous, almost like in “Buffy the Vampire Slayer”. <br /> <br /> I do not think this film is bad. This is also not a very good movie. Just a pretty well made horror movie. He is not very dependent on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music. In my opinion, the acting was fine. Sarah did a very good job, quite convincingly. Other actors were also quite good, I liked Yoko. <br /> <br /> The sets are good (and I don’t care that the sets are the same as in the Japanese original). <br /> Scary moments were often predictable. But not always. I saw some kind of horror, and now did not expect to be scared, but it happened at least twice. Nice. <br /> <br /> The film had some wonderful scenes that were almost original, for example, traces of garbage, simple special effects for ghosts, eyes of a boy, a cat that made terrible sounds, gurgling about a dead boy and his mother. <br /> <br /> Don't leave if you want to see Sarah in another episode with Buffy, because this is very different from her work with Buffy, much more serious. Do not go if you want to watch only films that collect Oscar nominations. This is a good horror movie, just waiting. I gave him 7.
