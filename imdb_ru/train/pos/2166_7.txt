I'm not a big fan of Tim Matheson, but I have to admit that I liked this movie. It was dark and a bit anxious with some scenes, a little bit sharp, I don't know whether to classify this movie a little SF and a little horror Slash thriller. I saw it around 2:00 am or so, there was nothing else on my local channel, so I decided to watch it. If you haven’t seen this movie yet, I recommend it not so badly, the characters are quite interesting, but they didn’t fully reveal their full potential, which could make this movie even better. I do not know if this film went to the cinema, but it seemed to me that it was made for television or immediately for video, I would buy this film if it is on DVD, then it fits well with my type of film, and a small one is attached to it part of the history of X-FILES. Government companies or running corporations involved in dubious unclear relationships. Overall a good movie.
