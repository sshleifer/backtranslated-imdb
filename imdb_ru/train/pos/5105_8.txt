How can you say that Urban Cowboy was and remains the best document about life in Texas for this period of time. Think about the following: men beat their wives, drink at night in bars, get married to fight, commit adultery, and compete on mechanical bulls. Try to name the film that so vividly depicts real life. They don't make them anymore. It seems that modern films are always about people with big money, they live in huge houses, drive expensive cars and do not work. This movie has a festive scene about getting a trailer for Pete's sake! <br /> <br /> In any case, I watch it at least once a week. No kidding. I analyzed this film from start to finish. feel free to email me to find out more about my reason for calling this a documentary. Consider the following scenes: Bad sees Sissy - they are separated - he beeps together and waves his hand, she throws a bird at him - he returns half of the peace sign, signaling a horn to add a beat, and then tears off. <br /> <br /> Kidney mom calls him ok. 18 hours after he arrives in the city, on Sunday, to see if he still has a job - all he achieved was getting drunk and left (x2), with the help of his uncle and aunt, who covered him up. <br /> <br /> “You all live like pigs” Think about why this scene is needed. I'm thinking about it. It was necessary? Can't we figure it out without showing the dirty sink? God, I love it! <br /> <br /> Sissy lets Wes help her ride the bull. Just a few days later (or maybe the next day) after Wes just threw the shit out of her husband. Steve asks - Hey Sissy, remember Wes? Oh yeah, didn't you beat my husband that night, so let's go this lesson, not to mention the fact that she seeks consolation in him later during one fight of Booth and Sissi, who, by the way, all have a place in public - uh jilly <br /> <br /> Shooting a photo shoot at a wedding reception (oh, mankind!) can at least arrange or move chairs out of the way. “My legs are sweaty mom” <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you don’t put such scenes in a movie to try to show a person’s psychology. This is a documentary about real life. <br /> <br /> The only pity is that the director was not ....
