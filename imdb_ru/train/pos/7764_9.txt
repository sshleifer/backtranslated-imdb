Another classic study of the influence of wealth on the southern family is masterfully depicted in Notes on the Wind. <br /> <br /> Kyle Hadley has it all. Wealth, the plane, you call it. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, always took him out of difficulty. Mitch finished college, Kyle was thrown out. Mitch is not from a rich house. Kyle's family, along with Hadley Oil, controls most of the city. <br /> <br /> In Kaylie Kyle meets the girl of his dreams, which Lauren Bacall plays beautifully. After a stormy romance, he marries her and returns home. There she meets her father-in-law, who warns her how difficult Kyle can be. Kyle sleeps with a gun under the pillow. Bacall's character meets Kyle's sister, Mary Lee, a vagabond, if ever existing, played to the fullest extent by Dorothy Malone, who was recognized as the best actress of the second plan. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson plays Mitch, a true friend. <br /> The year of marital bliss for Kyle and his bride ends when the doctor tells Kyle that he cannot have children. It is when his wife tells him that she is really pregnant, Kyle, thinking that this is Mitch's child, falls into a drunken madness and is accidentally shot in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Mary Lee, who always loved Mitch, tries but fails to blame Mitch for Kyleâ€™s death. In the memorable scene of the courtroom, Malone did his best to finally admit that Kyle's death was an accident. Her Oscar was well deserved. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Robert Stack, brilliant as Kyle Hadley, was nominated for the best male supporting role and lost in Anthony Quinn's frustrated victory, as Paul Gauguin, in Lust for Life. <br /> Douglas Sirk was a master of soap opera films of the 1950s. Written in the wind is no exception. *** 1/2.
