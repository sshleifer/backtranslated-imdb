This is a low-budget film with a set of unknowns and a minimum of filming on the spot. The Philippines replaces Thailand, and in fact no one goes to Hong Kong. A serial shot of a large Cathay Pacific jet plane landing at the old airport makes this transition ideal. This film proves that you don't need mega budgets or a star-headliner to create a great movie. It contains neither mistakes nor excesses that young filmmakers often encounter. Solid craftsmanship from people who know all aspects of film making and who understand the trade-offs between art and box office. Great job!
