Stumble. At first I have to say that I was a little disappointed in the first few episodes, but, having believed in the series and the undoubted talent of Abe Forsythe, I continued to watch. I can confidently say that now I am glad that I did. The story has indeed developed quite well, and all the characters have a solid foundation, and most of them lack any information. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can blame for this performance is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation obsessed by the character Lizzy. <br /> <br /> Some kind of good acting in combination with a star plot really overestimates this show. Hope for another season!
