Yes, it gets all ten stars. It is as clear as day that this filling is ingenious. Once, the universe sent Trent Harris as a young, surprisingly strange man, and Harris caught him on film in all this real glory of inconsistency, which is simply impossible to fake. It is a pity that this ended in a tragedy for a young man, if only an alternative ending was written for the story of this guy. The other two steps in the trilogy are really retelling the story of Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the roles of young people, respectively. The world is expanding, and weirdness is contextualized by retelling, which gives us a broader view of how weirdness grows in vanilla America. Recommended for everyone!
