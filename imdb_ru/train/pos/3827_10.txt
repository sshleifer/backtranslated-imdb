I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about - it was a wonderful film that created a sense of an era reminiscent of time travel. The characters are really young, Mary is a strong couple for Byron, Claire is young and a little annoying, Polidori is a convincing battered sycophant ... all beautiful, curious and decadent ... not so terrible wrecks as they are in the Gothic. <br /> <br /> Gothic works as an independent part of the shock film, and I loved it for various reasons, but it works like the film “The Merchant and Ivory,” and according to my readings the best capture of what should be, summer was seem to be. Romantic, yes, but completely igniting my interest in the life of Shelley and Byron every time I think about the film. One of my favorite ones.
