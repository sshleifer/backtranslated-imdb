I never saw it on TV, but I rented a DVD through Netflix as soon as I discovered that it was available. I had high hopes and was not disappointed. It's funny, and the animation is great. This level of quality I would expect only from feature films, so I am surprised by some bad comments to it. Maybe the DVD release improved the animation? One of the bonus DVDs was that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. I'm an adult, and I really appreciate it for adults. Not only children love cute animated characters. According to some, this is far from being “obscene,” but I see where some parents do not want their young children to see it. I am very disappointed that it was canceled. I would like them to produce more episodes. Or maybe a movie.
