And I'm a fanatic Nicole Kidman. I would pay to see and hear her reading the Moscow phone book, which, as far as I know, she could do when she spoke Russian in this film. <br /> <br /> All four principal are excellent, but the film itself is a lot of good images and the best scenes that are not bound together. <br /> <br /> Although everyone is always ready to stop disbelief while watching a movie, he asks the viewer too much. <br /> <br /> It could have been very funny (in parts) or rather frightening (in one scene), but the director didnâ€™t seem to know where to go.
