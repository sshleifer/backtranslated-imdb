People don't seem to give Lensman his due. Several questions were missed that are key to understanding the Lensman experience. <br /> <br /> The Year: For the year it was made in (1984), Lensman has some of the most amazing effects I've ever seen. As a person who watches the animation of the early 80s a lot, Lensman is unique in that he uses what is presented as computer images at the time when computers were extremely primitive. An excellent example of this is the battle of Kim against the geometric knives in a laser maze. Every time I look, I have to repeat to myself that it was 1984, when it was made. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack: Lensman has one of the craziest soundtracks I have ever heard, and this insane tantrum Beat penetrates every corner of the film. Lensman borrowed a lot from two Western mistakes and managed to deal with the first to some extent - the need to fill every second of silence in the film with music and the need for heroin. While the music is well tuned and stimulating scenes such as the motorcycle battle at the Tionit Factory at the Radelyx, the heroine theme fails due to the apparent meaning of Chris annoyance. It is interesting to note that the constant music prevented my efforts to eliminate noise when I archived the lensmaker from analog tape to digital format - since there was not a single second of silence available for use as a control point. <br /> Western Influences: Helmut - sounds like a “helmet” and has about the same voice as Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairborn has the same hairstyle as the SW princess, and her name looks suspiciously like Marissa Fairborn from the Transformers. He assumes the role of Han Solo, driving the ship and having some technical knowledge. Buzzkirk is a definite improvement on Chewbacca. The lens is a good concrete copy of power, which occurs less like a chance to preach Christianity in the audience than in the original SW. While strength rested on faith much more than concentration, the lens is a pure instrument of concentration. Theoretically, anyone could own a lens. The lens is much more limited than the Force, and is a purely defensive / offensive weapon. <br /> <br /> Technology: the Boscon Alliance has interesting ships with a meatball sponge. They look like attack aircraft only with a red uniform instead of a white uniform. The idea of ​​a DNA weapon was good, if only it had been developed. The Galactic Alliance looked like the Star Guns (or as it was called there - the series of the 60s, where they fought with the Xilons). I didn’t have enough ship to send battles - this was greatly improved in Lensman’s second film. <br /> <br /> Finally a note about Vorzel. This character is a unique and very interesting character design, which, fortunately, continues the second film. <br /> <br />
