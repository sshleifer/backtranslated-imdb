Here is my first film directed by David Mamet. Fitting as it was his first experience. <br /> <br /> The story is uneven here, and it moves like any fraudulent film, from small minuses to big minuses to comprehensive fraud. It's like "The Grifters", but without the level of acting. (In this film, John Cusack was kind of lethargic, but it was his character's character.) The game here is very flat (I sometimes wondered if Croes's polite game should have been a kind of attack on psychoanalysis). At least in the beginning. It never becomes really good, but it develops after painfully hard reading lines in about ten minutes. At the beginning of the film, some lines of Lindsay Crowse — how she reads them — sound like they are an internal monologue or narration, and this is not so. With the advent of Mantegna everything is getting better. <br /> <br /> The dialogue here is not as fun as it should be. I expected that the language lines would crawl in a circle like a slacker, but this is not so. It all sounds very readable, not verbally. Maybe Mamet evolved after this film and relaxed, but if not, then maybe he should let others direct his words. He appreciates them too much here, and as a result they lose their rhythmic, jazz quality. What is even more strange is that apart from this, the film does not look and does not feel like a play. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with Glengarry Glen Ross was that it looked too much like a movie theater, but in this film the actors were not only performed, but also relaxed and free. Everything flowed. <br /> <br /> I wouldn’t mind if it sounded like characters in a movie, talking in a story, or even playing characters talking in game strings — but here it sounds like a movie (or even a book). talking game lines. This is a strange mixture of theater and cinema, which simply does not work. This does not mean that the film is bad - it is not, it is often very interesting. The best piece is in the middle. <br /> <br /> This is a standard movie with fraud: a new guy (in this case, a girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in a terrible underworld. How she gets involved: she is a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive player. She wants to help him with his gambling debts, so she enters The House of Games, the dark game room where the scammers work in the back room. I admit that the installation is pretty incredible. (They expected Crow to come? Did they expect her to write a check? Was Billy on it? However, one of these questions was definitely answered by the end.) <br /> <br /> And from here the minuses start rolling out. I found the beginners - the little students - to be the most fun. We get a lesson in the art of fraud just like Crows. <br /> <br /> We see the approaching final, and then we didn’t see the second final, and then the real final, which I didn’t expect, but maybe you did. The ball just bounces back and forth, and in the last scene in the film, we understand that in the second Crose entered the House of Games she found her true vocation. <br /> <br /> I'm going to forgive the annoying discovery, the incredible bits and the strange reading of the lines, because there is a lot of good. If the first part of the film seems stagnant, stick with it. After a half-hour mark, he really is gaining momentum. If you want a funny scam movie, here it is. If you want Mamet, go see Glengarry Glen Ross again - James Foley made him better. <br /> <br /> ***
