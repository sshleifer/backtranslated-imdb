“Johnny Dangerous” is a kind of comedy game in which there is laughter and “eh?”. But I suggest giving him a chance. I think it is greatly overrated. Not too many people give this film a chance. It works. Just think of it as a little parody of "Goodfellas." Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And he does it well. Johnny Dangerous - a gangster who wants to be taller in life. He just goes from big bosses to a beautiful wife. And, of course, as in many films about the crowd, someone wants him to die. 90% of jokes are laughing. Like, I said, give him a chance. Just take your favorite gangster movies and mix comedy. You have "Johnny Dangerous." <br /> <br /> 7/10
