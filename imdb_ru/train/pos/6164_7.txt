Are we really doing a shitty video again? Under the guise of a digital widescreen large budget remake of 8 mm, it is quite a ride. Unfortunately, there are too many stories here, and sometimes it becomes a journey when our heroine is looking for interesting places in Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. However, I am rather scrupulous about the “depraved” scenes, including everything from hot wax, sharp flogging and rough sex to drowning, beheading and some others. These scenes are impeccable, and it is a pity that Bruno and his budget cannot stretch out so that all the presented creatures become more than just caricatures.
