After that, I watched the films ... I thought: "What the hell was this film such a big success at the Korean box office?" Even though the film had a clever / unusual screenplay, the game was not so good, and the characters were not very interesting. For the Korean film ... I liked the battle scenes. If you want to watch a movie without thinking, this movie is for you. But I have to admit ... the film was partly childish ... 6/10
