The superb quality of star Gerard Philippe, who died too young, jumps out of the screen in this ingenious, funny, tricky comedy with a lot of fencing strikes and amazing tricks. Charmingly entangled in his storytelling, it is impossible to resist. Sweet romantic comedy with a very young Gina Lollobrigida as a love interest. The film, which was remembered with great love.
