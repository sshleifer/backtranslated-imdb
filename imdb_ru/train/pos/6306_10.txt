Idiot crooks, baby, safe, plan and baby. Put them all together and you’ll get the best comedy you’ve never heard of. <br /> <br /> Even with some stellar power in the list (at least, minus ... well, b plus?) this film received very little advertising. <br /> <br /> But this does not detract from its genius. <br /> <br /> Stunning writing, solid delivery and a believable group of characters. Some truly classic lines and a fun twist at the end. <br /> <br /> This is not some kind of blurry comedy "Nutty Professor". These are bad guys with a low standard of living. They speak the language of a bad guy with a low standard of living and make things of a bad guy with a low standard of living. But they do it for your amusement and fun, and they do it well. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies I've ever seen.
