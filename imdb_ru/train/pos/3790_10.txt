I tuned in to this by chance on an independent film channel and was chained. I am a professional actor, and I was stunned by the performances. They felt completely improvisers, absolutely no affects. I could not tell if he was scripted or how he was shot and waited until the very end to see the credits, and then spent half an hour on IMDb to find this film. Do not miss it. I see that the writer-director also shot a very good film “Everyday People”, which I really liked. The shame of the movie business is that projects that are excellent do not get distributed and the advertising they deserve, and live under the radar. This film deserves to be soared high and proud. I urge people to look and see.
