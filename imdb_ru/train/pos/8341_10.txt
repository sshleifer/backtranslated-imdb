The result - the best romantic comedy ever. This film accomplishes what all great films aspire to: the creation of the world and the time we want to visit, and delights us to be part of the human race. When I'm blue, this film takes me up and makes me laugh (and this is still true after many views - always fresh). <br /> <br /> All the actors are in great shape. The characteristics are so dead that the characters fit together so well that you forget the actor (it's usually hard to do with Mattau, Robbins and Ryan). The supporting composition is invariably brilliant: Fry (“agae”, “full package of pygmies”!), Jacobi and Sachs and Maher (three theoretical physicists like “Greek choir” - “but time does not exist”), Dringing (“something that we can run from New Jersey, Shalhoub & Whaley (boss and Robbins employee at the service station) and Hen (Eisenhower - how many comedies does Eisenhower have ??). Don't miss this forgotten treasure.
