I bought it cheaply from the rest of the rental at our local store. It was almost in perfect condition, and I had never heard of it before. Obviously, no one else had. <br /> <br /> I can't believe my luck. You are going through the whole sphere of emotions, and she is trying to overcome the complex message - the very moral and non-triumphant position of Mandelaâ€™s party, undoubtedly. Despite its enormous length (I had to look at it in two sessions) - it was like a book that could not be postponed. Perhaps the songs are not so remembered, but the spirit of this subject is eternal. I can't understand the comments that the musical (explicitly designed for the stage) is not realistic! I saw South Pacific and also read a book, and I can guarantee that the musical is not realistic compared to a book. I will cherish this little find until it wears out. One day they will do it again with the best budget. <br /> <br />
