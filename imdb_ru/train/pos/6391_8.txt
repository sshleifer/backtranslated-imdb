Caught this film at the Arizona International Film Festival. I did not expect much (although the director of the festival told me that this is one of the best films shown). Five minutes later I was sold. Filmed at B & W on a budget, this movie is hilarious. The action is solid, the writing is solid and the appearance of the film is solid. Acting is perhaps the biggest revelation, since most films shot on a small budget usually have an amateur or stage play. Not this one. It contains one of the most convincing, cute and funny images of a character with Tourette Syndrome I have ever seen. The plot is confusing, not confusing and untidy, not unreasonable. If you have a chance, watch this movie. Such directors as Maykovski (I hope I understood this correctly) deserve the opportunity to present their materials to a wider audience.
