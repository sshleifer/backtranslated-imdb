Do not be fooled by stupid titles, this is one pleasant trip! The true successor to Tetsuo of Iron Man and Ichi the Assassin, this gem begins with a blow and puts thick blood until the credits begin. It seems that aliens capture human bodies and turn them into combat vehicles, which are then used to fight each other in a perverted game to entertain their species. The winner of the battle eats the loser alive. This is basically a plot, but who cares when the blood is so good? I have no idea how many buckets of mucus were used, but look disgusting. There is an interesting and effective use of stop motion when absorption occurs, and loving care avoids all creatures and makeup effects. CGI is a bit limited, but it really does not detract from the overall quality, at least for me. It was a really funny and exciting stomach film, which deserves a lot of praise and rightfully earned its place on the Cult Classics stack. Find it and see, you will not be disappointed!
