I have never seen such an incredible film work as I did when Daniel Day-Lewis played Kristie Brown in My left foot. In fact, behind the scenes, his role did not even end. He played the role of Christie Brown, or at least was as disabled as he was during the filming of the film and needed surgery because of the damage done to his excellent back play. This is wonderful for me, and in spite of all the pain that he humbled to play this role, I believe that it would be fair to say that he put the most Oscar-worthy presentation in history. He was so skillful in this difficult part that, I think, no one could do it better or with more dedication than he. Although I cannot say that this is the greatest film of all time, I can say that the way he played this impossible role, and then continued to play it until she no longer played, is without a doubt the greatest legs, which I've ever seen from an actor do. Probably a person too in this regard.
