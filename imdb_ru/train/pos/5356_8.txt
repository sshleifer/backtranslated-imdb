“The Running Man” is not a very good film, in fact it is rather stupid. But it provides what you want in the movie Arnie, and this is action and entertainment. I do not understand how no one could enjoy this picture, it is so stupid and excessive that it almost makes fun of itself. By the way, this is probably one of the most worthy films of Arnie.
