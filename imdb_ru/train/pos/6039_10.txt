I was lucky to be extra in this great movie and love every minute of filming. I went to the premiere in London and had a great chat with Phil, Peter, Martin and John, like my wife. Then a few weeks later there was a trip to the cinema with members of our bike club. What a brilliant movie, he deserves to be there with all the great biker movies. Now we have a DVD of Sue, my wife can't get enough of this and the kids too. Get a little from the club, who seems to think that I am now a movie star, oh well, you can only dream. I think they are just jealous. The only drawback of the first part of the shoot was the weather, rain, rain and more rain, but hey, we were in Wales. I hope there will be a continuation, so keep me posted, John. Danny Beck
