As part of the celebration of Earth Day, Disney released the film "Earth." Stopping away from any harsh message of gloom and doom, we turn to some excellent shots of animals in their habitats without feeling too bad about ourselves. <br /> <br /> Stars of the show are a herd of elephants, a family of polar bears and a whale and his calf. The narrative begins at the North Pole and continues southward until we reach the tropics, all the while being familiar with the inhabitants of the various climatic zones that we crossed. <br /> <br /> Global warming is mentioned at the time when we are considering the journey of the polar bear; It should be noted the reduction in the number of ice islands in recent years. We never see bears catching seals, but a desperate search for a father leads him to a dangerous decision. <br /> <br /> Aerial shots of caribou migrating through the tundra are one of the most breathtaking wildlife shots I have ever seen; this and one of the migratory wild birds is enough to reward the entry price to see them on the big screen. <br /> <br /> One of the disappointments I felt was that the stunning shots of the great white sharks that removed the seals were otherwise taken. Slow motion. You will never feel one feature of wild animals; their incredible speed. The idea of ​​slowing down a film in order to convey a greater speed, I think, originated (or at least this is the first thing I remember) in the television show Kung Fu in the early seventies. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that as the titles end at the end, some demonstrations of the cinematic methods used are revealed. There are enough dramatic, humorous and instructive moments in this film to make it a good choice for nature lovers. Perhaps due to some selective editing (as if sparing us from the terrible end of the predatory moment) and the fact that this material was released in 2007 and is available on DVD, it itself is a solid film, And you can take your children ! <br /> <br /> Three stars.
