I have seen this movie at worst. I already missed 15 minutes when I woke up on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I did not know what I was watching, I thought it might be the film of the week, but quickly became confined to the role of the main actress playing a young woman who had kidnapped the child. The package began to turn and turn, which I did not expect, and by the end of the credits I made my way through the onboard guide to find out what I had just seen. It turns out that I belatedly discovered Dow-John, who got the role for the best female role in Cannes. I do not know if Secret Sunshine is typical for Korean movies, but I go to the DVD store to find out more.
