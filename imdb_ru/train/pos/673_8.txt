Despite the huge gulf that we call understanding, we still don’t know much about what the elders of the early tribes explained. In each case, much is connected with the danger of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us that we are not preparing for what they are warning, this is the “end of time”. In this film, entitled “The Last Wave,” the natives were killed for no apparent reason. When the perpetrators are arrested, they are silent, less disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays a lawyer assigned to defend the accused. Although he is haunted by prophetic imagery from his own childhood and is warned by modern signs given to him by a sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton begins to defend the violation as the Tribal Law and therefore is not subject to standard justice. The film is full of mysterious gloomy forebodings about apocalyptic disasters at the end of the world and warnings about the future of the tsunami and the death of the island. Black drama and deep rituals - this is what gives the film a frightening charm, and therefore it is not for the faint of heart; in fact, the simplest ghostly visions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent moviegoers. Good quiet drama. ****
