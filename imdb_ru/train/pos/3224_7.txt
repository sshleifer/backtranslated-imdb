I watched this movie, expecting what I would get: cowboy good sci-fi stuff. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a wonderful job with an extremely limited role. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you are trying to act under these two restrictions: you have almost no dialogue, and because you play cool Military robot, you cannot show emotions using facial expressions! Howzat? Something like asking a diva to perform a great aria when she was silenced and pasted. Despite the verbal and expressive handcuffs, Russell gives an incredible description. His robot becomes a man, despite the limitations. Great job! <br /> <br /> As usual, Jason Isaacs assures that he will go down in history as the great icon of the unsurpassed villain - the one you would like to see drawn and quartered. Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, maternal and gorgeous. I'm not sure how much my impression is based on her play and on her physical beauty, but it was difficult to look away from her. Unfortunately, the role of Gary Busey was too small and limited. <br /> <br /> Most of the plot is quite standard, with a significant number of flaws, but since there is a science fiction comic in it, I donâ€™t see what is wrong with a few weaknesses. By the end of the story, the good guy wins, and the appreciative audience gets tremendous emotional satisfaction. Yes! <br /> <br /> Anyone who believes that Russell did not cope well with acting was the one who had lost sight of the whole point.
