I saw it in Detroit in what must have been its original mileage. I literally rolled into the aisle of the theater. It was so funny. Since then, I have not seen this, but with pleasure. Where do you get a copy? Anyone who says something about being dated or overdone for my money is just a bunch of posers. Every parody is evil, erotic or perversely funny. Each! There is no weak including. For example, in the opening sequence, which parodies 2001, there are gorilla-go-go dancers with hanging breasts. Felinny would have shot him if he had been an evil wit ... If you come into this film with an open mind and careless mocking heart, you will put it on your best list.
