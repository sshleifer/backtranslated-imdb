Despite what others have said (* cough *), this is my favorite movie of all time. I do not know how long I waited to see it, but as soon as I finally saw it, I immediately fell in love. Of course, this is strange, but it just gives it a more exciting taste. For those who don't know, Moonchild is one of the first films of Gackt and Hyde. They did not do very much, maybe 3 or 4 peaks each. So give them a loan. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best at first either. I believe that they create some strange situations, but I look to find the best moments of this film, emotions and the like. Therefore, I gave and will give this film 10 out of 10.
