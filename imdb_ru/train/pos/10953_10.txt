I think this show is a lot of fun! This is not for every taste, and I am not going to exalt or humiliate people who do not understand this. I am sure that they are wonderful bright people who work at a different wavelength. But if you like it, you really like it. Sarah plays a madly in love loser named Sarah Silverman, who often finds herself in the predicament of Homer (this is the Gomerians, as in Homer's Simpsonian). <br /> <br /> I remember Sarah Silverman from her short speech Saturday Evening Live in the early 90s. Then I liked her immediately, and I try my best to check what she has done. <br /> <br /> This show is ridiculous: "choke on food and wet pants." Therefore, I always fasted before watching and wear diapers for adults. Check this!
