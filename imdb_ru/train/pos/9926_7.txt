Kiera Knightley went straight from the P & P movie to this action movie ... she could hardly have decided to change her image more dramatically. Great success in love In fact, and like Lizzie in the classic Jane Austen, she, again, "goes." Just as her female warrior in a bikini in King Arthur was more skin than a muscle, it is hard to imagine this delicate frame that can withstand the lives of bounty hunters ... but this is exactly what Domino Harvey (real) did, I (being one of the biggest fans of Nightly) believe that she carries, if turned off. <br /> <br /> Material .... <br /> <br /> * 90210 (for the non-American world) is the Beverly Hills postcode in Los Angeles, where all movie stars live. * Domino's most famous film Father Harvey was the Manchurian Candidate (who appears in the film). * Domino Harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the movie was released in June 2005, after she was arrested for drug trafficking. She has just completed talks about including some of her music in her music. * Kiera Knightley refers to Domino Harvey's sexuality in an interview with Lucy Liu. <br /> <br /> If you find this film a bit contrived, look at Domino Harvey, because the facts are more amazing than fiction.
