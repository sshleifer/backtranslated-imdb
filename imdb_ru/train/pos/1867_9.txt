This is a film about life, triumph over troubles and wonders of the human spirit. I challenge anyone to not shed tears by the end of the film. It’s more than a tear-jerk, it’s an exciting, thought-provoking drama with great performances by all the actors, but especially Derek Luke and Denzel Washington. After 7 years, I am amazed that Luke is still virtually unknown, and Washington just shot another film. However, in addition to the slow development, the history of the hardship and adversity of this adopted child and how it still affects him in adulthood is a film that remains with you long after you have seen it. Like many other photos from flood foxes, it was more like a sleeping hit, and it did not receive the mass approval of the critics, which it deserves. The scene where Antwon finally meets with his mother, summed up the film for me, there were so many ways that could be done, and it could be all schmuck, or it could be unreal, but Washington produced an absolutely correct tone, his mother never said a word and could only shed a tear, while antowne asked just why. Her irresistible fault did not allow her to say anything that she could say to protect herself? One of the most moving cinematic scenes I've ever seen.
