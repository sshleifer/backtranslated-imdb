I was so surprised at how great The Man In The Moon was. I mean, at first I was expecting some stupid and predictable film, but I decided to postpone it while watching. Well, when it was all over, I was just left stunned (mostly in tears) by how wonderful “Man on the Moon” turned out to be. This film is so fascinating and so aware of its tone, and it’s just a terrific movie. The acting was great, especially from Reese Witherspoon (who was so cute and sweet) and everything else. Nothing really bothered me, I felt that the final was quite predictable, but very well done at that. I also felt that some things were simple or as if it had been done before, but still a great movie. In general, I have to say that I don’t have much to say about this film, not that it is bad, it’s just a film that you like or don’t like. However, I would recommend it to anyone and everything, even if you don’t like movies of this type, it’s still a nice movie. <br /> <br /> 8.7 out of 10 stars
