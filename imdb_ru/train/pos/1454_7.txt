I have been waiting for this film for a long time since I saw a trailer in which it looked like a political drama with the participation of three of my favorite actors; Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda. And although the director was Harold Becker, who did an uneven job, he and Pacino merged into SEA OF LOVE, which is among their best works. But interference at some level (for a start, some scenes in the original trailer do not appear in the film) and the change in tone (the subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller) do it, although it can be observed far from how it could have been. <br /> <br /> Which is very bad, because I really wanted this movie. There was a lot of potential here to make a film about how the government can still be worth it, despite all the corruption, and make a difficult statement about this corruption, and not about the good guys against the bad guys. And it's good to play here. Pacino and Cusack are both very good, and Danny Aiello gives one of the best performances in his career. But Fonda is wasted in her role, having nothing in common, and although there is merit in the central storyline when it turns into a thriller, the film loses its way, is briefly restored in the final scene between Cusack and Pacino, and then falls down completely at the end. I wish I liked it more, but no.
