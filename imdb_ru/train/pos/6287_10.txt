"Gone in 60 seconds" is a very good fighter who earned more than $ 100 million, but was blown up by most critics. I personally thought it was a great movie. The story was believable and probably was the best role ever played for this type of film, including three Academy Award winners Nicolas Cage, Robert Duval and the very hot Angolin Jolie. Except for the lame stunt at the end, this is the perfect combination of action movie and drama. my score **** (of ****)
