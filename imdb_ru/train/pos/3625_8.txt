This is the best picture of baseball ever since Redford hit The Natural in our opinion. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths illuminate the screen with a great story and actors who seemed real enough to draw you into their lives. <br /> <br /> “The American Dream”, filled with dreams - embodied in reality, after 9.11 inflames the true story of the devil Ray, Jimmy Morris. Australian-born actress Rachel Griffiths plays in her native western Texan better than most Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was perfect ?? play the role of an imitator, gonvara and a modest winner with the same psychological baggage as that of the ordinary audience in the audience. This is real. Screen chemistry works. If you like baseball players, you will love this movie. Ingredients for Americana and apple pie were there. My popcorn has become "fashion a la." <br /> <br /> And hey: buy a CD! Music shakes and bears the story superbly! Synchronization of words and music pushes history forward exactly as it should, and this area disappoints me more than not. <br /> <br /> Criticism: I would give baseball to someone else. But Quaid has a lot to teach us all about character and heart. St. Rita and the nuns were a good decoration, but they never found their place in history to open and close them. A little long It is worth every minute in the last analysis. 8/10. <br /> <br />
