This careless military fighter of 1939, fairly loosely based on Rudyard Kipling’s memorable poem, as well as on his novel Soldiers of Three, is considered first-class entertainment about the British imperial army in India in the 1880s. Cary Grant delivers more stunning blows with his frazzled fists than he did in all his films combined. Located in faraway India, this six-speed yarn tells of the exploits of three stern British sergeants and their native water carrier, Gung Dean (Sam Jaffe), who are fighting a bloodthirsty cult of Indian killers, called bandits. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (Cary Grant from Last Outpost), Sergeant McChesney (Oscar-winner Victor McLaughlin from Informer) and Sergeant Ballantyne (Douglas Fairbanks, the youngest from Dawn's Patrol), are a competitive trio of drunk, cruel and funny alpha males, whose years of playfulness are about to become history, because Ballantyne plans to marry Amy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and go in for tea. Naturally, Cutter and McChesney are developing different schemes to thwart the Ballentins' plans. When their bosses order them to return to action with a sergeant. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coot from “The Sheik Steps Out”), Cutter and McChesney Higginbotham, the drug, so he cannot accompany them, and Ballantin must replace him. Half the fun here is to watch the leaders try to outwit each other without hating themselves. Directed by George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in a great style and scope, when our heroes weave with an army of bandits. Lenser Joseph H. Augustus received an Oscar nomination for outstanding black and white cinematography.
