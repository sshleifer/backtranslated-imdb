This is such a fantastic film - “Western” about a self-confident person (Jimmy Stewart), going to Klondike for gold. On the way, he is plagued by a local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntyre, who gives a monstrously evil idea), which he distracts back. MacIntyre threatens that he will become dead if he ever comes back through his city, which, unfortunately, is the only way back to the States. The main part of the story is about the peaceful city of Klondike Dawson, turned upside down by new residents of the city of McIntyre. For example, Ruth Roman, who came with Stuart and his two companions (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, who plays Stuart's best friend), is building a salon (Hollywood front for a brothel) and trying to run a city restaurant and a tusochny place out of business. She paves the way for McIntyre and his assholes too. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the pinnacles of the western genre, "Naked Spur". “Far Country” is slightly smaller, and it contains 99.9% of what made this film so special, and, of course, it is not a cheap copy. Like The Naked Spur, The Far Country boasts excellent cinema. The scenery is great. Stuart gives one of his best performances (almost equal to his greatest success in 1954, Rear Window). I suppose this can be considered a cliché, as he starts a selfish loner and learns how such an existence ultimately plays out. However, Stuart plays it damn well, he makes this character very human. And auxiliary performances are fantastically universal. In addition to what I mentioned, the charming French actress Corinne Calvet is very good. And I have to highlight Walter Brennen. It seems he specializes in playing with best friends. His relationship with Stewart is very moving, since he is, at first, the only character who can bring any humanity out of a cynical person. The script is very well written, and the Mann guide is impeccable. Masterpiece. 10/10
