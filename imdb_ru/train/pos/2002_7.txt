To some extent, I liked this film more than the original VAMPIRES. I found this film to be rather misogynistic. As a woman and a horror fan, I am used to the fact that women in danger are one of the main genres. But they just beat Cheryl Lee too much. In this film, Natasha Wagner is a more realized character, and the main bad guy is a girl! Arly Jover (who played the vampire in BLADE) is very otherworldly and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi ... well, yes, not a great actor, but he's fine. At least he doesn't start singing. Catch him on the cable if you can. This is an Encore Action this month.
