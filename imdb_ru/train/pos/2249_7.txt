I enjoyed watching Brigham Young, and I found this to be a positive and in many ways true portrayal of the LDS faith. I think a remake of this epic journey through the plains would be useful, since many people today are not familiar with the trials and persecutions faced by the early Mormon church. This is an incredible story about strong and loyal people. <br /> <br /> As a member of the church, the most disturbing aspect of the film (most historical inaccuracies didn’t bother me much) was the image of Brigham Young as the one who “consciously deceived” church members, believing that he was called to be Joseph’s successor as a prophet. Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this storyline, it seems that his doubts in this regard are a historical fact, when in fact both Brigham and most church members understood and firmly believed that he was called to lead the church. Brigham did not consciously deceive the saints; rather, he led them confidently with inspiration. This moment is important to the Mormons, because an important aspect of our faith depends on it: today God really speaks to the Prophets and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was an inspired Prophet of God. <br /> <br /> or you don’t believe this statement or not, just know that the film doesn’t exactly represent what Brigham himself believed.
