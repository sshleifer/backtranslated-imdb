High-energy classic Raul Walsh of 1933, The Bowery puts the salon owner and operator Wallace Beery against a fierce opponent and dandy George Raft with foster street guy Jackie Cooper and good-looking Fay Ray in roles that play between their big rivalries. It is not clear what exactly is the competition, but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids. Initially, many magical masterpieces, but the characters soften as the film progresses. In addition, the apparent abundance of scenes in the cabin Beery. Different characters, a sexy chorus, a lot of booze, the perfect creation of a den of lawlessness, not too restrained by the so-called restrictions to the code, and then - Carrie Nation, led by Carrie Nation herself. All this creates a very vivid picture of a long past life. I do not like to compare epochs, but this film is completely and completely different from everything that can be seen today. The film has a lot of heart and long-lost innocence, and it must be seen.
