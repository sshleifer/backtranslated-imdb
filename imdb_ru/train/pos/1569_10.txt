I love this show! Mr Blick, Gordon and Waffle are cats that are so different from each other, but together they call themselves "brothers." I often try to imitate the tired, sighing accent of their butler, Hovis, or even the Scottish town of Gordon. There should be more episodes made about Kimberly's Man. The episode that cats are disguised as a teenage girl in order to gain access to Kimberley's Man Party to get their hungry paws for their favorite drink, Rootbeer, is a fun classic. Now we cannot drink the root beer in our house without performing either the voice of Catscratch or the brothers of the Hansons from the movie “Slap Shot”. Future classic. Where can I get the first two seasons on DVD?
