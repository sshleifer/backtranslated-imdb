The Farrelli Brothers, Bobby and Peter, are in this again. With "Fever Pitch", the creators of other films that dealt with a lot of rude topics are abandoning this tactic when they decide to bring Nick Hornby’s movie to the screen, which would be difficult to do. The novel under the same name dealt with the passion of men for football, as it unfolds in England, where most British sport fans absorb this sport. It is the merit of Lowell Ganz and Babalu Mandell’s writing team to turn the book into a language that most Americans like when they make their hero a fan of the Boston Red Sox. <br /> <br /> “Fever” is a film featuring the obsessed fan of Ben Wrightley, whose life spins around in the Red Sox season, and who is an eighth grade teacher who has strange ways to engage his students in the subject he tries to teach them.When Ben takes four of his best students on a tour of a local firm, he meets and falls hopelessly in love with the clever Lindsay Mix, a young woman who sets off on a journey but at thirty has no life of her own. > <br /> The story follows two lovers Through the ritual of visiting the Red Sox at home games at Fenway Park. The fans of this team are probably the most dedicated people in the world, they are stuck in a team that does amazing things, but never won the World Series until 2004. In fact, the end of what we heard was to be changed because it was the year in which they finally won an event that eluded them for eighty-six years! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as a couple in the center of the film. Miss Barrymore is a natural person who always surprises with her appearance in front of the camera. Jimmy Fallon, a popular television comedian who has become a film actor, has, in our humble opinion, better opportunities here than in his latest appearance in Taxi. <br /> <br /> The Farrelli Brothers film will also satisfy their fans. like baseball fans with this baseball tale.
