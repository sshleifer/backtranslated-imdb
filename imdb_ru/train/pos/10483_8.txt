Yes, this film is predictable and definitely not premium material. But then he is not trying to be what he is not. Cheerful bustle with real funny one-line players, Peter O'Toole’s stellar and very funny performance, a down-to-earth and down-to-earth performance from Joan Pleight. The band's performance was in place, each playing its own role in a dexterous, funny manner. The music was good, but not great, but it filled the film well. From some negative comments I came to the conclusion that the subtlety of some of the humor went to their head. A good example is the comment on “a strange baseball-like game”, well, my dear American, it was cricket, from which baseball originated, and explaining this to an ignorant American group was very funny for those who know cricket, Also no, you should have trembled when Karl broke the window; it was funny how Lord Foxley said, “Oh, yes!” to get more money for the breakdown, and the manager said “oh no” at the same time, also referring to the money. God, it seems that some jokes have to be explained to some people ... In general, I enjoyed it and had a big laugh! Worth seeing.
