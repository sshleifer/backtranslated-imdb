“Rumors” of Freeze Frenleng is an excellent cartoon from the Snafu series, which warns against the spread of panic rumors during the war. Created like all Snafu shorts to be shown to military viewers as entertaining educational films, Rumors are extremely creative and drive tons of ideas into their very short lifespan. When Snaf begins a rumor about the bombing, it turns into a rumor that America has lost the war. This is brilliantly illustrated by the example of a long rubber goat and several strange fictional creatures who are returning to chase Snaf, with even more terrible news about his country's armed forces. “Rumors” are resourceful, rapidly evolving and amusing, and all this helps to eclipse the rather discouraged message “do not scold the military.” He is considered one of the best shortts of Private Snafu.
