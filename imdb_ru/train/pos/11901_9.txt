As far as I remember, Balanchine’s changes in Tchaikovsky’s score are as follows: <br /> <br /> 1) The last part of Grocervitan (the traditional melody at the end of the party) is repeated several times to let the children dance the last dance before their scene ends . <br /> <br /> 2) Solo violin, written but excluded from Tchaikovsky’s score for Sleeping Beauty, is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene. Balanchine chose this music because of its melodic attitude to music for the growing Christmas tree that appears soon after. <br /> <br /> 3) Solo for the Cavalier Fairy Sugar Plum eliminated. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the accusation that Balanchine somehow defiled the great account of Tchaikovsky is inappropriate.
