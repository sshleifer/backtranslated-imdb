Here is another film that does not really need a big recommendation. This is a classic comedy, very funny and interesting, which, of course, ultimately inspired a successful television series, which, as many would say, was even better (I personally like both). <br /> <br /> For some, it is difficult to warm up by Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison, when they were filmed on a TV show with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or, possibly, vice versa). But in both cases, we have four good actors who, in real life, are so similar to their colleagues in the film that they managed to make these characteristics their own. This is Neil Simon's humorous material, which is key, and where the laughter really comes from. <br /> <br /> For those who for some reason have never heard of THE ODD COUPLE, this is a story about a neurotic and fussy neat freak (Lemmon) who is thrown out of a 12-year marriage to his long-suffering wife and settles in an apartment in Manhattan his careless and completely irresponsible friend (Mattau). Connecting these two unlikely roommates in the same four walls leads to very funny difficulties.
