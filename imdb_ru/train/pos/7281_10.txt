I first saw this film at a local station on Sunday afternoon horror in 1969 or 1970. At that time I was very small, but I liked it, and it didnâ€™t really scare me. I thought he had such a cool and very original plot. Recalling the past, I am still surprised that this was shown during the day on T.V. uncut in those years. Since then I have been looking for this film, I have seen it again and again and always loved it. One would think that John Waters would be the idol of this film. It should be not only a scary movie, but also one of the dirtiest, dirtiest films ever made at that time. And surprisingly, you have not heard of this as a cult that followed films like Blood Feast or The Hills Have Eyes. He has followers of the cult, but, in my opinion, he really should have become a cult classic. As far as I know, this happened shortly before the release of Blood Feast, which makes it probably one of the first real "bloody" films. In fact, in this film there are elements of Herschell, Gordon Lewis and little Russ Meyer, added for good measure. <br /> <br /> In any case, I recommend this to anyone who loves dirty, sloppy, black and white horror films from the early 60s (I think the date at the end is read 1960).
