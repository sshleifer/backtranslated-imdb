I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are still talking about this film! Obviously, this film was not THAT bad, otherwise people would not even talk about it. I personally enjoyed this movie, and still do! I think this film is not for everyone, but it definitely touched the hearts of many. <br /> <br /> As for those who think that this film is "overvalued" or "over-promoted" ... well, we only have the audience thanked the movie for it! lol * You see, these are not CRITICISTS / authors of articles that make the movie "HUGE" or "HIT" with the general public. PEOPLE make the film with great success. With Titanic everyone was delighted. Let's face it, a movie like this has never been done before. At least not with the type of special effects needed to truly capture the essence of the actually sunken ship. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron calculated the actual shipwreck in the film with a REAL drowning on that fateful day in April 1912. Even silver for God coincided! <br /> <br /> Give this movie a break, guys! Critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! When this film really came out, and people started hearing from WORD OF MOUTH (this is the BEST form of advertising, note) that this is a good / worthy film that is worth seeing, then everyone became crowds in theaters to watch this movie not one, not two, but maybe 3 times and more! So I wouldn’t really say that this film was “overloaded” ... at least, not like the MATRIX reload assembly or “HOOL” is “overloaded”. Ha! The critics did not even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover the giant budget of Cameron, which was needed to make this mammoth movie. Nevertheless, the money for the films took care of this 200 millionth budget and MUCH more! <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this movie. However, this film may not be for everyone. Do not say that this film sucks just because of romance! This is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Dislike to the film just because it has a romance! The story was sweet. The dialogue could be better, but let's face it ... THE REAL movie star was not Leo or Kate ... it was a Giant Ship! I think all the actors, including DiCaprio and Winslet, did a great job. This is not the best work (I have seen a lot of the BEST work from both of them), but it was NOT THE WORLD I’ve seen on the screen before. Give them a break! <br /> <br />
