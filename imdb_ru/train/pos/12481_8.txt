Well, I donâ€™t watch too many horror films, and the reason is that films like Dark Remains. I caught it on a (surprisingly full) DVD, and it scared me silly. In fact, I think that the DVD lacked only a pair of new pants. <br /> <br /> However, the next day I told someone about it when I realized that I really saw only about 10% of it. The rest of the time I was watching the pizza on my coffee table - I was nervous that my girlfriend would have caught me if I had really closed my eyes. Several times I REALLY bravely looked at the screen, I jumped so hard that I decided not to look again. <br /> <br /> Filming was solid, and the position of the characters was really convincing. The simplicity of the film - what really captured my jump button - is just a forest, a house and an abandoned prison - and a lot of darkness. The most surprising for me was the fact that, although it was clearly not a multi-million dollar production, the effect of the makeup really looked like it was! In addition, it is obvious that this is a film made by someone with a great love of filmmaking. Sound design and music really used my surround sound system like many Hollywood movies never did. I noticed on the Internet that this film won LA Shriekfest - a really great achievement, and I think the festival saw a clear talent of directors - and probably a lot more of this film than I could. <br /> <br /> Turn on the sound, turn off the lights, and if you want to save your girlfriend, order a pizza.
