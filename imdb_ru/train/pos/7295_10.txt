I managed to see it at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my boyfriend. We were both impressed by the complexity of the plot and found that it was moving emotionally. It was very well directed with strong images. The visual effects were awesome - especially for short. It had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic: this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon who offers to help her in a situation with her abusive father. There is also an unexpected turn at the end that took me by surprise. It leans towards the gothic feeling. I would like to see this as a feature film. - Carrie
