This incredible story of a female witch stalking a mortal in a mortal world. Her "community" is open among its members, but she hides her witchcraft from mortals. Hmmm ... that sounds familiar. Lol This is not your typical movie. Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovac’s very “marching” performances do not let you get bored. Kim Novak always gives pleasure on the screen, but I found her combination with James Stewart unusual (but not fatal to the story). <br /> <br /> With a new interest in everything witty and dark, this film deserves to be discovered and re-discovered by the old and new audience ... THIS IS REMAINING HOT!
