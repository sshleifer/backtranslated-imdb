Eglimata (= Crimes) is a story about small crimes committed by ordinary people who, in a crazy scenario, can lead to an absolute catastrophe. One of the smartest in the history of Greek TV shows! Such actors as Ketti Konstadina and Maria Kavogianni showed a completely new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible "guilty" laughter. It seems that every viewer will recognize the bad side of themselves in one of the characters, or at least the side of themselves that they wish to have. Actors of all ages, who played more and more roles, got an equally large place in the heart of the Greek audience. My personal favorites (except for the first two, which I mentioned) are Vasilis Charalambopulos, Atinodoros Prusalis and Stavros Nikolaidis, but many amazing actors have passed some episodes from time to time. Anyone who understands Greek worldwide should find a way to watch this series, although for more than 5 years it has been shown on television. In Greece, they repeat the series (ANT1) at every opportunity, both in the summer and in the afternoon. We will never forget Eglimat or any of the cast!
