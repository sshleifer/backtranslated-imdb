By no means a masterpiece, and far from being the best Errol Flynn, Istanbul still has a lot to do. Places and excellent technical color cinema bring us back to ancient times. Errol Flynn does show moments of his past glory, and is fine, like Jim Brennan, a pilot who returns in the past to pursue him. The picture is actually a remake of Singapore in 1947, and the story seems terribly contrived and cliché ”by today's standards. In addition, many of the auxiliary staff seem to simply “experience the movement” in this picture. Many people also compared him to one of the greatest people of all time, CASABLANCA. While watching the film, I could see many similarities, but hey, Casablanca inspired countless wannabes, so accept this by all means. In conclusion, if you're a fan of Flynn or old-fashioned love stories, you can watch this movie. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca, or the Maltese Falcon, as a good introduction to some of the classics of Hollywood ....
