Legend of Zu is perhaps the most exciting film I have seen in recent years. It exceeds all expectations and is truly a work of art. With unsurpassed visual landscapes and a history of divine proportions, Legend of Zu continues to amaze its viewers with its greatness. This film is wonderfully created using high-tech cgi, which allow fans of the fantasy genre to see their dreams. Acting is perfect for this type of movie; if you were immortal with supernatural abilities, I would think that you would be more about yourself. <br /> <br /> Unlike many comments, the plot is actually quite simple to follow, keeping a fast pace that adds a sense of urgency. Anyone who cannot follow different characters simply shouldnâ€™t pay attention to it or get used to such levels of difficulty as Titanic. The plot is fascinating and filled with such epic themes that they make you gasp for breath. The legend of Zu is at such a high level that perhaps many people put off its greatness. Allow yourself to fully immerse yourself in his fantastic vision, and you will love this movie.
