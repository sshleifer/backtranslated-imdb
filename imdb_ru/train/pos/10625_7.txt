“Hatred for a minute” is perhaps one of the best films that have appeared in Michigan in recent years. Not to mention that this is a brilliant film, but it is definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> “Hatred” tells about the unpleasant adventures of Eric Sivera (director Kallio), who was insulted earlier. and start listening to my evil side. <br /> <br /> “Hate” is very visually pleasing. The pictures are creative, and the lighting looks quite capricious and interesting. This film does have an element of production value, unlike other recent releases in Michigan, such as "Dark Tomorrow" and "Biker Zombies". Thin frames and stylized composition of pictures show a good use of the budget of this film at $ 350,000. <br /> <br /> However, “Hate” stumbles upon the same places as many other local films, and this is in the plot and characters department. In essence, everything just happens. Eric Siver does not evolve at all. In fact, he was always crazy, just people begin to notice. The film just wanders through its fun road with very little development. In addition, the final is very sharp. <br /> <br /> However, since this is a horror film, since when do we take care of the plot? We just want people to die, and “Hate” certainly delivers. When the number of people increased, people in the theater began to cheer: “Kill her! Kill them all! ”When people scream at the screen, it's always fun. <br /> <br /> This is the place where “Hate” becomes successful. It's fun. And in the end, that's all that really matters.
