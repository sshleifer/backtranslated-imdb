Brazilian films often get more positive marks than they actually deserve. Most likely, Contra Todos (Against Everybody) (the original name, which was refused by the producers: God Against Everybody) received a very low average score (average score) on this site. She seems to be directly rejected by female viewers in general. In fact, it is not so cruel. I mean graphic violence. His cruelty is inherent in the fact that he portrays potential lumpen, I mean deprived citizens, who actually possess high-tech equipment, who coldly carry out orders for murder in exchange for "grana graúda". Is this a postmodern man? Is he / she only worried about the fast, almost impersonal, over-propaganda finding among the binge eating? The picture is perhaps the best Brazilian film of 2004. His brilliant editing style “a la Godard”, his curious counterpoints of the soundtrack, his more than effective overall cast and, above all, his original narration with subtle non-chronological hidden points that are only found in the epilogue deserve at least a mark.
