If redundancy from the boat, from the boat, from the bus, from the bus ... is a way to waste time, then you should go back to Hollywood films that wrap this part in one montage to get money shots. nor will you be connected with each other and you are in cinematic uncertainty, which arises from the fact that you do not show the reality of life. The long elongated travel sequences actually allow the viewer to experience the same feelings of frustration and “waiting in line” that characters have to endure. Disappointment? Yes. Vital? Indeed. The uncertainty of this journey is the key to the “immorality” of this Turkish family. A beautiful film with a great acting game. Sad but worth it.
