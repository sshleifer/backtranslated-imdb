Bravo! Morgan Freeman is an actor who explores the character he chose to play before he makes a commitment. Freeman is great for this film (as well as for “Driving Miss Daisy”), and he is not only believable, but also gets the opportunity to change his image by playing a character with discreet dignity and propriety. Although there are no guarantees in life, it gives the actor an excellent opportunity to play different or unique characters to avoid stereotypes. And I must say that stereotypes have prevented or completely destroyed a significant number of acting professions. <br /> <br /> This is a low-budget film, which, surprisingly, was filmed over a period of just two weeks. This is a film that is well directed and written by Brad Silberling. The location manager chose Carson, CA to customize the movie, and the location helps set the tone and time for the movie. Editing is not bad, but a bit rough. <br /> <br /> Silberling was a “subcontractor” when Freeman made this film while the actor was between the film projects. <br /> There is good chemistry between Freeman and Paz Vega, a Spanish actress, and this opens up an effective dialogue between each of the actors who are diverse and come from different cultures. The film also promotes mutual understanding between people who not only speak two languages ​​(English and Spanish), but also come from two different worlds: ethnicity, race, gender, norms, customs, beliefs, folk traditions, principles and values. The film strives for some honesty and comes to some truth in order to preserve the integrity of the film. <br /> <br /> Part of the comedy is that Freeman plays an unemployed actor who has been out of work for four years. In truth, Freeman is so in demand as an actor that he constantly works. <br /> <br /> The film offers adventure, binding, caring, sharing, changing and changing. And the plots of the film give the viewer a preview of some of the things that the actor must pass in preparation for the role. <br /> <br /> If necessary, tell your boss that you have a "day of mental health." and watch this movie. If you can, take someone else or your family with you. I rate the film as 10 out of 10. It is pleasant, interesting, informative, sharp and worthwhile.
