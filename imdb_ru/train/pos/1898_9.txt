The Who alcoholic drummer's father, Keith Moon, was named Arthur. In this film, I found a lot in common between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon. Liza Minelli, who usually replays, did a good job of it and could turn her cheek to Dudley Moore at every turn. Yes, I agree, Sir John stole absolutely every scene. It was a completely different film, allowing the viewer to look into another life. We often try to repeat this movie on the satellite. God, rest, Dudley Moore; it was such a nice movie. Lots of satire and thumbs down to the rich and snobbers. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is quite sweet.
