Fred McMurray’s / Carol’s third film, Lombard, is a little more serious than Hands Across Table and Princess Comes. This is another adaptation of the play "Burlesque", which, apparently, was popular in those days. <br /> <br /> The original Burlesque play took place on Broadway in the 1927–1928 season for 372 performances, and the role played by Carol Lombard Barbara Stenvik was born on Broadway, which led her to Hollywood. Nancy Carroll played a major role in the early days of the talk, and later Betty Grable, and Dan Daly made another version in the film “When My Child Smiles Me”. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have a vinyl album of a radio version that Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler made for Lux Radio Theater. Believe me, this is an interesting job. <br /> <br /> In any case, McMurray and Lombard do an excellent job with an old chestnut tree, the story unfolds in a nightclub where Lombard is a singer, and McMurray is a jazz trumpeter. Note the good performance of Dorothy Lamour in the role of Latin fox, which stands between Fred and Carol. Anthony Quinn also starred in one of his earliest films like a wolf in a Lombard movie. <br /> <br /> Swing High, Swing Low hold on very well today, and I wouldn’t be surprised if we see another version of the burlesque for the twenty-first century.
