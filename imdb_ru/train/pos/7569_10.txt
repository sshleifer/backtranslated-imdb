At a time when, in our culture, reality, presented in the form of narration, suppresses fiction, as we know it on a small and large screen, “Beyond It” is a film that shows moments from real life that seem more honest, fresh and innovative in the presentation. I have ever seen before. The usual rules of spoon-feeding in this film are absent, so the content audience can sit and watch how these real moments of life flow one after another on the screen. While watching a movie and even after post-contemplation, it is hard to believe that these amazing performances are truly performances. Every moment with a lot of actors felt the truth revealed in their daily lives. However, “Beyond It” is not like a documentary or reality show, but instead surpasses it in its category, with its unique cinema and directing. I look forward to continuing this new category of storytelling with other films directed by Jennifer Scheinin and Randy Walker. <br /> <br /> This film is a must see.
