I am quite a pedestrian man, with some low tastes. However, I sometimes try to raise the bar of my cultural awareness. This film was one of my attempts. I was delighted throughout the film. I liked it so much that I got my own tape so that I could see it again. This is a very thoughtful and emotionally vivid film. I perceived it as a huge question for the viewer: what depth of the sacrifice to duty can you take, can you be asked to accept, accept? As a soldier, this, of course, is an important question for me. This question weighs heavily on the viewer of this film. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
