The 60s is a well-balanced mini-series between historical facts and a good storyline. In four deliveries, we follow the North American family of 3 people. But we not only see them. We also follow the story of several characters: the black reverend, the extremist leader and the soldier in Vietnam. Filmography is just extraordinary. In the first chapters, we see some footage of the Vietnam War between scenes. The next chapter does not begin where the last one ended; it begins after a while, giving us a little riddle about what happened. In general, the 60s mini-series is something that should be seen not only by hippie fanatics, but also by everyone who has little interest in this topic.
