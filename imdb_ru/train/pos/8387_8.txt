In this first part of the BRD trilogy, more passion and plot density than Lola’s, but less Veronica Voss’s magic. Political reflections point to them: we see a shortage after the war, how blackmailers could control most of everyday life (a delightful moment when Fassbinder, playing a fraudster, is trying to sell the full set of Kleist Shigulle, who notes that burning books do not give much heat: she really wants firewood). <br /> <br /> In the first hour there is some clumsiness. The scene in Mary’s room with the black soldier, interrupted by the appearance of Hermann, should go faster. The train scene, when Maria meets Carl Oswald, falls when she insults GI. - I cringed, it was so bad. But when the story develops and years pass, I am more and more drawn into this glossy, cold world.
