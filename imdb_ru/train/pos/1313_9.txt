More tv movies should be made like that. I saw it back in 93, when it was the first time on TV. Helen Hunt and Stephen Weber were awesome, giving very sandy and realistic performances. Weber was especially good, turning into an exceptionally creepy and undervalued view as a child molester / killer. This film really increased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also shot "Hoosiers", which was somewhat formal and exciting. But the direction in both of these works has the same obvious, simple realism, which is so attractive. If you like television films that are not predictable and crowded, watch them if you can. An additional story about the case of Hunt and Fahe is also attractive, but does not distract from the main story.
