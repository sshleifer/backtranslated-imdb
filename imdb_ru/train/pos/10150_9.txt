Of course, this film is juicy, sweet and full of cliché, but it is interesting, and that is why I watch movies. To be entertained. Natasha Henstridge is awesome, even with short hair. Her smile shines, and her beauty cannot be hidden. As for Michael Vartan, I am sure that women love him. These two seem to really love each other in this film. I do not understand the comments that between them there was no chemistry. I think we see what we want to see. <br /> <br /> Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were interesting to observe, even if the British accent d'Abo penetrated her supposed speech in the Bronx. Honestly, I did not notice this until I read these comments, but I returned to the DVD, and now her dialogue sounds more like a British than an American one to me, but she was perfect for her role with this one exception. <br /> <br /> This is the story of two good people who marry important people, but find each other in their souls. This may be an unlikely story, but who said that films should play like documentaries? This is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are shown on the pipe every hour. That is why we watch them in order to briefly escape from the noise of everyday life and enter the world of characters on the screen. I thought these actors did a good job of it, but hey, I'm a sentimental guy who is easy to break. Don't get me wrong, it must be a sentimental scene, and there were a lot of them in this film. <br /> <br /> I give it 9/10 just because I save my 10/10 on this. yet an unprecedented super gorgeous film that I know will appear one day. If you see that it is advertised as going on the channel “Film”, “Lifetime Movies” or something else, record it for viewing. I think you will like.
