This show is so incredibly fun that I couldn't stop watching the Comedy Central Marathon tonight (even though I had seen all the episodes earlier). I have always considered Silverman a great talent, and this, finally, is a means for this talent to appeal to a wide audience. I watch this show and laugh a very large percentage of the time ... I can't say that about many TV shows ... can I? This show, finally, something new, interesting and (most important) funny! This is a show that I will never miss, and which I will buy on DVD as soon as it is released. You have to watch this show ... I predict a long way for this series ... And to be clear, the people who are offended by this show just don’t understand it ... maybe they don’t have enough reason to figure it out .. They must stop making fools of themselves, attacking that they do not understand. Anyone who uses the word "fanatic" in relation to Silverman, or someone who claims that she only wants to "shock" ... this is far from the case ... It is exactly the opposite; just google it, and you will quickly see that it is a huge supporter of civil rights, etc. If you don’t know that it ironically covers all these outrageous points of view, you won’t get it. And if you don’t get it, do a favor and be silent about it so that we all can enjoy the cheerfulness ...
