It is hard to believe, perhaps, but this film was declared immoral because of more chairs than any other film shot before the introduction of the Blue Hayes Code. Yes, indeed, the priests actually told their herds that anyone who went to see this film was committing a mortal sin. <br /> <br /> I am not making this up. They had several reasons: <br /> <br /> Item: Jane loves sex. She and Tarzan wake up one morning in their shelter in the trees. She stretches out sensually and looks coquettishly: “Tarzan, you were a bad boy!” So ​​they not only had sex, they had weird sex! A few years later, according to the Hayes Codex, people (especially women) should not have been portrayed as enjoying sex. <br /> <br /> Item: Jane prefers a simple-minded, though wise and resourceful, savage (Tarzan) to a civilized, respectable nine to five people (Holt). When Holt first surprises her with a beautiful dress from London, she hesitates a bit; when Holt tries to kill Tarzan, and Holt and Jane both believe that he is dead, she hesitates a lot. But when she realizes that her man is very much alive, the sights of civilization disappear for her. And why not? The relationship between Tarzan and Jane is equal: he lacks a “civilized” insecurity that would force him to declare himself as the “head of his wife.” He still lacks many more “civilized” hobbies, such as jealousy. When Holt and his buddy arrive, Tarzan cordially welcomes them both, knowing full well that Holt is Jane's old flame. When Holt wears her in a London dress and slowly dances with her under a portable phonograph, Tarzan falls from the tree and pulls out his knife. Jealous? Nope He is just careful with the strange musical machine, because he had never seen it before. Once this is explained, it is cool. <br /> <br /> Item: Civilized Holt is a dirty person. Savage Tarzan is innocently sexy. When Jane slips into Holt’s lighted tent, Holt begins to watch her silhouette and changes into a fashionable dress. On the contrary, after Tarzan playfully stirs the dress, kicks her into the bathing hole and dives behind her, followed by the most sophisticated erotic nude scene in the whole cinema: the couple spends five minutes in the beautiful water ballet. filmed in three versions - dressed, topless and nude - the scene was cut before the movie was released, but the nude version was restored to the video that is now available.) And when Jane appears and the Cheetah chimpanzee steals her dress only for teasing, Jane makes it clear that her irritation is only due to the proximity of "civilized" men and their hangs. Where is “universal prudence” so dear to the hearts of seminarians? Nowhere, here is where. Another reason why the hanged men considered this film sinful. <br /> <br /> Item: the idea that man is the crown of creation, and the animals here are only for human use and comfort, endures severe beating. Holt and his buddy want to be sent to an "elephant cemetery" so that they can dig up ivory and take it home. They want Tarzan to take them to the indicated cemetery. You, the reader, think: “Exact chance!” And you are right. He is in shock. He exclaims "Elephants are sleeping!" which explains everything to him. Jane explains Tarzan’s feelings, which the two “gentlemen” find funny. <br /> <br /> Item: Jane, a former civilized woman, is much more inventive than the two civilized men she accompanies. Holt and a buddy blow it up and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals. This Jane keeps her calm. While the boys panic, she takes responsibility, barks at them and gives out rifles. <br /> <br /> Item: Jane's suit is something like a poncho with nothing in it. (The original idea was to have it topless, with foliage artistically blocking her nipples, which really takes place in one short scene.) <br /> <br /> Finally, several fabric people complained because the film was called "Tarzan and his assistant", and not "Tarzan and his wife." No comments! <br /> <br /> Of course, Tarzan, whom his monkey friends brought back to life, comes to the rescue, smashes the white hunters and prompts the elephants and African carriers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place where it came from. The end. <br /> <br /> So, here it is. Totally subversive film. As in all other films about complex and interesting women (see, for example, "Demons with Rita Hayworth" and Raymond Massey), who represented such a smooth genre in the early 30s and which were so unexpectedly completed with the adoption of the Hayes Code. <br /> <br /> “The joy of life” of this film is best expressed in the soprano version of Jane from the famous scream of Tarzan. A nice touch, which, unfortunately, was left in future productions. <br /> <br /> Let's listen to him for creative freedom, feminist Jane and sex.
