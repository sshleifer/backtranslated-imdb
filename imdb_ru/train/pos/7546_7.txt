At CAT SOUP, two kittens of the type "Hello Kitty" set off on a strange journey through the afterlife, where anything can happen, and does so. This astounding Asian short does not use dialogue, replacing tooltips instead. There is no way to describe this crazy cartoon, except to tell you to see it for yourself. And make sure that nobody in the room is under 10 years old. Dismemberment, cannibalism, cruelty, wildness, sudden death and heartless disregard for others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is an elephant, consisting of water, through which the kittens swim, and also ride on it. But, like almost everything else in this film, this stupid, fantastic interlude soon ends in a terrible end.
