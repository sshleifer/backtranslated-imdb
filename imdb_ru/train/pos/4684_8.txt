“Love at the Time of Money” by Petter Matthew is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattey offers us a vivid portrait of human relationships. This is a film that seems to tell us what money, power, and success do to people in the different situations we face. <br /> <br /> This is a variation of a play by Arthur Schnitzler about the same subject. The director takes the action now to New York, where all these different characters meet and connect. Each of them is somehow connected with the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world in which they live in their own habitat. <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be seen from all these souls in this picture is the different stages of solitude in which each of them dwells. A big city is not the best place where human relationships meet with sincere satisfaction, as you can see that this happens with most of the people we encounter. <br /> <br /> The game is good under the leadership of Mr. Matthew. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier and other talented actors - enliven these characters. <br /> <br /> We wish Mr. Matthew good luck and look forward to his next job.
