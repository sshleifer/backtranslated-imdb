I thought the Ice Age was a great movie! As a 30-year-old woman who has no children, I still like these humorous, witty animated films. Sid is the best character I've ever seen, better than Bartok in Anastasia (although he was really humorous, and I did not think that his character could be picked up or even defeated) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I saw the movie at least 15 times (I obviously have it), and I quote the movie at work (in many cases ... yes, still). My favorite scene is the part where Sid says, “Oh, oh, I love this game!” And Sid and Manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about “tigers” ... “A pack of wolves, a pack of bears, a pack flea, flock of whiskers, flock of noses, flock of derms? "Flock of lies, flock of troubles, flock of rabid, flock of birds, flock of flying fish ..." or whatever! This is the funniest part in the whole movie, although I also I liked the humor associated with "placing sloths on the map" and many other parts. The only animated film that can be remotely compared to "Glaciers th period "-" Brotherly Bear ".
