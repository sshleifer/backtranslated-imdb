The entertaining and informative film “Non-Stop” made a decent comparison with “Run, Lola, Run.” The film quickly turns into a sequence of pursuit, during which viewers learn about the three main characters through memories and dream episodes. The chase is not a precipitous climax, but a journey that makes up most of the film. During the “run,” we see the characters grow and for a moment forget about their dreary life, the “macho” roles they have acquired, and ultimately forget about why they started running from the very beginning. Just as the battle gave "clarity" to the characters of "Fight Club", running gives the heroes of this film the opportunity to move away from the false values ​​that we all allow society to create for us. Their run serves as a way to truly experience the taste of life from a cloudless point of view, and all three find some level of clarity and joy in this process. <br /> <br /> My appreciation and pleasure only hesitated slightly at the end of the film, where instead of learning from their own experiences, the characters seem to return to playing the macho mock roles that I thought were they fled through their journey. <br /> <br /> However, the only true problem with this film is that it was not distributed outside of Japan before.
