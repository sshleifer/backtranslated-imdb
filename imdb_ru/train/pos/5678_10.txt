We can still use the Black Adder even today. Imagine that Rowan Atkinson resumes the role of assistant prime minister, played by the wonderful Hugh Laurie. Hugh is sensational, like the brave Prince George, and Edmund, as his brilliant assistant. I like the episode that guest Kenneth Connor plays in the role of a British fan. Every time Edmund says Macbeth. Two thefts commit a silly little act to ward off evil spirits. These are the funniest things you will see. Of course, none of this brilliance and comedy genius could be without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, who also stand behind films such as Actually Love, Thin Blue Line, Four Weddings and Funeral. Black Adder is funny and almost too good for television. Humor can be smart, sexy and funny at the same time. Last night, Saturday night, I hoped that Hugh Laurie would pay homage to his past in British humor. If the SNL team did some research, they would know what a treasure it was when Hugh Laurie embellished their scene.
