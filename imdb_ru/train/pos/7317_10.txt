It was a movie I had heard about all my life, but I never saw it a few years ago. That reputation really kept it up. I knew about Michael Myers, saw the mask, saw the commercials for all the terrible sequels that followed. But I grew up for a decade when Jason and Freddie were deadly strong in a horror game and never thought of a Halloween franchise. The boy, as I cheat cheap scum. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a truly terrifying movie. Now, by today's standards, this is not so visual and intuitive, but this film shows all the other levels that most horror films today do not achieve. The atmosphere that John Carpenter creates is so terrible, and the fact that it is located in a strange city in the Midwest is a testament to his abilities. Lighting effects fall straight down terrifying, with "Shape" seemingly appearing and disappearing into the shadows at will. A simple but brutally effective musical score only adds to the tension. <br /> <br /> The performances of all the players are well done, with certain bows to Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Plesans. Miss Curtis is such a good Laurie Strode because she is so pretty and vulnerable. It’s all the more scary when Michael Myers pursues her, because the director and the audience have invested so much in her that we want her to survive and leave. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasant plays Dr. Loomis as a Man on a mission, and it works well. He adds a sense of urgency to the predicament that the city finds itself in, because he knows what evil their streets are. <br /> <br /> In general, Halloween is not only a great horror movie, but also a great movie. He works on many levels and attracts an audience and never gives up. This should be a standard viewing for those who want a truly scary movie. And for even more terrible time, try to watch it alone with the lights off. Do not be surprised if you think you see “The Shape” hiding in the shadows!
