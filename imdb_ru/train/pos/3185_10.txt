sweet story ........ voted ten against all averages for my age and gender ... not so much comedy (compared to the movie "I'm almost wet"), although quite funny. I'm not a fan of musicals at all, so maybe it's too much for me, but they give you time to drink or drink soda without missing anything important. maybe a version of the fifties, when Harry met Sally? Ahab, no, actually, but if it's in your top ten, like this is mine, you'll love this movie. in fact, it just leaves you with a warm, indistinct feeling, reminding you of what a novel can and should be, something that is worth shooting for. my resume describes it best in a few words ..... pretty adorable
