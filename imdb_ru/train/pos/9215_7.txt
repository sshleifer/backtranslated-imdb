What does the Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archeology and the cult of mermaid worship? Tobe Hooper is trying to answer this question in a strange little movie. <br /> <br /> Jeanne is a young cutie who visits her boring archaeologist father in Alexandria, Egypt. Jeanne catches a mysterious prostitute (and a brazen lesbian) who serves dad on the side. Pope is sent back to the place where he discovers the tomb with something like a mermaid on it. Jean meets a descendant of the Marquis de Sade and falls in love with a wild Egyptian (providing the hottest movie scenes). In the end, the Djinn learns that he must become a victim, and there will come a lingering and bloody climax. This story is wrapped by the Marquis de Sade's footage in prison, which tells about the portrait of Jean. <br /> <br /> Robert Englund is amazing both for the Marquis and his descendant. His acting skills have always been beaten by his makeup needs, so he is allowed to shine here. His best performance is still in Killer Tongue, if you haven't seen it yet. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, including the young Genie, is pretty and average. The script, however, is problematic. You will quickly realize that the Marquis' scenes are completely unnecessary, with the exception that the filmmakers had access to the classy set. The cult of the mermaid, who ultimately saves Gina, has no meaning. Who this mermaid was never explained, and her connection to Christianity (which is unwound throughout the entire film) is nothing. The film is very anti-Christian, as the archeologist is a biblical father, but he likes to be bound by a local prostitute. There are many scenes of debauchery and violence, but Hooper probably had no idea what the writers were trying to say. I know I have no idea. <br /> <br /> So why do I recommend this movie? This is strange. There is an extended sex scene. For women, Egyptian Egyptian rides a horse completely nude. Englund is amazing. Do you like snakes? This film is full of them. It's like Roger Korman with a big budget. Knowing that Hooper somehow invented the Crocodile, this is pretty sad. "Night horrors" are not perfect, but it is definitely worth a wink, not serious. <br /> <br /> This is a rating (R) for physical abuse, sexual abuse, blood, profanity, female nudity, male nudity, sexuality content, sexual references and drug abuse. <br /> <br />
