Andy says: “Nobody was hurt, everyone won.” Before he says it, we know that everything is the opposite: everyone is injured, no one is winning. This is a new thread in American films or perhaps an old thread that was eventually returned. Think "Eastern promises", "There will be blood", "There is no country for the elderly." These films are dark, serious, very well made and do not care about happy ends. I love them. “Before the devil finds out that you are dead” corresponds to the general description, but creates its own atmosphere. Kelly Masterson's debut screenplay is as close as a Hollywood film ever falls into a Greek tragedy. Paying tribute to fellow veteran director Stanley Donen, Sidney Lumet skillfully and soberly turns a dark story into an outstanding drama of old-school characters. The initial shots, although the fat accounting doggie stylized his trophy wife, resemble a picture of a Dutch master. On the contrary, the drug dealer's condo is more like a series of mondrian. Great performances. Only the character of Albert Finney Charles feels a bit overstretched, with wide eyes and mouth almost all the time. But then he finds himself in deep trouble, deeper than any of the troubles most of us will ever know. For compensation, Marisa Tomei is super hot. But, of course, I don't need you to tell you that. Why her heroine Gina would like to be with a guy like Andy, we were never told, but this is normal. In the end, action is character. The unique and magical touch of Carter Berwell’s music makes this beautiful film a masterpiece. Do not miss it.
