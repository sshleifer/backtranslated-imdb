In 1976, I just moved to the USA from Ceylon. I was 23 years old, I was married for just over three years and started acting like a lesbian. I saw this film on an old black and white TV, with a terrible reception, lonely and uninterrupted, in an awakening that seemed to echo history. I lived in a small house in Tucson, Arizona, and it was in the summer ... like everyone here, I never forgot the feelings that caused the images of this story and its remnants of fragile magic, and I treasured the hope that would see it again sometime. I will continue to register. I would also like someone to make a film about Shirley Werel, "on the other side of Venus." it also has some same weakness and constant sharpness ...
