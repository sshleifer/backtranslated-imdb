It was unexpected. The influence and resolution of this movie is in my automatic way to respond to people and situations. The excitement of anger emotion was most vivid. Very similar to the behavior of a spoiled child when he reacts to what he fails. . Tantrum, if you want. To think that I hide this anger from others was the most ridiculous farce of all. What did it cost me? Soooo much love. So many blessings. Now I imagine how incredibly humbly I feel and feel constant gratitude for life. .. for what is happening at the moment, without my wild expectations that life will be in a certain way, I think that life or people "should" be. This film contributed to the freedom that I now feel to communicate with others, without restrictions and expectations. and connect with real love. without fear of loss. , At first, just love and accept what is given to love.
