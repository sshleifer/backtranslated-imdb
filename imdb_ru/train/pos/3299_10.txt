Great movie requiring an acquired taste. If you are in action, making films and hating serious love stories, then this is not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a good intellectual film from time to time, I highly recommend it. Of course, the best movie made in Bollywood this century. <br /> <br /> The only other Indian film for which I would give 10/10 is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then it goes second to this masterpiece.
