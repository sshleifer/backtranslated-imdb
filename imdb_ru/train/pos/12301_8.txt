It's kind of crazy, but I recorded this German version of MGM "Anna Christie" and the English version of TCM ... but I first saw this because I heard that many thought it was better than the English version. <br /> <br /> Without seeing the other, I cannot compare them, but in any case it is a great early chatter, with Garbo's amazing performance. She looks very beautiful in this film, her face shines everywhere, especially when cameraman William Daniels shoots her gorgeous close-ups. <br /> <br /> The film’s atmosphere seems to be different from MGM’s usual work made at that time. It’s very similar to French or German expressionist films of the 1930s. The director of this film was the great French director Monsieur Jacques Fader, who shot Garbo in 1929 in the film “Kiss”. <br />> Theo Scholl is superb and gives an absolutely believable impression as Anna's sweetheart, a hard-boiled, tough sailor who is just a child in a human body. In addition, Hans Yunkermann plays very well, like the alcoholic father Anna and Salk Wiertel, as a kind-hearted old cheap joker. <br /> <br /> In general, this is quite an experience, because this is the only film where you can listen to Garbo speak a foreign language ... because all the other films she has shot in Sweden or Germany were during Silence. <br /> <br /> Serious movie.
