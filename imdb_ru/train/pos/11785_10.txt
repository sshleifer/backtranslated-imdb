I do not quite understand how to explain the “Darkand Room”, because if we summarize, it will not be fair. This is a typical Lynch short film with two beautiful girls in a strange, mysterious situation. I would say that this short film is definitely more related to the end of Mulholland's Lens in the spectrum of Lynch, rather than Elephant Man or Straight Story. It is hidden on the Lynch website and deserves a search.
