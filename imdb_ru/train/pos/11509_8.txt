This is a real shame that this additional series, inspired by the excellent television films “Night Stalker” and “Night Strangler”, lasted only one season and twenty episodes, because at its best this program offered an often winning and very interesting mixture of sharp cynical humor (energetic verbal sparring matches of Karl Kolchak with the ever-hot-tempered and long-suffering editor Tony Vincenzo always enjoyed to watch and hear), clever writing, graceful supernatural Threats (must love unusual and original creatures) in “Spanish moss killings”, “Sentinel” and “Horror on the heights”, plus you can't go wrong with such proven favorites as zombies, vampires, werewolves and witches), colorful characters, live a performance from a variety of cool guest stars (William Smith's legendary biker film got a rare chance to play a heroic role in "The Energy Eater", while other episodes featured such outstanding actors as Keenan Wynn, John Fiedler, John Denera, Severn Darden and Illyam Daniels in juicy roles), spectacular moments of genuine expectation (the climax in the sewage "Spanish moss killings", in particular, was truly painful), and, most pleasantly, the one and only Darren McGavin in peak piquant form, as bold, aggressive and excitable, but mostly decent, courageous and honest little Chicago, reporter of the Illinois newspaper Karl Kolchak. <br /> <br /> Kolchak was a typical protagonist of the 70s, a cunning and quick-witted guy with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and unsuccessful dexterity for getting into all kinds of trouble. Moreover, the sometimes awkward Kolchak was not at all superhuman; he usually either stumbled, or stumbled, fleeing from a mortal threat, but he had a certain inner strength and courage that allowed him to save the human race again and again from all sorts of deadly otherworldly enemies. Kolchak was surrounded by a handful of nice supporting characters: Simon Oakland was perfect as is chronically the evil boss Carl Tony Vincenzo, Jack Grinneydzh as a madman Ron Updike created for the perfect comic film, McDevitt, Ruth was simply delicious as sweet Miss Emily Coles and Carol Ann Susi was also very fun, like the passionate newcomer of the beaver Monique Marmelstein (who, alas, disappeared after appearing in only three episodes). Of course, the show suffered from dull make-up and special effects (the title lycanthropus in The Werewolf, unfortunately, reminds a Yorkshire terrier!), And in the last episodes there were some funny silly monsters (headless biker in Chopper, Katie). Lee Crosby in the role of Helen from Troy in “Youth Killer”), but even second-rate shows are redeemed with the brand name of the program’s maliciously sardonic wit and unlimited vitality and McGavin’s exciting presence.
