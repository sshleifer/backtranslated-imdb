Laurence Fishburn is a great actor, and deserves respect for trying this, but he is not in a class with great Shakespeare, such as Olivier and Wells; and he also suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irishman, always brilliant, simply removes the show. Olivier realized this potential in his production and threw Iago with someone whom he knew he could push into the background. I hardly realized the possibility of Iago, the most evil character of Shakespeare, but Brana shows us the depths. Nice to see the view of Venice too.
