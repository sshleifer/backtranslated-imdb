Well, I admit it - I'm stupid, and sometimes I love a really stupid comedy. While I have seen more films of Kurosawa, Bergman, and Truffaut than almost everyone on the planet, I still have a weak point for a befuddled comedy that does not try to be complex, but just funny. Several of these films, which immediately come to mind, are “MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL”, UHF, “START REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME”, “STRANGE BRY” and films of Bill and Ted. They all lack snobbery, but they may not like just a zombie or a professional film critic. <br /> <br /> Although BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is not as good as the original Bill and Ted movie, it's still a lot of fun. In addition, unlike the original, it really improves when re-viewing. I remember that I didn’t like the film the first time I saw it - perhaps because another film set such a high standard for laughter. But every time I see it again, I am amazed at all the wonderful moments - especially those involving the Grim Reaper. And by the way, this reaper is about as different from Bergman in the SEVENTH SEAL! In addition to a lot of laughter, there is great music in this film - in fact, it is better than the first film. The Kiss anthem is great at the end, but just like the rest of the hard rock tunes - provided that you are not an old killer like De Nomolos. Great viewing for kids and adults.
