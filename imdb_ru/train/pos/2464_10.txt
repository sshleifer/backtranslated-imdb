One of the best screenshots I've ever seen. We play a lot in church, and this is a resource that can be used as a resource that illuminates all the good things that actors can do in their work. I highly recommend this one, especially for those who are interested in acting, as "must see." There are several scenes to note. On the one hand, the cemetery scene, when Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows about this scene, just attending elementary school), and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done. The logic used in this scene was terrific - I believe that Shakespeare's testament is more than anything else. For a second, I really liked the scene where Hamlet, Horatio and the character played by Robin Williams were discussing the upcoming fight.
