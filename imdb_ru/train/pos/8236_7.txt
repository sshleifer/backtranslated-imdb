Because of the invention of the “collar of domestication,” zombies that feed on flesh are brought under control and become productive members of society; However, they perform the black task. The slave dead serve those who live in fenced small cities in the style of the United States in the 1950s, while wild zombies roam the “Wildlife Zone”. In the city of "Willard," the minor K'San Ray (as Timmy Robinson) lives with her parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker (as Helen and Bill Robinson). Alas, the Robinsons are the only family on their street that has no zombies; their new neighbors, Nizov, have six of them. Thus, to keep up, Robinsons get zombies Billy Connolly (like Fido). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mr. Connolly’s “Domestication Collar” is damaged by a walking old woman, and he eats it; then new and hungry zombies overrun the city. Meanwhile, the young Ray became attached to Connolly (the boy and his zombies are similar to the television Timmy and Lassie), and it is difficult for the Robinson family to cooperate with the Zomkom controlling authorities. <br /> <br /> Fido doesn’t go deep enough into its intriguing Wild Zone; But it is a colorful, stylish and fun satirical addition to the zombie film. Ray and the cast are performing well, individually; The most memorable pair is zombie Sonia Bennett (as Tammy) and owner Tim Blake Nelson (as Theopolis). Director Andrew Kerry and his team, including Rob Gray (design), Ian Kisser (photo), Don MacDonald (music) and James Willcock (design), deservedly won awards. <br /> <br /> ****** * Fido (2006) Andrew Kerry ~ K'Sen Ray, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker
