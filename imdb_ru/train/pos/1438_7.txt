Full marks for the translation of Pacinoâ€™s speech over the coffin of a dead child; Shakespeare's Mark Antony can be shamed !! <br /> <br /> Was it Paul Schrader or Ken Lipper who should be praised for the wonderful dialogue? They are rich, smart and worth your time if you like movies with good scripts. I found that the narrative is developing quite well down to the postscript behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more to tell in this movie; even John Cusack played better roles than this one. Interestingly, the film is very focused on men - women are just appendages.
