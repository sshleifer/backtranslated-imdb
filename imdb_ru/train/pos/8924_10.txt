This film is wonderful. What distinguishes it from other sci-fi 50s is the fact that the alien has no features, face, eyes, anything, but cannot be killed. I especially like the idea that this film will not occur for several days, it will occur in one night, presumably after midnight. It is also scary that as soon as the clot hits you, you cannot take it off. you are stuck in it, as it dissolves your flesh and slowly devours your body. My favorite science fiction film of the 50s, and what is sometimes considered the most significant. I understand why this Steve McQueen soared to fame. All this and the catchy theme of the song! How can you go wrong?
