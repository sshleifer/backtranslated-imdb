This is not “free”, but an exact, accurate remake of the classic 1983 “I Soliti Ignoti” monothellian song from “Toto”, “Mastroianni”, “Gassman”, “Cardinal”, etc., even in detail (for example, when the photographer steals the camera from the local market). <br /> <br /> I have watched the magnificent old version many times, and I knew all the gangs and endings by heart, but I still enjoyed “Welcome to Collinwood,” which has its freshness and atmosphere. It is interesting to see how the life and way of life of little thieves in Italy in the 1950s adapted to the United States of 2002. Things have not changed much. 8/10.
