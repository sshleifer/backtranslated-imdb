They shot this movie on Long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this film. Apparently, there is some kind of party where they all drink beer (I was told that it is colored water, it tastes disgusting, it is very difficult to swallow again and again, especially in funnel scenes). And yet, none of us had ever heard of a film being released anywhere in any form. He never went to the cinema (obviously), and, as far as I knew, was never released on video, and I am sure that it was not released on DVD. However, it seems that some people have seen it, although probably very few. So there must be something. I would really like to buy this for my brother, but I canâ€™t find it anywhere. Does anyone know anything about when / where / how you can buy this film? And in what format will it be?
