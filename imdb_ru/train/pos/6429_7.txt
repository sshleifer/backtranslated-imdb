If you believe the films, the Chinese ghosts are much more beautiful and harmful than their Western counterparts. The plot lines of the three Chinese Ghost films are largely identical, but the direction is excellent, and the details and color are such that it is not a big problem. As always, humor is an integral part of the film, accompanied, of course, by a large number of robberies. For those who have not yet encountered the Chinese GhostStory trilogy, this film offers an interesting departure from the western horror / ghost genre; for those who have, another nice romp in the ghost world of China.
