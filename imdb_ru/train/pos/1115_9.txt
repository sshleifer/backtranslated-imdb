This is one of those unfortunate films that suffered from an even more sad, miserable death at the box office. I saw this film in a local art cinema, in a revived form, shortly after it was released in regular theaters. It certainly deserves to be approached a second time (or even a third time). Sandra B. brings it to the limit by uttering spoken words and performing some famous songs in this play (her version of Hank William's “I'm So Lonely, I Could Cry” can easily make you cry). Perhaps someday the audience will be ready to take this film more seriously (but not without a good laugh too). The film is moving at a fast pace (thanks to good editing), so some viewers will not find it callous and boring. Perhaps the awakening is just beginning.
