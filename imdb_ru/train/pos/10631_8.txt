This film was watched by my wife and I when it was released in 1978. This was a revelation to us. We really thought we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever been married and had children. Obviously, we were wrong. Love can come from where you do not expect it and may not want it. But we still chose this love. <br /> <br /> And no, she never changed our sexual orientation. This kind of thing is meant for Christian jerks. <br /> <br /> When we were young, we both had business, but never had the opposite sex. With age, extramarital relations have ceased. <br /> <br /> This story is just around the corner. Nevertheless, the assumption that they became heterosexuals seems to me rather unreal. My wife and I have been sleeping together for the last 40 years. We are still gay. The end of the story.
