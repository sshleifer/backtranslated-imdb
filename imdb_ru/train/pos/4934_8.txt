Panic in the Streets is a rather obscure little film by director Elia Kazan, shot before his classic masterpieces, such as A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Embankment and To the East of Paradise. Kazan already received an Oscar in 1947, before this film, so it was not completely unknown at that time. However, “Panic in the Streets” is basically a movie that went under the radar. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this film is the Oscar script. It has a very good concept and its excellent tense thriller material with the smell of the elements of crime / film noir. The dialogue in this film is also absolutely magnificent and gives the film a sense of reality and likelihood. <br /> <br /> The cast is rather unknown (especially at the time of its release), but Zero Mostel and Jack Palance are still present in one of their first film roles. Palans is especially impressive as a tough gangster boss with a very powerful face. <br /> <br /> However, the film is sometimes a bit slow. The film starts very well, but after the start the film slows down and does not always make the right decisions in terms of tempo and the point of view from which the story is told. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, “Panic in the Streets” remains a completely watchable movie, mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialogue that makes the film believable. For fans of the genre, the thriller is a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
