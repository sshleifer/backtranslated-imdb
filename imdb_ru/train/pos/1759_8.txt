I'm not quite sure if the term “serious comedy” refers to this film, I'm not even sure if this can be applied. In the past few years, cinemas have been filled with comedy films that are too stupid to make us smile. Therefore, I considered films that did not meet these requirements as "serious comedies." <br /> <br /> Does the 40-year-old Virgo enter this guild? It's finally up to you, but in my opinion, this is a very funny movie. You can laugh a lot, plus it gives a social comment through some really great characters and situations. <br /> <br /> I’m pretty, there’s more than one 40-year-old virgin, and even people who don’t quite meet these specifications may have been recognized by one of the characters in the film, especially the men. <br /> <br /> The story, as the name implies, tells of Andy, the shy, silent guy who collects the figures, is watched by Survivor with his eighty-year-old neighbors, whose favorite band is Asia. <br /> <br /> Cal is Andy's employee at SmartTech. He believes that Andy is a psychopath until Andy’s secret is revealed. Cal is obviously a sexy pervert, but, nevertheless, he seems to get what he wants in the opposite genre. <br /> <br /> David is a passionate guy who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend who ran off with another guy, And Jay, a man in a relationship who seems to be influenced by his constant deception and deft actions. <br /> <br /> I’m pretty sure that most young people between the ages of 13 and 21 have already watched this movie, but it really has no age limit to be able to enjoy it. So, if you haven’t seen it yet and you’ll enjoy a little social commentary, then go to your video store and take a break from these deep and depressing independent films. <br /> <br /> It also includes DVD bonuses that you’ll actually see from top to bottom.
