This is a fun video in which everything else <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy seems very disappointing (even “Beverly Hills Cop” and “Nutty Professor”, which show how good it is). Honestly, I don’t think that I’ve ever <br /> <br /> laughed at something the same, including the Naked Gun and the rarely seen Barjars. This show is amazing, although I must say that it is certainly filled with a word starting with F, four letters long (plus its extended version starting with M), but that did not bother me. You see, the funniest thing I've ever seen, and perhaps the funniest thing you've ever had.
