Gentleman Jim is another example of the seal of a legend: Errol Flynn plays the legendary boxer as a daring but charismatic social climber in exciting entertainment that barely stops for breathing. It’s just as senseless to look for historical authenticity, as in the Flynn film “Light Brigade Charge” is a pure hockum with all the stops pulled out, shot on a surprisingly generous scale and having a real Raul Walsh direction. Flynn is still at the peak of his abilities (you will never guess that he suffered a mild heart attack during the production), with Alexis Smith, the perfect romantic sparring partner and everlasting assistant Alan Hale, and this time as Father Flynn this time Jack Carson performs the duties of an assistant). Indeed, even the pirate galleon from Flynn’s earlier films makes a somewhat out of place cameo in a battle on the dock! 103 minutes just go by.
