Since I first saw this in the theater, he has become my favorite. Since then I have seen it countless times, and I never get tired of it. The situation is largely related to this (I know that Colorado will be jealous), but the storyline is original, and I liked how it used the mountain dwellers of a small city as heroes. There was no movie, I can also compare it. John Lithgow plays an intelligent villain, but I like the fact that he is completely insane: he has to follow Tucker, and that makes him interesting. This is a thriller at the BEST. I do not think I will see another one that is so interesting. <br /> <br /> You do not need to lay off 50,000 rounds to become a fighter. It just has to keep you captive, not shocked.
