Eleven different filmmakers from different parts of the world gathered in this film to present their views and ideas about the attack on the WTC. This is one of the best efforts you will see in any movie. Such films are rarely made and appreciated. This film attempts to affect all possible WTC cores Here are some of the most important stories from the film that make this film so unique. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran), where somewhere in Iran people are preparing for attacks from America. There, the teacher tries to educate his students by informing them of innocent people killed during the WTC massacre. This is followed by a story from Yusef Chein (Egypt), in which the cinematographer comes face to face with a dead soldier during an attack on the WTC and a dead cruel terrorist who was implicated in the attack on the WTC. Then we see a story from Idrissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso), where a group of children from five innocent people see Osama bin Laden and plans to kidnap him and win prize money from America. Then we see a story from Alejandro Gozales Inarrito (Mexico), where you see a black screen and slowly you see real footage of the ITC buildings. And people who are stuck in a building jump out of it to save their lives. Another most important story is from the World of Nair (India), where the mother struggles to gain respect for her Dead Son, whose name is falsely caught in the WTC! After the attack of September 11, our heartbeat automatically begins to beat if we hear two names anywhere in the world. The first is the World Trade Center, and the second is Osama! This film completely changes our perception and emphasizes that it requires something more. <br /> <br /> I will definitely recommend this film to anyone who loves such home DVD-collections. Definitely worth every penny you spend. But please do not expect anything more than the movies on this DVD. There are, of course, the film makers of the film, but no additional features.
