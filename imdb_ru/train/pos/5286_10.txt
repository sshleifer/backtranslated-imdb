Part of what was so great in the classic Looney Tunes cartoons was their disrespect and the way they were not afraid to do everything they wanted. In this case, the Marvin-Martian entrusted to return the earthling. Of course, he faces Bugs Bunny, who warns of rebellion by Marvin's dog. After Marvin finally catches Bugs - with a bazooka throwing a jacket out of the Acme strait! “Zhukov has something else planned to travel back to Mars.” I mean, if you thought it was a serious change in the solar system, when they deprived Pluto of the status of its planet, then you have not seen anything! Yes, "Hasty Bunny" is struggling. The way they buy Acme products in outer space is probably inaccessible to most people, but the point here — I mean the hare — is to enjoy it. And trust me, you definitely will. In the end, a small space never hurts anyone.
