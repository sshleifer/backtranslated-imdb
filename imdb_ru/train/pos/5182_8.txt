A quiet, sweet and nostalgic film about how old friends and surroundings from your youth face you, with all these memories, problems and sorrows of the present with you. The film that makes you feel good. All the ingredients here are old jealousy, rivalry, friendship and loyalty. Brad, night raids on the fridge and everything else that we all remember from our summer camps. All characters have the opportunity to test it again within a week, since the old camp leader is now retiring and wants to meet with the children from the golden years of the camp. All of them are now over thirty, and they have a career.
