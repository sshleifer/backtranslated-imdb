Looking back at the last 28 years (since my first participation in the show), all I can say is: once you get it, it will stay with you forever. I remember my initial reaction: 1) I was annoyingly overzealous, 2) was incomplete 3) incredible characters <br /> <br /> Well, after two years I looked at several episodes again and did not find it so annoying. A year later, I was able to catch the whole series from the very beginning and quickly plunged into its bitter-sweet story about human wine and views on happiness. Yes, the show has a style that is not for everyone, and I am sure that it would be difficult to deal with outdated production value now. But I still think about the show at least once a month with vague tears craving for what seemed like a simpler time ... <br /> <br /> By the way, I'm a married man ... this show is for women)
