Well, I'm from Bulgaria, where a tornado is almost impossible, but my imagination tells me that I am very, very afraid! This guy (Devon Sawa) did a great job with this movie! I don’t know exactly how old he is, but he didn’t behave like a child (WELL DONE)! Now about the tornado - it was not very realistic, but it scares you! this is a movie!
