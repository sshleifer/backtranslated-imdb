The Danes character finally gave Buddy the awful truth. “Leave me alone, kiss the men if you want,” she shouts smugly in front of everyone, thereby destroying the man who loved her for so long. Cute girl. This may be the place to revisit all of the ridiculous charm that Danes puts into this character. An excellent reason to feel sympathy for the fact that she lies in bed and dies, but, hey, remember, there are no mistakes, except, perhaps, watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Wait a minute. This irony is intended! This is actually a masterpiece of ironic wit, yes! But for some reason I doubt that this is what the creators of this film had in mind, unfortunately. Perhaps in the end, there are a few mistakes.
