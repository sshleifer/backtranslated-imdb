Personally, I think that the film was made very professionally, I liked the choreography and acting skills. The plot is also exciting and mysterious. The film itself is very emotional, and what I liked most about it is that it makes you think later. Antonio Hades lived his role to the end, and I must say that this is one of my favorite pictures, and Saura is a wonderful director.
