In the book "The Citadel" in the film "Films about Gene Kelly" "Anchors of Avey" is described as the main role of the musical. I am sure that I can not do better than this. This is such an important film in both the career of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Catherine Grayson, too, was not too worried about this. <br /> <br /> Louis B. Meyer borrowed Gene Kelly to Colombia, where Harry Cohn got inspired to put his own numbers and because of this, Cover Girl became a classic. So, if Mayer did not learn the lesson, producer Joe Pasternak made and allowed Kelly artistic control. When Anchors Aweigh was finished, Fred Astaire finally had a dancing rival for the monarch of cinematic dance. <br /> <br /> The main number that everyone is talking to with Gene Kelly is the dance with Jerry Mouse. Kelly originally wanted to do a Walt Disney Mickey Mouse number, but Disney did not betray Mickey to anyone. Mickey will have to wait until someone framed Roger's rabbit to make a movie on the street. Do not worry, because MGM had its own animated rodent, half consisting of a team of Tom and Jerry. <br /> <br /> Kelly, as a dancer, was always eager to do something new and unusual on the screen, as Fred Astaire did. Over the next dozen years, the two were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work, even if the films themselves were not shocked. As if each inspired the other for more and better creativity, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM and any number of other studios. In Anchors Aweigh, Kelly made Sinatra dance a little. In fact, Frank Sinatra always paid tribute to Gene Kelly for showing him how musicals should be made, as he thanked Bert Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for their help in earning him - “Oscar for here”. <br /> <br /> When Frank Sinatra bought half of his contract from RKO MGM, he insisted on a little artistic creation on his own. He became friends with the team of songwriters Joel Stein and Sammy Kahn. In his autobiography, Sammy Kahn talks about how Sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film. Louis B. Meyer gave up and the team wrote some really good ballads for him to sing. One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchor Aweigh, I Fall in Love Too Easy. Frank sings, accompanying himself on the piano in an empty Hollywood bowl. This is Sinatra at its best. <br /> <br /> With Julie Stein, and then with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Kahn deservedly won the title for putting more lyrics into Frank Sinatra's lyrics than anyone else. They were lifelong friends, and Kahn always believed Sinatra in this important step in his career. <br /> <br /> At the bet, Stein and Kahn said they could write a song using only the chromatic scale. They proved it in Anchors Aweigh when Catherine Grayson soprano staged to work on Suddenly Sings My Heart. She also made some classic numbers. <br /> <br /> Here, singing is actually the basis of the plot. Two sailors on vacation meet, by coincidence, with Catherine Grayson and her orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell. Trying to connect her with Sinatra, Kelly says that he can arrange her audition with Jose Iturbi. They spend the film trying to achieve this. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment at Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton, who plays the Brooklyn waitress, herself did not get the number. She received rave reviews about her work as Meg Brokie in Brigadoon on Broadway, and this is what led her to Hollywood. I have a suspicion that she had a number that was cut, and somewhere in the MGM vaults it could still be. <br /> <br /> Aweigh Anchors are a great example of why musicals are no longer created. All this creative talent was concluded with Metro-Goldwyn-Meier. If you had to pay the market value for it, these costs could write off the debt of some third world country. <br /> <br /> But the results of the film would be extraordinary.
