Time is the future, and for many who do not know about it, this day has come. In this final film for legendary actor Edward G. Robinson, “Solent Green” becomes a landmark classic. Many film lovers and environmentalists believe that this is our possible story. The film is taken from a novel titled “Free Place, Free Place”, but the name of the workplace has been changed to “Solent Green.” History concerns the Earth, which is evolving into the future, and the environmental problems in the world are becoming nothing more than a catastrophe. The natural resources of the planet are depleted, and the main food is turned into simple food. They come in a variety of colors, such as Solent Yellow, Solent Red, and now Solent Green. However, there are those who know the "real" ingredient in Solent Green and are afraid of their own guilt and fear divine retribution. The first is the head of the food department named William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). After his death, a dedicated police detective named Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston) seeks the truth in his apparent suicide. Although corruption reaches the top, it starts with Simonson's Bodyguard, Ted Fielding (Chuck Connors) and Donnovan's security chief (Roy Jenson), who aim Thorn at the waste disposal factory. Thorn's boss, Lieutenant Hatcher (Brock Peters) believes in his suspicions, but warns him about those “Higher and hot” who want the case closed, but Thorn will not risk his “work” for the sake of an easy exit. What Thorn discovers means his death, but, like the film, the last warning awaits him. ****
