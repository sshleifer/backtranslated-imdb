This is one of the funniest and greatest movies ever made! Although I only saw forty minutes, and I must say that this is a good film. The plot is funny because there is sex in every corner of the film. It's really fun, and I don't understand how someone might not like this movie. I really really want to watch the rest of the movie. There is one slightly sick scene in it (believe me, this is not very pleasant), but other than that it is a great movie. I rate this movie 7/8 for comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for plotting. PLEASE, if you are an American pie fan and want to watch a movie in which almost all sex, buy this movie. This will please you. <br /> <br /> 10/10
