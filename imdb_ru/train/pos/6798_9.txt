(No spoilers, only plot details) I cannot understand such hatred for this episode. Do you want to watch a bad episode of Smallville? Watch Underground - now there is a bag of shit. Tom Welling performs well (I donâ€™t say that often), and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but most of the time he plays. The alternate universe scenario seems frighteningly realistic. Martian Manhunter, who had previously appeared in Static, returns and tells Clark that the doctor who is the head of the psychiatric hospital where they are held is actually a phantom from the phantom zone, and if Clark wants to return the Universe, he must kill him . In general, an excellent episode, with a good acting game and a decent pace.
