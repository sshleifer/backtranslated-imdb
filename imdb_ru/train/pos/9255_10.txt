If you need a cheerful romp with a lot of subtle humor, then you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> I don’t understand why nobody would like this movie. Take it for what it is: transport for Dennis Hopper, who will fight with your head and make you laugh. This is not Shakespeare, but it is well done. Erika Eleniak is absolutely beautiful, and in this she holds herself better than any episode of Baywatch, and demonstrates a knack for subtle humor. It is a pity that she did not have many opportunities to expand this. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenguer is perfect for his role in the “real fleet”, and William McNamara does an excellent job with his duties. <br /> <br /> Take a walk with Hopper in the middle of the chase for “Cherry on this ice cream” and you will get a film that caught my attention and made me laugh. I bought this one as soon as it was available. <br /> <br /> Brain candy.
