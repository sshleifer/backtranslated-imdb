This was definitely the case with the Angels in the outfield. It was on TV last night, and I believe that I have not seen this film since the second year of high school, and now I am in the fourth year. Although the film has many flaws, it is so touching that you can't help but sit down, watch it and enjoy. It is also fun. Danny Glover's conversations are just so exaggerated that you can't help laughing at him loudly in most cases. This adds to the film, and I'm sure that this is exactly what the director wanted. You actually feel for the characters in the film, although the development is not the best. Must see. I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8/10
