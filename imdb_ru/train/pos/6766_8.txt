Perhaps the most exciting and clever of the scam movies - Otto Preminger’s “Where the Sidewalks Come Out” from Ben Hecht’s really excellent screenplay from Frank Rosenberg’s Night Creek ... <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is honest, hard new York policeman, always in trouble with his superiors, because he loves his own strong hand techniques as he hates scammers ... When he hits someone, his joints hurt ... And the person he wants is be a smooth villain (Gary Merrill) who points to the title. “Why are you always trying to push me into a ditch?” He asks Andrews. "I have as many rights on the sidewalk as you have." <br /> <br /> Dana Andrew’s obsession and neurosis lies in his hidden, painful discovery that he is the son of a thief ... His deep hatred for criminals forced him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them, and the pursuit of justice turned out to be spoiled in a private vendetta ... <br /> <br /> Ironically, unique to the film itself, Dana Andrews and Jean Tierney from Laura come together again, and Andrews seems to be playing the same detective some years later , but no longer a romantic, tormented by his work, cheap scammers ... This time he went too far, and accidentally kills a suspect ... Murder is random, the victim is worth nothing, but this is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to prison ... <br /> <br /> Using his knowledge of police procedures He hides his involvement in a crime, throws false evidence and tries to attract the leader of the gang, but cannot avoid investigating the case itself ... Double tension to bring the case to the end without involving himself in the murder, well supported and final resh The idea is both logical, satisfactory and in no case a compromise ... <br /> <br /> The film is one of the best detective films of the 50s, with curious moral values, as well as one of the best Preminger ... <br /> <br /> Preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique, projecting the pretentious camera angles and the unusual touch of a strange person to bring him out of his expectation in realism ...
