I loved "Dan in real life." A wonderful story about a journey to love, such as “You received mail” or “While you slept”, but not ridiculously full of jokes and rude jokes, and not so romantic that it makes you vomit. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Stephen Carrell) is a popular tipster who doesn't seem to be able to fix things in his life. Until, one day, at a family gathering / journey, he does not meet and instantly associate with Maria (always beautiful Juliette Binoche) a shining sample of a woman who seems to be created in a hazy filter going back to the stars of classic cinema. Chemistry happens over a cup of tea and muffins, but Marie has to go off to the previous engagement, and they have to part. <br /> <br /> Later, Dan’s friendly, friendly relatives come to us, who not only have breakfast together, but also love to use the clever and sweet-saucy Dan as a joke for many boyish jokes. What I really liked was that, despite the fact that the characteristics of the family might have seemed unpleasant to someone, I thought that this is a great image of a large family that does not risk parodying or grossly exaggerating. The Burns family is just a close, loving group of people who are really interested in the best for Dan. There are surprisingly awkward family moments that are not unreal. The family is curious, but never despicable or gossiping; Quaint, but never outlandish. <br /> <br /> And then Dan falls in love with his brother's girlfriend, whom he brought to the family gathering. And so begins the roller coaster of low-key angst and amusing budding. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I just thought this movie was just awesome. It is not particularly "fashionable" or "smart", never too verbose and obsessed with dry humor or a sharp mind, like many comedies in modern cinema. There is a good balance of narrative visual effects and a funny but real dialogue. in fact, at the beginning of the film, the spark of love begins with a bizarre discussion in a classic Hollywood-style conversation, where the characters say what they think out loud. <br /> <br /> So I must have wandered and repeated, but I highly recommend "Dan in real life." This is a great movie about dating, believe me, you will laugh, and only if you are such a jerk like me, you will have tears in your eyes. "Dan in real life," filled with fun and magical love, will not disappoint. <br /> <br /> =================== 3.5 out of 4 stars Excellent rating
