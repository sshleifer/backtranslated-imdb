CitizenX (1995) - the answer of the developing world to the Silence of the Lambs. Where “Silence” terrorized our peace of mind, “Citizen” instead exhausts and grieves us. This dramatization of the Chikatilo case is broadcast quite well, thanks to the pro-Western friendship between the two Rostov cops, who are becoming equal. <br /> <br /> CitizenX can also oppose (!) the death penalty much better than Kevin Spacey’s “Life”. David Gayle (2002). <br /> <br /> Humans are Mahevellian mammals, under which limbic brains lie (lizard logic). Why did the two children, who knew better, stoned the child they kidnapped? Why do bloodthirsty women shout "li-lilililililii" at acts of irreconcilable terrorism? “My own term for this is“ limbic domination, ”the lizard's desire to dominate the“ enemy. ” If the words "enemy" / "revenge" are in your vocabulary, you are easily capable of "limbic domination." <br /> <br /> In Rostov, which was destroyed during the Second World War (located at the mouth of the Don River) near the Black Sea, nothing suppressed Andrei Chikatilo’s desire for "limbic domination" from the suppression of his layers of civilization. The easy victims of Chikatilo (Jeffrey Demanna) were the poor, usually children, who rode the intercity train for fun, because they could not afford anything else. <br /> <br /> CitizenX reminds us that the bureaucracy has claimed the lives of 52 such "lambs" to refute the rampant Soviet Union. Rostov’s serial killer has been at large for almost 7 years AFTER the police arrested and released him. <br /> <br /> The politicization of the fight against crime is bad for all policemen. Although the police usually suffer from corruption all over the world, in the west, political seizure can lead to chronic inter-agency competition, hindering a more coordinated response to crime. However, in the Soviet Union, CitizenX, the department of murderers of Viktor Burakov (Stephen Rea), suffered from repressive bureaucracy. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Demann plays psychosexually inadequate Chikatilo with impeccable, but understated power - before the point of complete obscurity. In real life, Chikatilo had a life experience that merged and evaded capture. <br /> <br /> His pursuer, on the other hand, stands out as a strange bird transmitted by reckless naive explosions. Perhaps, according to the plan, Stephen Rea gives a very strange idea as the chief criminalist of Burakov. Ria’s Russian accent is impenetrable; and his Burakov is ruthless and sullen, not at odds with everyone. <br /> <br /> So Donald Sutherland leaves with this picture. Colonel Sutherland Fetisov, the head of Burakov and at first his only supporter, is an overly restrained, patient policeman whose worthy coach is evidence of decades of bureaucratic fraud. His awakening as a logical-oriented, but still passionate policeman becomes the cornerstone idealism of the film. <br /> <br /> Joss Ackland makes another twist in the role of a vicious apparatchik, secretary of the communist ideology Bondarchuk, who oversees the investigation. Naturally, he canceled the arrest of the most likely suspect, a communist, in 1984, with a man carrying a rope and a knife in his bag, supposedly going home: Andrei Chikatilo. <br /> <br /> Soon he replaced Burakov with another Moscow apparatchik, detective Gorbunov (John Wood), insisting that the investigation is now focused on "well-known homosexuals." The most ridiculous scene of this sad, sad film takes place during the legalized harassment of Bondarchuk and Gorbunov: one stupid policeman sincerely reports: “As I suspected, comrade, this is fornication. I made several drawings - cue howling laughter. <br /> <br /> 5 years after the bodies began to accumulate, in 1987 the police finally tried to get information about criminal authorities. The only collaborating Soviet psychiatrist was Dr. Alexander Bukhanovsky (Max Von Sydow), who called UNSUB "CitizenX". Later, he also noticed Fetisov and Burakov, that "... together you become a wonderful person." We agree. <br /> <br /> The protracted pace of the decade perfectly reflects the institutional inertia of publicity - “openness” - this did not happen. The contrast with restructuring - “restructuring” - could not be more significant for this case. Although Chikatilo was still roaming the railway stations, police plans were going to bear fruit. <br /> <br /> In 1990, Colonel Fetisov was quickly promoted to general. His sworn enemy Bondarchuk disappeared from the scene, which finally allowed him to continue the investigation without political interference. Staff, communication, advertising - suddenly everything became available. In just one night of a telephone conversation, Fetisov got his forensic investigator depressed at the FBI's serial murder task force in Quantico, where, as Fetisov discovered, officers regularly withdraw from serial murders to prevent such psychological damage to investigators. Fetisov informs his newly appointed forensic expert, now Colonel Burakov, about all these changes in the avalanche of confession, which becomes the main scene of the film. Fetisov is the most gentle apology I have ever seen in the film: “In private, I offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife. I hope that someday you will be able to forgive me for my ignorance, ”he almost whispers. <br /> <br /> CitroenX is a top quality movie shot on HBO. Not only do the exteriors look truly grim (filmed exclusively in the most dilapidated parts of the otherwise impressive Budapest), but Randy Edelman’s soaring soundtrack is absolutely stunning - and often our only respite from grim cruelty. Hungarian speakers recognize many Hungarian accents and credits. <br /> <br /> The actual murders of Chikatilo are depicted as a dark, aberrant behavior, generated by character flaws and ignorance in an equally grim world. This makes the killings not entirely inappropriate, but, of course, they were. As President Kennedy reminded us, “we all value the future of our children.” <br /> <br /> CitizenX understands perfectly well that killing is much more awful and indecent than any fantasy of revenge. Serial rapists rape to dominate; serial killers kill to dominate. Like some soldiers. Such "limbic dominators" make poor people. <br /> <br /> WARNING-SPOILER: ----------------------------- --------- --------- The real Andrei Chikatilo was the most prolific serial killer in the world. Convicted, he was executed in 1992 in accordance with all the death sentences of the Soviet Union: one shot in the back of the head. Foolishly such methods destroy any possibility of studying the deviant brain after death. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: ------------------------- --------------- -------------------- The best result is always the prevention of murders, and not their pursuit. Executions only guarantee the inability of society to learn from the difficult reality of the death of the victims, when we send even unconfirmed evidence of how / why they died. And the killers don't learn to regret if they are dead. <br /> <br /> Revenge does not kill the victims. Striving for the blood of a murderer is nothing more than opposition — as soon as it gets too late. <br /> <br /> Revenge for the grieving is not the justice of the deceased, but the pacification of the living. / ten)
