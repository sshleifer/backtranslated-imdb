The jokes are obvious, the jokes are commonplace, and the characters are walking characters, but I could not help laughing at his very interesting film. No matter how many times I see it, I still enjoy it, and I recommend it to all lovers of thoughtless entertainment. It contains many quotes and some of the best jokes that I have seen to this day. If you had a bad week and you need a little laugh, rent it on your way home on Friday night to give you a good start.
