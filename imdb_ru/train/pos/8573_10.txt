In 1996, “101 Dalmatians” Cruella De Ville was arrested by the London Underground police (God bless them) for trying to steal and kill 101 Dalmatian puppies. All covered with mud and hay, she spent the next 4 years in a “tin can”. Now, 4 years later, she, unfortunately, was released from prison. I say it's about 28 years old - in dog years !!!!! <br /> <br /> So in 2000, Disney decided to release a continuation of the successful version of the classic film live, and it was dubbed “102 Dalmatians”. It has the 102nd Dalmatian added to the family (I think that is the name Oddball; I should know this since it was recently shown on television), and the puppy had no blemishes !!!!! In addition, although Cruella (played by Glenn Close again) ran away again, she wanted a bigger, better coat — once more made of puppies !!!!! <br /> <br /> I especially liked the theme of the song - I’m sure everyone likes the song "Atomic Dog" from the 70s or so. And now, we hear a little about it in this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> “102 Dalmatians” is such a wonderful film that I continue to be surprised - WHEN WILL BE “103 DALMATINS ??? ???” LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
