At first I doubted this film (simply because of the subject), but the richly drawn characters, the incredible scenes of bison hunting and the dramatic conclusion make it worth seeing. At first I had problems with the difference between the two buffalo hunters, but as the film developed, they became more and more different. I'm still chasing the final scene.
