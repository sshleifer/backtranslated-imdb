Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo, the Ripper of Rostov, who for 8 years killed 52 people, mostly women and children. This shows how the consequence was made difficult by the Soviet bureaucracy, how difficult it was to investigate crimes. He does the work so brilliantly that he will not leave anyone indifferent. In the beginning, this may be a bit of a slow pace, but it really captures you when the story unfolds. I can only say that, next to The Silence of the Lambs, this is by far the best movie about a serial killer I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> In this film, it is difficult to say which of the actorâ€™s actions stands out from the rest. Stephen Rea is really great as an inexperienced forensic expert tasked with investigating. The work of Donald Sutherland as his cynical leader and the only person in the Russian government who is ready to help him is as outstanding as that of Ria. And what about Jeffrey Dumann playing the serial killer? DuMann brilliantly created a character who evokes sympathy, not hatred. Yes, he is a monster, but he is also a sad figure, oppressed and ridiculed by his wife, his boss, his colleagues ... He is tortured, ashamed, and also extremely angry. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend this film to anyone who is interested in a well-made documentary drama, where the actors are still more important than special effects. It deserves at least 9/10, perhaps even more if you ask me.
