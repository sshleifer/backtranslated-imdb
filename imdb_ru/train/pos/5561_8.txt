Well, needless to say, this film will only attract a certain audience; namely stoners and like-minded people. <br /> <br /> As the saying goes, if you are one of the aforementioned people, this film is OBLIGED. In fact, I think that head shops should sell a copy of this copy to everyone who buys their first bong. That Monty Python's Holy Grail is for fans and nerds, just like this film is for talkers. I first watched this movie 10 years ago or so, and I still lose whenever I watch it. These jokes are perfect for role-playing, much better than in recent days, such as the Half-Baked attempt. <br /> <br /> So to say, there is no plot; the film is more a collection of various scenes; as the main characters of the films roam Los Angeles in their legendary haze. Despite this, the film has a great sense of tempo, and it does not pull at all. Many people consider "The Best C & C Work" "Up In Smoke", but I have to say that Next Movie is superior. <br /> <br /> So if you are set up for an hour or half of laughter, ignite, tune in, and let your mind float away =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and FREE TOMMY CHONG!
