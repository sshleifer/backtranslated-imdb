An excellent, funny, cute film with Morgan Freeman (who plays himself) and who meets a Spanish girl named Scarlet (Paz Vega) in a small shop while exploring a potential independent film. The first ten minutes I had a little doubt in the film, but as soon as he was in the store, I really began to enjoy the movie. It shows how a positive attitude can change anything. It does not contain any complex plots, it is easy to follow, but it will lift the saddest moods and make you smile to the very end without the need for a petty cliche. It includes several scenes that make you laugh at your sides. Very rare masterpiece!
