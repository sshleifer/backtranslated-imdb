First of all, do NOT call it a remake of 63 years old. Although this version is more truthful for the stage play, it is extremely long. Casting was good with some exceptions. China Phillips was not a good choice for casting. She was almost 30 when she made this film, and it was hard to believe that she was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while my head hurt. Tyne Daly replays his role as May Peterson. George Wendt was funny, like Harry McAffie, and showed that he can hold a tune. Like the film of the 63rd year, they played the unknown, who played Conrad Birdie. Mark Kudish had fun with his role as Birdie, and it showed. I even have a soundtrack, and I love listening to his singing. So what led to the failure of TV ratings? It was a long time for one. They insert new songs and scenes. Although some of the new songs were good (for example, "Let's Settle Down"), was it really necessary? Now do not misunderstand me, I liked it, but I rather watch the film for 63 years (see My Review). It was a case when some actors overdone in roles, made some changes and again in LENGTH. Another thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. She copes well with the role and music. Give her any lyrics, and she can sing them. So, here is my advice from someone who starred in several productions of “Bye, Bye, Birdie”: if you want to watch an entertaining movie, watch the movie for 63 years. If you want to see a more believable version, look at version 95 of the year. Just take it in moderation. Do not be a hero and try to see everything in one sitting.
