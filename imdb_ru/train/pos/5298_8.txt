John Waters gave us a really nice movie. This, of course, is not without his shocking moments in the spirit of Waters, but it is more meeker than his older religious items, such as the Pink Flamingos. Pecker returns to Johnâ€™s early mainstream scene because he reminds the viewer of the same type of humor that was evident in Polyester. All in all, a really funny comedy with great moments!
