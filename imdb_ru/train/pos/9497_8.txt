Absolutely fantastic trash ... there is everything: nudity, good fighting scenes, blood, action, explosions, etc. He also plays the wonderful Belinda Maine as Ingrid, not Olga, as another reviewer noted, although Olga is turning in Ingrid later in the film (you will have to watch it in order to understand what I mean). <br /> <br /> I will not go into the story, because it is too long and not very interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo (Robert Jinty) is interesting - look at the scene of towel theft to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were pretty good right away, and then spoiled by some really trashy blood. effects that looked as if they were made by a team that made "The City of the Walking Dead" (that is, strangely colored blood gushing from wounds on the neck). <br /> <br /> I would advise lovers of low-cost trash to check it out. if they can trace a copy, it is quite rare, although I will not ever be able to worry about reprinting it, so that it will become more and more rare in a few years. <br /> <br /> In any case, I’m recommending it exclusively for Belinda Mine’s gorgeous nude scenes! This lady fox!
