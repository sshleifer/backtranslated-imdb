Like many people on this site, I saw this film only once, when it was first shown on television in 1971. Some scenes remain in my memory, and I recall that it affected me. I would have been delighted to see him again if he had ever been made available for home video. <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler: I wonder if anyone else agrees that the basic plot settings and characters could be obtained from the 1960 British film, originally titled "City of the Dead", renamed "Terrible Hotel" for the American release? There are some similarities with the later British film “The Wicker Man”. <br /> <br /> One detail remains with me years after watching a movie. This is a small but important point at the beginning of the film. As I recall, the minister and his wife stopped to help some people on the side of the road around 1870, somewhere in the west. The friendly seeming Ray Milland introduces himself and his (daughter?) Yvette Mimier, a beautiful young dumb woman. While the preacher helps Ray Millend with the cart, the rattlesnake slides into view and rolls threateningly, unnoticed by any of the characters except Yvette Mimier. She does not look frightened at all, but looks at the snake with silent concentration, until she leaves. With this strange little moment, we already understand that in these seemingly normal people there is something very unusual, although the possible danger to the minister and his wife remains uncertain and uncertain for a long time. <br /> <br /> This little scene after all these years remains alive with me along with many others. The film has a terrifying quality that does not let go, and it is not surprising that people remember it so vividly. Someone should make this available for home videos!
