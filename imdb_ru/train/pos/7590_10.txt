I don't care whether you want my comment or not, but I think that you who write that the film is not very good ... you are so obsessed with Hollywood movies that you cannot see how good the film is, I am not a fan Jay Chou, but I like his play, and not just him ... and maybe you think that there’s not much point in the idea, and maybe you think that it’s not so interesting, but look deep there more than action in films, more than love, passion and tears, it's more than the USA in the world, and that's good :) really good. And it was expensive, so please do not criticize the actors, directors, because you do not know how hard they work, so that you will be happy for one and a half hours, watching them, thank you :)
