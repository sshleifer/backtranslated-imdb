It helps if you understand the Czech language and see it in the original language and understand the Czechs' obsession with “Professionals”, but if not, “Jedna ruka netlaska” is another great Czech film. It is funny, dark and very nice. The biggest compliment I can pay is that you never know exactly what will happen next, and even keep this feeling in the second and third viewing. <br /> <br /> For a small country, the Czech Republic has created an amazing amount of world-class films and literature, from Hrabal, Hasek and Kundera to Menzel, Sverak and many others. Czech humor is, by its very nature, gloomy and often uncompromising, but often with a naive and warm feeling behind it. This is just a film, it is unkind and tells about the less attractive sides of people, but under all this there is a beautiful story full of promises, good intentions and optimism. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this and most other projects in which Trojan and Machacek are involved. Have fun, this is a film created for just this reason - at least, it is as close as the Czechs can ever write a really happy ending ...
