Kudos to Fawcett to take on roles that were considered controversial at the time. As far as I remember, rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980s, and the rights and emotions of women have rarely been so deeply studied in this time. <br /> <br /> Fawcett is simply a woman who is followed and followed by actor James Russo. It is adequate as an obsessive psychopath, but sometimes a bit transparent. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarvid plays a small role, as does Alfre Woodard as a houseworker. Woodard is concerned about the legal consequences when Fawcett, the rape victim, takes revenge on the criminal. The scene where she throws a hot oil pan into Rousseau is a classic one, and as a rapist, he deserves it. Then she holds him in captivity, and the consequences must be overcome. <br /> <br /> A very real story that reflects the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been physically and mentally abused. Highly recommended. 8/10.
