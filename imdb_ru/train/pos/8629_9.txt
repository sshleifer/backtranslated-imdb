In the early nineties, I read a little ad in some horror magazine about Liebe des Totes (love of the dead) or something like that. This, of course, awakened my curiosity, so I ordered Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking (“The King of Death”). With the films “Necromantic”, everything is in order, they are even interesting and unique in their approach to the topic “Necrophilia” (even if they are obviously recordings from the horror opera, and are not intended to cause fear in the viewer, they things pretty funny). <Br /> <br /> TODESKING, on the other hand, in my opinion, is one of the best films ever made. It consists of a series of scenes depicting many aspects of death. Death as an enemy; Death as a deliverer, Death as a very physical decomposition of the body. The film is a metaphor of life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our life is. It reduces its audience to the children that they (we) really are. The fact that we cannot truly understand the nature of Death, and therefore not the process of dying, is the main idea of ​​the film. This is the most realistic movie. Never does Batgereit try to hide death behind white roses or anything else. No matter what moral standards you set, death is inevitable and sooner or later it will become not an invention, but YOUR reality. This applies to YOU, dear reader, as well as to the audience of the film. Some juvenile reviewers do not seem to understand this, which is fully justified, because, of course, they will live forever ... <br /> <br /> This is not a film about exploitation. What for? Because death does not exploit us humans. It gathers us. We grow for seven days, then we return to the Schopenhauer state before birth, that is, Death. Buttgereit gives us its version of the oldest of the tales. Do you think that this is "optimistic" or "pessimistic", it's up to you to decide. At first glance it may seem very dark. Consider, however, that in order for something to live, something else must die. “Who wants to live forever?” <br /> <br /> I suppose that when the Bootcaster shows a body absorbed by the larvae, it shows not only decay, but also the GENERATION of a new life. Wouldn't it be better to die and give life to the larvae, and then to the birds, and ultimately become the soil, than to remain alive dead zombies, who is one of the favorite pets of the genre? <br /> <br /> When you realize this you see Der Todesking in the right context. <br /> <br /> Sieben Tage hat die Woche, siebenmal letzte Stunden. Seven days of the week (weak, mortal!), Seven times in the last hour. <br /> <br /> Don't be afraid of the Reaper, Batgereit tells us, because the Reaper only accepts things that are ripe. And apples that do not collect for food, rot! <br /> <br /> Have a good life, friends IMDB'ers! <br /> <br /> (And watch this film, which is compared only with Ingemar Bergmans "The Seventh Seal" in terms of depth and versatility)
