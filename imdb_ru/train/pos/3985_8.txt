Last night I watched it as a late television film purely by chance. The filmâ€™s advertising said something about the mother staying with her daughter and going on a romantic journey, when I tuned in to the fact that the carpenter was working hard at the new conservatory - played by Daniel Craig no less - so the plot was immediately obvious. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the love of the mother of the same name is also the daughter's boyfriend, so there are problems with brewing and not too many surprises. But I was caught by the compelling performance of Anna Reid, and I was hooked. The direction gives her enough space to look in the mirrors and fix the scarves when she exudes sadness. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes were exciting and destructive taboos. Shouldn't older women be hidden? Not here, and we are in for a delightful awakening in Mother's sexuality. Even more striking are the drawings she made, which (SPOILER!) Once discovered, confirm her daughter's suspicion that something is happening here. <br /> <br /> Catherine Bradshaw, because the daughter did not convince me as much as the rest of the cast, but it could be me. With her waves of castles in front of Raf, I still expected to see Julia Sawalu, whose more intense face could better withstand my confrontation. Bradshaw has a rounder happy face on which there was no anger arising as the film progressed. <br /> <br /> The end is weak. If the farewell to a mother who goes away in disgrace is so indifferent, then perhaps we will see several close-ups of those who wave a farewell and see something of their individual reasons. Whatever she does, she is a recently lost widow, leaving for the lonely house in which she lived with her husband for 30 years, and I discovered a lack of sympathy. For a film full of emotions (and keep in mind that this is like opening a champagne, you will never close the lid), the end is a cold contradiction.
