"Dressed to kill" (1980) is a mysterious horror film from Brian De Palma, and it really works. The atmosphere is right there. The atmosphere that scares you. And that's not what a horror movie should do. All the actors are in the right places. Michael Caine is wonderful in the role of Dr. Robert Elliot, a psychotherapist with a little secret. Angie Dickinson as Kate Miller, a sexually upset mature woman, is awesome. Blake call girl - fiction. Dennis Franz plays his typical detective role. His detective Marino is one of the most prominent in this film. In this film many creepy scenes. The elevator scene is one of them. Comparison between this and Alfred Hitchcock Psycho (1960). There are some similarities between these two films. Both of these films can cause sleepless nights.
