Monstervision is the show I grew up on. From a late night meeting with Penn and Teller to the only Joe Bob Briggs. The show haunted me on Fridays during my school years and gave me the best memories of entry that have ever appeared outside the entrance. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the best late evening. television ever. If you did not go to bed, you missed. <br /> <br /> I know that John Bloom and Joe Bob live, but I want them to go back to where they should be ... MONSTER! The question is ... has anyone else been sitting all the 4 hours of “Roy”? q :) <br /> <br /> Long live Monstervision!
