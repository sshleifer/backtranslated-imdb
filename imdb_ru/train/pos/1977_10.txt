I really love this movie. I remember once, when I was in the second grade, my teacher showed it to us on a 16 mm film. This film, however, can be a bit intimidating for students in 2nd grade, such as the scene where Bill kills Nancy and sees Feiginâ€™s face for the first time on the screen. One of my relatives was tired of watching this movie because she was in a music class. If I were a teacher and could rate the people who produced this wonderful film, I would give them an A + rating.
