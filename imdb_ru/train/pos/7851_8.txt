“Revenge of the Operator” is an unusual short movie not because of the subject (adultery) or because it is animated (by this time Winsor McKay was presented in the film “Nemo Nemo”), but because it depicts errors telling a story! Ladislav Starewicz originally wanted to shoot actual battles with errors, but could not get them to do it on camera due to the hot lights that they experienced, so he took the dead and began using motion stop methods to manipulate the movements to satisfy it. This short work is well suited for imposing human qualities on small creatures, such as riding motorcycles, drawing, shooting, kissing and dancing. Starewicz would also do Frogland (1922) and The Mascot (1933), but his first known work would be this one. If you are interested in this and the other shorts mentioned, check your local library to get The Imagemant Revenge DVD and Other Fantastic Tales from Image Entertainment.
