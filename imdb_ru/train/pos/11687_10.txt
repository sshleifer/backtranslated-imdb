My affection for Chris Rock varies depending on his films, I hated him after Lethal Weapon 4, but after that I hated everyone in this film. I like him when he himself is not restrained, as in Dogma. Well, this is his best, I did not expect it to be so good. Laughing at my ass all the time. Chris Rock presents a wonderful wonderful story, backed up by one of the funniest comedies I've seen for a long time. Loved it.
