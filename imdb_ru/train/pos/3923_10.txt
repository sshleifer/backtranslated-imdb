This is an amazing film, both thanks to the incredible energy caused by the frantic flamenco dance, and thanks to the unique way in which the filmmakers interweave the history of stage production with the lives of the heroes preparing for it. The spell is the only word I can use to describe the experience. This is not "Carmen Bizet" by any ordinary standards. This is no ordinary movie by any standard. Every nuance, every kick, every musical piece is intertwined so fascinating that it is impossible to look away from the screen. You do not need to love opera or flamenco (I donâ€™t) to be captured, admired, fascinated by this film. Thin and straight; loud and quiet; One of, if not the best, films of this kind, because there are very few of them.
