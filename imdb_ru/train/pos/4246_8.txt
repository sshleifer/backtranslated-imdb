In this film, made ONLY at the time when the production code was used, Gene Harlow is Edie, and Patsy Kelly is a sorceress who stalks a man, Kitty. The girl from Missouri begins by saying that the girls get on the train, and Edi promises to earn money for herself, looking for her millionaire husband, while remaining whole - some in the process. It did not take long to meet with Frank Cousins ​​(Lewis Stone was a good doctor at the Grand Hotel, as well as Judge Hardy in the films "Andy Hard".) But everything is not as it seems ... The censors must have liked Harlow's line: "A girl cannot accept such an expensive gift from a gentleman unless she is engaged." Later, someone says: “You know that we have never been alone together,” and Edie replies: “Yes, and we will not!” Lionel Barrymore - TR Paige, another rich elite who came to her aid when trouble comes, looking for Go. At some point, Page announces: “You have to strike me out of your list — I'm not a lady” ... I wonder what that line would have been just a couple of years ago, before the Hayes code entered the city. What did he actually say? Carol Tavis seems to be "Baby", as indicated in the credits on IMDb. Looks like she was in show business only from 1931 to 1939, and Munchkin in The Wizard of Oz is the last role she played. Cheerful, clean hype when girls chase men across the country. Look for Neta Pendleton as a lifeguard who was an Olympic wrestler in 1920 (silver medalist) who became a movie star (he was in many films of Dr. Kildares and appeared in four Harlow films.) Mistaken personality, plot twists, young Franchot Ton, love stories even Jean Harlow is in a swimsuit in Palm Beach, although outdoor scenes in the city center seem to be the backdrop.
