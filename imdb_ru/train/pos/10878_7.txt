Personally, I liked cut thouroughly. It was the first time I saw a theatrical Australian slasher. Genre, usually limited to major Hollywood films. <br /> <br /> With all the usual culinary comedies and dramas coming out of Australia, I enjoyed watching horror movies that were not frustrated. I did not even think that it was a fake of other films. It was a supernatural plot of horror, like “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” not “Cry” or “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” and therefore there was more suspicion of disbelief. I think it's time for Australian films to try to get more in the main genres. <br /> <br /> The director's work was original, rather frightening and, ultimately, a bit funny. I would give him seven out of ten and would not take it as something serious. He did what he expected, entertained, and frightened me enough times to please me. I enjoyed it.
