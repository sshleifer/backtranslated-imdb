I have to start with an apology, because I thought that the first 75-80% of this film was funny. This is mainly due to the performance of Brad Pitt. Spot on. <br /> <br /> The game of all the participants was pretty good, but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in every way. I'm not a giant Pitt fan, but this must be one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> Brutal, Honest, Gritty. All good words to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> I read the previous review, and the person said that the cause of the early violence was not explained. This is explained, but, fortunately, they do not need to go into graphic details to convey their thoughts. <br /> <br /> In general, I put 9, because each scene 1 or 2 was effective. I think that humor in the first half or so is perfect for this film. Underestimated.
