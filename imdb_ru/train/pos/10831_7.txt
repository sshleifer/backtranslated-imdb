A great cast makes this film work; all the characters are very well designed and it is clear that the actors liked to appear in this film. <br /> <br /> This is not exactly a comedy that I expected, a much more carefree look at trying to regain youthful fame than raunchy humor. For music lovers, there are quite a few subtle references that are intellectually fun in themselves. <br /> <br /> I hate making direct comparisons with other films, but most of this film reminded me of Alan Parker's films that I can't help him: imagine if Obligations really made it big - and then tried to return this glory 25 years later.
