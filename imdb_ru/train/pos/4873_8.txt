For those of you who are not familiar with the theme that Kusturica continues to periodically explore in his films - the Western attack on traditional Serbian values ​​- you will not be able to understand his narration. This continuous theme, expressed in fantasy and outrageous comedy as its guide, is what Kusturica has chosen for the mandate. Starting with his fantastic work and Magnum Opus' Underground ', Kusturica’s films'' Black Cat White Cat '', 'Life is a Miracle' ', and recently with' Promise Me This', his rough carnival style emphasizes the 'westernization' of Balkan culture Arrival and attack on a traditional idiom. In the case of “Promise me this,” the paradoxical world of urban (urban space) and rural (traditional idiom) space is opposed. The world of the city reflects western attributes that encompass a spatial and temporal setting; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a torn sense of identity and disrespect for traditional values ​​expressed in relation to a young child - a villager. The end of the film further illustrates this concept, as we observe the funeral mass and the wedding on a dirt road with one-way traffic. They are on rough collisions; accordingly, the wedding, which represents the life and pulse of the village, that is, traditional values, is about to face the funeral of the bereaved, illustrating the death of the tradition in this context. Yet Kusturica brilliantly explores this topic through its unique stylistic feature. With his outrageous and vibrant style, serving as a vehicle in his image.
