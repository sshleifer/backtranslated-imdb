BSG is one of my favorite TV shows. I was lucky to start watching it when the series approached the final season. It was a marathon from start to finish for me, and what an incredible ride it was! <br /> <br /> As soon as I noticed the pilot on Hula, I knew for sure that I was only interested in the name - Caprica! Although some things do not add up when you compare both series, they are still perfectly executed. There was no mention of golobands in Battlestar Galactica or references to virtual worlds, but maybe I didnâ€™t tell them enough about the series. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to everyone who loves the universe, technology and alternative fantasies of our world. This show is very interesting and you want to see more!
