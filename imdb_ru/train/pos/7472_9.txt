I really liked this movie. I read a few other comments, and although I feel sorry for those who did not understand this, I agree with some of the criticisms. That in a strange way makes me love this movie even more. I agree that they have a good line-up for remaking an intelligent film for the general public, but there are so many levels in it, and it is still a pleasure to watch. I also love movies such as this one that provoke so many disputes, theories, possible endings and hidden subtexts. Congratulations, Mr. Crowe, definitely in my top ten. <br /> <br /> P.S. I saw it when he first appeared, when I was climbing in Mexico, it was late at night, and I had to go back to my hotel, and I had a lot of paranoia! Where does the dream end and the present begin?
