Contrary to popular belief, this name, at least for me, is not so bad. In fact. I think this is the favorite movie of all time. Welding stories was not well structured, given the differences between the series, however, despite all this, you can watch it quite happily. For a feature film of the time, the scenes are well proportioned, and the characters remain believable. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is my personal favorite. Almost everything has the right sound effect, and many voices suit the characters much better than theirs, now American duplicates played poorly, colleagues. Synchronization is perfect in every frame. I had a few problems with casting to the voices of "aliens" (I apologize for the rude name, it has been a long time since I saw it). For the rest, however, the cast seemed perfectly balanced. I feel and believe in the characters of this film. So that is often a subject with which I rarely agree with a long time ago. I liked OSD then, but the castings often let the TV shows down. <br /> <br /> At this moment I would like to add that it was one of the first anime I saw in my life. It has historical value for me, but even after viewing the original Megazone 23, it remained stronger and was more observed in my collection. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, the name only ever was in the USA in Texas. Personally, I think this is a big shame. If the right audience were exposed to this, I think Robotech the Movie would be accepted and not tainted over the years. I do anime every day of my life, and everyone to whom I showed this film thought it was a beautifully composed title. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie after its individual components will allow the viewer to notice an obvious plot. holes between shows. However, without seeing the originals, the viewer would not have noticed. Since the animation in style is identical, there was no reason to question it at one time. The UK had very limited access to anime. Laser discs were the most productive carriers. Personally, I like the way Carl had balls to at least push the genre. I mean that Harmony was not going to invest in the publication of the series. <br /> <br /> Despite a few picky flaws that people had with this film, the feeling of the eighties keeps me in love. If you are watching Megazone 23 now with its original Japanese sound or new dub, I think you will be very disappointed with OSD. Return to the original Bubblegum Crisis Dub soundtrack and present a new sound of the eighties for EV.E. <br /> <br /> Having said all that. The popularity of this film is currently most likely due to its rarity on the open market. Personally, it spawned a collection for me. Now I search the world for goods from its three components, and if I can ever meet Karl Matsek, I shake his hand for the effort and buy him a pint or box for me in the anime.
