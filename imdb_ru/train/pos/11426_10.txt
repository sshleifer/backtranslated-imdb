I think that this film would be more pleasant if everyone thought of it as a picture of colonial Africa in the 50s and 60s, and not as a story. Because there is no real story here. Just one vignette on top of another, like small points of light that mean nothing until you have enough to paint a picture. The first time I saw Chocolat, I really “didn't understand” until I thought about it for a few days. Then I realized that there are a lot of things that need to be “obtained”, including the end of colonialism, which was just around the corner, simply without conspiracy. Anyway, this is one of my favorite movies. The scene at the airport with a brief shower and beautiful music was pure poetry. If you like “exciting” movies, don't watch it - you will be bored to tears. But for some of you ... you can thank me later for recommending this to you.
