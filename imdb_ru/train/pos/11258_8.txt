Spoilers! Classic sex of the 70s! Swedish girl (Helga) made this film so wonderful. She was beautiful, but what really attracted me was how sexy she was. She exuded a huge amount of sexuality throughout the film. Her best scenes were when she stimulated herself. Whenever she appeared on the screen, I became shocked. <br /> <br /> Dr. Julia (the sister of the crazy male film focus) was visually very interesting. Although most 12-year-old girls have bigger breasts than Julia, she knew how to use what she had little, and her scenes (especially scenes with a silk blouse and black skirt) also mercilessly attracted my attention. You should also love the main hockey scene, where bats undressed her nekkid; I do not know if I have ever seen anything more funny, but at the same time sexy. Classic stuff!
