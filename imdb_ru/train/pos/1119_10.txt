Sandra Bernhard's film “Without You, I'm Nothing,” released in 1990, followed her production outside Broadway in 1988 ... what she and others call their “one woman’s hit” in the film. "<br /> <br /> There were some changes in the monologues and one-liners, and the film’s version visually changed the plot, taking Sandra from a fairy-tale existence as a successful performer in New York, during what she calls her" superstar summer " in an illusory, almost desperate existence at her home in Los Angeles — her fictional film manager talks about how to get Sandra back “to her roots so that ... high-class dinner clubs like the Parisian room.” "<br /> <br /> It makes sense. Sandra is trying to appeal to his liberal outlook and his sometimes harsh criticism of American pop culture to an audience that does not fully see it. In Los Angeles, she plays with a predominantly black audience, trying to tie up her ideas, when all these people seem to want, this is “Shashona”, a stripper like Madonna. And even when Shashona is dancing to drum rhythms similar to those of “Like a Virgin,” there is little to say for the pleasure of the audience from the show. Club scene throughout the film is drier than bone. A funny scene that can be caught is a depraved man from the audience who helps Chashonne out of his pants. <br /> <br /> But if she goes down, Sandra does it with style and power, conveying everything from dirty confidence to pierced ones. vulnerability ... until the moment when she is naked (literally), begging for acceptance and yet somehow still floats in a pool of her own transparent glory. Her portrayals of interactions with people like Calvin Klein, Jerry Lewis, Bianca Jagger, Ralph Lauren, and (what we believe in) Warren Beatty are fictional and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Sandra begins her show at her most embarrassing moment - performing a quiet but mysterious transfer of Nina Simone’s song “Four Women”, dressed in civilian clothes and other African attire, with lines like “my skin is black” , “my hair is woolen” and “they call me Sweet Things.” <br /> <br /> She resurrects and celebrates the ghosts of underground art in the incredibly funny description of the crazy real estate auction for Andy Warhol: “Give Andy wisdom and sensitivity to watches and hours of toil and labor that went to indian the product ... that they were so lucky to make money on all this stuff happening in Santa Fe. "<br /> <br /> She explains the excessiveness of Hollywood comforts an upset friend, and then convinces him, saying," Mister, when it comes to Ishtar, I get up right now and leave your life forever, because it is too indulgence of my desires even for me! "<br /> <br /> Sandra illustrates women's expectations in the era of feminism. Dressed like Cosmo, Sandra recounts her young girl's fantasy to become executive secretary and marry her boss. As a result, she comes to the conclusion with relief:" I never I will not be statistics, not I. I am less than 35 years old and I am going to get married! "<br /> <br /> Sandra extols the revelation of sexuality in society." When he touches you at night, he feels good or real ? I say it is real ... MAY real. "<br /> <br /> Finally, she cries for n In the progressive American society, the great disco artists directed Patrick Cowley and Sylvester and proclaimed: “In the end, everyone will be frightened!” <br /> <br /> All this happens in the form of brilliant, bold, but wonderful performances by cabaret songs written and created by Billy Paul, Bert Baharache, Hank Williams and Laura Niro, to name a few. At the same time, Sandra's idealized, fictional incarnation — her own self-created image — floats around the city, a beautiful black model with flowing dresses and thick booties reading, “Kabala”, studying chemistry and listening to rap music NWA. br /> <br /> In Without You I Am Nothing, Sandra Bernhard explores the emotions and existence that she had previously played only as a regular guest in "Late Night with David Letterman." Her almost childish enthusiasm for shock, shown during the 1980s, is thrown off toward a more subtle charm, and her confidence in the face of materialism and American celebrity turns out to be refreshing. Such an approach to the comedy will forever change the direction of Sandra's movement and make him a more mature, more representative artist. <br /> <br /> If you like subtle humor, then there are jokes about glamor, celebrities, sex and loneliness. From despair and superficial manifestations of love and kinship, this film will not leave you indifferent. This should not be funny in all directions. Perhaps it is a little anxious or even curly for some. But think about the emptiness of the world that Sandra draws for you, and you will understand how funny and brilliant she really is. <br /> <br /> But look, I’m nothing with a friend without you, "in the know" because it is definitely funnier. Before you find out, you two will swap Sandra with beards and put the rest of you out of yourself.
