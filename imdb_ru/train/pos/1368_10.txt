Good. It has been a favorite since 14 years. Of course, I no longer watch it several times a year, but ... This is not a film for the older generation, which needs a deeper meaning or some brilliant message. This movie is fun. It's rather outdated, almost out of date, but Parker Posey is so gorgeous that it is unbelievable. If you want to be fascinated by the breakfast of the 90s in Tiffany, visit the rave of the 90s or fall in love with Parker, this film is for you. Otherwise, do not worry.
