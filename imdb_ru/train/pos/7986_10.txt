This is a great heartbreaking movie. This is the best of what I have seen, displays the current reality in Latin America ... kidnapping, corruption, ruthless and greedy police officials and heartless lawlessness in relation to innocent victims. In my opinion, Denzel Washinton gives the most touching results in his career. Dakota Fanning is an amazing young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is beautifully written and depicted, I believed every minute. The cast is great, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke are great as ever. Walken lights up the screen for me, like no other actor. I would like to see more of them both. Authentic places are wonderful. Working with the camera is interesting and different. The cast includes many famous Latin actors, which makes it even more interesting for people familiar with Latin American cinema. I highly recommend this movie.
