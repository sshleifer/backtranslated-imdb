... and I love it. A lot of special effects, and for a film that is not made on a mega budget, this film really does a great job of creating a fantastic masterpiece. I am one of those guys who didnâ€™t understand the story at all, but it was great to watch it anyway. It is definitely there in standards that surpass the Bored of the rings, and on par with films like Harry Potter. Which again talks about the film, made up to a fraction of the budget of these international hits. <br /> <br /> One thing that I really love about this film is that it stretches so much the envelope of an adventure film from Hong Kong. The theme is exotic and original. The quality of the production is not similar to what can be seen in HK for the fantasy action movie, and the acting is great. <br /> <br /> One of the best films in Hong Kong, this is the fantasy film Hellish Affairs of Hong Kong and I hope that they will continue to work in this area until they surpass the Hollywood adventure films. <br /> <br /> fantastic.
