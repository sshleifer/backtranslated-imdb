What a fun b-movie! Shepis is absolutely beautiful, and the Scarecrow is distinct and original. He really brought me back to the monsters of the 80s. The budget is obviously small, and not all of Pacino is behind the lens, but this does not matter, because it never takes itself seriously. From the trash bin to the high-flying Scarecrow martial arts, this is truly the gem of the b-movie. Take refreshments, snacks and a couple of friends, relax and unwind. I liked this movie so much that I bought all 3 Scarecrow movies. Of course, they are not intended for everyone, but for each of them. Sometimes you just need to put on thinking and smile.
