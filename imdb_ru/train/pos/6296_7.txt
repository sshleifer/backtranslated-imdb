Parker (Jonathan Schach) is an aspiring writer who is still looking for his big break. In the meantime, he works as a telephone consultant on the psychics hotline in Manhattan. Once, unfortunately, his apartment building burned down. Parker and his cat make it alive, but now they are stuck with the difficult task of finding affordable housing in the Big Apple. Parker gets a rumor that the woman Samantha (Alison Eastwood) is looking for a roommate, but will only accept a gay man. Since Parker is direct, but the price is right, he decides to pretend that he is gay. Samantha loves him from the very beginning and welcomes him as his new companion. But poor Parker. Sam is cute, smart and very welcome. How can he keep his true nature under control? Besides, doesn't Sam have a successful businessman guy? This is a cute, pleasant and humorous film with two very attractive stars in Eastwood and Shah. Naturally, the plot is a series of scenes “how can I support this trick” when Sam asks Parker to give shampoo while she takes a shower or begs him to keep her in bed when she gets bad news. In addition, Parker needs to create his own “fake” gay buddy Boris, when Sam insists on putting him in order with a man she knows. We hope that the gay community will not find it too offensive, as this viewer believed that most of the questions were perceived delicately and delicately. For a small film, the costumes, scenery and camera work were also pretty good. Therefore, if you love these funny love stories, get it soon. You will like what you see, I know that.
