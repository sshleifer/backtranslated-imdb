After she was jailed for at least 10 and no more than 40 years because she was arrested by drugs and refused to quit her peers, Jackie (Eric Gavin from "Vixen" and "On the Other Side of the Dolls Valley" (c) the last movie role is to get used to life in a big puppet house, or at least try in this early film by Jonathan Demme. Because of his tasteless nature and obvious observability, I would also call it one of his best films, right under Silence of the Lambs and Stop Thinking, but much higher than any other film of his. This little classic is just polite, sloppy, and funny enough to be an amazingly good sense of guilt, and, fortunately, never went beyond the whole parody of the Women In Prison genre. This is ALMOST washed away from the mouth of a bad taste absurdly preaching "Philadelphia". Nevertheless, the film is not without flaws (“a serious show is a HUGE routine work that has to be endured, and it lasts too long, Barber Steele, unfortunately, wasted, among other trifles) But don't let these shocks stop you” from watching another nice movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: B- <br /> <br /> More info on the DVD: 5-minute interview with Roger Corman; Actors and film crew Bios; Original trailer; and trailers for "Candy Stripe Nurses" (nude), "Big Bad Mama 2", "Big Doll House" (nude) and "Crazy Mama" <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Juanita Brown, Cheryl "Rainbow" Smith, Erica Gavin, Robert Collins, Ella Reid, Linda Gold and some others demonstrate skins
