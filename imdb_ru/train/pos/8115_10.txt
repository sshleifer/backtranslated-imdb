The first two parts seek to bring to the absurd the growth of useless wars and the rule of nationalist barbarians. The third part assumes that progress and exploration to the Moon and beyond is the key to ensuring meaningful use of human talent and resources. He has speeches that some viewers call naive or pompous, but make others tremble with excitement. It shows a space gun / launcher and a helicopter, as well as inventive mass communication devices, elevators, flat screens and wireless intercoms. This is probably wrong with buildings without windows in the future. But it depicts a childish vision of limitless scientific / technological research. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this is a film about a group of rationally minded thinkers who are guided by Spinozeic morality in their desire to perpetuate themselves and live ethically through scientific progress and a unified world government. Progressive characters (such as two clicks) believe that humanity can "live forever," while preserving our experiments and progress for future generations, always standing on our humanity, as on the shoulders of giants. <br /> <br /> Arthur Clark (author of The Space Odyssey) in 2001 offered this film to Stanley Kubrick as an example of an excellent SF movie. Kubrick hated it and said that he would never watch another film based on Clark's suggestions (source: Clark's special millennial introduction to his 2001 novel). Although the late Clark continued to offer it at the head of the list whenever someone asked him about the best SF films. He has a beautiful artistic design Menzies, but mediocre special effects (especially toy tanks). <br /> <br /> I personally liked it, and I think that it perfectly reflects the spirit of modern times. A little naive about the plausibility of creating a society without crime for a long period of time. It also seems implausible about the inevitability of progress. It seems to me that we could just as easily return directly to the dark ages, or at least become so stagnant in science that we kill ourselves because of overpopulation or the inability to avoid the next major natural disaster. But this well reflects the importance of taking risks against the public and the resentment of the nanny for potential threats of cosmic accidents and deaths. This forces us to choose the side of progress as compared to petty desires for safety, comfort or happiness: <br /> <br /> Kabal: “Too much (peace) is too early, and we call it death. But for man there is no peace. " and there is no end. He must go on - to conquer beyond conquest. This small planet and its winds and paths, and all the laws of mind and matter, which restrain it. Then the planets are around him and, finally, huge stars. And when he conquers all the depths of space and all the secrets of time, he will begin. ” <br /> <br /> Kabal: “If we are nothing more than animals, we must grab our little bits of happiness, live, suffer and die, no matter more than all other animals — or done.” {He points to the stars. } "This is - or is it? The whole universe - or nothing ..." (quotes from the script). <br /> <br /> If this sounds like a rationalization Having devoted progress to the whole society, the council members (of the world government) will become technocrats. But in fact, these "technocrats" allow their citizens to become artisans or freely pursue other hobbies, and they will have to I suppress government bans, laws against science and experimentation, as well as other mandates and restrictive use of force that will turn their critics into tyrants. <br /> <br /> In fact, a huge group of rebels in this conspiracy feels humiliated by all scientific and the technological developments of the Council, therefore, they are trying to halt progress and put an end to the freedom of experimentation. A progress-oriented council will not suppress the freedom of speech of the rebels, only by preparing its “world gas” in extreme x situations and just wanting the freedom and space to achieve their progress. <br /> <br /> So this is also a story about the freedom to do science, as well as about the wonders of progress. Many people in our society actually agree with some of these basic premises, except in cases of social bias (many want to prohibit cloning, for example) or naturalism (some do not want us to progress freely, and would prefer that we simply become extinct at one time, being enslaved by the earth) or fear / mind (some believe that we are not ready for advanced science / technology, because we can destroy ourselves) But Kabal (the president of the council) has the answer to the danger problem: “Our {scientific} revolution has not abolished death or danger. It was just worth the death and danger ”(script).
