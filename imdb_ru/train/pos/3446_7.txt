Yesterday I attended the world premiere of The Descent at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. I had a great time. It was sold out and visited by all the major stars, including my friend spacer Marcus Patrick. <br /> <br /> I give the film 7.5 starts out of a possible 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Maya (Rosario Dawson) in college. You can imagine a typical college environment with wild parties and flirting. The photo in this film was excellent. She meets Jared (Chad Faust), and they become lovers. It looks like any other relationship at the beginning. A man is in search of attention and affection of a woman, and a woman is hard to get. Both played well. Very innocent flirting between them. He invites her to his apartment, and everything falls apart. <br /> <br /> The apartment is very sad and dark. In the end, they end up in the basement, which is very dark and lit by numerous candles. It actually reminded me of a dungeon. Here he shows his true colors and continues to rape her. This is a very dark and rough scene of rape. This scene is not for the young or weak hearted. The rape scene is a bit long and difficult to see, but it’s necessary for the rest of the next movie. <br /> <br /> Maya is now starting to lose his soul due to drugs and sex. She falls into her abyss. She begins to attend the wildest parties and wakes up one morning in a room, not remembering how she got there. She is told to go to Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this character is that they say: "He is the one who saves everyone who needs salvation." In fact, he is the one who introduces Maya to drugs. They start dependency relationships that come into play later in the film. The scenes of the club at this point of the film are photographed with exceptional experience. I thought they did well, and I noticed that the director of the photo was applauded by the audience at the end of the show during the credits. <br /> <br /> Maya returned to college as a TA, and who is in her class - Jared is her rapist !! You could see the confusion and emotion on Maya's face. What should I do?? What should I do next? Pictures of her face and emotions are priceless. <br /> <br /> In fact, it’s not what is happening. She is interested in Jared. Looks like she wants to restore the relationship and become lovers again. I sat there and said that this could really happen. Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> She invites him to her apartment and, of course, he appears. Now in her apartment is dark and sandy. She made him completely undress. He thinks he's lucky. Then she teases him like any woman. She caresses him everywhere, and he is excited. Note: for those planning to watch this film, this scene - complete nudity in the frontal plane - maybe not suitable for the younger viewer. <br /> <br /> Then she turns the situation around, becomes a monster and continues to rape him. Once again, the scene is dark, sandy and very rough. <br /> <br /> If you are going to watch a movie and do not want to know what will happen next, skip this paragraph and go to the last paragraph. <br /> <br /> Here Adrian enters the picture again. Maya forces Adriana to save (?) Her by performing extremely rough male sex with Jared. She thinks this is the last revenge. Adrian continues to take all of Jared's manliness and negates his dignity. Marcus, like Adrian, plays this scene as believably as possible. He is a strong actor playing a strong character, and power is shown across the screen. After the film, during a question and answer session, Marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and Chad. Maya thinks this revenge will save her, but I don’t think so. In one of the last scenes, a close-up of Mace's face, and you see a tear that rolls down her cheek. It was an unbelievable close-up scene that causes constant discussions with everyone who goes to watch this movie. She took revenge on what she wanted ?? Was it as nice as she expected? In my opinion, it is not. This only exacerbates the situation. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie with well-played roles, and I recommend it to anyone who thinks about watching it. I would be a little indecisive if I had not turned 17 years old. Rosario, Chad and Marcus deserve credit for a job well done. Directing and photography are also commendable. It was a night that I liked.
