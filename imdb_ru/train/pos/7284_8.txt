When I was little, I saw very few films. My parents rented this one with all their wisdom. I was very careful about what the film was about; in fact, I was not even allowed to watch it. My brother and sister, of course, got there, and it made me very angry. So what did i do? Late at night, I smashed the VCR! I kicked the TV screen and called the police and reported the vandals. Of course, I was arrested, I could not get my leg out of the TV until the police arrived. I was given only a strict conversation and sent home. My parents, of course, put me in my arms and forced me to work to pay off the debt for the TV and VCR. It tore me apart, slave labor is really terrible, but I had to do it. Housework around the house. What happened at the end? For my work, we have a large screen TV, a DVD player and a surround sound system. How did I get the money? Easy, I made my own films and sold them to Disney! Do you remember Looking for Neno? Well, I wrote this film and shot my goldfish in their aquariums! They, of course, rewrote the plot and did it in CGI, because they could not afford to make him a real fighter, like me! In the end, I have never seen the movie “The Head That Did Not Die,” and the rating I gave is my life rating! It is very good!
