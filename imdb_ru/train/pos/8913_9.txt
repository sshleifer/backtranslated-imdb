This is my favorite classic. It was shot just west of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, when I was 13, in 1957, and was released the following year. Then, in 1970, I was working in the same district as the rookie of the state of Pennsylvania. I always liked to check different places where scenes were filmed. I knew the owner of the Downingtown diner well, and he had a traffic sign that told all passing motorists that it was a “house of drops”. The theater scene was in Phoenixville, near Valley Forge Park, and today it still shows films!
