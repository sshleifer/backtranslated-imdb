If you have not seen Eva Longoria from the series "Desperate Housewives", then you are missing. Eva will be one of the biggest stars in Latina, and you will soon see her in theaters. It was Eva's first film, and she plays an excellent acting role. She was 24 years old when she shot, and looked hot then. As for this low-budget film, it’s pretty good for the first director, who will soon have another film from Juarez, Mexico, which is currently playing at many film festivals in the United States. In fact, it seems that he may have a limited theatrical release of some news. What would be nice to see is “Snitch'2” with a higher budget.
