Princess There There is no sign of racism, as we think of racism in the United States, but there are more subtle (for the American viewer) allegations of ethnic identity at the time. Pay attention to the location of Alvina (Baker) in the frames, how other characters turn to her, settings around her, which all portray her as a “wild” African, and ask yourself if Alvin has at least some piece of action throughout the movie . I do not want to destroy anything, but in the end pay special attention, the dichotomy between the "eastern" and the "western" cultures is, to put it mildly, insulting, such diction, fortunately, is disavowed today. The French have a precarious past as imperial power in all of the territories depicted (see Chris Marker's Les Statues Meurent Aussi- 1953) and pay attention to places that European travelers visit while they are in Africa, and that this is reflected in their attitude to “other ". I give this film 7 because I suck Baker, most of what she did in her professional career, for example, Princes Tam Tam, who is regressive, is certainly overshadowed by her integration efforts, her work as a damn spy. whip, sorry.) However, the film is fascinating to me because of her work, except that it is an eloquent relic of departed mentalities.
