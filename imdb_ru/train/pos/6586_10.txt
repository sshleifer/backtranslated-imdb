Jeremy Brett is simply the best Holmes of all, of course, by a small margin from the great Basil Rathbone, and this is probably the best adaptation of the story by Konon Doyle. <br /> <br /> Length adaptation includes several new storylines. It fits well with the surrounding dramatic plot and reinforces the hatred of Milverton. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances, especially from Robert Hardy, and Brett and Hardwick, fully rounded and comfortable in their roles, make this an excellent piece of drama.
