I nominate it and BABYLON 5 as the best television science fiction television series. Both stand out in my memory, because, unlike the early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent evolution of stories and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK: TNG, these were great shows, but there was no common theme or story linking all the episodes. In many cases, you can usually watch the show completely out of order, easily understanding what is happening. This was not the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its gigantic battles that took place all last season) and with other TREK shows, since they were united by a great story. This consistency seems to have evolved as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw it even more with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long romance slowly take shape. Of course, there were several “one-off” episodes that were not related to the rest, but they were very rare and far from each other, and, as a rule, were quite funny. <br /> <br /> And speaking of funny things, I liked this SG -1 from time to time to keep my mood light and was not so terribly serious. So I really enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love for Homer Simpson - it’s too bad that he gradually disappeared from the series in later seasons. <br /> In order to truly appreciate SG-1, you have to watch it from the start and see how the plots work intricately. This consistency gives the show exceptional stamina. And, if you don’t like SG-1 after it gives it a good chance, then science fiction is probably NOT a genre for you.
