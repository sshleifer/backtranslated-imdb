Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker reunite to play all their songs 35 years ago, when they formed a trio called “Cream”. These were the psychedelic days of England and America, and these guys looked like this: all skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues, and it was, for the most part, not bad. <br /> <br /> These guys are over 60 years old, and they can still sing and play at a high level, as this wonderful live DVD shows. Of course, I was always very familiar with Clapton, who had never been the center of attention, but I did not know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, whom I had not seen for decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker was so haggard that he looked like a freak on the verge of death. Now he looks healthy, fit, and his drumming was flawless. Bruce looked a little haggard, but his voice is gorgeous, good as ever, and I love hearing those old songs. This is just great material and performance from guys who know what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Some people criticized this show for being restrained. I do not agree with this. I have no complaints. The concert sounded very good. The second song "Spoonful" was outstanding, the highlight of the concert for me. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
