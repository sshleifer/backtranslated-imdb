This film, although it is one of the most favorite themes of Mexican producers: extreme life in our cities, has a funny way to show it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Four of the most important Mexican directors of recent times approach the history of our city in various literary genres, because it may be a farce or satire, which gives us a film with an overly exposed topic in our country, but is told quite to another, which gives it freshness. <br /> <br /> With little-known actors, but it perfectly interprets their work, each of the directors reflects in his stories the ability that we have defined anywhere in the world, this ability to laugh at pain and make a holiday of sadness. Perhaps many people in our country were not pleased with the film, but I believe that people from other countries could find attractive and share Mexican surrealism.
