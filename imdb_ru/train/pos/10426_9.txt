I like it because of my recent personal experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite. The characters in the firm did not really enjoy their “real” life, but they really did enjoy, that is, who they were. The film did a good job making this simple day a good memory. A good memory includes not only romantic feelings for a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but also definitely a deeper discussion of their life values. Many films resemble this in terms of defining the definitions of life or love or relationships, or current problems in life, or in some ways. Before Sunrise, they coped well with this, which makes the viewer think, adjust breathing and continue watching the movie. Until Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought in your head. It simply prompted you to think about some of the problems in everyday life and gave you several alternative possibilities. This made conversations between characters interesting, and not just typical plaintive complaints or current silly ideas. You would still think about these issues for yourself and would be interested in the next line of the story. The end was not at all important after all. You could learn something good and positive from the movie. Films should be enjoyable. This is a nice movie and worth your time to watch it. I am also on a journey. The film somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions.
