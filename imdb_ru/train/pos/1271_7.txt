Having never seen this film based on the entertaining novel by Nicholas Katzenbach and taking into account the first-class cast that was put together for production, we decided to take a look. “Just Cause,” although not a horrible film, takes too many liberties with original material that Jeb Stewart did not quite succeed in his appeal. Directed by Arne Glimcher. <br /> <br /> The first thing we think about when a young black is being diverted to the local police station for questioning is police brutality. After all, Sheriff Tanny Brown and police officer Wilcox do not show pity for beating Bobby Earl, who is accused of killing a young white girl. We are horrified by what the officers do to the prisoner. <br /> <br /> Then the scene changes. Evangeline, the grandmother of Bobby Earl, goes north to ask the distinguished Harvard professor, a retired lawyer, a young man, for Paul Armstrong to protect him. She, the old woman, is convincing enough for Armstrong to look at the matter. He is also convinced of the innocence of the young man. <br /> <br /> This is not quite what we thought. When Blair Sullivan, a man who is serving a sentence in the same institution as Bobby Earle, comes forward to talk about how he is associated with the murder of a young girl, and changes the dynamics of the case. The way he plays in the film serves to confuse the viewer and distract Armstrong from reaching the truth. <br /> <br /> This thriller appeals to Sean Connery, who plays Armstrong. Laurence Fishburne, an intense actor, makes an excellent impression as a sheriff who, as far as we can see, is guilty of insulting his prisoner. Ed Harris has a great opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and young Scarlett Johansson play second role. <br /> <br /> The film, even with its flaws, will not disappoint.
