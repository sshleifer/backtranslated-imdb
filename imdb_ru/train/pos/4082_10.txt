Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of narration, but it is often compared to Walt Disney. This is so unfair, because from Miyazaki's films it becomes obvious that he is the best artist. He really has the gift of excitement for both adults and children, and Laputa is truly one amazing trip. <br /> <br /> But where can I start to describe the film, so magical and exciting! Miyazaki's works never cease to amaze me. “Laputa” is a great adventure, and I wonder how a film can be so full of details and imagination. Ask yourself: if you dream of such a grand and magical adventure, what will it look like? The answer will be to sit down at some place and look at Laputo, because this is indeed a childish fantasy that has become a reality. Every minute of the film is rich and fascinating ... from chasing the train to amazing air flights ... and to the wonderful view of the most floating castle. Not to mention Joe Hisaishi's excellent score! Everything you ever want from an adventure film, is here.
