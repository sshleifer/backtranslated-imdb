Some of those guys who watch movies and complain about them for life forget something: the DVD menu system. I tell you, people, I watched as the main screen repeats this about 35 times. It was awesome. The cinematic tapestry of cascade brilliance that brought me from where it was, which was the very beginning. Many times the amount and Bam! I was connected. Again and again and again. And again. <br /> <br /> "Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." And this is just the soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I lay in bed, curled up with my Vaio. It rains on a flat roof, and today is soft, soft again. The cat is comfortable and my ankle, which crosses me, has already rested. I popped on the DVD. I was hypnotized. All night long. "doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." <br /> <br /> Blob. See it. Steve Quinn, two policemen and one girl in a dress. Two thumbs up!
