How tasty my little Frenchman was telling a story that is alternately sad, scary and life-affirming. It ends with a cruel finale, which, as you knew, was supposed to happen, even if you were hoping — perhaps even believing — that would not happen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is the film’s greatest strength: it skillfully plays with your emotions and expectations, and then drops a bomb on you. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a cinema theory class at USC in the mid-90s. It is not easy to find, but it is definitely worth hunting.
