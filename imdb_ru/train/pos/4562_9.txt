Yesterday I saw this movie on DVD and was stunned and stunned. The unaffected DDL game just blew my mind, and I was surprised by the whole cast and its great game. All the characters were so authentic for me that I really took DDL for Cristi Burns and Brenda Fricker for his mom. Go and see! You will cry, but you will have a wonderful catharsis! In addition, he teaches you one important lesson: definition is everything. You can be a cripple in the poor suburbs of Dublin, but when you are strong enough, you will not have any problems. If you can only control your left foot, you are still good enough to be an artist or a writer. The worst thing you can do when you have mental problems is to indulge in self-pity. It will not lead you anywhere, and the only person who will feel sorry for you will be himself.
