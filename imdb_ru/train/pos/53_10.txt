Home number I was very surprised. Compared to other films that have been written about Columbine High School, this one is the best. The home room does not show school shooting, but the consequences and influence of the community and the city. The film focuses on two opposite characters: Alesia (Busy Phillips) and Dina (Erika Christensen). Alexia is an outcast who witnessed the whole shooting. It seems she does not show any emotion about this. Dinna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim. Alexia is forced to visit Dinna in the hospital to get a higher education. In the meantime, the police are investigating Alessiaâ€™s case, since she could have known that the shooting should have happened. Alecia and Deanna are very different and do not get along at first. In the end, they develop mutual understanding with each other and become friends. (very club style for breakfast). Home Room Perfectly shows the power of intimacy and bustle after school shooting. I would recommend this film to everyone.
