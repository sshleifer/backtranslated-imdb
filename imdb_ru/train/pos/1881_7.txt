As a drunk millionaire playboy by Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is perfect as an adult who has fallen into the trap of childhood. As it turned out, the role is so suited Moore that he was trapped as an actor. Soon, many disappointments followed (including the pale continuation of this film), but this does not detract from the charm or appeal of this picture, which is well-written and directed. Some of Moore’s drunken scenes are forced, parts of the film are shaky, but the cast plays with such pleasure that it is difficult to resist the film. He has a very big heart and gives Oscar winner John Gilgud the artful, dry, funny role of the valet of Arthur, Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is amazing, and they have a wonderful connection. Lisa Minnelli (as a love interest with blue collars) is impudent in a restrained manner, and Moore is impudent, but agile and lively; he never dismissed Arthur’s shadow, but at least we have this career document. *** from ****
