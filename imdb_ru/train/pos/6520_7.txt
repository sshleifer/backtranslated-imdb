The original film DeMille was made in 1938 with the Frederick brand. Very good movie indeed. Hollywood love for remakes brings us a rather interesting film with Yul Brynner in the title role. He, of course, was great because he almost always appeared in all his films. Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was a stroke of genius. However, the film did get a bit longer in some places. It does not move at the pace of the 1938 version. However, this is a fun movie that is worth watching at least once.
