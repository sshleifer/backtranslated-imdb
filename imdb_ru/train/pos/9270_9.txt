Before reading this review, I must point out that this is in no way a statement against the Iranian people ... if you really want to read something in it, then I hope you see that I am against politicians in general ... but if you want to be offended ... I can not help you! <br /> <br /> Not in Iran, since this film is prohibited there (see the IMDb trivia for this film). What a shame, because the film is great. If it were not for "Grbavitsa", this film would have won at the International Film Festival in Berlin. <br /> <br /> By law (it was the second participant or second place, if you wish). What for? Because it is a film about oppression. It's not even that this is a complete problem for women. We are talking about the government trying to suppress people. The analogy is so obvious that the government felt the need to ban the film. But by banning it, nothing is solved and / or they can make this film disappear! <br /> <br /> Another reviewer had an excellent summary line: “The Comedy of the Tragedy,” which sums up pretty well!
