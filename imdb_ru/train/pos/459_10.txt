This is the best series of this type, which I have seen all year. I can't help thinking that this is just my luck - the series I love gets 6 episodes (and more next year), and the constant stream of police shows of cookies never ends. <br /> <br /> I think New Tricks has a lot of reasons for success. The scripts are good, and the mix of characters is gorgeous, “Acting is the best flight,” and the combination of comedy and drama is fun. Stories are not so memorable, but I don’t watch such shows. <br /> <br /> This topic is a favorite, and we were disappointed that it is not in any published edition. Great thing, the BBC is a triumph of feelings about sex appeal (except for the young constable, there is no one there, and even if he IS, he can still act!).
