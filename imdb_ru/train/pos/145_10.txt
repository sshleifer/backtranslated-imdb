The sequel to the "Kingdom" is more bloody and even more perverted. I saw only half (I was exhausted and could not sit all 5 and a half hours), but I liked what I saw. Ghosts, blood, murders, poisonings, mutated children, voodoo ... that's it! If you have a strong stomach and you like weird movies, this is for you. <br /> <br /> In addition, you do not need to look at part 1 to understand it ... you will understand it! <Br /> <br /> Does anyone know if there is a kingdom 1 and 2 on DVD? Sitting through these marathon films in a theater is exhausting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the “Kingdom 3” probably will not be - Ernst-Hugo Yaregard (Sig) died a year after it was removed. But you never know!
