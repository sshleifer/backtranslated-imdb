I expected this movie to be an ordinary romance of the 1930s. The boy meets the girl, they fall in love, the boy loses the girl, the boy eventually wins her. It's not like that at all. Clark Gable plays the cheater Eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrow. He hides from the cops when he bursts into Ruby’s apartment (Jean Harlow) to find her covered in bubbles in the bathroom, no less. Instant chemistry. It is difficult for her to play for a while, but a girl can only resist this grin for a long time. The heat between them is obvious, and there are some scenes that definitely represent the pre-production code! When the work of blackmail goes badly and Ruby gets into a boarding house for “problem girls”, she is unhappy and, thanks to the rag her neighbor gives, begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow plays beautifully with Ruby’s hardened, fast voice. She never lets Gable get all the good features! There is a particularly touching scene with her playing "their song" on the piano, which acts perfectly. The last fifteen minutes I cry every time. A truly sweet romance.
