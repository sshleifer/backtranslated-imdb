Greta Garbo's American debut in the movie is an analogy of how fate and our actions can sweep our lives as if in a stream, causing us to lose part of ourselves along the way. <br /> <br /> Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant in love with the character of Ricardo Cortes, Don Raphael, a landowner. Ricardo is also in love with her, but too easily influenced by his domineering mother. Leonora is homeless and goes to Paris, where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops her reputation as a free woman. In fact, part of her relationship is bitterness because of the abandonment of Raphael. <br /> <br /> She returns to her home to visit her family and ultimately confronts Raphael. Surprisingly, no one knows that she is famous La Brunna, and Garbo plays her role as a diva, which she really was, and appreciates such steep arrogance in her later portraits. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortez is very similar to one of them. Valentino looks in this part, and he was prepared to be a clone of Valentino MGM, although he never thought that he might actually be, and he was right. In the believable part, he is believable as a weak-willed sissy and allows himself to realistically but comically grow old at the end of the film. He cannot defeat Leonora when she returns home, and later, when he goes after her, his courage is undermined. <br /> <br /> This film is beautifully shot, with brilliant storm episodes, and the sets representing Spain of that time are authentic. Seeking. There are also some good secondary speeches by old-timers Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall and Mack Swain. <br /> <br /> Although this is a story about lost love and lost chances, I donâ€™t think that Leonora and Raphael would have been happy together because he needed a more traditional wife and she was a very professional woman and I I do not think I would be happy in a small village. The ending is true to life and gives no punches. <br /> <br /> Consider that this is the debut of the American film Garbo and the predecessor of the upcoming events
