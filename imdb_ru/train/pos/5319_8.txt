Forget this movie "B". Forget that is largely outdated. Instead, take note of writer-director Ida Lupino because he touched on a topic that at that time (1950) was taboo in Hollywood. As far as I know, it was the first film on the subject of rape and the emotional and mental consequences of this crime for its victims. <br /> <br /> While most of the cast is pedestrian at best, Mala Powers At a time when she was eighteen or nineteen years old, she perfectly plays the role of an injured young woman, Ann, who tries to escape from her “shame ". Based on her work in this film, I am surprised that she didn’t have a more successful acting career. Tod Andrews also has some wonderful moments as a minister who turns to her for help. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lupino, apparently working on a tight budget, still managed to create some memorable scenes, such as stalking through streets and alleys leading to rape, and the police force following him. And she created a bittersweet ending that made me wonder if Ann could ever have a normal life again.
