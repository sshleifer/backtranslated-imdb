I saw this film only once, on TV, and it did not repeat. This is strange if you take into account the garbage that repeats over and over. Usually, horror movies are a source of entertainment for me, but this one really scared me. <br /> <br /> DO NOT READ THE FOLLOWING BIT IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THE FILM <br /> <br /> The worst moment is when the townspeople pursue the preacher where his wife is almost dead (they poisoned her). He asks who the hell are you people anyway. One by one they give their true identities. The girl who pretended to be deaf to corrupt and seduce him said: "I am Lilith, the witch who loved Adam to Eve."
