Oh, those vile Italians. This is not the first time that they base a film on the source material without permission or knowledge, in this case, the author of the novel. Of course, this is not something that, as a rule, Italian, but quite a lot was done in the early days of the cinema, mainly because they often thought they could get away with it. The publishers of James M. Cain succeeded in keeping this film off American screens until 1976, but, nevertheless, the film itself became a bit of a well-known classic. <br /> <br /> The film is not as good to watch as it was in 1946 in America. version, but, nevertheless, this is a great movie. This is, of course, not least because the film is a very strong story that is intriguing and gives the film great characters and realism. He follows the novel quite closely and, therefore, for the most part coincides with other versions of his film story, with the difference that it is set in the Italian environment. <br /> <br /> Leave it to the Italians to make a film about life and the real people in it. These early dramas always have a very realistic feeling and therefore are also very interesting to watch. Unfortunately, the film lost some of its strength by the end, when the film began to be felt a little long and stretching in parts. The film could easily have ended 15 minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> However, I canâ€™t say more about this movie. This is simply great material based on equally brilliant and strong source material. An impressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti, who continued to make many more remarkable and memorable Italian drama films. <br /> <br /> 8/10
