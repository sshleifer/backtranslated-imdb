I remember seeing it at the cinema in Salem (where I visited almost every Saturday at the Kiddie Matini) in Dayton, Ohio, when I was a little boy and never forgot about it. It just amazed me and my friends. I wish there was some way to see it again! I tried to find some sort of shorts or something like that, but to no avail. I just recently discovered that it was a Cousteau film, and it struck me even more. How the hell did he do it, I don't understand. At some point, the fish really is at the mouth of the cat, if I remember correctly! If anyone could help me find a way to see it again, I would be extremely grateful!
