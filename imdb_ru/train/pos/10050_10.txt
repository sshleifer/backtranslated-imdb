Daddy Daniela Steele, what a refreshing story. This film glorified the importance of family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is it? At these times, “Heather has two moms” (or something else, you fill in the blanks), it's easy to see why this topic is not for everyone. I hoped that the roles of the father would be outstanding, and this will be another saga about Daniel Stille. How annoying this is the end. Each character was important and did an incredible job fulfilling his role. I would really like every character to develop over the years. I really liked this movie and I will watch it defiantly every time it is turned on. Good story, good acting, and I hope that this is not a spoiler, but not obsessive sex or a bad language. Yes, it touched my heart. Warning, prepare Kleenex. What I find sad is that this aspect of family life is rarely portrayed today in our entertainment, be it television or. Films. Daniel, if you listen, You go, girl, give us more.
