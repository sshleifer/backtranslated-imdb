Listening to an audiobook, Camppel Scott is a reader. I was so excited to hear his voice, and this brought back my disappointment that the “Six Degrees” were canceled. It seems that they never keep a good show on the air long enough to attract an audience that can connect with the history of the show. What a shame and shame on the network for not giving this show the chance of a full season. It was a great show to watch with a great cast. The network gave a second chance to “People in the Trees”, the witch is also a great show, but they shot “The Invasion”, and it was also something completely different than the same old and old themes. Why the networks can't get it right.
