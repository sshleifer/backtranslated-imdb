I had a hell of a good time looking through this picture, and was surprised by its more erudite features. Firstly, the film is undoubtedly cheaper production with its cardboard sets, limited settings and creative scientific props. The action ranges from very bad (two strippers), hardly professional (Evers Emblem as lead man), Gothic exaggeration (Leslie Daniels as Kurt's assistant) to first-class Virginia Leith as a headless victim living against her good will. science and lustful passions of her bride. The scripts, though, are very good, and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this kind. There are many questions about the role that science and medicine play in our lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is in many ways thoughtful. However, do not be fooled by his real intention. This is a sad story about a man obsessed with his abilities in medical science, who wants to connect his dead girlfriend's head with a perfect body, thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best body and soul. Another very bright aspect of the film is saxophone music, which resonates strongly every time the doctor visits the city for beautiful women.
