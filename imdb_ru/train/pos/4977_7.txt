So many educational films are nothing short of stunning hard work, saved only by the fact that MST3K mocks them (it comes to mind “Why study industrial art?”). The “gorgeous Hemo” is actually pretty well made. It is all about blood, heart and circulatory system. I admit that I don’t remember all of this, but he does a good job explaining everything, keeping it serious but interesting. I think you can always count on a foray in June (the most famous voice of Rocky Squirrel, she plays deer here). <br /> <br /> Since Chemo Magnificent itself can be difficult to find, probably the best place to see it in Gremlins: the class watches him while the gremlin is being formed.
