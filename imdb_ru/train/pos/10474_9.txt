I was surprised by this movie. It contained the fundamental elements of depression, grief, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and communication. It was not just about a genius musician who reached the bottom, but about a man overwhelmed with grief, resolutely trying to find solace in his music. He finds a companion who comes up with his problems. Claire and Des were able to give each other friendship and love, but, more importantly, to conclude about the events that shaped their lives for the worse. <br /> <br /> Des is an unlikely character by today's rock star standards. And yet he has a musical genius. He also has an event in his past that made him stagnate, while the things around him literally fall into ruin. He focuses on creating his whale music, in fact it becomes an obsession for him. <br /> <br /> Claire is a street child who needs a place to stay. She finds hidden talents while in the company of Des. She also finds a mutual friend who accepts her. She learns to trust him for a certain period of time. <br /> <br /> These two find love for each other. Not a mind-blowing, sex-filled kind of passion, but love, where friendship and understanding mean more. For two people who have suffered, they find confidence together.
