I personally have seen many Disney films in my life, although absolutely none of them in any way matched Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I personally would not crossbreed live action with animation, it was an improvement in trying to dress people into animation characters. The film tells about three evacuees from the Second World War who are sent to a country with a quiet and clumsy woman in society. I would have to say that the casting was brilliant. Angela Landsbury made the perfect Miss Price, while David Tomilson aroused a great desperate love interest of the artist. The ends always surprise me, and this was no exception. It was neither happy nor sad, although I do not know whether it was intentional. The dialogue was not great, but considering that it was designed for children's films, this is normal. In general, I would give a play nine out of ten, a dialogue six out of ten, casting nine out of ten and costumes eight out of ten.
