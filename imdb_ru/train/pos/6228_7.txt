Another fun, witty, foamy RKO musical with Aster and Rogers. FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming film. Although he lacks outstanding remarkable melodies of SWNG TIME (although the final issue “Facing Music and Dance” is one of the best on the team and rightly so), it is incredibly pleasant, since these two people can hardly make mistakes in the 1930s Once again, the plot is easy and forgettable, but watching Fred and Ginger dance together is paradise. These two gave more romance and magic in the dance than many couples in films on a huge love scene. Although there are the best musicals of Fred and Ginger, this is definitely a must-see.
