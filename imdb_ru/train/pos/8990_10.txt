A film about Anton Newcomb. The music and career of the two groups is just a background. It’s fair that Newcombe has the final word on the film, which you can find in the News section of the brianjonestown massacre website. I would link it here, but IMDb will not allow it. <br /> <br /> Documentary filmmakers are limited by what captures the camera, as well as the need to assemble a coherent narrative of several random instances when an accident placed a camera lens on the line of sight with a corresponding event. In Dig !, Fortune smiled at Dandy Warhols, capturing their rise to the status of candidates for pop idols, when they created ingenious pop confectionery for mass consumption, primarily “Bohemian Like You”, a song that made them global favorites thanks to mobile phone ad. <br /> <br /> There is no such luck for the slaughter of Brian Johnstown. The film does little of what made the original BJM line magnificent, with the exception of one editing, lasting about a minute, showing how Newcombe creates / records several short instrumental parts, which are unremarkable in themselves, and completes the sequence with Lush, the twinkling sounds that were supposed to be in Newcomb’s head and spirit before they could enter the world. <br /> <br /> Three comments accompany the film; one from the filmmakers, and two from the band members (the BJM track is only former members, and without Newcomb). Both Warhols and BJM graduates point out this editing sequence as the “best” bit in the film, and I agree that, given the focus of the film on Anton Newcomb, this is the only part of the film that sheds proper light on his gift and seems too short in order to give the proper balance to this attempted portrait of the "tortured artist." <br /> <br /> An interesting thing in the comments is that, unlike films, they are recorded in real time — one long take — which can be a more honest revelation than a documentary that is mainly formed through editing. <br /> <br /> Dandy are not very good in their comments. If the world of rock and roll expands the life experience of high school students to its inhabitants - I suppose, then these are mods - these are obsessed types of neat ones, those who listen to rock, because this is what their peers do, and the BJM Crew looks like as half-rejected, half-driven out outsiders (for insiders such as dandy, "losers"), who are a true rock spirit. Joel Gion of BJM, who talks about many things, tells me about the film when he says (paraphrasing): “We must not forget that Anton was able to do the only thing he ever said that he wanted to do. great music. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, dandy laugh too easily at every outrageous show during Newcomb’s breakup (all BJM footage ended here in 1997, before Newcomb dropped heroin). Courtney Taylor-Taylor’s discussion of Newcomb’s commitment to his vision comes down to the following: “He is 37 years old and still lives in his car. You can download all of his work on his website. He is so tired of being deceived by everyone, giving it all away. He could have done mint. "You can practically hear how he shakes his head incredulously. <br /> <br /> The film’s authors cannot be blamed for the film’s shortcomings; rather, the difficulties of documentary form and the loss of cooperation from the film make this portrait Newcomb is so fragmentary. But this is probably the best we can get outside of his music. <br /> <br /> I rented only one disc that has this feature. Most of the extras are on the second disc. Without renting it out, I put in my order to buy a set.
