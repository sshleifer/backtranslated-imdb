Andy McDowell's facial expressions are great again in this movie. When you are 40 years old and have been alone for a while (or your whole life), you may feel that you are losing strength. The film is a pleasant reminder that love can be found anywhere if your antennas are very active. I liked the quick sexual relationship, which should be unusual for an ordinary school teacher (McDowell). Her former student is pretty cute, still in love with her teacher for so long. <br /> <br /> Although there are some moments that seemed unreal or impractical to me. For example, in a scene where the jealousy of other womenâ€™s envy and the scene were created so that Andy MacDowell left the young man, would a mature policeman (another MacDowell friend) allow his friend to do such a sinister act? Is it easy for someone not to stop in front of the car? Of course, accidents happen all the time, but I was hoping to see how the heroine would come out in a happy marriage with the first man with whom she came in contact (was this the hardest thing to believe !! For such a beautiful woman to be lonely for so long ??). .. <br /> <br /> Movie producers may be aware of the fact that many romantics between an elderly woman and a young man do not last long. In addition, they know that the happy end will not please the public, especially jealous women over 40, who are waiting for some miracles. A sad end to a glimmer of hope for a sad woman who has lost her true love is sweet, but if a man continues to live, will it last? How long? Nobody knows. However, this is a movie that makes you want to watch it again sometime later ... maybe in a year.
