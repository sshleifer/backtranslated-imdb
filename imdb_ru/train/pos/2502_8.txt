This film surprised me! Having never heard of Heide Gakt, I did not expect much! The reason I wanted to watch this film was because someone mentioned that the film contains serious John Woo-style action movies! I am usually very careful when it is stated! There is only one John Woo, and so far this day there has not been a single director who approaches his magnificence when it comes to acting! The fact that the "Child of the Moon" will portray a vampire, convinced me even more! How can you go wrong with guns, flaming vampires! Sounds promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed in this movie was that the pace was significantly slow! It takes time to set the mood! This movie contains some good Hong Kong style racing scenes! But "Child of the Moon" is not an action movie! This is a drama about friendship and loyalty! The focus is on the characters and their relationship to each other! The performers Hyde and Gackt are good at acting and are very believable as friends! The only problem I had with the plot! A couple of times the film seems to have missed several years, without explaining what happened and why they should have missed! Example: When one of the gang members dies (a very dramatic moment), Alexander Van sees Kay (Hyde) drink the blood of one of the attackers! Without warning and explanation, the film misses nine nine years, and most friends are no longer together! Also without good reason, Son (Alexander Van) and Shaw (Gackt) must kill each other! I know this is done to add some serious drama! Because of the actors, this is very effective, but sometimes it makes! In addition to the shortcomings of the plot, this film has an atmosphere and appeal that makes it hard not to love this film! It is difficult to explain why this film is wonderful! But it is just like that! The overall impression you get is sincere and sincere!
