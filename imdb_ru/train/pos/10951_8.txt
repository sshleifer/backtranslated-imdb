Big S does not play with taboos and does not impose any plans, say, Mencia or Chapelle (although I like both of them). She argues the obvious in subtle, almost subconscious remarks. Her show will not change the world, nor is it intended. But, along with jolly Brian Posen and ex-boyfriend of Paget Brewster Jay Johnston from Mr. Shaw, this is one evil show with an appetite for destruction! My side was completely destroyed by the first episode. Listen, I love this woman and, like her famous boyfriend Jimmy Kimmel, she just talks about her and lets the viewer escape. The best kind of comedy around. Sharing anything and anyone, like “Mary Poppins” in the second episode, when she sings to fake birds to quickly comment on public and student nonsensical nonsense. This is highly recommended, but only for those who still have a funny bone (and she did not lose it during the last procedure with liposuction or tits).
