After seeing Dick Tracy at the Future Shop for $ 6.99, I decided to try it without any prior knowledge and be a big fan of mafia and crime films. I was very surprised to see a very funny, intelligent entertainment film with solid performances everywhere. The film is progressing well, he has, of course, another solid performance from Warren Beatty, but Al Pacino and Madonna are the real outstanding people of the film. I was happy to know that Pacino was nominated for his performance as the main gangster trying to destroy the city. Madonna was gorgeous, like a girl in need, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. If you want to watch a funny, smart movie with a great game and a solid script, then try Dick Tracy. I do not think you will be disappointed. And watch the cameos from Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Katie Bates and Dustin Hoffman and others.
