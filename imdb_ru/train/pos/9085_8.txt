I see a lot of really negative messages from people who wrote in August, although the film was not released in the United States, at least until mid-September. Maybe these are unfortunate immigrants living in South Korea who saw it early. I am in the USA and just saw it today. I thought the special effects were excellent, better than the trailer. The story was not Western, but I think we are all used to it from many other films. It was not at all difficult to follow. The leading game was weak, but other people were pretty good. There was also humor everywhere. I rated it at 8 because I had a good time watching it, to which I was going.
