His Hollywood imitating Daytiem soap operas in all its glory! This is a pleasure that we never see. Great characters and great lines. Whoopi is funny ..... Sally Field is so excited .... Gary Marshall's lines are a riot .... this is what I love about good comedies. Never afraid to poke fun at myself !!!!!! The sets were great .... The wardrobe was up to the mark, and the stab in the back of the Montana Morehead evoked devilish enjoyment. Terry Hatcher, in the role of Dr. Monica Demonico, didn’t have enough lines, but still she’s great and fun on the screen. I would like to know how the idea of ​​this film originated. I have never seen a group of people get so much pleasure from creating comedy work! Soap should be, and I'm waiting for the DVD!
