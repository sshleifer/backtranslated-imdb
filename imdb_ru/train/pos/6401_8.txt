Men of Honor have many wonderful aspects. Good action movies, a lot of “pleasant” scenes, a good musical score, but the role that really makes the film is a great acting game. Mainly by Robert Deniro. The story of Men of Honor is focused on Carla Brashire, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., who wants to become the first African American deep-sea diver in the fleet. This chronicles his hard struggle from being a poor farmer to a diving school and even more. This is a good story, but it seems that it was done many times before. A person, in spite of everything, will not give up until he reaches his goals, which he set for some sentimental reason many years ago. This might have happened, but much of the struggle of the Brashear faces in the film is questionable, including C.O. from the diving school, interfering with his last test. However, all this is compensated by the scene when Robert Deniro finally enters the film. Deniro plays the head of Mater Sunday, a diving school teacher that Brashear attends. As soon as Deniro enters, he misses this atmosphere of extreme arrogance that you cannot hate unless you have an incredible willpower. Until the end of the film, Deniro makes a few speeches that will make you laugh at how cool he is, but you are too stunned by how he knocks them out. In the end, you have to doubt certain aspects of the film, but admit that, if it were true, it would make you sit down at your place by the first twenty minutes.
