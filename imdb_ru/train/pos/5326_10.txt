The Beatles' Birth, being a televised American film released in the fall of 1979, was in fact the best film about four children from Liverpool who revolutionized the music industry and the world. As told former Beatle Pete Best. The performance of the entire cast is excellent, but especially for Stephen McKenna as John Lennon and Rod Culbertson as Paul McCartney. The film was shot by the legend of the era of rock and roll Dick Clark. Who a year earlier, in 1978, made another television film that stood the test of time with “Kurt Rousell” in the lead role in another musical legend; "ELVIS". This film was shot by an unknown director named "John Carpenter", who shot other successful films, such as; Halloween, Escape from New York and Things. The same can be said about the Beatles' Birth Director Richard Markwande. He continued to lead other theatrical blockbusters, such as Return of the Jedi to Star Wars, Eye of the Needle, and Jagged Edge among many. The only other film that tells the story of Fab Four, which I know of, is Back Beat, which was shown in a theatrical production in 1994. However, critics did not care about this, as did the public, because it did not have a long time. longevity in the theater. The Beatles Birth is a very charming and simplistic film about the beginning of the legend, the struggle and the difficulties that they faced and which reached the top of success when they arrive in New York and appear on the Ed Sullivan show in 1964 I highly recommend this movie.
