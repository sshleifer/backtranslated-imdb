I agree with another user here and have to say that this is one of the best Kung Fu movies! I watched it in childhood and loved it very much! The forest scenes are awesome, and you really can empathize with this guy because he is treated like an outcast. Good humor and fantastic kung fu, this movie is awesome! If you like kung fu, you will like it !!!
