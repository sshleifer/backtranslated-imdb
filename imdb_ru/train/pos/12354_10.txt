A wonderful movie to watch with amazing scenes and talented actors such as Misa Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes of viewing, your eyes are looking at the screen and you are not doing anything, just breathe the atmosphere of the film, expecting the fate to bring the characters. This film makes you leave your position as a standard audience, it takes you, it makes you part of the story ... The costumes and scenery are great; especially the Okiyas area is skillfully built. This is definitely not very Akira Kurosawa, but he still receives a lot from the master, especially the stylistic narration tells us that we are in an outstanding film country, which is rather far from Hollywood brilliance.
