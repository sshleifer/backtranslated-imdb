Stylishly, the powerful supreme gangster Frankie Diomedes (always stunning Lee Van Cleef in perfect rough form) is himself arrested and sent to prison so that he can erase the traitor without detection. A dumb little fool and a wise wannabe Tony Breda are caught (friendly image of Tony Lo Bianco). Frank and Tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank escape from the joint and helps him in his desire to take revenge on a rival group of thugs led by the ruthless Louis Annunziata (played well by Jean Rochefort). Director Michel Lupo, working on the exciting script of Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, tells a neat story in a constant vigorous tempo, maintains a rather rough, but sometimes frivolous tone and sets up inspiring plot plays with a significant tearing brio (a rough, difficult fight in prison and dragging out. in mondo style as exciting moments). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco demonstrate pleasant, free and fascinating chemistry on the screen; the relationship between their characters alternately funny and touching. The delightful Edwige Fenech, alas, is not as much as the tearful friend of Tony, Orchid, but at least she can expose her insanely luxurious and voluptuous body in a highly valued gratis scene with a naked shower. The unique, pulsating, syncopated funk / jazz Reese Ortolani certainly amazes the soul-cool place. The polished cinematography of Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is also impressive. A really elegant and interesting little winner.
