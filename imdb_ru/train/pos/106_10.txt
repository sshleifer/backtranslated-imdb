Von Trier's first film I ever saw broke the waves. Of course, a good movie, but it definitely stands in the shadow of Europe. Europe tells the story of a young German American who wants to experience Germany immediately after the Second World War. He takes a job, which his uncle arranged for him as a conductor in a luxurious train. Because of his work, he travels to almost completely destroyed Germany, meets with the murders of traitors, and hunts former Nazi party members. Society suffers from corruption. His uncle narrowed his mind by focusing on work, which he also has as a conductor on the train. By coincidence, the protagonist is involved in a bombing and terrorism group called "werewolves", they put pressure on him to help them set bombs on trains. The atmosphere is amazing. The spectator is taken from scene to scene by a person who is trying to put the viewer under hypnosis, and then hopes to wake you up in a new scene. Just when you think you've seen a lot !!!!!!! Europe!!
