There were a lot of science fiction films of the 50s. These were big jokes for foreign theaters. Many of them were shit even then. This film and “The Day When Earth Has Stopped” stand out, and both are well aged in their own way. From the very beginning, with its eerie musical score (which still sounds strange, since the terms are almost never used) Forbidden Planet takes you to a place where there has never been a single person before. Speaking of Star Trek, there is so much material in this film that got into Star Trek TOS as a pilot for the series; from interactive captain / first assistant / doctor, mad scientist, alien creatures, babies in a short skirt, computer intelligence; It's all de riger now, but it was the first of its kind. In addition, he has a good acting and well-executed artwork, which even today causes a certain fear of images. See how Crell’s huge machine is successfully depicted with some real depth. I saw it as a child (at the entrance: 0) when it was a new film, and it scared me. Of course, every film that was even dimly intimidating did then, but I remember how worried I was about the invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a film that a science fiction fan can watch several times and find something new with each viewing.
