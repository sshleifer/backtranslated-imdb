I really liked this movie. At times, the humor was a bit absent, but I liked how the story went from dramatic to serious throughout the entire film. This is the only second film where I saw Verdone playing (the other was “Un sacco bello”), and I understand why Italians consider it tedious, but he thinks that he played his loving father role well. <br /> <br /> My only flaw in this film was that I knew that it happened in Italy — somewhere in the center or in the south, I suppose, but I felt that there was no idea about place This film could have been held in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Delhi ... I always think that it is important for films to have a place to give viewers something they can relate to. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian films, then I think you will like it. This is not Fellini or Rossellini - this is not realism or neorealism. This is a funny story with serious moments that can really happen to each of us.
