Although I wanted to watch this movie since I first saw the trailer, I was deeply surprised by this movie. Although some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed too cartoony, â€œthe dark nature of the film really makes this process completely different. Instead of feeling happy and happy, this film leads you in a different direction, which, as it turned out, uplifting, but also causes concern. Most children will not understand some of the dark moments in the film, which makes this film watchable for adults. I was also impressed with the cinematography, using animation and digital animation to create a single network of pan and tilt. The music was solid again, proving that Hans Zimmer is the best guy when it comes to animated scores, and I never thought I would say that I really like the music of Brian Adams.
