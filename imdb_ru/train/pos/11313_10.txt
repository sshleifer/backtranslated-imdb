Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) - a young and beautiful tramp who arrives at a road bar. He meets the young, beautiful and dissatisfied wife of Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai) and her old and fat husband Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa), the bar owners. He exchanges his mechanical skills in food and shelter, and he has an affair with Giovanna. They both decided to kill Giuseppe, having made a car accident. Guilt and the effect of the police influence their relationship. This masterpiece ends in a tragic way. The noir and neo-realistic Lucino Visconti film is outstanding. For the first time I watch this version of "The postman always calls twice." I liked the 1946 version with Lana Turner and the 1981 version, where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the sexiest scenes in cinema history, but this one is definitely the best. My voice is ten.
