The problem with the 1985 version of the film is simple; Indiana Jones was so closely modeled after Alan Quartermain (or at least Alan Quartermain is a character type) that the director of '85 made a mistake by sacking IJ films for dialogue and history too deep. What you got as a finished product was a random mess named Alan Quartermain, in a jagged jumble of cheap imitation of IJ saga (with a touch of Austin Powers Esq. Here and there). <br /> <br /> Many critics have called him a “great parody” or “unintended comedy.” Unintentional word. This film has never been meant for humor; witty, yes, but not with humor. Unfortunately, this is stupid, not witty. <br /> <br /> With this new M4TV mini-series, you will get much more storyline, character development, solid images and a wonderful, even fascinating mix. This story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors, but deservedly so, since this version carries with it a real storyline, not just action and Eye Candy. Although it includes both action and Eye Candy, it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version, forgetting everything about IJ and going back to the original materials for AQ, creating a beautiful, well thought out plot and some nice additions. sub-sites. <br /> <br /> Now this attempt is not the most extravagant action game that Indiana Jones represents. And this is not a bad attempt to be one. This vehicle, driven by plot and character, is an excellent rendition of the AQ / KSM saga. Filmed on location in South Africa, viewers are provided with wonderful (if desert) perspectives, Aboriginal SA cultures, and some good wildlife shots to blend seamlessly with the performances and storyline here. <br /> <br /> Steve Boyum totally surprised me with this, since I was never the only one to subscribe to his vision. In fact, I didn’t like most of his work as a director before this attempt. I hope this is more of a new vein of talent and less of an accident than it seems. <br /> <br /> This version is rated at 9.8 / 10 points on a TV scale of ... <br /> <br /> The monster :.
