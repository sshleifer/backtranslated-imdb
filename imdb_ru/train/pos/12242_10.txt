I consider this film to be a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4-5 times to see it in order to understand what a wonderful film it was. First, he describes the face of the Second World War, which we usually do not see in Hollywood films. In particular, the German soldiers, the army and the Nazi government are shown to be more "humanized." One of the facts that struck me the most was the mention in the end of the murder film that took place in the forest in the last 20s ... this forest is the place where the last chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz are taking place: these are the forests where Reinhold kills Mize. Another tip for those who like the details is the door view. Fassbinder is obsessed with changes in people every time they pass through a door or a door opens. Many doors are shown on the screen, open and closed. And the characters change their individuality, their actions, etc. Every time this happens. Did you notice it?
