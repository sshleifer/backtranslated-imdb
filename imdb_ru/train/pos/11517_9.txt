If you like Cleese and all the British “Piton” humor of that time, then this little gem is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a real pleasure! <br /> <br /> I saw it with friends on TV when it just came out, and his classic quotes were part of our jokes for 30 years, and will last forever! I have it on tape and it is constantly appreciated. <br /> <br /> Perhaps some reviewers take this too seriously. <br /> <br /> I cannot believe that it is now available only in the US (NTSC of course), and not in the UK, where it should be an integral part of the history of British humor !!
