No, not really, but this is a really very good film and, unfortunately, a forgotten stone. Black and white is suitable for the film. <br /> <br /> Direct formula, the guy had a plague, and the authorities must hunt down all those with whom he contacted before they die. <br /> <br /> A very good director, and the acting is great. Richard Widmark as a male leader is good, but he is completely obscured by acting stakes by Paul Douglas as a police captain, and Jack Palans (never better) and Zero Mostel as villains. Unfortunately, Palance continued to play similar characters in some truly second-rate gangster or war films.
