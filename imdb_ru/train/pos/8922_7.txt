The only thing that is noteworthy in this film is that it was the first major lead role of Steve McQueen. <br /> <br /> McQueen's talent is undeveloped and rude, but refreshingly honest in this little science horror film. Steve shows himself as an anti-stalking actor who loves the hot rod, who in five years will become a polished icon of the film industry. <br /> <br /> McQueen will later say that he hated this film and that "he was a drop." But everyone has to start somewhere, and The Blob is sweet, fresh and innocent. If we all stayed that way. <br /> <br /> The plot develops rapidly and, although predictable, it’s still an interesting hour or so. And it’s really interesting to see Steve McQueen before he became King Cool (and Anita Corso, before she became Andy Taylor’s friend). A close friend sent me a DVD a while ago, and this is a valuable addition to my Steve McQueen film collection.
