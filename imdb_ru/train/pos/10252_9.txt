After watching “Guinea Pig”, two questions come to mind (besides “Am I really a psychopath to watch this?”): “Is it snuff?” The answer is no; although this is the closest thing to the snuff film I've ever seen. And then: "Where the hell did they find this girl?" Because she was tortured for 45 minutes without explaining the reasons (in fact, there is nothing more in this film!): They cut off her nails, beat her with hands, feet, tools, infected larvae ... and a lot more until the final scene (I'm I still don’t know how they did it). Since it belongs to the “Japanese underground scene”, it is obvious that she did not receive much money. So what were her (their) motives? <br /> <br /> I saw it in Japanese without subtitles, but this is not a problem (no real conversations, the boys just insult her in several scenes). I have not seen all the series, but the first Guinea pig is not known as the best. However, I rated it 8 because if the goal was to make people believe it was snuff, the problem is pretty good (ask Charlie Sheen, the actor). But I think they could go further, which they did in the following. <br /> <br /> Another movie that I hide from my parents. <br /> <br /> 8/10
