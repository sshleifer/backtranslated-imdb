I first saw this film when I was a freshman in high school, and the film stuck with me for many years. It's not about the soundtrack, or the cinema, or even dialogue and a few bad actions, but about educational purposes, and the main idea of ​​this message. It is not a sin to have a child when you are still a teenager and are still in high school, and this is not so bad, but this is a problem. Many girls I knew now have children, and I think they never watched this wonderful film, and if they did, they clearly did not understand the meaning of all this. The point is not to risk when you are in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. This is not a myth. You don't have to lose your dreams, but they have to take a back seat in your future, because you have a child that you need to think about first. <br /> <br /> In this film there is a clear idea: just SAY "NO!
