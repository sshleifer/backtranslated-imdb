Artimisia was late at night. At first I did not think that I would like it, but seeing that I did not want to sleep and nothing else happened, I continued to observe and felt intrigued by young Arthymys, virgin, clean and passionate. Her affair with the elder Tassi evoked recognizable feelings. Despite the fact that the film is based on a very romantic level, and not on reality, I loved it much more than ordinary biographies or costumed dramas. Great game, great camera shots, great music and lyrics. I loved it, and I want more of it! :-)
