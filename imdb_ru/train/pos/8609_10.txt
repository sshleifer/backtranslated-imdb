I thought it was one of the best films I have seen in a very long time. It was a great storyline, showing that people are so confused in all respects. Recommended it to all my friends! I always liked a good storyline, and this film was one of the best I have seen in a long time. I could see that I have a daughter and I do the same thing as Natalie to learn more about her life and love. This showed that we not only live with our families; but there are also parts of our lives that we don’t share with them - because it is not in their interest to know all the details of what we don’t do and of which we are so proud. /> I look forward to another such film, and will follow it.
