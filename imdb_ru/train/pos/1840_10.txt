Great script and some of the best actors in the world. Montand gives the concept of a “lone wolf” police detective a completely new dimension of intensity and, most importantly, trust. <br /> <br /> When a typical Hollywood cop a hero loses his family, friends, and pets to kill, he is usually given a minute of grief. But when sixty seconds were over, he pulled himself together, gathered a pistol and joyfully shot at his enemies one by one. <br /> <br /> Mark Ferro from Montana, however, is really devastated - by killing his girlfriends, of course, but also finding out that she had another lover. In his confusion and anger, he does not seek revenge, but must continue to look for the real criminal, where his fingerprints are everywhere. Thus, all his actions become inevitably logical. This is the main reason why this film sticks us to our places, but definitely not the only one.
