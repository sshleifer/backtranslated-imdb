After watching this movie last night at Sundance, I realized that most of the Nakata style was first made in this movie. Here we have a lot of identical elements of the RINGU series, especially the idea that the media is a source of the supernatural. Instead of a damned video, we instead have a haunted studio and weird images appearing on the tape. In fact, the strange images appearing on the tape immediately resemble the damned video in RING. The only thing missing was the obsessive idea of ​​water that seeps into subsequent Nakata films. The final scenes are rather frightening, with a slight bow of Murnau, that when the door opens itself and the ghost enters the room, it immediately reminds me of <br /> <br /> NOSFERATU. An exciting movie that makes you think twice about going up to the podium.
