First of all, I just wanted to say that this film exposed more than any of the recent crap Hollywood has prepared from its depths. McBain is a real fighter, with more violence than most viewers can endure. It contains all the classic elements of an action movie of the late 80s - early 90s ... random, unsubstantiated acts of violence (that is, when Walken and his team fight against drug dealers to get money, which they simply discover and kill their). instead of letting them live and just taking their money), flicking their necks, guys on fire, guys who break loose from buildings, and, of course, guys who are on fire, blown off buildings. In this picture, Walken demonstrates the best qualities, capturing such memorable lines as "let's sit .......... on deck". and others who make this movie a better purchase at the cleaning stand at a local video store. If you have a thirst for blood due to unnecessary random acts of violence, rent this movie today and quench your thirst.
