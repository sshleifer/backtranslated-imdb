The typical film “De Palma”, created with a lot of styles and scenes, will take you to the edge of your place. <br /> <br /> Most likely, the style that makes this film better than the usual thriller is the style. He has some brilliantly edited scenes and some scenes that really destroy the nerves that lead you to the edge of your seat. The best scene from the movie; Scene of the museum and the killing of the elevator. There are light erotic scenes, and the tempo of the films may not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie. So this film may not be suitable for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also not bad, but it is the style that makes the film work! This can only be for fans, but ordinary viewers should appreciate the tension in the film. <br /> <br /> There is a good character played by a good actor. Michael Caine is an interesting choice of actors, and Angie Dickinson works as well as looks good (not bad for a 49-year-old child!). <br /> <br /> Pinot Donaggio's musical score is also typical for De Palma. The film is like and very suitable, just like its score for De Palma's other film, Double Body. <br /> <br /> Brilliant nerve thriller. I love De Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
