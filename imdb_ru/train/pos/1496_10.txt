I liked to catch this movie on TV very late and late, and he would not let me rest throughout the whole picture. This wonderful creepy, but mysterious looking English house with an ominous decor, worn furniture and rooms that make you wonder why someone wants to rent this house or even buy it. There are four (4) tales about this house, and every inhabitant of the house faces all sorts of problems. You will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the house, as well as the sweet singing of birds, but do not let it fool you, horror everywhere. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack," the 80s, copes well with the role of a man living at home, and even Christopher Lee, The Curse of the Scarlet Altar, 68, and his little daughter Chloe Franks (Jane Reed) make a wonderful exciting story together, for some reason his daughter likes to read WITCHCRAFT BOOKS! If you like creepy, horrible and mysterious films with a lot of surprises, this is FILM FOR YOU !!!!
