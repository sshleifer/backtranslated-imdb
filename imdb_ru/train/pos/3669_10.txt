This film reflects the absurd nature of the powerful American patriot-actor, who believes that his work (and politics) are just as important to the American people as the opinion of the president himself. Alan Bates perfectly reflects this mindset of Michael Bates, and I will remember the immortal Bates as this character. This is a film for Canadians and Americans. This is a valuable cinematic film that can captivate viewers with the magic of creating a film and show how easy it is for a producer and director to completely lose control over the will of the actors and countless external forces. Wonderfully, “Hollywood North” does not suffer from the subject that he portrays: Peter O'Brien directs with precision and complete control and commands both the serious “behind the scenes” part of the film and the film inside the film “Flight to Bogota” with clarity and insight. If you're at all interested in the wit and power of Canadian cinema, “Hollywood North” is a great place to start.
