When I heard that Patrick Swayze was finally returning to his acting career at KING SOLOMON'S MINES, I was very excited. I was expecting a great Indiana Jones adventure adventure. What I received was a 4-hour epic (with ads), which was very slow. The second and third hours could have been discarded altogether, and the story would not have suffered for it. The ending was good (there are no spoilers here), but I still wanted more. Well, all the guy can do is the booty that Swayze does in “RoadHouse 2” so that he can return to the action movie genre that made him famous. As long as you are not a fan of King Solomon’s mines than reading a book or watching the 1985 version with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, which is also not very good, but this is only an hour and forty minutes of your life instead of 4 hours.
