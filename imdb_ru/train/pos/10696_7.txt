Every time I see Nicole, I like her more. I like this movie. A woman from whom you just will not give up, but she continues to break your heart. The first film I remember was the film On Human Slavery, the version of Kim Novak - Lawrence Harvey. They talk about the correctness of the Russian language, which is spoken in this film, petty, it was enough to fool me or anyone else who does not speak Russian, I'm sure. It's funny how people miss the point. Russian guys were not very good. Finally, I have to bow my hat to Ben Chaplin, as someone else remarked, he plays with great dignity, and it was definitely hot between him and Nicole. To think guys pay for it, mind-blowing.
