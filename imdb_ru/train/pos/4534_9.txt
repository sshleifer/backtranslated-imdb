Poorly conceived as a satire D.V. Griffith Intolerance, Three Centuries was Buster Keaton's first attempt at a full-length comedy film. The only resemblance to Intolerance is the introductory scene of the "book" and the fact that such stories are edited through centuries together into a full film. According to Keaton, this style could be attributed to the fact that if it does not work out as a feature film, it can be reduced to three twin-engine ones. Fortunately, “Three Centuries” is brilliantly doing well as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines I've seen in any Keaton movie. There is nothing unique or bold in the storylines. These are simple plots “a boy meets a girl”, “a boy loses a girl”, “a boy gets a girl”, but the satire of the period is wild and set the standard for future works of Mel Brooks and all films of this genre. However, I do not believe that anyone ever led this comedy. No one can play an attractive fool, like Keaton, and the stunts in this film are some of his best. In addition, the appearance of Wallace Beery as Keaton's rival adds to the appeal of this film. Anyone who thinks the comedy of the 1920s cannot be appreciated by a modern audience should watch this movie.
