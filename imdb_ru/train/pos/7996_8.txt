Sneaky, ugly, ugly retro thriller about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!) The killers of the girl he had to protect. This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. Directed by Scott does not want to apologize for the immorality inherent in the dramatic structure of the film. Scott either does not know or does not care about 30-year social progress. I really donâ€™t think we will see a more violent movie anytime soon, so you had better go and watch this movie while you can. Despite my ruthless gloom, I think the film is a powerful example of cinema in its most sinister, exploitative and effective acts. Scott is hard to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The unusual technical aspects of this film are too effective for me to ignore. Scott's directorial choice is simply amazing, and he does an excellent job with Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls need to stay away from this, but I recommended it to those viewers who are looking for a great action-filled movie.
