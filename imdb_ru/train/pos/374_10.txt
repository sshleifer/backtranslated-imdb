Rating "10/10" Master part <br /> <br /> Several years ago I heard Spielberg comment that he would remake the film here and there if he had a chance. Well, Mr. Spielberg, I think that there is nothing perfect, but this film - together with the Schindler list - is your best. Even Oprah works well in this! <br /> <br /> What struck me most was the realism of the story and drama. Similar things happened and still happen in the world.
