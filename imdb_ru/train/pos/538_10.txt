“Return to the Lake House” is perhaps one of the few sequels that can match the original. He had black humor, good expectation, beautiful girls and, of course, a psycho-killer. What are we missing? I think nothing. Except that we have a small amount of blood and nudity left, because it was made for television. In addition to being one of the best sequels, this is one of the best thrillers for the whole family. Recommended for everyone.
