The Stone Boy is an almost forgotten drama of the 1980s. Considering how many famous or soon famous people in the film, one may wonder how this could be so lost. This is a slow, capricious, but touching story about a tragedy that happens to a farming family. The film is more or less an indictment of the stoic values ​​of the Midwest and the suppression of emotions. The film will not be for every taste, but everyone who can appreciate the real human drama should like it. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, we see two brothers leaving early in the morning to take some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if they are lucky. Rising through a barbed wire fence, the pistol is accidentally discharged, and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother. These boys apparently never took a hunter’s safety course. So that the two men could correctly pass through the fence with one gun as follows: The first person will crawl through. The second person then hands him a gun over the fence. Then the first man lowers the pistol and helps the other through the fence. In no case, no man should keep his hands on the gun and on the fence. <br /> <br /> In any case, after his brother is killed, 12-year-old Arnold returns to his world. He doesn't even run for help after his brother is shot dead. He just goes ahead, collects peas and later tells his family about the accident. During the funeral or the investigation, Arnold never showed any regret or regret. His family seems to be avoiding him. They may even be angry with him for killing his brother. The ornamental uncle played by Frederick Forrest is outwardly upset by Arnold, although the death of his older brother allows him to strike at the girlfriend of the child. Arnold's parents do not seem to understand what to do with their son. They really don't even try to talk to him. The only person with whom he can communicate is his grandfather, played by Wilford Brimley in typical grandfather's skill. After a while, Arnold even approaches with an old timer. <br /> <br /> Nothing seems to force Arnold to open until he sets off on a strange journey to Reno-Nevada to find his uncle’s ex-wife in an inexplicable way. As soon as he meets her, he begins to come out of his shell after apologizing to her for parting with her marriage, starting the entire turmoil of the family with an accident. From this point on, the film becomes a quick exploration in reconciliation and awakening. <br /> <br /> In most cases, acting is compulsively distant. Robert Duvall and Glenn Close make ideal stoic parents on the farm. Forrest is good, but he may be trying too hard to show Paul Newman's performance in Hud. Cinematography is also exceptional. If you like capricious pictures about common people, this may be for you. Some may even be advised to bring some fabrics. 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Dog.
