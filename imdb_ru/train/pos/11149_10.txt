Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides to leave his little life in Texas and turn it into a Big City. Women are here to ask, and men are mostly tutti-fruttis. With wide eyes, he arrives in New York, not ready for a series of humiliating misadventures that he is experiencing, one worse than the other. In the midst of this chaos, he meets Rico “Ratso” Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann), who meets with him and makes friends with him, a homeless man who lives in a clearly condemned building. <br /> <br /> Not so much history because MIDNIGHT COUBA is a series of vignettes designed to show not only Joe Buck’s misfortunes in the City, but also to cross his past and show us in shock and semi-psychedelic Fragments of his past in dreams: his unfortunate relationship with his girlfriend Annie (Jennifer Salt), who was gang-raped, his abandonment by his mother and his apparent violence from his grandmother, who also had a habit of pushing men for money. The atmosphere of pessimism dominates the film almost from a pensive beginning, as Nilsson plays throughout the debut with his deceptively floral “Everyone speaks”; we feel that even when we want Joe to eventually leave his mark in the City, the chances are high that he will not and will eventually work for a penny in dead-end work - as shown in the masterful shot from his outer point, look later in the film, when he watches a man working in the kitchen as a dishwasher in a soup through a window, and sees himself. We know from his eyes that he does not want to end like this. <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger is a grim story of shattered hopes, creating obsessive images of lost souls in the late 60s and at the center, the predominant friendship between two men when they struggle to give some meaning to their lives among the elusive comfort of a decent life. There is an implied opinion that they may have been lovers - Ratso stretches his hand to hug Joe on the stage, and their final embrace at the end certainly indicates this - but this is essentially a friend’s film that manages to survive literally to death, and bring some hope to Joe, who at the end of Florida seems much different, older, wiser.
