this is reminiscent of the writings of Stephen King and the remembered childhood filled with horror from such stories as IT, as the complete opposite. There is no horror in this childhood that some of the friends remember or seem to suffer - which are still friends 20 years later. Up the line, everything is described as a friendly struggle, maybe periodically described as a “choice” of one or more of them, but everything is forgiven. There is no “fear” in the film, and the participants at a later age describe relationships - all that we see are young people who have grown mainly from the same people. More mature, but mostly all the same people and the same power structures. <br /> <br /> Absolutely amazing! Not only because people can grow relatively unharmed due to social conventions, but also because friendship can really last a long time. In this regard, this film is a tiny gem, since it can be assumed that this was the purpose of the film: a portrait of uncontrolled emotions connecting people together. What, if you look in contrast to the films of later years, in which the dark sides of childhood are depicted - what easily comes to mind - cruel bans in Bowling for the Combine, but from the mid-80s along with the growing adoration of children and childhood (accompanied by thousands of commercials, animations and serials aimed directly at children). Several films and documentaries were successful in depicting the dark sides of growing up — ill-treatment, loneliness, striving for success — as a result, adults had dark and perverted thoughts. /> <br /> And here is the film, which says: "I have a happy childhood, look here." <br /> <br /> Thank you for that. OR the illusion of counterweight ... <br /> <br /> 8/10
