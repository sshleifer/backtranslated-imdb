I sit in films like Tiempo de valientes and I want to talk about movies for hours. The delight that this film has given me goes beyond my own explanations, because I watch scenes of the film and in my thoughts look for film-making ideas and innovative dialogues that can arise from something more than Damien Sifron's mind. br /> <br /> Looking at an environment so uncompromising, so simple, I think; this man is a genius. Not surprisingly, he created, perhaps, the best television show that Argentina has ever seen, and then the first film, full of elements that some modern directors have not yet achieved. “El fondo del mar” is a name and, as it awakened (a few years ago), my enthusiasm for our everyday cinema. <br /> <br /> Starting his journey from the daily lives of people, Sifron goes to where Pablo Trapero has never been to “El Bonairense”; life of the federal police department. Trapero's film was a journey into the mind and experiences of a person, and not to the places he saw. Yes, there was a detailed training and a lot of criminal situations, but Sifron in “there” is more like a detective story, like those we know and love, with riddles and exciting music. <br /> But in his work there is a lot of humanity, and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of the main characters, Alfredo Diaz and Mariano Silverstein. There are a lot of big actors in the film, but these two actors are those without which the film cannot do. The first character (Luis Luka) is a detective who just learned that his wife is cheating on him; and should work on the case. <br /> <br /> The second is a psychiatrist who is assigned to treat a detective. He wants to deal with him in regular sessions, but the sheriff takes advantage of the time allocation and offers to join Diaz in his routine: “Nothing, ordinary things, no problems.” But this is more than that, and it will reveal some of the doctor’s personality that he did not know. <br /> <br /> Relations between the two leads cannot be explained if they are not observed, because it’s This is such a complexity that demonstrates how talented people like Sifron are who are trying to leave their signature in our story. Having reached the point of incredible spontaneity, during a high-pressure situation, Diaz tells Silverstein: “How will we continue our treatment?”, And Silverstein responds: “No, I am not your doctor. You call me to have dinner; I am your friend ": we laugh, because we can not help it. <br /> <br /> And we can not stop laughing when Diaz crashes into a car on the street and does not attach any importance to it, or when it breaks rules all the red lights on the street, or when he smokes marijuana on his police patrol, and Silverstein can't believe it (but then smokes too, because he screwed up) or when Silverstein tries to be friends with Diaz’s robbers. Magic from Diego Peretti is what we get there. He, the psychiatrist himself, gives an idea in terms of “Locas de amor ", but strikes with all its range. Luis Luka, on the other hand, returns to the path with a first-class image that reminds us of his great actor. <br /> <br /> I have a passion for this, and I have already said that I could write about it for hours, but unfortunately it is not so, and I have to be accurate and summarized. Although I have to watch many old films and study them, I can assure you that “Tiempo de valientes” - This is a comedy that Argentina has been waiting for and has never received until now.
