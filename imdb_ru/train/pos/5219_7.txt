Gere and Danes are two members of the public security department who monitor sex offenders. Gere, who plays Babbage, calls them his flock. Gere is an overly obsessed vigilant guardian who is on the way. He is training, rookie Allison, to take over his job. Gere considers his flock to be very sick, worried puppies. He asks them questions that are not on the list, and tries to act like the police and solve crimes. He is constantly warned about this, so he is replaced. During his last few days at work, a young girl goes missing, and Babbage is sure that one of his flock has gone astray. He and Allison narrow the list and discover that some of the criminals quit. Therefore, he decides that he needs to find the missing girl, and not help the police. This part is a bit contrived. <br /> <br /> This film shows some sick, perverted things. For example, when Babbage and Allison go to this building, where a bunch of sick people interfere with each other. There are also people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the film, we see what kind of sick freaks they are. However, I would not call this film excessive, because there is not much in the film. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: If you like thrillers and movies about serial killers and policemen stalking killers, you will like it.
