I like movies that don’t give the typical “happy ending,” and this is my main reason I like this movie. Alisa Marano (Danes) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) were arrested in Thailand for drug smuggling after a tip anonymously called the Thai authorities. The film does a solid job, forcing viewers to guess whether (or which) of the girls was involved, and Bill Pullman is beautiful as their sloppy attorney. Jacqueline Kim turns into a stunning performance in the role of his kinder, generous wife Jon, who is also a lawyer. I would like to have more girls abused in prison, as suggested by another commentator, since I heard that Thai prisons can be quite cruel. However, this film captures me and ends. Alice punishes herself for a total of 96 years so that Darlene can be pardoned, and we (the audience) realize that they are both innocent. Any film that challenges my expectations for the final wins me extra points, and this well-played drama certainly deserves.
