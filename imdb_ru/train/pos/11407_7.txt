updated January 1, 2006 <br /> <br /> “Parsifal” is one of my two favorite operas or Wagner’s musical dramas, to be more precise (Meistersinger, the other), although it is difficult to imagine it as “the top of someone else jumps out ". The libretto, as usual, by the composer, is a confusion of religion, paganism, eroticism, and perhaps even homoeroticism, and its length may seem to the audience like the paint dries out. <br /> <br /> Wagner Being a famous anti-Semite (Klingsor may be one of his surrogate Jewish villains), he naturally entrusted the prime minister to the unconverted (not because RV tried!) to Herman Levy, who was his favorite conductor! (Go to hell!) Kundry, the most mixed and one more likely Jewish substitute, villainous or benevolent, depending on the scene. <br /> <br /> Considering that many video versions of Parsifal seem boring On the other hand, this film is an opera, by comparison, a breath of fresh air. Director Hans-Jürgen Siberberg brought a lot of imagination into this, but it’s hard to understand why he made some choice. For example: the notorious double parsiphals (of each sex!), Puppets, the Wagner Death Mask set, and various dolls and symbols, such as the Nazi swastika in one of the travel scenes. (If I remember, the "real" Engelbert Humperdink wrote real music to tell about the changes in the scene.) Although Wagner himself died too early to be a real Nazi, many of his descendants (like his second wife, Kosyma). were at least fellow travelers, including their grandson Wolfgang Wagner, who still runs the Bayreuth Festival at an advanced age. In fact, the son of Wolfgang Gottfried Wagner, in complete contrast to his father, was trying to honestly negotiate with his great-grandfather. <br /> <br /> Seberberg, judging by what I read, also seems ambiguous from a political point of view. In 1977, he shot the famous film about Hitler “Hitler: ein Film aus Deutschland” (sometimes called “Our Hitler” in English). Since it lasts all 8 hours and is not widely spread, most people have not seen it (including me). <br /> <br /> Armin Jordan, conductor of the audio CD, on which this film is based plays Amfortas (performed by Wolfgang Schöne). Edith Clover (Yvonne Minton) plays Kundry, Michael Kutter and Karin Creek play double Parsifal (both played by Reiner Goldberg!), And Robert Lloyd and Aage Haugland play and sing Gurnemants and Klingsora. <br /> <br /> Although the opera takes place over a long period of time, and all (except Kundry?) were described as having a significant age between acts 2 and 3, no one looks a day older by the end of the opera. (The magic of the Grail? In this opera, the Grail is the cup from which Jesus saw during the Last Supper, and not Mary Magdalene, as in later times, an idea that I find ridiculous!). <br /> <br /> Conducting and singing is quite suitable for use, and it seems that the DVD has greatly improved the sound, if not the image. (Yes, I agree that the “Kna” approach is better, even for the second, stereo version, but it probably surpasses all recorded versions in general.) <br /> <br /> Not Parsifal for all wagnerites, but I think That it works quite well, like a filmed opera.
