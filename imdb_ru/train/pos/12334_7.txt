Does anyone know where this movie was filmed? Aviation scene on the rock is beautiful. Looks like it's England. However, Ivey’s apartment building certainly looks like a Brill building with its fascinating elevators. <br /> <br /> Charles Mendle plays Sir Charles Gage. Maybe I blinked, but I never saw him. He may have been a husband’s lawyer, but again, I don’t remember this character being in the film, except for the mention that he made a phone call. Perhaps he was on the aviation scene? Or ballroom scene? Has anyone noticed him? <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall was 57 years old when he was making this film.
