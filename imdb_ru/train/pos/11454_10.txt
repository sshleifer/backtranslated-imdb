For a while I was a fan of Andy Goldsworthyâ€™s art and possessed some of his books, so I had some expectations of what I would see. What I received was something completely satisfying, and a bit more than I expected. Being an artist (I work in clay), searching for inspiration in our environment for creating good art is a must, and this is what Andy Goldsworth has mastered. Following him throughout the year, the director captures direct energy, skill, and dedication to artists connecting with nature with dramatic inspirational talent. The music for the film covers and intoxicates. If you are an artist who needs inspiration, or someone else who needs an exalted experience, then SEE THIS FILM. For example, I am glad to know that Andy is somewhere there. Creating, dancing, fighting with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful.
