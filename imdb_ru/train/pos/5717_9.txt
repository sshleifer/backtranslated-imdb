Omigosh, this is really the scariest movie I've ever seen. To say that I love horror movies would be an understatement, and I saw a bunch (given the limited availability in New Zealand, this is quite a lot), but I had never had to sleep with the lights on ... before I saw The Grudge. <br /> <br /> Someone might say that this is a disruption of The Ring (both based on Japanese horror films), both are similar (but different) storylines, but The Grudge considers itself a terrifying movie - seeing in the cinema, I even shouted at some point in the film. <br /> <br /> The acting game is great, especially from the supporting characters — KadDi Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she’s such an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real beauty, and William Mapother looks like he is having fun. However, although I am usually a fan of Clea Duval, it doesn’t really look like this movie. Of the minor characters, her story probably got the deepest and most prehistory, but she doesn't seem like she is all there. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, well, she remains about the same in all her films and roles, doesn't she? The ghosts were really scary, the music and sound effects were scary (especially the noise made when the character Qadi Strickland answered the call in her apartment), the ending was also cool. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 9/10
