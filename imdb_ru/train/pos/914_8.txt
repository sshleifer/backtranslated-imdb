Vivah is not a classic. However, in the days of tough actions, innovative special effects and complex plots (none of which Bollywood has yet mastered), it is quite pleasant to see such a simple film as Viva. The story we all know is a journey from a couple's first date to their possible wedding after some shy moments and trials. No more, no less. Music is not exactly in the same league as MPK or HAHK, but it doesn’t impress your senses. Two songs stood out for me - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane. While Milan Abhi, Aadha and Hamaari-shaadi were humble. Shahid sincerely speaks and shows great potential. It's nice to see him play something else besides the “cool guy” he usually plays. Amrita is very sweet and plays the role of an obedient girl from a small town to perfection. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas are awesome props, and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job. The direction of Suraj is simple but effective. The main drawback of the film is the slow pace that many young viewers may suffer. But overall a good, clean, decent family movie.
