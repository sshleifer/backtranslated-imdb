I am not a fan of Steve Carell, but I like this film about Dan, a consultant commentator who goes to his parents' home to stay with his children, and ends up falling in love with his brother's girlfriend. This is a story that was told before, but not so. Just too many little pieces that make a movie better than it should be. The cast is wonderful, and even if Carell is not my cup of tea, he is quite good as a widower who is supposed to know everything, but finds that knowledge is different from feeling, and that life sometimes surprises you. At times, witty and wise in what may be an annoying Hallmark card, the film still somehow manages to grow on you and be something more than just a film mill. Worth seeing watch
