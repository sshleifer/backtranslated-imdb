Tweed professors thought everyone understood. The peoples of Polynesia today have descended from migrating Asians, fearlessly moving from the Far East, from island to island, to the east, to Tahiti and all other exotic tropical islands of the South Pacific for millennia. But the well-established thinking simply did not like the young Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. If this explanation was true, then why are some people born and raised on these islands have traditions, works of art and physical features that resemble not those from Asia, but from South America? How can the vegetation of Ecuador, Peru, and Chile look like what you find on an island a few thousand miles away? It is just a coincidence that the islanders point to the sea in the direction of South America and say that it was from here that their ancestors came, led by Tiki, their equivalent to Adam? Meanwhile, how do Norwegians talk about Scandinavian predecessors who were persecuted from the South American continent, which they colonized, and together with some of the indigenous peoples with whom they became friends, went to sea, heading west? This is too much to be coincident with Heyerdal. The expedition begins with an amazing amount of moxis, several crew members and local know-how for the traditional construction of the raft. This is the same trip to the human imagination, as well as the pseudo-scientific demonstration that such a trip is possible only with the most basic tools and navigation. The Oscar-winning documentary can be dated in its tone and Anglo-ethnocentric approach, but it is in the spirit of adventure, surpassing even the space program launched a decade later, as people are willing to risk it all to test the theory, which they consider true. Wonderful. Do yourself a favor and read the book first. This is an amazing coup and ideal setting for a film-style film.
