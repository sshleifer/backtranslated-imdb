Here is proof of why Mary Pickford was America's “lover”. In this rather complex drama, Mary plays the squatter's little daughter, who dares to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the "highlanders". Scenes when they steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply amazing. She is even ready to take a bath. That Mary could cope with this role at the age of 30 is simply amazing and partly because of her small stature (5 '). <br /> <br /> Tess has to face many physical and emotional problems. She does this with a sperm that has not been seen in many of the heroines of the time. Tess pounces and does not hesitate to fight anyone. I don’t understand why she agrees to help her little-humpback daughter, but she sacrifices her own happiness to keep a deep secret. Pickford's closeups are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Jean Hersholt, born in Denmark, is just wonderful as a villain. The scene in which he treats a small child is enough to make you throw vegetables (or something else) on the screen of a movie. If Forrest Robinson (who plays Deddy Skinner) wore a beard, would he approach the model used in those WWI recruitment posters that Uncle Sam was called ?? He wants you! <br /> <br /> Although the story is somewhat predictable and slow at first, it’s worth taking the time to see the piece or “Americana”. The film tells about the options available to all of us, including the joy of someone else and what it means to be a real Christian. Featured.
