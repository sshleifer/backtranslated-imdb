Although I can understand the bad things that someone has to say about this film, I still found it absolutely amazing. It will affect you, and if your critic does not look deep into the flaws and failures of each film, or you just don’t touch anything, it’s worth a look. Do not enter the film while waiting for anything, just have a box of tissues and unbiased. It is beautiful and brilliant. I think that Will Smith, despite the fact that he again plays another lonely depressed person, is amazing. I believe that a good actor is one who can truly portray the feelings and emotions that we all experience in our worst / best experiences, in such a way that he appeals to you and makes you feel something. And this is exactly what makes this film. Give it a chance.
