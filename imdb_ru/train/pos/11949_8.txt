Woody Allen's second film in London. Tha Tarot Card killer kills prostitutes in London. Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a clue that he can be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She begins to admire him, but quickly falls in love. She is assisted by stage magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen), who does not like what he sees. <br /> <br /> I like it more than the overvalued "Match Point" from last year. He was shorter and moved much faster. The plot is old, but I was entertained, and it made me guess until the very end. In fact, this is not a comedy, but a riddle with a few very good comedic lines (of course, from Allen). This is not one of the best of Allen, but he is much better than his worst. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the game is very good. Allen is bad, but he played this character a million times earlier, and he became tedious. But Johansson and Jackman are great - they look fantastic and give two very attractive believable views. Allen is also (amazingly) working on his sex appeal - there is a sequence in which they are both in their bathing suits to show off their beautiful bodies. The only real production rate is that Allen is still not sure how to shoot at London. Although he is not so bad as in “Match Point” - maybe he will just get better along the way. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing. I give it 8.
