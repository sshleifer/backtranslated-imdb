Opening the film with Bach Toccata is an aural hint at what unfolds in this intense drama. All the compositional techniques that Bach perfected to keep his listener (and performer) intrigued and entertained belong to this film. In the final scene, there is no mutual tenderness between the two main characters and the main woman, and I believe that this is justified if she claims to have been raped, although her victim feels that she was warned that he was a guy. Mamet convincingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the sexes, but I feel that he does not know how they actually complement each other, given a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet had ever developed a healthy, humorous look at the interaction between the sexes, I wonder how this work would end? Because it exists, it is very gloomy and mean.
