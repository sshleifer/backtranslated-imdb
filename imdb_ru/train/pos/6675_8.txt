The directing of this film was fantastic for comedy. Many scenes look like comics, and they are much darker (visually, not plot) than I expected. Of course, this may not be the funniest movie ever made, especially if you like rough sexist jokes, because there is not much to say (compared to others like Something About Mary or American Pie). When you reread it, a few jokes stand out and become funnier. If you have ever read comics or watched films like comics (“Batman”, “X-Men”, etc.), and you liked them, you will probably like the subtle humor that goes on throughout the film. If you don't like them, you may like the respectful mockery this film has for them. If you liked this movie, the DVD has some interesting additions. (8/10)
