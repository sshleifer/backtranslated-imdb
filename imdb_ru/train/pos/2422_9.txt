Yes, this is a low budget. Yes, this is one of Candyâ€™s earliest films, but he is probably the funniest! John Candy was not so far from the SCTV days in Going Berserk, and it shows. If you are not upset when Candy tries to help a guy with his products, being handcuffed to an escaped cohort during sex with his girlfriend, when they are only separated by an apartment door (yeah, watch a movie!) Or the way Eugene Levy (created by Kong Fu Yu) is talking to her mom on the phone, or just countless facial expressions, which only Candy can give you better check your pulse! If you like John Candy from Only the Lonely, this may not be the movie that I would advise you to watch, but if you like the days of John Candy on SCTV, you should watch this movie!
