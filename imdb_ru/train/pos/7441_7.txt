Personally, I despise The Jerry Springer Show, however, I think Ringmaster is the funniest film I've seen this year. The endless satire of "guests" by Jerry Springer, starting on the debut scene, makes you laugh throughout the film. Despite the brief scene in which Jerry Springer makes a weak attempt to justify his existence, I definitely recommend this film for pure entertainment value.
