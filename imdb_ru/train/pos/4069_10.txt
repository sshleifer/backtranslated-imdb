Listening to the soundtrack at the moment, the images come back with brightness, which makes my desire for dry eyes very strong (so that I can print it). Until now, I have seen it twice, and I should be ashamed of the fact that I have seen it * only * twice. <br /> <br /> I saw all the films of Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli, and they invariably represent nothing more than masterpieces. (with the possible exception of Nausicaa, which even in the uncut version was too premature compared with nec-plus-ultra manga). However, their strength sometimes becomes their weakness, since they tend to become too naive / positive (Chihiro) or, with a lot of nuances, too frank / moral (Mononoke). At least, in comparison, for example, with another master, Ghibli Takahata (Tomb of Fireflies / Just Yesterday / Wars with Raccoons). But not this one. <br /> <br /> In Laputa, Miyazaki recounts all the brilliant stories of tale tellers that had been collected and perfected over the centuries, combined with a bit of morality, but pleasantly intertwined not only with a completely transcendent atmosphere, but also with humor and entertainment. For example, Totoro. Each main character is beautifully depicted with his doubts, fears and qualities that help them overcome difficulties. The pace is so perfect that I know nothing but a black hole that could have such a gravitational effect on your whole being. This story is a fighter with hinted secrets, but when a girl falls from the sky, loses consciousness, swims with a stone, and the main theme begins, you get an idea of ​​the great mystery that you are going to uncover. but then the story is settled and gradually, through a series of carefully selected scenes of action and serene beauty, grows into an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty, as in the following days of gloomy gloom, finally seeing the horizon in the clear morning knowing that the path had passed, seeing the distance ahead, but smiling at the very fact of being able to catch a glimpse of him. <br /> <br /> This is so much like the exploding white light in your skull, that if When the credits take effect, you keep your eyes dry and your thoughts numb, you should contact a psychotherapist. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that technically some recent Miyazaki can be more overwhelming, this remains to me his undisputed masterpiece. If it takes you a split second to realize that this was done back in 1986, you can only conclude that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius who looks like a star that appears only once every 200 years. This, of course, was suggested before, but for me it is his only film that can fully illustrate this simple fact. If you miss it during your life, you will die with a huge gap - which would be a pity, because the coffin is worth the same.
