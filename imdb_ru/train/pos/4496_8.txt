Simply put, I liked this movie. The cause of my interest and pleasure was not connected with anything but the object itself. I heard stories from mothers and grandmothers about how the life and attitudes of the working class in northern England were (how they survived) earlier, and this is an interesting image that seems to truly reflect what they told me. In particular, paternalistic, but domineering father, who "knows" what is best for his family, along with his stubbornness, when this paradigm is challenged. (Then little has changed !!) <br /> <br /> People who have watched the play are likely to be disappointed with the film, because the story cannot be easily conveyed through various media. In a sense, however, the film is a historical document, and I personally liked it, if only because it conveyed a social phenomenon.
