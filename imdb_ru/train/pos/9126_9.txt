This film is outstanding and well-deserved. Prince Oscar for the music was deservedly deserved (many people do not know that he won one). I think this is one of the best movies you can watch as a couple late on DVD. Big surprise: the prince copes well with acting and rather well conveys the pain to the camera. Morris Day, Wendy and Lisa are good at their supporting roles. Very cool landmark of the film.
