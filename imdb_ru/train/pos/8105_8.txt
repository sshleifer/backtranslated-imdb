DESCRIPTION The future is from 1939 in England. Since the war hung over Europe, the salvation of mankind will not be found in the politics of the past. To overcome the past mistakes of man is the work of the wondrous new world of science. <br /> <br /> CONCEPT IN VIEW OF VISION Beware of your leaders and what they say to you. Meditating outside the box can lead to a brighter tomorrow. There will always be descent and fear, and learning to overcome it is our only hope. <br /> <br /> Pros and cons I have seen this film a long time ago and recently downloaded it from the Internet (it is publicly available). domain). This is an exciting job on many levels. Since this is a story about the future since 1939, it has obvious flaws. This vision of the future is awful and bizarre. This film has been foremost for its day. The special effects are very good, as is the storyline. Acting suffers a little in the British theatrical sense, as it may lean slightly towards Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes of the film - science and technology can solve all our problems, which we now know, this is not always the case. Another storyline of the films is that charismatic leaders are the curse of human existence and are likely to always be with us. <br /> <br /> In this film you can see the basics of almost all the latest science fiction films. The scenography and wardrobe of the Forbidden Planet, the flaws of the technology in 2001: Space Odessa, even the lush landscapes / Star Wars cityscapes owe a certain inspiration to this film. <br /> <br /> The end of the film leaves the viewer a little puzzled. While he is optimistic in his final sequence of reaching the stars, we are left to wonder whether humanity can ever do this. Even when we reach, there are those who try to hold us back. These films see the future, although they are interesting and a bit humorous by today's standards. Huge aircraft and instruments that could shoot into space, never materialized in the real world, but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step. <br /> <br /> Many great British actors in this film are young. Cedric Hardwick and Ralph Richardson are the most recognizable, and their eloquence is obvious. Raymond Massey is a curious choice to play the main character, Cable. His heroine can almost be met as the new Christ sent to save the world from his own destruction with the new religion of science. <br /> <br /> This is a good part of the history of cinema, the themes of which are still relevant today, even if his vision of the future did not hit the target.
