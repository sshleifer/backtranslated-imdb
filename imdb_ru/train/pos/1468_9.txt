The person who wrote the review “stop sweating and spit,” does not understand what cultural, literary or psycho-criticism is. He rejects Zizek's interpretations, because they do not correspond to "what the director had originally intended." So what? The importance of the director’s (or author’s) intent is not important in a critical theory. This is known as the author's “Deliberate Misconception” and should be avoided. <br /> <br /> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy A text or movie MAY be analyzed using a number of theories, many of which do not agree with each other, and also completely ignore the author’s intention. This is the most fundamental idea of ​​Critical Theory. <br /> <br /> Because of this, the one who wrote this wall of the text spent a lot of time and effort in insulting Zizek. In fact, anyone who studies theory immediately discredits this opinion of the guys (I think you should), because it is completely untrue. <br /> <br /> As the saying goes ... If you are generally interested in Freud, Laconic, or Kristevsky discourse, this film is simply necessary. This connects these theories with the popular film, making them much more tangible and enjoyable than just reading or thinking about them.
