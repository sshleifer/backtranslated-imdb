Has the movie ever been more charming than this? One of the reasons why everything works so well is that the group of actors really interacts and affects each other’s lives. At the center of this is the "romance" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and cannot get along with each other, but communicate anonymously with each other as pen-pal friends. But there are also minor characters, and unlike many romantic comedies (including “You Got Mail”, the recent “Shop” update), they are not just assembled to support the two roles and their needs. Each becomes a tangled part of the rich tapestry of Ernst Lubicz. One of the most touching scenes in the history of cinema occurs when the almost tragic Frank Morgan casually and humbly looking for someone with whom you can dine at Christmas. Must see! **** outside ****
