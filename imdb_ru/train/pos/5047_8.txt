The actor Paxton made his debut in the director's film with this frightening, gloomy and well-created thriller about widowed mechanics (Paxton himself), which involves his two sons in the murder of the wild ax, claiming that the victims are not people at all, but "demons" and that they were chosen by God to destroy these "demons." All of this in the memoirs is told by one of the sons, who has now grown up (Matthew McConaughey) from a skeptical FBI agent (Powers Bute). <br /> <br /> It is difficult to automatically forget this film; better than most serial killers, this is a tortuous and disturbing story told in a simple way with a minimum of movie tricks. Commendable, Paxton hardly shows blood to the very end. Everybody acted well, especially the two child actors (Jeremy Sumpter from the recent Peter Pan and Matt O'Leary from Spy Kids 2 and Internal Riots). The only reason I deducted any points at all is because I can understand that it may be difficult for some people to go through all this. In any case, this is an atypical thriller with a decent script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
