Written / directed by Brad Silberling, who made a short film from the movie "Carson, California", he made only 10 weeks or less. For two weeks, he felt that the whole story was improvised ... in the best sense of the word. Silberling was fortunate enough to connect veteran actor Morgan Freeman between his major projects and Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result was a dialogue between two people from different perspectives who manage to improve the life of another. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays himself - but part of the comedy is that he is portrayed as an actor who has been out of work for four years, searching for a place for a small “filming movie” to return to the flow of things The “role” should be with the market manager, and he landed on a seedy market in Carson, where he encounters, among other things, one Scarlet, a girl for an argumentative 10 Items or less than a control line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her full-time job, she’s also usually angry with her gangster husband (Bobby Cannavale), who is currently sleeping with Scarlet’s lazy colleague (Ann Dudek) and her inability to find a decent job elsewhere. Two couples after several common problems, and they go on a “road trip”, as a result of which each of the characters grows out of the presence and history of the other. <br /> <br /> This is a simple story, to put it simply, but because of the delicate connection between Freeman and Paz, it works very well. This is one of those small films about human relationships that say that they are vulnerable to change and exchange. It’s well worth seeing, and it’s a DVD that has touching, informative, and comic features that are fun to watch. Grady harp
