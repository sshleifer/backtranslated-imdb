Someone has already mentioned "being in the right place at the right time." It was so true for this documentary that I doubted the authenticity of the scenes and thought there might be some action in it, but it’s not. This is all real. There is nothing new in history for people in developing and / or poor countries. This sheds light on the manipulation of people by corporate media, misinformation, artificial polarization of people, deliberately creating tension on the streets, sometimes to the extent that the army, special services or even the government (many believe, led by the United States) uses agents who attack “any “Side to provoke the masses to violence and thereby justify their coups. The naval officer in the film also mentions this. It was they who wanted to see the people confront the streets. All of these scenarios have been played out in Turkey (the United States domestic dog in the Middle East) throughout its history, which survived 3 coups, and recently the secret plans of the Turkish army were revealed, ironically, through pro-government religious / conservative media. speaking out against the religious doctrines of the army, in which an army agent is bombing a very important mosque to provoke people, etc. <br /> <br /> What makes this film unique is that they were filming from the inside, perhaps by accident, when events occurred. It is clear that the directors are professionals of Chavez. Whether this was the reason that the directors began to filter events and information and manipulate them, I do not know. <br /> <br /> And whether Chavez will protect the people of Venezuela from the dictatorship of the United States and the world economy without history will suppress any overwhelming thought and, eventually, will turn into a self-satisfied tyrant. <br /> <br /> But at least Chavez is a hope, and I think this chance is worth it.
