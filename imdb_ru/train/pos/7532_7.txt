"New Adventures of Batman" (also called "Gotham Knights") occur 5 years after the final episode of "Batman": the animated series (B: TAS) and go on the air only in 24 episodes. This is not a terrible show, but it is not as good as in the original Batman animated series. I will start with everything that was not very good. <br /> <br /> First, the animation itself: long and sweet, Gotham is no longer dark, the sky is always bright red. and orange, B: TAS did it also, but it was painted on a dark sky, the color of the sky was more sinister, in this show, the color of the sky is too bright. It all looks like any other children's show and doesn't sound as unique as Batman: TAS did it with a dark, classy art style on Gotham. The artistic style is fine, but no longer reminds me of Batman. Each character consists of straight lines, squares and triangles that make the characters less like people. In the original series (B: TAS), the characters look more like drawn versions of real people. The animation may be more consistent than in B: TAS, but it is definitely not so good. <br /> <br /> Next: some episodes seem too dull and childish, but some scenes are even stronger than in B: TAS. (Two-faced trying to kill Tim Drake / Robin 2, and some villains get pretty rough treatment). This brings me to the next item. <br /> <br /> Since this should happen in the future, as well as in the final episodes of the Animated Batman Universe, many villains meet their death or leave forever. Poison ivy is obviously drowning in the explosion of a cruise ship; The two-faced nearly killed Penguin, Killer Kroc and himself, so he moved to Arkhem forever; The joker falls into the exhaust tower of an industrial plant (although it will later return to the animated series of the Justice League); Catwoman goes to France, leaving Batman, etc. ... The fact that the series ends does not mean that they have to get rid of some great characters! The motives of the villains are also pretty bad. There is not one! In B: TAS, we learn that these villains are mentally exhausted and their lives are ruined, so they behave the way they do; in this show, villains just commit crimes to develop a story. As if Batman just doesn't care about maintaining sanity in the people with whom he fights, he just beats them senselessly. This Batman is a colder and more evil version of the character, but since he has been doing this work for years, I understand why he is so sharp. <br /> <br /> Next, reworked character models: they are terrible. Gordon lost about 100 pounds ... is he sick? Many villains look stupid (among the worst are the Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Mad Hatter and Killer Kroc). Although I think some characters look better (Bane, Scarecrow, Batgirl). Harley is about the same, and Ivy (who is still hotter) has light green skin. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of mistakes in the series, some episodes are simply gorgeous: “Beyond, Mad Love, Beware of Lianas” In my opinion, my favorites here are Night Night Out, Old Wounds, Legends of the Dark Knight and Never Fear. All the Batman crossovers in the animated series Superman were also great. <br /> <br /> The absolutely ART part of this show is how the creators say they love the animation of this series more than the original. On the DVDs of the original Batman animated series, they talk about how they were proud of the artistic style, and how difficult it was to revive some of the characters, but in the end they managed to do it (for example, the complex animation needed to animate Clayface), On DVD- “New Batman Adventures” drives basically say: “To hell with B: TAS, this is a new, new re-vamp, it looks better, and we like the way we DESTROYED A SERIES!” (Well, this is an exaggeration). When the creators dropped the amazing artistic style of B: TAS, it made me very angry! <br /> <br /> This is a good show, but I still don’t like it as much as in the original animated series. At least the show doesn’t communicate with its audience, so I still recommend it. Although some episodes of this new series are fantastic and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Superman: the animated series and the Justice League: the animated series is a great sequel to Batman: the animated series and new adventures of Batman, so give them a watch.
