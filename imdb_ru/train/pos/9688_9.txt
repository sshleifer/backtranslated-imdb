I cautiously approach films about talking animals. For every wonderful thing, like the Kid, you get as poor as the horrible remake of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of Cats & Dogs, you have a great idea for a movie that does not match its potential. When I heard about Pauli, the premise of the wise parrot didn't quite inspire confidence in me. But I found the movie a pleasant surprise. And he manages to penetrate your heart, without even knowing it. <br /> <br /> Russian cleaner Misha Vilenkov (Tony Shaloub) gets a job in a research laboratory. One day he hears singing coming from the basement. And when he explores, he finds a parrot in his cage, singing his little heart. Misha is fond of the bird, especially when it turns out that a parrot can not only sing, but also speak. And not a few phrases too. This is a parrot that you can talk to. <br /> <br /> Parrot's name is Paulie (voiced by Jay Mohr), and he recognizes the same bastard in Misha. I wonder how this world for a wise bird turned out to be in a dusty basement, Misha convinces Paulie to tell him the story of his life. It all started when he was a child, and in the care of Marie, a five-year-old girl with a stutter. These two have become feathered birds (ok, bad pun!). <br /> <br /> When Marie's parents began to worry about her close friendship with the bird, they decided to send him away. And they finally did it after Marie nearly got hurt as a result of a fall, having taught Poly to fly. Desperate to reunite with her, Paulie embarks on a long journey through America, which includes many new owners, flies long distances and even ends up behind bars. From the cage that is! <br /> <br /> Paulie was one of the many talking animal films released by DreamWorks in the late 90s. And although Paulie did not receive the same recognition or box office success, Paulie succeeds on several levels and from time to time impresses with her mind. <br /> <br /> Sustainable style of Jay Mora acting game is well suited for the role of Pauli. He never plays a role too smug, even if he's a little clever Alec. Poly worldly, but he is also naive in his attitude. <br /> <br /> Since he lived a rather secure life with Marie, when he was taken away, he had to stand up for himself for the first time. And when he falls into the hands of different owners, they give Paulie a promise to reunite him with Marie, whom he believes. Only for those promises that will be broken again and again. <br /> <br /> Pauli, admittedly, is a bit episodic. It follows the eclectic people with whom Paulie ends up and as he slowly approaches and approaches Marie. First, he goes to a pawnshop, where he is adopted by Ivy (Gene Rowlands), an amiable woman who teaches his meaning of manners. She sympathizes with the situation of Pauly and travels across America to find Marie. <br /> <br /> Poly is sometimes a very moving film. His scenes with Ivy are some of the best. Wonderful moments when Paulie sat on her shoulder and sang Tom Jones' numbers. The way she instills the need for hope in him is wonderful, and some dialogs are pretty well written and even make you think: <br /> <br /> â€œThere are things in life that you put off because you think that you will I this later. But the real thing that Ivy taught me is that you have to live as if you can't be later. "<br /> <br /> The scene where Ivy is leaving along the road, leaving Paulie alone, is a very heartbreaking moment And the sequence in which he gains the courage to fly through the Grand Canyon for the first time, soaring majestically is such a beautiful scene that stays with you for several hours after the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Despite random events, a sad moment, there are a lot of laughter to be had. Pauley comes with a group of parrots in an open-air Spanish restaurant. The animatronic effects here are really excellent, as four birds perform a dance number with perfect choreography. And Pauli even gets romance. Which is broken when he falls with a petty thief (also played by Mohr). This may be the only the complaint that I have. As soon as you get comfortable with one situation, the film will move Poly to another. <br /> <br /> The scene where Poly is taught to steal money from ATMs is fun, but also a little alarming. I am amazed that DreamWorks was given the opportunity to include such a scene in a children's film. And the robbery of the Diamond of Pauly is very impossible. He was caught at the scene of the crime and sent to a laboratory for animal testing, where he has remained since. <br /> <br /> The story finally goes full circle in the laboratory, where Misha vows to help Paulie. Of course, they find Marie. But the last revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity that it was numb for a few minutes. Poly may never get the longevity that Toddler has, but I think this is a no less brilliant film. Same laughter. The same impeccable effects. And the same amazing intelligence. <br /> <br /> Minor stone.
