“Yes, Giorgio” is a frivolous and enjoyable film / comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music. This is not my favorite movie, but this is a movie that I liked to watch more than once. Some observers have suggested that if someone wants to enjoy Pavarotti, then they will probably be better off if they take an opera DVD. Although a complete opera can better represent the opera talents of Pavarotti, often the opera requires costumes and subject lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of man. “Yes, Giorgio” allows Pavarotti to use his voice and demonstrate his personality and character in a way that the opera does not. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers seem to find the story incredible; I do not agree. Extremely talented people can be both selfish and charming - charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people. In addition, people who are very different from each other often get an idea of ​​themselves and develop in a positive way of communicating with people who stretch them or lead them in directions that they may not have chosen themselves. Both Giorgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationships with each other. <br /> <br /> Relax and allow yourself to immerse yourself in a visual and auditory film with Pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities. The final scenes just from Turandot Puccini are worth the time to get there.
