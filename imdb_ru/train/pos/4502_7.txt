I have seen almost all the movies of Cynthia Rothrock, and for me this is the funny thing. It reminds me of Jackie Chan's early films. Admittedly, Miss Rothrock may not be the best actress, but she is very good both in martial art and as a very sweet young lady. This film, although not the best of all its films, was the most interesting.
