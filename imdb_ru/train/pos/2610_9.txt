In the ten years since Wildside’s release, nothing has come close to its quality in local production. This includes two episodes of pleasant, but overvalued Underbelly, which brought to mind the events in the recent criminal history of both Sydney and Melbourne. The exception may be the Blue Kill mini-series (in which Tony Martin also played the main role, but in the role of another person according to the law). <br /> <br /> At the present time, “Wileside” is repeated late in the evening on ABC. Despite the show for a long time, I'm still impressed with his uncompromising storylines and very human characters. The cast is excellent: Tony Martin as a detective is pursuing the disappearance of his son, Rachel Blake (who later contacted Martin in real life) as a public worker struggling with alcoholism, and Alex Demetriades as a young cop whose vice is gambling, Equally good roles provide Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Custas (yes, Effy herself) and young Abbie Cornish. <br /> <br /> Inexplicably, ABC released only the first three episodes on DVD a couple years ago. The logic of this kind of marketing does not suit me, but I suppose that this may be due to licensing disagreements with the original manufacturers. <br /> <br /> An excellent series that has stood surprisingly well. We hope that the ABC DVD department will come together. <br /> <br /> (According to the moderator on the ABC bulletin board, some further DVD release is expected in December 2009)
