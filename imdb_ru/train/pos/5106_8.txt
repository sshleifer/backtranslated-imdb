I think that every time I see one of these old 80s films, it makes me go back to a simpler time, no matter how trite they may seem today. This movie is good. I remember seeing him as a little kid and thought it was the greatest film ever. It has all the heroic characters that a young cowboy wants to be. Now that Iâ€™m grown up, I can look back, laugh, and still feel sad, but this time I really know what's going on. I found one weird thing. How many people can move to Houston and chat with Sissy, get married, get into the trailer, quarrel, cheat, die uncle, and then get together again, all within a month? Only in America.
