Alright, so 10 for a movie 2 1/2 stars you ask? ... well, look at it, and maybe it will make more sense .. Hitchcock never mixed up the scenes better together .... The film weaves the scenes flawlessly from the very beginning and yet you donâ€™t feel the scattered feeling that sometimes occurs when the film passes you through the many characters that it is trying to develop. You feel that the characters will show you something unusual in themselves, and then they will not disappoint you. The surreal story of the life of screenwriter / producer Phil Kaye, mixed with an absolutely excellent soundtrack, makes you think about 6 degrees of separation in life than about a film with the same name ... the future.
