This man’s “Navy” is, as noted in other commentaries, a rare and well-filmed look at the activities of the Navy easier than in the air (LTA). LTA crews were rightly proud that the escorts they were following never lost a ship to attack submarines. Shooting in different places NAS gives an idea of ​​the type of aircraft, which has long disappeared. However, the first half of the film is dedicated to Beery, his relationship with his friends in the service, his meeting with the character Tom Drake and his mother, as well as the correction of Drake's foot. Only then does the second film begin. The second film is mainly LTAs in action, filmed on the surface, the guys die and do a lot of damage. I think the look is rather rough and realistic. Then we move to Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have LTA there? No matter, this part is really wild, with a dirigible balloon, which is used to extract a downed flight crew from the jungle. And the Japs are shooting like crazy. Shades of Vietnam, except for escape, oh, so leisurely. This is the airship we are talking about. After all, the good drama of World War II is about a very unusual part of the war.
