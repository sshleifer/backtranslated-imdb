After reading many other reviews of this film on IMDb, there is a consensus among purists that this film is not like the books on which it is based. I can not comment on this point, as I had never before read the adventures of the main characters. However, what I can say with certainty is that it seems to me that many of the referees mentioned above have certainly gone through a sense of humor; Let's be honest - this film is just very funny! <br /> <br /> OK ?? .. therefore I must admit that the film is clearly not representative of the character / characters, but let's deal with this clear perspective ?? .. the same people who find fault with this film also mourn the fact that the classic Batman series of the 1960s does not remain true to the original character of the DC comic? Or, perhaps, the excitement remained in the same people that the 1980 version of the Flash Gordon film was too big a departure from the original series? <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this film is incredibly camp, but this is his charm! <br /> <br /> Former Tarzan, Ron Eli plays the hero of the same name (and not only has a fleeting resemblance to Gary Busey!), and is supported by a great supporting cast that everyone looks like having a ball with their respective roles. Also note the very short, but very welcome, appearance of Michael Berryman's favorite horror movie. <br /> <br /> Best scene? Too much to choose from, but look at the funny facial expressions accepted by the waiter, when Savage and his people perform an extremely erroneous procedure for ordering Coca-Cola, lemonade and milk in a solemn event! In addition, the often celebrated scene at the end of the film, where Savage solves the problem of his sworn enemy “Captain Moray”, uses various martial arts disciplines that are indicated on the screen! ?? Priceless! <br /> <br /> Simply put, the film does not take itself seriously and makes it even more exciting. Great fun from start to finish! (and you will be singing a customized themed song of John Philip Souza for a few days after that!)
