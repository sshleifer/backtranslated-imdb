In a seemingly endless search for well-made, well-played horror films, it is very rare to find a film that even comes close to the goal. Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised when I came across Burnt on a Stake in the US cable network when I switched channels. The premise is quite simple. In 1692, young Ann Putnam (Swift) became the most ardent witness of the alleged witches, making unfounded accusations against anyone who deserved her displeasure. To manage it for its own purposes is Rev. Parris (Peters), who also serves as the court’s guidance on witchcraft and satanism. Everything gets complicated when Ann starts accusing the members of the Good family of witchcraft. Salem (1980 or so), Lorin Graham (also played by Swift) has unusual visions just before she visits the Salem Witch Museum. A strange man in a seventeenth-century outfit is trying to attach himself to her there and to the building. He continues to pursue her, while strange phenomena begin to attract her more and more. Soon it seems that she is obsessed with the spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, the further description becomes quite complicated and gives away too much. Although the film is not action oriented and will probably be of little interest to many viewers, the performances are good, and the seventeenth century dialogue used in many of the film’s memories sounds very convincing. Performance indicators are solid, with the exception of some special effects. In addition to this, the film’s technical advisor was Laurie Cabot, Salem’s official witch. Viewers who appreciate a well-made, atmospheric, but understated horror film can appreciate it. Writer / director Bert I. Gordon has a long career in horror films and science fiction films and is best known for his work on a number of films about “big bugs” and similar works years ago.
