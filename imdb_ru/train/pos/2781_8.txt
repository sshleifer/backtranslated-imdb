It was an amazing movie. A real good movie when you need it. The story is easy (it's not Gone with the Wind), but sometimes this kind of plot is needed. Fun and warm characters, fantastic acting and beautiful costumes / wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagr (also from the EP TV show) in this role is remarkable. She is definitely a new bright star for Hollywood. Everyone should watch her, she will be GREAT in the future. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack for this film was also impressive. A pleasant combination of modern and Indian melodies. I danced most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if you need an interesting movie.
