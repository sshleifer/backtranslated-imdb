This is almost typical Lynch. However, what makes this film a bit unusual for Lynch is the fact that it looks very raw, almost amateur. But I believe that Lynch does this on purpose to give a greater sense of realism, which serves to increase the intensity of surrealistic moments. <br /> <br /> However, there are many typical Lynch motifs, such as: a floating work camera; haunting music; long (painful) pauses; hanging curtains; dim lights become darker at a slow (almost indistinguishable) pace; extreme closeups; women in distress; insurmountable, compassionate, all knowledgeable characters are confronted with characters who are distraught, temporarily oblivious, in the dark, etc. <br /> <br /> The performances are gorgeous, and a brief thought provokes. As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything up to interpretation. Many questions remain unanswered, and this ignites the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant lynch effort. I just hope he makes some shorts more like his sony playstation 2 commercial. They were inspired.
