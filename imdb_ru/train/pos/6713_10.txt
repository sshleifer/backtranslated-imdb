I liked this TV show, because it was in itself that the girl who turned sixteen, finds out that she is a witch, and she lives with her aunts in the house, and they are also witches. Well, it took her several weeks to get used to. When she first used her powers, it was so funny because she turned her enemy into a pineapple. She had to turn back time and repeat the day. This series is really cool, and this is a typical teenage series, but she was exhausted when she moved from home to apartment with her college friends, and then she got bored and I stopped watching. and the other was really dizzying. I loved Valerie and hated Sabrina's enemy, Libby, she was ugly.
