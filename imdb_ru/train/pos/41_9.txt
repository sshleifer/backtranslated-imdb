"Who did this?" contains a lot of true laughter and jokes. This is not only one of the best films about The Stack with Shemp, it is one of the best short comedies made in Colombia. Directed by Bernd originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the Stooges, but when Curly Howard experienced a stroke in his career, he was adapted for the comedy team Columbia from Schilling and Lane (their version was released as "Pardon My Terror"). it was too good for Stozhi to refuse, and he was finally shot by the Stacks at the end of 1947. <br /> <br /> Old Man Goodrich calls Schemp, Larry and Moh's aces detectives out of fear that he will be killed. When they arrive at his house, Goodrich disappeared, and his niece and various assholes are trying to get rid of the puppets. Will they find Goodrich and will they bring her niece and thugs on trial? <br /> <br /> Shemp is especially funny in this movie. His reactions after Christina McIntyre gave Mickey are excellent; he makes the sound of his trademark (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb), and Miss McIntyre is clearly trying not to laugh! Other fun scenes: a close-up shot of a Moe looking through a camera lens; and fight in the dark with all the actors involved. <br /> <br /> Niko Gong (played by the Duke of York) is one of the most unusual-looking characters ever depicted in the movie Handgun. With his curved hair, he could almost pass for Stog, if he did not rise above all the others! "Who did this?" is a jewel among the films Stack with Shemp. Even Curly fans will love this! The real Stog classics. 9 out of 10
