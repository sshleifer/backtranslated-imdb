Q: How do you steal the scene from expert expert scene thieves Walter Mathau in full, furious and brilliant Grumpy Old Man mode? The answer is: quiet, calm and with perfect time, like George Burns. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know anything about Vaudeville, but it remains my favorite movie, the two main commercials are funny, funny scenario, direction and tempo very well. Richard Benjamin is very funny, like an ordinary person, he tries to get to Burns through a window, etc. Even small details are great. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny scenes, Matau spoils the commercial, Burns repeats his answers as if senile ... <br /> <br /> Delight. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrr!
