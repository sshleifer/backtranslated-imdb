I just finished watching this well thought out and beautifully played / directed film. It was hard to know if I was going to waste my time watching a movie in the Lifetime Movie Network because of the terribly distracting commercials. Reading the previous comments convinced me to try. In the end, the worst thing that can happen is that I can fall asleep during one of the boring but long announcements about insect sprays. So why did I watch this? mainly because when IMDB gives the film “WEIGHT AVERAGE” out of 5.8, WHO'S STATISTIC AVERAGE MEDIUM was 7.3. This should be a sure hit. <br /> <br /> I was very glad I took the time to watch this film, commercial smallpox and everything. Helen Hunt continues to amaze me with his ability to perform tough roles, adapting his key figure to each role. <br /> <br /> The portrait that she painted in this film about a tough but penetratingly human police officer was beautifully executed. When a scene calls for witty and timely oral communication, it can stand face to face with any actor. However, she is adept at dealing with the amount of emotional response, without saying a word, relying only on facial expression and body language. Without commercials that are intended to kill the continuity of any good film, this would really be wit. I gave him 9.0
