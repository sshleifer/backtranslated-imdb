A young and seemingly promising college graduate (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to prison for killing an innocent young girl and is put on death row. Sean Connery plays the role of a lawyer of “happy happiness,” whom a young man's grandmother tracks down after retirement and begs for the matter in the hope of freeing his grandson. Laurence Fishburn plays a policeman who was well involved in this case and damn determined to refute the theory that Connery could dig up to try to free the boy, who, like him and the whole police department, swear guilty of a crime. Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and film colleague Leith Lynn Tigpen in this very intense dramatic thriller.
