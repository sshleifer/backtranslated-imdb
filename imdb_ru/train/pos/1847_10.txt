Whoever you are in your life, you should never forget that you have roots. This is a story of true facts that has been turned into a beautiful and moving film! I dare say that this film is undervalued. It shows us the reality of life ... the more evil surrounds you, the better you become. Trust your instincts and realize that the ideal of life is to live happily ... without resentment, without life "under the rock." The concept of the film is more interesting ... combines story-telling with real-life events ... keeps us updated on everything ... from facts to emotions! Bless these people and make everyone happy! Look, I recommend this to all young people. It's not racism, but how to live your life!
