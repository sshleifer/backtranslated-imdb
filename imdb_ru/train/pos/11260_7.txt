Well, the story is a little difficult to understand for the first time, but this is only because all the drawn and painted vampires of the 70s are naked with breasts dancing to bongo drums. This, of course, is interrupted by several vampiric orgies. And there are some very interesting candles and their use. And for the girl on the girl action, vampirik or not ... this film is just awesome !!!
