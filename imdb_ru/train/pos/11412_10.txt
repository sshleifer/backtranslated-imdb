Beautifully and intelligently played by two young girls, Mischa Barton as Frankie and Ingrid Uribe as Hazel, although the plot is rather stretched. Honestly, young Hazel running for mayor seems out of place. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the acting is well done by all interested parties, the film lacks a genuine dramatic atmosphere. Perhaps we grew up expecting a harsh reality in the movie, rather than comparing Pollyanna to how green my valley was! Never mind, each one is good in his own way. <br /> <br /> I admire Joan Plowight, even if her role here is somewhat muted. Mid-road entertainment is well suited for younger audiences, and how nice it is to occasionally show off great classical music, which is almost a rarity! <br /> <br /> I consider this film a welcome change, as it reflects quieter, thoughtful values ​​for growing up, and there is no violence, thank God. Warm family movie to enjoy.
