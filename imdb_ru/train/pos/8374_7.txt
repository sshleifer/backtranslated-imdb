OK, this movie was awesome. I don't think it was the best movie ever, but it was fun. My brother and I still play the scenes from time to time, and from time to time we take out the film from the closet, blow off the dust and stick it out. Nice to the end, but a great concept. This is a movie that you just need to forget about criticism together and just enjoy. Judgment is the victory of the Jocks robot.
