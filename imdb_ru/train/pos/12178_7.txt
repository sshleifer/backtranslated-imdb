I think this movie got a low rating because it was judged by its worst moments. There is a joke about diarrhea and an awkward scene with nuts, but other than that there are quite a few moments that make me laugh out loud. Jason Lee plays a surprisingly fine comedy in this film, and Julia Stiles manages to be damn funny. In addition, this film behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes you know how it will end. (Which is better than most of them, where you already know, in +/- 5 minutes). In any case, it is better to watch movies, but definitely not the worst choice ... Hooray
