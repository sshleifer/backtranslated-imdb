This, and not definitely a bit overpriced “Southern soap opera,” was the greatest epic of the greatest Hollywood year, 1939. I will not repeat the obvious: Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen (who was a Bengali lancer) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. gives excellent comic performances. However, I want to mention two other, less clear elements of this masterpiece. The magnificent final battle, when the wonderful Sam Jaffe hardly rises to the top of the temple to blow up his forge and to warn the regiment, it’s just great. It never ceases to fascinate me. Another underrated element in the film is the performance of Eduardo Chiannelli in the role of Guru. This is not a caricature of Fu Manchu, but a well-drawn, clearly articulated, historically-informed (“Have you ever heard of the Maurya Chiangrubutra? He defeated the armies left in India by Alexander the Great”), a villain. Indeed, one can see parallels between this mystical, evil nationalist and some famous figure of the thirties (a German, not an Indian). Gung Dean, anti-Nazi treatise? Not really. But still awesome, funny, touching epic.
