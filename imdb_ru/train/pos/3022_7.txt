I never realized that Charles Boyer (Louis Denard) appeared together with Lauren Bacall (Rosa Cullen) in one movie and enjoyed their great game together. Even Peter Lorre (Contreras) played a role in this film, and he had a misfortune in the bathroom, because of which he lost consciousness. This story deals with Republican courier Louis Denard, who visits England during the Spanish Civil War and is trying to break the contract for the extraction of coal, which will cause great harm to other countries. Lauren Bacall (Rosa Cullen) comes to the rescue of Louis Denard, picking him up and at the same time falling in love with him, and then helps him escape from the angry crowd of English miners who threaten his life. The real bad guy in this film is Victor Fransen, (Licata) "The Beast with Five Fingers", which gives outstanding performance The great classic film of 1945 without Humphrey Bogart.
