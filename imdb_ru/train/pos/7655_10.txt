Having not seen this movie for about 20 years, I am still impressed with its tough impact and stellar play. Of course, one Mr. Mickey Rooney is really INCREDIBLE in his lead role in the "Killer" ring. (As for the other review here, none other than Orson Welles also recalled Mickey Rooneyâ€™s name as the greatest actor in cinema.) I also recall the jazz-copper score and the bare black and white photo. I like the last line of Mick before he goes for a dose of lead poisoning (I think that "Dusha" raised it for a line in one of his songs - "Take me in hand"). This is a great film and an undeservedly buried film. Let's get it out! An additional note - the recent magazine Film Review gave a great article on Don Segal's Babyface Nelson, shot a couple of years before The Last Mile, as well as Mickey Rooney in the title role. Another delight from the intense and sympathetic performance of Mick. Perhaps this is the beginning of a good perception of some truly excellent cinematic performances.
