Watching this several times as a child was a real experience 15 years ago, and now that I found him again, he still has film experience, like some others. If this is risky, this is an excellent demonstration of moral and life lessons recommended for family viewing with young children. While it is still an adult, I was lucky that I learned a lot from him many years ago. Trying to find it today is quite difficult. but believe me, it's worth it, regardless of age. Especially anime lovers will find this wonderful record in the Masami Hut filmography. With impressive artwork and unique design, Chirin No Suzu is a worthwhile experience. While some of the lyric songs are not very hot when recorded in English, the musical score is nonetheless charming. But even the voice acting is much better than today. Unfortunately, it came out of print in the mid-1980s from RCA Columbia Home Video and, to my knowledge, did not receive any new version of the format, at least in the United States. Look for him, and you will be quite happy! This is a cunning, rich, pleasant and important landmark in Japanese animation.
