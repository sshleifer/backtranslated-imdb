Interesting characters, a lot of tension. How close to black and white without being black and white. I was discouraged by how carelessly supposedly sympathetic the mainstream character, a quiet, almost deaf secretary, was able to turn to crime to kill colleagues, beat people on her way and, finally, participate in a robbery, and appoint someone to be beaten as bait for her own care. I am a little repelled by the tendency that in other quality films criminals sympathetically portray criminals, ignoring the damage they have done to others, except that their immediate opponents are portrayed as assholes. In this film, we will never know whose money they are actually hiding, or what happens to an innocent wife, which the sympathetic deaf secretary uses to set up a vile bar owner to fall for the missing prey. Sorry, the movie could be great.
