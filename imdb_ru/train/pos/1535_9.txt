Fortunately, as a student, I can watch “Murder with a diagnosis” for several years. This is mainly a doctor who investigates murders with the help of his son LAPD, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM has provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What distinguished him from many other police shows and was worth watching many times, is his cast and quality of writing. The main cast gave good performances, and the roots of the artist Dick Van Dyck shone through the use of magic, dance and humor. The best sides of the DM were at a fast pace, witty scenarios and, of course, sketching a finger. Unfortunately it was unfair compared to "Murder, She Wrote." DM is much better, boasts more challenging riddles and more variety. Now it is gone, television is the worst place. Gone are the days when I felt good, family police shows. Now there are only oppressive "sandy".
