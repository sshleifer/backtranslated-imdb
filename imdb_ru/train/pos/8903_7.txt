Of course, this is a special trip in the 50s, but do not let this fool you. In my little book there are many intelligent touches with unexpected portions of humor. Catch the formidable Mrs. Porter, who must keep track of the doctor's place. She not only steals the scene, but damn approaches the whole movie. And where are these indie producers coming up with bucks for color film, a wise decision, since a drop would not have seemed good in black and white. Yes, the result is ragged around the edges, as shown by the number of dead ends. But, with the exception of a few teenagers, the non-Hollywood cast plays well. In addition, the game among the hot and the police looks very lively and exciting. Pretty damn good for a couple of directors, more at home in the pulpit than on the sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to portray teenagers in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with “juvenile delinquents”. On the other hand, the 27-year-old McQueen is hardly suitable for work in the age department, but in any case he is in control of a hot attitude. The film at that time was a hit, which was undoubtedly promoted by a catchy title melody that received many radio shows. And with the exception of unsuccessful final effects, the film is still very funny, with or without arrival. Meanwhile, I am waiting for the clot to return now, when the polar ice sheet is turning, let's say, into a refrigerator.
