I like my Ronald Coleman, dashing and awesome, the guy you see in films like "If I Were King and Kismet." I like it as the epitome of civilization, as in "Lost Horizon" and "Random Harvest." Pensive Coleman is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> But in Double Life, precisely because his role as actor Anthony John is so unusual for him, Coleman was recognized as the best actor of the Oscars in 1947. became his most famous part. <br /> <br /> Coleman is an actor who really takes the method very seriously. He has just completed a successful run in a comedy of manners, and he is a rather cheerful guy. To change the tempo now that this play has finished its work on Broadway, Coleman brings Othello's revival to New York. Approximately the same opposite, which only you can get. <br /> <br /> His leading lady in both cases is his ex-wife Xinho Hasso, who loves him very much, but cannot put up with his mood when he is at work. Coleman also loves her very much and wants her back. But he moves to a mental breakdown when he begins to confuse himself with the jealous Moors of Othello and Hasso with her role Desdemona. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Shelley Winters, as a poor waitress raised by the repressed Coleman, stands in the way. his madness, and she turns out to be like poor Desdemona in a play. Killed in the same way, and now it's up to the police to investigate the murders of Joe Sawyer. <br /> <br /> Coleman’s play is so good that you can only wonder if this is a professional risk for the actors? I would be scared to think so, if there were any unsolved murders inside or around Lawrence Olivier and Orson Wells, and then they wrote Othello. <br /> <br /> For this reason I will never be able to buy this story, but I certainly applaud Ronald Coleman and what he did with this role. I am sure that in his victory at Oscar there was a shade of regret, because one of the other nominees was his good friend William Powell from Life with a Father. That same year, Gregory Peck for the “Gentleman Agreement”, John Garfield for “Body and Soul” and Michael Redgrave for “The Tribulation Becoming Elektroy” participated. <br /> <br /> Coleman gets support from the rest of the cast, including Edmond O'Brien, who finds himself in an undesirable part of Cassio in Coleman’s jealous fantasy. However, you will not find Yago's equivalent in Double Life, no one pushes for jealousy, it's all in his own mind. <br /> <br /> And this is from one of the most cultivated and civilized minds of the last century.
