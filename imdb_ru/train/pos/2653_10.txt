Kubrick again proved his brilliant reputation, now in the horror film of obscurity, based on the book by Stephen King, also entitled. Jack Torrance - a man of forty, married, with one child, with past troubles and alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends service in the winter due to extreme weather conditions, and there is a well-paid job for a person who takes care of objects during these five months; and Torrance, who wanted to be a writer, found him perfect. But the manager told Torrance about the loneliness in this place, potentially dangerous in the winter, and told him that some caretaker had gone crazy in the past and had killed his family. Even before they got there, his son Danny, who has some imaginary friend who illuminates his future (shining), knew that this place was not very good and did not want to go. As soon as they settled in the hotel, it all started right, but after a month Jack began to behave strangely, irritably and depressed. At the moment we know that something will happen, but we don’t know when or how. Terrible things happen, such as the appearance of two twins talking to Danny, and someone who brutally attacked him. They are not alone in this place. Later, Jack began to see other people and immediately felt well with them, as if they were his family; among them is the well-known psychotic caretaker Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he has to kill his family because they are “intruders” in the hotel. By obeying this order, Jack went to the goal, and here a lot of the most terrible things I have ever seen happened. Final spectacular, and the audience will remain interested and shocked to the last minute.
