It seems like a very primitive episode of the General Hospital, established in the generic department (including for severe cases), this high-speed programmer has a satisfactory emotional impact - mainly because Eric Linden, as a distraught young husband in the main story, perceptible downfall, and with such a good reason. His future wife, Loretta Young, was taken to the ward at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for separating a libertine who probably had him; Ms. Yang, as always, does nothing to rekindle the sympathy of the audience, and she is too good to be true, although, of course, she is pretty and good to look at her. Her hard pregnancy and relationships with other girls from the ward form the essence of the film, and the result — not entirely happy — seems right. Elin McMahon, “one of the few wonderful movie actresses,” according to the apt words of film historian David Thomson, radiates warmth and authority as a senior nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a not-too-willing new twin mom, gets to Frankie and Johnny Kroon drunk lullaby. Frank McHugh is featured in another storyline, and he shows a greater range than Warners usually allowed him. He is scaled and modest, and the panic of the expectant father Linden stays with you for several days - this kind of role was often played for laughter, but he is a frightened young guy in trouble and very persuasive.
