I saw IPHIGENIA only once, almost 30 years ago, but since then it has haunted me. <br /> <br /> One sequence was especially remembered, and only a great director, like Michael Kakoyanis, could create it. <br /> <br /> Context: the burden of history, the mighty army and navy lie on the shoulders of King Agamemnon. The act of baptism calmed the sea, putting at risk his great expedition to Troy. He is told that he must sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to Apollo in order to raise the wind on the sails of the Thousand Ships. He resists at first, but comes and deceives his wife, Clytemenstra, to bring their daughter to the Greek camp to marry the greatest of all warriors, Achilles. <br /> <br /> Clytemnestra and Iphigenia arrive, learn about bringing sacrifices and angering the gods for their defense and revenge. Meanwhile, proud Achilles discovers that his name has been used in such a fraudulent, dishonest way. He climbs the hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect her. <br /> <br /> Snapshot: the camera hugs two young people without looking directly at each other. They mourn their own fate and the weakness of people who are deceiving their loved ones and craving war. Suddenly they stare at each other, and at some point we feel their strength and beauty, and the undeclared - with the exception of the camera - the irony is that at another time, in another place, they can love each other and be married, This is a harsh and sad epiphany that lasts only a moment. <br /> <br /> What direction! What camera! What a story!
