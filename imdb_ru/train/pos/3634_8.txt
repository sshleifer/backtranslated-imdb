I had low expectations from this film, but I was looking for something simple for the evening. I left the theater completely admired and somewhat surprised. This is a very good movie about baseball and a good lesson about how to make your dreams come true. Dennis Quaid does an excellent job with his role, and I was touched by his performance. Definitely worth the ticket for the full price and a couple of hours of your time!
