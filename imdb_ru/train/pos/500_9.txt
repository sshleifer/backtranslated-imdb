I, like many stubborn Trekkers (or Trekkies, I don’t care!), Outlived the seven seasons of Star Trek Voyager, dreaming of a better show after it ended, mourning the end of Deep Space Nine in 1999. prayers, answer. "Enterprise" is fantastic. Fresh perspective, fundamentally different characters, stunning new visual effects, a pop song for introduction. (I was shocked!) I can’t think of anything that I didn’t like. Sign me up for 10 seasons of this show. “Star Trek” is back - “Voyager”, no one misses you! Go on Trekkin '! <br /> <br />>
