This film reminded me that some old black and white films are definitely worth watching. <br /> <br /> I initially had some reservations, but from the beginning of the film to its end I was captivated. I was VERY impressed with the mixture of drama, suspense and comedy. <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) is very cheerful and made me stitches all the time. <br /> <br /> Definitely add this movie to your night movie for easy relief from today's sometimes depressing and “too” strong or too “funny” movies.
