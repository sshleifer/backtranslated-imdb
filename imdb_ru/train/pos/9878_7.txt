almost every review of this film that I saw was pretty bad. This is not very bad, it is actually quite good, although not very. Judy Garland’s character might be annoying, but she didn’t allow it. Somewhere along the line, I became a fan of reverie, authority, replaying Van Heflin, at least in the early 40s. Judy's singing is great, but the film missed a great chance without showing more of their relationship. I gave him 7.
