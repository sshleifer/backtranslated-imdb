I found this episode one of the funniest that I have seen in a long time. The creators of the South Park made the best parody of the Romero film I have ever seen. They really touched on Romeroâ€™s main social commentary, which he made with each of his films. I would like to know what was the opinion of George Romero in this episode, I am sure that it was purely positive! Keeping his true vision of his zombie epic completely intact! Most cheat on pure blood without forcing the viewer to think about how Romero is trying to do with his films. I think that if there was a zombie outbreak, we could actually worry about our property value before our lives, as shown in this episode!
