I thought this film was very well made, Heath Leger was very convincing, and his Irish accent was flawless. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also really good and believable. How true this is for what actually happened, I have no idea, but it did show why people sometimes become what they do. Maybe those who were in power were always corrupt, and I was wondering that more than 30,000 signed a petition for not hanging Ned Kelly, so maybe there was more truth in this film than it seemed sight? In many ways, it reminded me of Cold Mountain, which was another good historical film. In general, I highly recommend this film, and I’m somewhat confused as to why it didn’t seem better in cinemas.
