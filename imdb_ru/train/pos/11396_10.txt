Released two years before I was born, this Oscar-winning film has it all: luxurious scenery and Technicolor costumes, breathtaking cinematography, excellent Gershwin wall-to-wall music, superb choreography, lighter air script and great Kelly plays Levant, Foch, Guberian and Karon. Hollywood no longer makes them like that. Definitely, this is my favorite movie of all time, the standard by which I rate all other films. ENJOY, ENJOY, ENJOY!
