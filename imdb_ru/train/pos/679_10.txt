This supernatural Peter Weyr thriller is truly one of the most exciting and exciting films ever seen. Richard Chamberlain is excellent here as an Australian lawyer who defends a group of young Aboriginal people accused of murder. When he gets closer to the case, he learns more about the main accused, Chris, and not least about himself. Chris tells him that he is Mulkurul, who seems to be a race of supernatural beings who lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, unusually heavy rains seem to confirm the aboriginal prophecy about the coming of the LAST WAVE, which will drown the world. <br /> <br /> The sequence of dreams and supernatural effects reinforce this film and make it an impressive experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are solid in supporting roles, as well as the guy with the difficult name, who plays Charlie, an old aborigine who can turn into an owl. The climax and finale do not disappoint, unlike many other supernatural thrillers that fail after a promising hour or so. However, this can not be called a pure thriller. It is also a drama telling about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. Workshop by Peter Weir, master of visually stunning dramas.
