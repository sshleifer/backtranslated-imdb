The performances in this film were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patrick as a great film adaptation of the novel by Jim Thompson acted as "Kid" by Collins. This film, far superior to The Grifters, which was a good film, really remained faithful to the roots of the pulp and fiction novel from which this story originated. I recommend this movie to all film noir fans.
