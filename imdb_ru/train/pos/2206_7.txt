Do not believe all the negative reviews that this film receives. Yes, it is cheap. Yes, the blood is funny. And, yes, the action is sub. However, this is an example from an early slasher from the textbook, and if this is your “thing” (mine!), Then you will like it. There are enough good aspects in this film to more than compensate for the shortcomings. On the one hand, the estimate of the unknown then Christopher Young is very terrible and perfectly accentuates the violence. The ending is a welcome break from the predictable optimistic endings of most movies. And last but not least, this is what made the film for me. The creators of this film could have “dressed” the film set much better in order to make it more believable in a college dormitory. However, if you can skip this flaw, the setting will be excellent. Four students alone in a huge, abandoned, doomed building, waiting for demolition ... it gives the opportunity. When watching, let your imagination do some of the work, and you can enjoy this movie just like me.
