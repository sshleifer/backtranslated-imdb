My nanny was a fan, so I saw a lot of old episodes when I was growing up. I'm not a fan of Scooby-Doo, so I'm not sure why I left the TV when the premiere of this show. To my surprise, I found it enjoyable. For me, Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters * deviating tomatoes from the fans of others *, so I like that they focus only on these two. However, it can make fans of original shows hate it. I like the voice acting, especially Dr. Finius Fibes. I enjoyed listening to him even before I learned that he was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Mesquiman, like Roby, sounds to me like he really enjoys his actor job. I also enjoy techies with their slightly autistic personalities and their desire to play Dungeons and Dragons or play scenes from Star Wars (not called by the names in the show, of course).
