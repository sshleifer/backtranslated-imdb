Brilliant movie, the next best movie of the Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it on the original VHS, and I have not seen this film for 15 years, but still as good as then. The acting was terrible, and the dubbing was even worse, but it was the features that make this film (and many other old-fashioned Chinese kung-fu movies) superb. The choreography is amazing, and the storyline is the baseline. I have never seen Shaolin's 36th camera, but I know that this is the same film, but Gordon Liu plays San Te Te, and San Te in “Return to the 36th” is played by another character. It has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung fu.
