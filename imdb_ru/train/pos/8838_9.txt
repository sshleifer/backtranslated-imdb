Finally, a film where the audience wonders to the very end what will happen. Well, we all know that the life of the brothers, Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will move down to destruction, because where else to go, but down, but we donâ€™t know how and when to end the movie. Hoffman, as usual, is great, and even Hawk was decent, like a younger brother, who basically does what he is told, as he really cannot think for himself. Hawk may have been a little insane, but he played the role quite well. Add to this mix the wife of Andy, which was perfectly played by Marisa Tomei, cheating Hank; Andy's embezzlement of the company's funds to pay for his addiction and sexual addiction; and the father, who finally discovers what exactly happened on the day of the robbery. This film will make you think.
