<br /> <br /> Robot Jocks is a great little movie, well, some of the shootings are bad and the game is not so good, but the special effects are very good for a movie of this size and age. You have to remember that this film is more than 10 years old, and it was made very cheap, first of all, so you can't moan about bad details. So just relax and watch a cool movie with huge robots.
