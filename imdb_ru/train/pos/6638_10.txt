The appeal of such ancient films as this one is that you can see a real moving lifestyle more than 100 years ago. There are a lot of people leaving the factory, all of them are already dead, and none of them even remotely aware of the scale of the invention that they made before. I was shocked when I read that one reviewer called this movie as boring as home video today, and at least one other mistakenly called it the first movie in history (it was the first movie shot at 16 frames per second, but not then normal 46 frames per second). <br /> <br /> Of course, all you see is a lot of people leaving the building and going in front of the cinema on the way home from work, but this is a curious thing for dozens of reasons, not least that itâ€™s was the first film made by the Lumiere brothers, who probably had a stronger influence on the development of cinema than any other person or group of people in history.
