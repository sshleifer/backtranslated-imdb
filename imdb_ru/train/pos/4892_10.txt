It was an amazingly intelligent and interesting film that I never get tired of watching many, many times. Casting was great in the selection of young and old characters. There are those who really appreciate good actors and a clever story format. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful and is a gift to any play in which she appears. I always try to see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is a great actress and watches with pleasure as each transformation of her character comes to life. I can be grateful only when I see such an outstanding picture for the majority of movies, which recently lacked good characters, good scripts and good acting. The filmâ€™s audience needs heroes, not deviant dummies that lack ingenuity and talent. It's great to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Lane. I would like this film to receive the awards it deserves. Thanks again for the amazing night of entertainment. I congratulate the writer, the director, the producer and all those who have done such an excellent job.
