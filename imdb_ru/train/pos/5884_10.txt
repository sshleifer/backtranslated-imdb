Indeed, I liked it. The package was good, the story came up when both of the relevant episodes ended, and here is my favorite part. Mary and Valerie are not bitter! They are not like others who become synonymous with a particular series, and then refuse to talk about it or to conduct possible reunions (a vivid example is Susan Day, "The Partridge Family"). In fact, Valerie said she would be glad to make another film, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I’ll look for another one ... but if it’s not entirely successful, then they can restart this one.
