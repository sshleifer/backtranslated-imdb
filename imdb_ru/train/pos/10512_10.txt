At first I bought this film on VHS, than just bought it on DVD, this is one of my favorite films of all time. I read the book, but I really think the film is much better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow both Emma and Jeremy Northam, because Mr. Knightley was an excellent choice. He was great! <br /> <br /> This movie is 10/10! <br /> <br />
