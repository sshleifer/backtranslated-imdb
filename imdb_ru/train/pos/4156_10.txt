From the moment of his premiere, I watched several episodes of the Cold Case (especially now that he was immediately following The Amazing Race, but this was one of the best examples of writing and acting that I saw in Bruckheimer's house. Casting, especially the young officers who Were in place, and the script and editing, soundtrack and acting skills made this episode a power tour. If I were a producer, I would have presented this episode to Emmy. The portrait was made from Coop and Jimmy as part of the 48-minute episode in which many talented people try my best. I hope that there is a preliminary warning about when this episode is repeated, because I'm sure that I will notice a lot of things that I did not notice the first time.
