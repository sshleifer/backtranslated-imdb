If I didn’t know anything better, it’s almost like a production, but it’s not. It was set up perfectly, and how they got all these shots is amazing! The unfortunate events of September 11, 2001 are well combined in this documentary, and the classic shots they received made this unfortunate classic. Only a story in one frame should make it MUST see any American or person who was affected by the September 11 tragedy.
