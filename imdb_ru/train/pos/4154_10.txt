It was one of the best episodes of all time. Officer Sean Cooper was killed in his patrol car back in '68. A dying convict in the state prison says that after the shooting he stole a heroin block from the car. His case was resumed with the assumption that he was corrupt as a policeman. <br /> <br /> Further investigation of him as a police officer and person is revealed by a war veteran involved in forbidden love. This type of love was considered shameful and something that at least had to be hidden at the time. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the love that I personally support, he was still a policeman, a man and should not have been killed for it. The soundtrack was excellent (makes me watch the DVR), and selective use of black and white, mixed with color to emphasize one object or give a special feeling to the scene, was especially attractive. I will watch this in repetition!
