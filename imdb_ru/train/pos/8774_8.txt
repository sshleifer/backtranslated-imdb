In the late 1800s in San Francisco, poor well-dressed Errol Flynn (like James J. Corbett) works in a bank and enjoys visiting local “fights” (boxing) with a work colleague and drinking friend Jack Carson (like Walter Lowry) . One day, the beautiful Alexis Smith (as Victoria Weir) enters the Comstock Bank, where Mr. Flynn works. Flynn is so passionate about the elegant beauty of Miss Smith that she offers to take along her bag for withdrawing money. Smith secretly enjoys handsome Flynn, but his audacity pushes. <br /> <br /> Flynn's good deed (in fact, a loading attempt) gives him a free membership in the mocking “Olympic Club”, which conveniently includes a gym (with boxing equipment). However, Flynn’s arrogant manner and practical joke (he tickles men on parallel bars) annoys Club members. When an English boxing champion visits a club, members try to get Flynn to fight this man. They hope that Flynn will retire, humiliated by his defeat - but Flynn will win! <br /> <br /> First producer Robert Buckner packs great packaging for Warner Brothers and director Raul Walsh. Mr. Buckner, of course, basked in the success of his contribution (script) to the brilliant studio "Yankee Doodle Dandy." Unfortunately, this story is positively funny. There was “Gentleman Jim” - this story supposedly takes off the real autobiography of the real James J. Corbett “The Roar of the Crowd”, but this film should be considerably invented. <br /> <br /> Flynn is a very attractive leading person; he easily maneuvers according to the script and should have been recognized in the early 1940s as an excellent actor. Many of the Flynn features were (or?) Missed as excellent performances, and this is one of them. Smith copes well with his female interests, deftly conveying his emotions to the viewer. Director Walsh makes nonsense look sleek and extravagant. The supporting cast is a treasure trove, from the frantic Alan Hale (like Pat Corbett) to Lon McCallister (“Mr. Corbett's Paging”). <br /> <br /> ******** Gentleman Jim (1942) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
