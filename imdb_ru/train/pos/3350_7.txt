I do not remember ever seeing it tonight, perhaps the name sounded so ordinary that it continued to pass by me. But this is a well-thought Western, with an interesting, thoughtful storyline, complemented by the fact that it turns from good to banal. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum descends into a wide open city in search of his wife and news about his daughter, and remains a tamer for some time. As usual, good business people have mixed emotions - they want to get rid of the villains, but they like the business they bring. This is still applicable: loosen the laws on drinks and gambling and encourage the industry, but pretend to regret the gloomy consequences it can have on ordinary people. What is striking in this film is the cynically intense image of Mitchum about cleaning the city from the villains and the recognition by the citizens that his violent methods were the only ones. Favorite moment: the sudden death of two villains in the Red Dog cabin. Shooting in the main saloon bordered on an abomination, but it was an effective way to combat the spread of poison. <br /> <br /> In general, a very good film, the only mistake in which, as a rule, is a bit hooligan - is not very good for virtues who probably would prefer to negotiate with Evil throughout life, rather than stopping them.
