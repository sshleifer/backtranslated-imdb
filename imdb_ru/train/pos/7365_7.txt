I find it very touching, as Spike and Heaton stay together throughout the entire movie, not to mention the fact that there were not a few betrayals along the way. I thought the chase was postponed, the relationship between them was in the foreground, I think. I already guessed that Heaton had such cheerful intentions. My favorite scene was supposed to be the one where Heaton and Spike were stuck in the swamp, and Spike runs away, I generally thought Spike would not return. I have to say that if it were not for our film teacher who made us watch this, I probably would never have seen it. Overall, I thought this film was pretty good, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of British films.
