The film is really sharp, unique and inspiring. History is universal in the sense that it is a battle between good, evil and peace between them. It is MOST IMPORTANT that his rating is wrong, misleading and parodying. Blockbuster rated it as if it were a movie rated X. The truth is that it is closer to G than to PG, and children who can read simple and understandable subheadings should see it.
