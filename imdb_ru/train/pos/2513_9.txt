Beautifully made. A lot of longing. Friendship can not stand everything, but in the end it's all that matters, or so a group of friends learns. I watched it over and over. The music is amazing too. When Kay loses the only friend he has, he gives up until he meets Shaw, an orphan boy who is not repelled by his true nature. On the lawless streets of Mallep, they fight for their place among the melting pot of Asian races and find out that sometimes being on top can cost you more than you are willing to pay. The end of surprise, which captures the same as the whole movie. I could not get enough of it. Gackt and Hyde do an excellent mastery of acting, proving that they are more than just singing guys.
