Wizards of the Lost Kingdom - a film about a young prince (Simon), who was expelled from his kingdom because his father (king) was killed by the cliche “evil adviser”. This film is about the adventures of Simon. The special effects, plot, action, and in general, everything in this film is BAD. However, it is so bad that it is ridiculous. You will continue to watch this film simply because it’s so bad, it’s funny, and as another film reviewer said, it’s so bad, it’s good.
