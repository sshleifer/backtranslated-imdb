I first made this film many years ago and was absolutely delighted with it. More recently, feeling the strange need to revisit some of the too few films that I enjoyed immensely in my life, I decided to take another look at Erendir. And I am glad that I did it, because I soon discovered that even with the passage of time the radiance of this film did not fade at all. <br /> <br /> The story of a teenage girl (Erendira played wonderful Claudia O'Hana - in some ways she looks like Winona Ryder!), who accidentally burns in her grandmother’s mansion, after which her grandmother, hypnotized by Irina Papas, forces girl engaged in prostitution on the road to pay damages. <br /> <br /> Viewing at the same time fascinating and convincing - although, despite the basic premise concerning prostitution, with taste is devoid of unreasonable and rich sexual content. The story revolves more around the interaction between the girl and her grandmother, and various other colorful characters with whom they come in contact during their stay, which, by the way, is located in the harsh and destructive part of rural Mexico. <Br /> <br /> The film is very atmospheric, mysteriously mysterious, with a decisive fabulous quality. Sometimes it borders on a strange one, but not from the point of view of, say, a David Lynch film. It is also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature, read the comments of previous viewers below ... <br /> <br /> Often in the background you hear the sounds of a lonely accordion, quiet and dreary, adding just the right musical accents to emphasize mexican setting. The cinematography of the countryside, many of which are in the desert, is quite excellent. <br /> <br /> The film is moving at a good pace, neither too quickly nor too slowly, and after each scene I felt like I had to rewind the tape and play it again, simply because it makes you want to do it. In any case, for me it is really convincing. <br /> <br /> I hope you will see a film in Spanish with subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school and also in college, and I was happy that I could understand a lot of the dialogue. Por ejemplo: "El mundo no es tan grande como pensaba". (“The world is not as big as I thought,” ie. This is a small world.) <br /> <br /> This film somehow reminds me that I came across a dusty old bottle of vintage wine, which after drinking, however, you get tremendous satisfaction, and you have to be sad a little when you realize that there are no more bottles like this.
