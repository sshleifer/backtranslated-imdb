I will not give anything, describing the plot of this film, except to say that it begins with the return to Israel of a young blind woman, whose closest friend and companion had just committed suicide. It unfolds as a detective story when a blind woman tries to find out why her friend ended her life. As she continues her investigation and information accumulates, this inevitably leads to a destructive conclusion. The film is masterfully shot, and the acting, especially by Talia Sharon in the role of Ya'ary, the blind woman, is excellent. The Israeli film has definitely come of age and is now fully competing with other foreign films, although few have found a large audience in the United States.
