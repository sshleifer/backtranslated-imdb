I liked it so much that I bought a DVD and a novel at the same time. The chemistry between actors (including little Arthur) is amazing and exciting. <br /> <br /> It could have used a little more screen time for the tasty Frederick Lawrence (played by James Purefoy) And Gilbert Markham was amazingly “on it” from the very beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> The one who most excited me with amazing shock, surprise and surprise was Rupert Graves in the role of Arthur Huntingdon. I adore him in "Sasuke Forsythe" and in everything that saw him. But he transcends himself here as Arthur. In my wildest dreams, I could not imagine how he plays a psychotic madman, such as Arthur Huntingdon. But he does. And I love it. And I love him.
