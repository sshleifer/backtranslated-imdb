A distinctive feature of Withnail & I is that it is sealed, that shortly left college and life can go in any direction along with all other outfits. Freebird is something for those who probably never thought about higher education and just went to work at the age of 15/16. I know that some broad sheets stuck a knife into this film when it came out in theaters, but I saw him in a crowded house in Hailsham, and everyone seems to really like it. I grew up in Dean's forest, and it brought me back to my mushroom and drug days (I had wonderful buddies — I didn’t want to think what they were doing now — probably I ran the local council). I watched it a couple of times on DVD and I already see the film as an old friend, who will forever remain part of my collection (as I might like this film and Dambusters - somehow not right) the edge to the second half of this film, and I think that social scenes of interaction with local people made brilliantly. I like the combination of the three main characters, and there really are some excellent lyrics, as well as some very quoted lines, and I dare say that this is a good example of integrity. I tried to get a soundtrack, but it was never released (shame because it is a traffic jam). Someone told me that initially it was a stage play, not quite sure how it worked, but I’m sure it was fun. I liked the little Shakespearean touches / links that seem to occur throughout the whole movie (also noticed by referee Dylan Thomas), and like all little pearls, there are always little things like the final scene that gives Easyrider a bow next trip. In general, the really unpretentious part of making a movie (I love it!)
