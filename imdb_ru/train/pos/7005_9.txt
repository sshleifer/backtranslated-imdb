When his DVD came out, I came to the market and bought it. And I think my money was on the right track, as I expected before I bought it. Awesome movie, what else can I say for Will Smith, he was a terrific actor, as always, in movies or action movies. He always gives record rates of inhibition. I think this is a movie after the August fever that makes a person cry while watching. The way the director described the story was truly amazing. His previous life and his new movie life were properly designed for the audience. Even I could not find any mistake in the story or the way they shoot it. I think his DVD should be homemade, because it will be a really good thing for your collection. This is not a movie that needs popcorn for fun, this is a movie that allows the audience to learn a lesson. what lesson you can see while watching. And I advise those people who are critics of the film, please watch it, if you could find any criticism about this film, then please talk to me.
