The League of Gentlemen is one of the funniest, strangest, darkest, and unforgettable comedies of our time. So it paved the way for new comedies of this kind, many of which copied the style, but never succeeded. <br /> <br /> Unlike any other display of sketches around, the characters of the League of Gentlemen are all loosely connected. First, they all live in the fictional city of Royston-Vasya, in the depths of northern England. <br /> <br /> The first characters to greet the newcomers are Tubbs and Edward, the owners of the pigâ€™s face, presumably the local store, which is so far away that most of the inhabitants are probably not aware of its existence. Other oddities: the Denton family, obsessed with hygiene, chastity and toads; Hillary Briss, who sells a special, but fortunately unknown, brand of meat; Pauline, a restart officer with a sharp tongue and even sharper hands; Mr. Chinnery, a kind-hearted veterinarian and a threat to all four-legged; Jeff Tipps, plastic salesman with a vicious sense of humor, often with guns, electric pipes, etc.,,,,,,, DRAIN !!!!! <br /> <br /> Although the League of Gentlemen is a comedy at heart, it often goes beyond genres, although it never seems to fake or rip off other people's material. There are several references to horror, such as the disappearance of the traveler, a pair of silent twins, an obsessive circus owner, and a sudden outbreak of nosebleeds. Even more striking are the moments when the series takes on a more reserved tone, and the above-mentioned characters, such as Pauline and Jeff, are shown in a more sympathetic and vulnerable light. The film's adaptation is the best demonstration of this, but some fans may decide that they belong to the local population. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the underestimated third episode also follows a different path; instead of sketches, each episode focuses on a separate character with each storyline leading to a single conclusion involving a plastic bag and a runaway van of a theater company. Although many fans may not like the structure of the film or the third series as much as the first two, they are certainly signs of how creative the League of Gentlemen can be and how much they are not afraid to explore new areas. <br /> <In short, the "League of Gentlemen" is definitely worth it to see, as the greeting sign says: "You will never leave!"
