A pretty good picture of a person who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the killer wanted to kill the lady, why not take it off and let the cop try to figure out who that was? Involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous, not to mention that you have to worry about staying locked up. Why did a depressed woman go to a bar when she could hardly sit on a chair or say a word? Are there actually cops who wisely crack, chew gum, grin monkeys that are so suspicious of the suspect? It probably played well before the wheel was invented, but today itâ€™s so trite and unbelievable. Catch Elisha Cook's manic recess; his frantic knocking never matched the record. His crazy expressions made up for unusual sync.
