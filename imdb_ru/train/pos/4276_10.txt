At first glance, Who sings there seems simply absurd and excellent comedy only with an unusual, quiet and slow movement: what a mistake! <br /> <br /> Starting with two singers in a desolate landscape, then a bus and a wonderful group of actors, he hides a gem! <br /> <br /> Folded history and a false rhythm make you think, yes, it’s funny, but you can just guess that it’s going to be a gentle film. <br /> <br /> Not at all: very funny, instantly, gloomily, cynically towards others, does its development surprise you throughout history ?? Very ingenious and intelligently presented, all the characters are important, and the actors give them a full life. <br /> <br /> And surprisingly, it is based on deep observation, excellent mastery of camera work and is of great importance and in fact everything, the general direction and how details are also presented, it just makes you forget that film: it's like watching a kind human society that you don't know yet, shot by a friend behind the camera. . <br /> <br /> And you are the one who is behind him. It is simply and simply exclusive! <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong; In no case does this mean that the script, the quality of the image, the musical accompaniment have a kind of amateur character, no, no! This is great art! <br /> <br /> Because it flows like a river ?? From the top of the mountain, down to the sea, with all kinds and riddles that the real river faces on its way to the sea ?? from the tiny thing to the mainstream. <br /> <br /> This is a metaphorical image that I used - the best way to explain the beauty of someone who sings there. For me, again, I take the hammer: just exceptional ... <br /> <br /> I saw that the Director is the one who made Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, who, as I know, is very famous ?? But since I had not yet seen him, I had no idea about this gentleman. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers wrote dirambic comments on this film, I completely agree! <br /> <br /> European Eastern Cinema is not well known, because it is rarely translated, but I was lucky to have this sample in the original language with good English subtitles. In general: deep, tasty and exceptional ... For fast and empty explosive types and buffs with special effects, avoid it at all costs, it may be too thin and useful for you! <Br /> <br /> But if you are interested in different genres and / or classics, I think you will not regret it, and in the case of a purchase you will have good communication in your personal DVD library, and there are no less of them. than honored names like Billy Wilder, Lubich or Sasha Guitry among some of my favorite directors. At least for this movie! <br /> <br /> *** A film is never really good if there is no camera in front of the eyes of the poet Orson Welles.
