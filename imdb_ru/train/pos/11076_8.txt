I will begin with the fact that it is undeservedly checked by almost everyone! The fact is that nobody expected this, especially from Guy Ritchie. What everyone expected was whooping coughs and good liners "do you like dags?" etc., but it is much more mature than his previous work. I would agree that this is confusing, but all the facts are for us, we just have to see them and listen more attentively, this film requires all your attention! Look through the cool and dazzling view of the film, try to listen to the dialogue, and not to admire the performances, and I think that we all will get a more complete understanding of the entire film. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is influenced by modern classics (fighting club, reading matter, etc.), but in general it is original both in direction and in rhythm with unsurpassed music. I feel that if everyone watched this film over and over again, they would have understood it much more and, perhaps, would have appreciated it as a wonderful example of modern cinema, and I hope Richie will continue in the same vein, as I prefer it bullying "masterpieces".
