Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. I have seen it at least a hundred times, and I can't get through it without tears. I challenge anyone watching the reunion of Seli and Nettie or Shuga and the father, and I donâ€™t feel that your eyes are becoming hazy. Whoopi Goldberg should have one award for an amazing image. And for the person who said you can't love the movie if you loved the book, wrong! I testify of it.
