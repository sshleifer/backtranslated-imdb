How powerful and exciting can be just high-quality filmmaking. This film is about everyday scenes where you can feel the sharpness hidden inside. According to others, itâ€™s true how this film vividly demonstrates how much Hollywood is lost due to its special effects, bloated emotionality and excessive climatic consequences, and has forgotten the essence of a meaningful story told with simple realism. Most of what these characters go through is implied by the scene, and not spelled out in a verbose dialogue. One aspect that I really liked in the film is the contrast of two brothers, one of whom is very frankly expressive in his children's manner, and the other is completely stoic, but both are capable of evoking deep emotions. The elder brother needed to say a little, as he usually did, it was all on his imperturbable face! Excellent cinematography, great acting, great direction! Do not miss!
