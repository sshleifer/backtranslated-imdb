I watched the trailer on the DVD after watching the movie, and I think anyone who saw it before watching the movie would be very surprised and possibly disappointed. He made most of the fact that the film was “directed by Cuba” and made it look like a horror film, when in fact it’s an absurd comedy (IMDB spell checking does not seem to think that Absurd is a word but it’s so), reminds Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. They are dead. <br /> <br /> I like how the story slowly develops at first, and then gradually sharpens. I also like the fact that there is no explanation of what happens in the film. This and the fact that the story unfolds mostly in only one set are the only aspects in which this film is similar to Cube. I recommend it.
