Oh, cliché, cliché, cliché; They are the main part of a large variety of horror films. It has a lot of them. Nevertheless, it is - Stephen King, one of the best masters of horror. This film was really good, just TOO predictable. And in what horror movie are there no stupid people? This one is overflowing with backward victims, simply practically pleading for their lives to be taken away. Pet Semetary I found a bit creepy. The way in which everything is set up was REALLY creepy, but not terrifying. For the most part, the acting was SOMEBODY believable, the wait was not so intense, but the level of entertainment was set to a high level; My eyes were practically riveted to the screen. All fans of Stephen King should watch this movie, but, like for everyone else, the OKAY thriller should be expected.
