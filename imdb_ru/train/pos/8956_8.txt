I watched this movie after watching Practical Magic, and the old movie was much better. I liked how the lighting, makeup and costumes changed as Gillian changed history. The manners of Jimmy Stewart did not really help me in this film, but I believe that they helped to emphasize the stock of the character Gillian. I was also struck by the manners of Nicky and Gillian - as if the director wanted him to seem effeminate, and Gillian - male. Nikki's gestures, when he shows Redlich, his abilities especially hit me. I never thought of warlocks as feminine, so this was an interesting way to counter these characters.
