Russell, my favorite, is great in this film. But more than that, the film covers a huge spectrum of human passion and grief. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected. The film makes the viewer realize that tolerance for other people provides a way to save humanity. Incredible love story between Lachlin and Lil. I replay their scenes over and over. Anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people. All the characters are cast and painted perfectly.
