The Cure is an amazing film ... so intense and so REAL! I was lucky to see the premiere of The Cure at the premiere in New York, and it just shook me! I also heard that he received an award from this particular festival, and he definitely deserved it. The first thing that struck me was cinematography. Eric Jovon has done an amazing job. The shooting style of the love scene halfway through the movie was awesome. In this film, a love scene was needed, and Jafri understood everything, but he kept the scene tasteful. Jovon and Jafri make up an excellent creative team, and they definitely need to work together on future projects. Judy Meier's narration was so surreal, but at the same time heartbreaking, it made me feel that the main character felt. I am a very tough critic, but I must say that The Cure is one of my favorite films ... ONLY LOVE IT! If you have not seen, check it out!
