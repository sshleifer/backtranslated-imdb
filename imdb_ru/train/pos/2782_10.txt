“Bend like Beckham” is a film that received very little attention here in the United States. This was probably due to the fact that the film was purely British in dialogue and terminology, and it talks a lot about football (football is here), with which some people may also have problems. This is regrettable because this film is absolutely fantastic and deserved more coverage here. I think the plot (after sleep) is something that many can relate to, and in the end, “Bend It Like Beckham” turns out to be a good movie with a source of inspiration and a really good acting game. I was not too excited to see this film at the beginning, but now I regret that I have not seen it before. I highly recommend this movie!
