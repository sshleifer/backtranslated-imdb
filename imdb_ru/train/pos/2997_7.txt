William Powell - Philo Vance in the film The Case of the Murder of the Nursery, in the film of 1933, which also starred Mary Astor, Paul Kavana, Eugene Pallett, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. The dog show, in which Philo received his Captain Scottish Terrier, serves as a backdrop to the puzzle of a locked room with too many suspects. The mystery is very clever, and the outcome is complex and interesting. Since the walkie-talkies are still quite young, camera work is a bit static, but Michael Curtis does a good job of managing. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent; the whole cast raises the movie one step higher. Many actors played Philo Vance, including Paul Lucas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Low, James Stevenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell played her most (five times) and is best suited for the role - very relaxed, but at the same time serious. This was done before the “Thin Man” catapulted him into great glory - by the time he spent in the cinema about 12 years, starting a career on stage in 1912 at the age of 20 years. A wonderful person, a wonderful presence on the screen and a wonderful actor who lived to be 92 years old. We are so lucky that today his films are available on DVD and on TCM. “The Kennel Murder Case” is a great story and fun movie - don't miss.
