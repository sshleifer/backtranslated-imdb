A detective (Dana Andrews) with a reputation for violence accidentally kills a murder suspect (Craig Stevens) and then tries to hide him. In the film directed by Otto Preminger, there is a lot of atmosphere, but the story softens when the dead man's wife (Gene Tierney) falls in love with Andrews. He did well in the big hole, but it was too light at the end of the tunnel for a film noir. Gary Merrill is great in the role of Scales, the criminal boss Andrews is obsessed with confusing, and the tension between them gives the film its energy and drive, especially the scene in the bath with Merrill, Andrews and Neville Brand, and the night of meeting time outside Bellevue Hospital, which establishes what should have been the conclusion of the film. High marks for the atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill, etc. ... and the overall image of the underworld, although the angle of love and the simplistic elements of a good cop of a bad cop do not help his cause.
