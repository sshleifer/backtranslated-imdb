The mannered story of old Jane seems very popular these days. I lost count of the number of versions going around. Probably the reason is that its “gauges” are our “gauges” even at such a late date. This television mini-series gives him a mannered tale suitable for a novel. Stubborn, self-assured Emma, ​​if you think about it, is a rather “modern” girl, although the atmosphere of the world of Jane Austen may seem a bit artificial today. If you don’t look like Emma, ​​I’ll just say that the self-sufficient Emma really gets her retribution. Worth a look to find out how. Here, the honors of acting are given to the ladies: Kate, Prunelle, Lucy and Samantha. They could almost have a psychic connection with old Jane!
