Shakespeare's "Storm" is the model for this exceptional science fiction film. We are looking for differences. Prospero and his daughter Miranda are stuck on a Mediterranean island. Morbius and Altayra are on the 4th planet orbiting the star Altair. Ariel - the spirit. Robbie robot is an artificial servant. The evil of Caliban is hardly approaching the evil of Caliban. “Monsters” is a comedy. The Forbidden Planet is a tragedy. We are wondering whether humanity should survive the future of Crell in the future. Ann. Francis is Altayra. Jack Kelly - Lieutenant Farman. Kelly starred in the lead role with James Garner in the comedy / western TV series Maverick.
