I remember watching American Gothic when it first went on the air, it recently occurred to me, all I could remember was the same guy who appeared in Midnight Koller - this is Gary Cole, I I don’t watch TV very much, but I watched American Gothic This week I bought a full TV show on DVD and it’s still as good as before. This is one of the best TV shows in the history, so I don’t watch a lot of TVs, because it’s just rubbish that’s included, except for Derren Brown, it’s all reality shows or TV shows such as Lubricant, Big Brother, etc. I am fed up with it, I received a full series of American Gothic for £ 16.97 from the Asda website, this is the cheapest I can find.
