This is one of the three films of the 80s, which I can remember, but unfortunately at that time they did not notice and, unfortunately, have not yet been noticed. One of the others was Clownhouse, filmed by Viktor Salva, a film horribly overlooked due to the legal / sexual issues of Salva. Another would be Cameron's Wardrobe, which seems a bit undervalued to me - not great, but not as bad as the reviews I have seen. “Paper House” is worth your time, and I think this is one of those very quiet films that just stay in your brain for much longer than you think. I mean, 10 years after I saw it, and I still pause, whereas what I could see 6 months ago went on the air.
