The meteor falls from the sky and awakens a plesiosaur, which long ago terrorized the territory around Crater Lake. When the monster eats the locals, they try to kill him. <br /> <br /> Recent attempts to send old horror films and sci-fi films, such as Lost Cadaver's Skeleton and Alien Offender, prove controversial when you have movies like Crater Lake Monster available . This is the film that these films fake and send, only this is the real deal. This is all that these films try to be only without a tongue in their cheek, and this is much more fun because of this. This is a real movie for beginners, which unfortunately came at a time when Star Wars changed our attitude to special effects. A monster, a mixture of life-size stop motion and head, a charmingly strange little beast. The filmmakers spoil the viewers with frequent shots of the monster and its chaos. Of course, it is clear that all this is fake, but isn't it films about the suspension of disbelief? In fact, I think these are really cool monsters that are in it. <br /> <br /> I like this movie with a small budget. If you want a real authentic drive in a monster movie, look no further. It would be ideal for a double or triple function with similar films about lake monsters (Bogey Creek, etc.)
