Just a movie that I love. Some very good British actors, as well as the one and only Sharon Stone. Kathryn Tramell (The Stone) skillfully manipulates a well-educated group of people, playing on their weaknesses, gathering experience to write a murder mystery book. She plays a pretty good female psychopath, using her sex appeal to convincingly portray what can be considered one of the best Black Widows. Tramell is useful for dark places within society and freely participates in sadomasochistic intrigues in the “never to visit after the dark” part of the city. From the very beginning, there is nothing in this dialogue except the R. rating. The stone can also be described as a kind of Hannibal Lecter, an unemotional fatal woman without a nutrition plan.
