Any film in which federal pigs (“people in government”) are insane threats that they are in real life can recommend a lot to me. <br /> <br /> Alas, supervision, editing and even, sometimes, the direction is imperfect, so there will be people who will humiliate the entire film and ignore the good moments. <br /> <br /> I saw the original way back when he was new, and hated him, despised him, hated it. I think it was a terrible irrational piece of trash. <br /> <br /> Now I do not remember why. <br /> <br /> I believe that these two concepts should not be compared or even linked. <br /> <br /> Treat them as two different films. <br /> <br /> Rate them as two different films. <br /> <br /> This “point of convergence” provides a unifying place, a banner for people who want to encourage individualism, who believe in human rights, who recognize a threat to freedom, maybe there is a government, especially the federal government. <br /> <br /> “Voice” wears a cap with the motto of the state of New Hampshire: “Live free or die.” At one time this would be the motto of most Americans. <br /> <br /> Despite the obvious flaws, “The Point of Disappearance” is a movie that needs to be cheered on.
