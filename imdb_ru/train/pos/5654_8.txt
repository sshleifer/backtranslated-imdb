I watched the show 10 years ago and I really liked it !!! Now I have a DVD, I watch the show and wait for the scenes I knew were on the show (when Lucas confronted Gale in his house), and realized that he was missing - suddenly I was watching seduction without a leash. up. Then I connected to the network to check all the BIOS of the stars and came across comments that the show was out of order. Thank you!!!!! But it seems some kind of conflict. Some comments say: “Strangler No. 19, and then Triangle 20, when the other had a different way. Also “Potato Boy 5” and “Dead World 6” also changed places. Can anyone clarify ?????
