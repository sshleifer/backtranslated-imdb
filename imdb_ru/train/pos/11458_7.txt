Hello from the dark again. Understanding the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist. How strange it is for most of us to see someone who MUST work ... regardless of conditions, otherwise his cause of life stops. Seeing Goldsworthy sculptures come to life, and seeing how he reacts to each of them, is extremely voyeur. This artist creates, because he must - not for the sake of money or fame. This is his life force. When you see his failures, energy seems to erupt from his body like a burst balloon. The point is not to start again, but that he takes his energy from his work. Watching his work only to capture nature and recall his work is somewhat painful, but nonetheless breathtaking. He discusses the flow and time in minimal dialogue, and there seems to be no doubt that the artist and the land are one and the same. When he says he needs land, but he does not need it ... Please differ. The only complaint - the musical score seems to slow down even more, which relaxes at best.
