For the first time I had the opportunity to see this almost forgotten classic in the early 1980s, in one of our art houses as an awakening. As I watched this feverish dream of the sexual exercises of the 1930s, I thought of YOWZA! They managed to avoid murder in Europe on the same day. Unfortunately, this film was largely cut out in its original American edition in the blue-nosed Hayes office (a firm government censorship board created by “Your Holiness”, Will Hays), a former post office employee, if you can believe it ) because it is a common theme of human sexuality (heaven forbids people from actually having sex in the 1930s). The story of Ecstasy concerns a young woman (played by Hedy Lamarr), who marries a much older man and then regrets it. She (Lamarr) meets a handsome young man and has an affair with him, which leads to a divorce from her previous husband (then there is no other in Hollywood films --- Divorce!). Despite the fact that the film was shot in 1933, it was probably the first time the director worked in a sound format (i. E. The film seems to have techniques that were used mainly in silent films, i. E. In the expressionism of the 1920s ). It is still worth finding a window to the early European conversational paintings, along with Luis Bunuel L'Age Dor (1930) and Carl Gustav Dreyer 'Vampyre' (1931). Not rated, but contains this shameful nude swimming scene and some finely veiled sexual references, which by today's standards would have cost a little more than PG-13 (but could have easily got a terrible "X" back in the 30s, if it were existed) then)
