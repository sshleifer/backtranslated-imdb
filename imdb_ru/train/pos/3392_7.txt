It was a very provocative film, especially in 1973. At the time, it was a huge box office success. After the 1970s, it seemed to be forgotten, but its central messages were too important to disappear completely. It was actually at least fifteen years ahead of time ... no one had ever heard of the "greenhouse effect" before 1985, and the controversial question about euthanasia was rarely raised. <br /> <br /> Sets and special effects may seem a bit outdated, but a lot of money on sci-fi movies was a game at that time. If you look closely, you will see that everything usually makes sense. This is a movie message, not intended for Star Wars fans, who cannot spend one minute stimulating their thoughts if there are no millions of explosions in it. <br /> <br /> This was Hestons last good movie, the end of his famous anti-utopian sci-fi trilogy. After that, it was all the bloated disasters of the epic and a large budget crowd pleasing the garbage. This may not be the funniest two-hour film ever made, and the ending can be creepy and depressing, but itâ€™s hard to find any producer who has the courage to deal with such a topic.
