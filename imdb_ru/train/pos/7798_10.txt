I can't begin to describe how amazing this film is. Suffice it to say that every time I get upset about unfair or useless things, I shoot this film to put me in order. Background music makes you aware of the ease of existence and how simplicity provides the greatest happiness. The Indian girl who sings is just one example of a character in this film who does not try and is happy as a result. Persifina, Ruby (Ashley Judd), an employee of the laundry room, is another of her glances, and a smile can make the day of the hardest person. I watch this film and dream of the days ahead or of a good conversation with friends, and I understand that loneliness — Ruby quite often — is not at all the same as being lonely. Recommended for those who like a thoughtful calm film.
