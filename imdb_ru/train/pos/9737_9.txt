Awesome performance from Simon Pegg, who is getting better and better with every role. As usual, he plays the role of a very dexterous character who sometimes makes you want to hide behind a pillow, confusing him, but this is the essence of Pegg. <br /> <br /> Laughter was regular, and tears poured out, each of them aimed at Penn. The film was very cleverly composed, where each character plays a very complex and serious role, and Penn is the only humorous act that is a huge credit for director Robert Weide. <br /> <br /> And I cannot allow this to happen without quick applause to Gilliam Anderson, who beamed everywhere. Highly recommended to everyone.
