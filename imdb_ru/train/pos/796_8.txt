Thomas Kapano was not the boss of Anna Marie, the governor was Tom Carper. For this reason, the feds intervened, he called Clinton and asked him to get the feds involved. At that time I lived outside Philadelphia, so every day it was the first news. I also read the book by Anne Ruhl and saw the section “City Privacy” by A & E. Tom Kapano was a delusion of grandeur (sp.), A Super Controller and a monster. He claimed that he loved Ann Marie, but all he wanted was someone he could control. When she no longer allowed him to do this, he killed her, the highest form of control. I think it is a waste of money that he is still alive.
