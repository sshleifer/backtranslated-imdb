At the moment it seems almost unnecessary to argue that Jon Bon Jovi demonstrates stable, strong and uninterrupted work, like Derek Bliss. His ability as an actor was previously established by his critical acclaim gained in other films (Lead, Not Looking Back). But, if someone is still interested, yes, Jon Bon Jovi can act. He can behave well, and this can be expected from him. It's easy to separate Derek from the guy who shoots hits on VH-1. <br /> <br /> I would not watch a horror movie at all. I expected them to focus on sensational blood, and not on dialogue and plot. What pleased me most in this film was that there was actually a viable storyline. The blood is not enough to become the center of the film and does not have the alarmingly realistic quality of films with a higher budget of technical effects. So, blood fans may be disappointed, but history fans will not. <br /> <br /> Unlike an action movie like U-571, where the dialogue is relegated to the background, we get a chance to get to know the “good guys” and really do not care what happens to them. Several scenes remain unexplained (for example , Derek's hallucinations), but you get the feeling that some aspects were as they should have been the basis for the continuation. Unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown by Hollywood in this film, this continuation will never happen. These few cases can be forgiven knowing that "Vampires" could be What is the best movie I've ever seen in my life? Is it a good way to spend about two hours having fun? Yes. It will not leave a person who is afraid of horror films with insomnia, and Don't leave a horror movie lover completely frustrated. If you are somewhere between a horror lover and a horror lover, this movie is for you. It reaches a happy environment with effects and history that balance each other. <br /> <br />
