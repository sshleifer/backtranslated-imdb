John Tau is a great actor. I have to admit that I was impressed with his range as a crunchy old idiot who reluctantly agrees to take the evacuees from the streets of London (World War II). the film is also great. Very touching story with a pleasant ending. Some characters are a bit underdeveloped (especially the school teacher), but none of them are essential to the plot. In fact, the story of an old man and a boy, and the film does not need anything else.
