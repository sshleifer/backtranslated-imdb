Hidden Frontier is a Star Trek fan show. The story takes place after Voyager returned from the Delta Quadrant. There are characters from the official Star Trek shows, but most of them are original for the show. The show takes place on the stellar base of Deep Space 12 and on several spacecraft, which gives it opportunities that the official shows do not have. The characters have the opportunity to rise in the hierarchy, which is not the characters in the show with only one ship. The show has a good computer animation of the spacecraft, but the action takes place in front of the green screen, and it gives the green light around the actors. Not all actors are equally good, but most do well. Episodes are character-oriented, and characters develop in many episodes. This is a bit more like Babylon 5 than on most official Star Trek shows. Hidden Frontier takes taboos that even the official series did not use. In general, I enjoyed watching it.
