I'll give it to you right ... this movie is awesome. Foreign gay films are so fast surpassing American gay films for the quality of acting and plot. While many American indie gay films look grainy, bad sound, amateur acting, banal storylines and the amazing absence of any nude or erotica, high-quality foreign gay films appear like this one from France. Cinematography is beautiful, thoughtful, meaningful. The story is adult and complex (but not difficult for everyone), the game is intense and professional. both leads are fantastic, as is the entire cast. boys are more than just beautiful, and they have a lot of nudity on their foreheads. you follow the whole year of these guys, from their meeting to the end. all the small nuances of the relationship, the details of the love and the breakup of love are perfectly fulfilled there. it left me waiting for more. check it out!
