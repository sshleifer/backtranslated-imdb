CHANDNI BAR's Madhur began making realistic films that some called “dry.” <br /> <br /> He shot SATTA, which was another realistic, though film, film, but a great movie. <br /> <br /> AAN employees made a film about the formula <br /> <br /> he returned with his excellent page 3 <br /> <br /> A film that plunges into the lives of journalists, and it’s brilliant film <br /> <br /> The film is well narrated, although it would have been possible to avoid the unfinished romantic parts of Konkanah, but this is forgiven <br /> <br /> The whole track of Upendra Limaye is also magnificent, <br /> <br /> in While the Atul Kulkarni track is also great. <br /> <br /> The dial between Manoj Joshi and his friends is fun at first, but it repeats at times <br /> <br /> Bikram-Tara’s plot is great as the whole bo The night scene as well as the latest child abuse that shocks you <br /> <br /> The film has an open ending that is nice to handle <br /> <br /> Madhur does a great job with his work Music is OK <br / > <br /> Konkana stands out as Mad Xavi, using her expressions for the better, Tara Sharma is decent, except that her voice Sandhya Mridul is good as usual. Upendra Limaye is excellent in her role as a cop, one of the talented actors. Unfortunately, he is not very good these days. Atul Kulkarni is also good in his little part of Boman Irani is restrained and does a great job, everything is fine
