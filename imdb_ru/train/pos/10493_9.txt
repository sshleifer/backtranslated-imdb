This film inspires anyone who is in dire straits, financially or emotionally. You will surely laugh, this is the best medicine! :) Having remained in a difficult financial situation when her husband dies, Grace must find a new way to make some money, and this is not entirely legal, which adds humor. Even my boyfriend liked it, so don't think this is a chick flick.
