This series introduced me to the work of Dayton and his genre when I was younger, and I love this presentation of the story. However, I do not agree with the above comment. From what I read in the past, it wasn’t Jimon who refused to release the series, not Hill’s performance, but the slaughterhouse that all three books received translated into screen. A great example of this is the rewriting of the boundary, which marked the end of Samson's field career. The scene is not in the book, the character who dies in a minefield has never been in any of the books, and the transition to Sinker took place from East Germany to West Germany, and not across the border of Poland. This whole storyline is a fabric. Changes in the Seth also damage the integrity of the story. My point of view on Hill’s actions was that he perfectly portrayed Samson’s disorientation during his wife’s desertion, and I think he showed himself well in depicting an aging field agent desperately trying to bridge a class abyss. Samson pays for the idealism of his father and suffers because of his influence on his life. As Clevemore commented, if he had been educated, he would probably have led the department. I think that the real loss of productivity is connected with the appearance more than anything else. Compared to Samson from the book, Hill is tiny - a physically impressive person, able to use his size to impose his presence.
