Star Pickford and director Turner — along with their two favorite cameramen and assistant editor Clarence Brown — bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor, isolated Scottish islanders — the same territory Michael Powell would give twenty years later for his first big success. Visions of wind and waves, tanned silhouettes of lovers do not just complement the story, they are the story of dealing with difficulties. <br /> <br /> Actors bring the dignity of proud people into their roles, and Pickford is great as her character struggles with his duties as head of the clan, hesitates between comedy and thoughtfulness, here with her father's whip, who plops wayward islanders on church sitting there with her guest's cane in her hand, like a scepter, discussing her lover, played by Matt Moore. <br /> <br /> See if you can choose future star Leatrice Joy in the ensemble. I tried, but failed.
