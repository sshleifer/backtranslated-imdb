There is something amazing about this movie. First, it must be based on a true story. It is amazing in itself that several tornadoes at night will fall on the same city in the fall in Nebraska. I wonder if the name of the real city was close to Blainsworth (this is the name of the city in the film). There is Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a city that starts with Blaines, something like that. <br /> <br /> In fact, it shows the slowest moving tornadoes in the entire history of observations when boys are in the house. On the other hand, the scene on which the TV is blurred is actually based. Before the Doppler radar and meteorological radio, we were taught that if you turn on the TV on a specific channel (not on the cable) and adjust the brightness precisely, you can determine if the tornado was approaching. The problem was that by that time you could hear it. <br /> <br /> Since I know something about a tornado in the Midwest, this film was funny to me. I enjoy it more than Twister. I mean, give me a break - you just canâ€™t get through F5 by chaining yourself to a pipe in a well house.
