Fortunately, without knowing anything about this film, I was curious to record it from TV. And then the recording ended just five minutes before the final! <br /> <br /> But I'm glad that I managed to get most of it, because this is a really great spy movie. There are the usual toy submarines and a bit vague scenes, as well as very frightening and even bold moments. Given the 1969 release, some light lesbian notes must have raised a few eyebrows. Of course, now this does not surprise anyone, and these scenes actually look quite beautiful. And this is not only because of the two actresses George. <br /> <br /> It seems that the gas attack struck every viewer very strongly, and, of course, struck me. Very effective. In addition, points of view from both sides of opponents give the whole story greater depth along with ordinary expectation and action. This is not just the heroic military history of one winning side, but it shows what is behind the victory in good and evil. Well, being a military is basically bad. <br /> <br /> For fans of composer Ennio Morricone, this is also a must. His work is always excellent, touching, but never excessive. And I think I should try to catch more movies with Susie Kendall. Talk about Fraulein! Let's hope they get it on DVD soon, so I can have the whole movie in my collection, and more people will know about this very little known gem.
