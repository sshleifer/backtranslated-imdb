Chalked in a column of victories, it was an excellent film. The acting was great and the script was equally great. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt was gorgeous, like Riverside police officer Gina Pulaski. Gina was a difficult character. She was a police novice at the Riverside Police Department. In the end, she started a romance with an employee who, as she knew, had a wife and children, and at the same time took on the dangerous task of hiding behind a secret killer. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey (similar to Ray Liotta) did a great job with the work of a confused, often stumbling policeman who had an affair with Gina. He was a stoic as an officer, but he was completely the opposite when it came to his feelings and extramarital relations. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber, especially from the Wings sitcom, did a good job, like a quiet, meek, unreachable sociopath. On the surface, he was an innocent loser, but beneath the surface lay a cold-blooded killer. Weber really took on the role of a childish young man with an insatiable thirst to kill little boys. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was spectacular. Each scene, each verbal exchange allows us to learn more and more about the characters. The production team has done a phenomenal job, concentrating the days, if not weeks, of the events in the 90-minute film. This film was a good example of how much can be done with a little.
