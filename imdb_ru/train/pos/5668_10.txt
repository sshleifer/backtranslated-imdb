I stumbled upon this series. After half an episode I was hooked. "American Gothic" was a dark, strange series with Gary Cole as the mysterious, probably evil Sheriff Buck, who is trying to take possession of his illegitimate son Caleb, played by Lucas Black. I was impressed by the sinister sheriff Gary Cole, and I was even more impressed by Lucas Black. Caleb Lucas Black was able to resist the sheriff of Baku, one of the worst characters ever created for the series. I have rarely seen a child actor with such a presence or talent as that of Lukas Black. If you're unlucky to see Lucas in American Gothic, see him in Slingblade. <br /> <br /> It was a wonderful show with a lot of ambiguities and riddles that were never explained for a short time.
