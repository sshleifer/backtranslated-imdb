This film is just too funny, absolutely not a gangster crazy computer. If in the 30s Mel Brooks took a picture about the mob, it would look like this. There are too many excellent one-liners to remember, and although itâ€™s not for everyone, anyone who DOES NOT laugh a whole bunch of times has no pulse. So put it on and LAUGH, Ice Holes !!!
