What happens to washed rock and roll stars in the late 1990s? They start the return / tour reunion. At the very least, this is what the members of Strange Fruit, the (fictional) stadium rock band of the 70s, are doing. <br /> <br /> Tony (Stephen Rea) has a concession on condom vending machines when he encounters the son of a promoter of a famous music festival. It was at this festival in the 70s that the Strange Fruit broke up. The 70s are retro, and it is time to expand this wave. He goes in search of other members of the group. <br /> <br /> Part of what destroyed the band was the death and replacement of Keith, the lead singer and brilliant songwriter. The group was known for its excessive lifestyle, and now they have all returned to the working class from which they emerged. Beano, the drummer played by Timothy Spall (who was great in the movies "Secrets and Lies"), a tramp, a bass player is a roofer, and their vocalist is still a rocker. While he owns a huge mansion, he was forced to sell it, since his condition did not last. Brian, lead guitar player is dead, so a young guitar player was hired to replace him. <br /> <br /> The group reluctantly agrees to give a chance to reunion. Having abandoned their daily work, they begin to rehearse, and their manager appeals to his label to reprint their albums. But he wants them to start touring again. And so they hit the club across Europe. The club scene is not polite with these fat, outdated, old rockers. <br /> <br /> It is in the tour that the film really starts to develop. All the old conflicts recur, with Keith and Brian figures hovering everywhere. They all stick together, because everyone is looking for a second chance for greatness that has eluded them before. And they rediscover some aspects of interpersonal communication that make playing together so enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Crazy still starts as Spinal Tap II, but gradually becomes a more focused film, following the relationships of the band members. Although it is still a very funny film, it is the developing characters struggling to cope with the death of Brian and Keith and their personal demons make the film work.
