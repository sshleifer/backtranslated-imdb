Psychotic shemale Bobby kills a patient (Angie Dickinson) of a famous doctor (Michael Caine) and then pursues an expensive prostitute (Nancy Allen), who caught a glimpse of Bobby in the elevator. Liz (Allen) falls under suspicion of committing a crime and teams up with the patient's son (Keith Gordon) to catch the killer. <br /> <br /> This can be expressed in two words: it is very sexy (Dickinson and Allen look great), it is very bloody - with the blood that is usually given to the spray of movies, and the boy is well thought out. De Palma's screenwriter and director's script is fine, but he does recede into the background to the director's abilities. This is very successful internally, and I really enjoy these characters. I can see De Palma’s standard respect for Hitchcock’s looting, at least in one of the Master’s photographs. <br /> <br /> And to top it all off, this is a professional and believable cast. <br /> <br /> This was De Palma's third film with ex-wife Nancy Allen (after Carrie and Home Films.) <br /> <br /> By the way, the dancer who became actress Rachel Ticotin was one of production assistants. For you, there are some trivia. <br /> <br /> I would not have thought that a thriller can be stylish and bloody at the same time, but this picture copes with its tasks. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this is the typically astounding account of Pinot Donaggio’s music. <br /> <br /> 8/10
