This is a film about the Italian artists of the 17th century and, in particular, about one artist, a woman of Artemisia, an unheard-of profession for women of that time, and she dared to draw a man naked, detailing his unique musculature. <br /> <br /> Camera work mainly in the room where the artists mainly worked. There are some great shots. Close-ups by candlelight suggest beautiful works by classical artists, and it is very interesting to observe how artists and their students support elaborate scaffolding that adorns the details of religious frescoes. It is not surprising that the filmâ€™s artistic elements (costumes, faces, makeup) are quite magnificently authentic, because the Italian churches have kept all these details in their frescoes for centuries. Beautiful Artemisia is encouraged by her father to learn from the great Florentine painter Tassi, who has become an expert in art of perspective and landscape painting (something very new), but unsuspecting Artemisia meets more than new techniques in painting. Posing to her, Tassi forcibly rapes her. Her father is outraged. Legal proceedings follow. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama has a rather simple story with an unsatisfactory ending. An outstanding feature of the film is its decoration and attention to detail. Scenes such as women running across the field and wind blowing up their bulky clothing add remarkable effects. <br /> <br /> Artemisia says she draws to please herself; her father draws to please others. As for this film, I will like it most of all.
