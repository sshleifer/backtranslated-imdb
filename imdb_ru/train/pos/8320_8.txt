Farrah Fawcett spent the best part of her post-angel career, embarrassing us, and sometimes the acting game deserved attention, sandwiched between her Playboy mischief and Letterman shoots. But when it comes to this, one cannot deny that this girl can act. This well-made television film, far from the history of epic proportions, gentle, quiet and sometimes exciting. Fawcett plays the wayward black sheep that comes home and discovers that she missed the last days of her motherâ€™s life and funeral, much to the chagrin of her more stable and seemingly more intelligent sister. Brad Johnson plays a love interest, and the story unfolds with all the typical elements of a television drama, but there is always something to confuse Farr to watch, and she really remains highly observable. (And, yes, I admit it, I had this Farrah poster on my wall, sometime ago). Silk Hope gets three and a half stars (out of five) on Corcymeter. Bosley would be proud.
