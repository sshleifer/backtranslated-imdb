I was hooked from start to finish. A huge horror comes from disturbing images and organic shocks, which were created not to make you jump, but to go "What the hell have I just seen?" All other commentators summarized the contents of the film, so I will not rephrase what was said. I told other people about this movie a few days after seeing him only because he was still following me. I even had a bad dream after I saw it, and I'm a real horror fan who is not easy to scare, for example, "The Grudge" or even "Silent Hill". What gave me bad dreams was that I felt anxious about what I would do if I was in that cell with these guys. What will my personal horror be? my subconscious led me there, and it was not nice. That my friends are what a good horror movie does to you! The best part of this movie is that it is thin. This is not about ghosts that jump on you, alien invasions or tons of blood. This is the opposite. The horror that you create in your own mind. The irony about the four characters is that the horror does not come from external force, which claims to be power over them. Men just ask one thing that they desire, and they get it ... but not the way they imagined. So, on the one hand, they get what they want from an occult book, but, ultimately, they may want it to be not. Sometimes it's best to be locked up in a prison cell!
