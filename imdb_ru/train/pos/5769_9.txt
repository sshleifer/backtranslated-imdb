Will you all, damn you, stop Todd Sheets!?! Let's give you 30,000 dollars to create a movie and see what you come up with! The guy got 735 zombies and the regular cast is recruited for FREE! Of course, it's funny from time to time. Yes, makeup is not the best you have ever seen. But this is not the worst, if you want to see it, look at the Zombie Nation with its zombie raccoons. <br /> <br /> This is a clean, old-fashioned partisan movie! Todd is a great professional and great guy. There are holes in the plot, yes. The plot seems far-fetched. But why the hell do I still love this movie. I would like Todd Sheets out of the underground and do what he was going to do. If someone has ever tried to make a film, he knows that only its completion is an achievement in itself.
