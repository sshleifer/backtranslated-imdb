No destination letters appear in another world found in the back rooms of the post office. Here Alice manages to find work in the hope of finding her lost father. What she does discover is the tormented soul of her boss, Frank. A quiet little Australian film that came and went to the movies. Now you will find it in the deep dark corner of the video store, overshadowed by fifty copies of this terrible GODZILLA film. It's a shame, because this film turned out to be bold, telling a brave story with bright simple images and stunning performances of two characters. This film has succeeded where another dead office of Harry Frishall's “DEAR GOD” (1996 - USA) failed, and is approaching the glamor not of Kevin Costner's turkey, but of the POSTMAN He Jiangjun (1995 - China).
