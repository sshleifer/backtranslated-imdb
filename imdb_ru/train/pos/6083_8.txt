Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and, best of all, Jeff Fahey, all in one film. Wow, that's all I can say about it. These are the four most underrated actors in the business, and they work great together. It sounds like poetry when they act out each other and exude a natural ability to appear as if they were best friends for many years even for filming. <br /> <br /> The film itself is good, and one that can be intense enough to see for the first time, and four stars greatly aid the ability to re-observe. I can't describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey together on the screen, and the greatest moment when they watch the pair from a distance and fill the vocals themselves, it almost caused tears in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Good movie, great cast, go and see. What for? Four words: Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
