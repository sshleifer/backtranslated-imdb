I was one of many who expected to see the illustrious image of Dandy-Yankee-scribble about the day, which (as we know, cited) was supposed to live in shame and not glory. How wrong I was. These guys were there, right in the middle of it, and the pictures they brought back were amazing and heartbreaking. And yet it all happened during a random trip to the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> Two French filmmakers shot a documentary about the life of a New York fireman, especially from the point of view of a young recruit coming up through the ranks. In the beginning, we see most of this material, just to remind us that there was no thought of making a film about terrorism. It was supposed to be a film about how ordinary people earn their living honestly by helping others, and the beauty of this film is that it never loses this advantage. <br /> <br /> When investigating a suspicious gas line (I think my memory dimmed a little), we suddenly hear a plane flying overhead. The camera rises, showing a commercial plane torpedoing itself into one of the towers. What was the operator supposed to think about at this time? Recognizing the importance of the footage left by the camera, and perhaps realizing the same thing, FDNY allows the camera to track them into the building. <br /> <br /> The following is a true view from the front lines. We see FDNY's commitment, their reaction (a stunning silence after hearing the first person fall to death, becoming frightening), as well as the collapse of one of the buildings from the inside, while the second camera captures events from the outside. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the terrible event that they covered, only the footage would become the dream of any young creator of the document. Simply put, the footage deserves conservation at all times. But what really distinguishes this film is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer. We see how firefighters enter the battle without hesitation, people of different races help each other to escape from the excitement and even the concerns of the filmmakers about the friend (they are brothers), because they cannot reach each other in confusion. There are amazing sights in this film, as well as amazing human stories that Hollywood will never be able to repeat (even though he tries). <br /> <br /> September 11th is not a film about politics. Nor is it a film about religion, nationality or even jihad for that matter. “9/11” is a film about people, which is a true indicator of the best and worst that we can do. “9/11” is just one of the most important films I've ever seen, and it would be the only film born at this event if it depended on me. You cannot duplicate this.
