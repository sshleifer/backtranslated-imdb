Wilhelm Grimm (Alexander Knox) ​​appears in court for Nazi crimes. Three witnesses testify - the father of Varecki (Henry Travers), the brother of Wilhelm Charles (Eric Rolf) and the former mistress of Wilhelm Marya (Marsha Hunt) - before Wilhelm speaks for himself. The film ends after the court summarizes the results .... <br /> <br /> The film is told in three sections of the memoirs, when each of the witnesses takes a position. The story basically unfolds in a small Polish village, and the memorable scenes include the village’s reaction to Anna’s death (Shirley Mills), which Wilhelm accuses of rape; dealing with Jewish villagers as they prepare to move to concentration camps; and the church service, where Willie Grimm (Richard Crane) condemns his Nazi upbringing, mourning his girlfriend Janine (Dorothy Morris), Margie's daughter, after she was shot in a brothel. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Knox did not repent and was very persuasive as a bitter, resentful and angry person. Martha Hunt has a few strong points, and she fits his strength, and Henry Travers is also very good at being a priest. This film is an effective story that will stay with you after its completion.
