New York has never looked so good! And no one has this movie. Although the script is a bit lightweight, you can't help but like this movie or any other character in it. You almost want such people to really exist. The appeal of the actors is something that really makes you think (John Ritter, Colleen Camp and the late Dorothy Stratten are especially good.) Hire or buy this film, you will be glad you did.
