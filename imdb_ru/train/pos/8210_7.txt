Clint Eastwood reiterates his role as Dirty Harry, who this time is engaged in a vigilance case (Sondra Locke), which kills people who raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago. Eastwood plays a role, and the film is basically more action than talk, not that I complain. Sudden exposure is really pleasant entertainment.
