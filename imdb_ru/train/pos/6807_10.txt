I have copies of both of these films, a classic where Robert Blake is a mighty wonderful actor, where most of the 1967 Blake film is more shown standing by the window in prison telling his childhood life where he is shot, because he killed the Clutter family, show in the classics a lot of what actually happened, and not to tell us which one of them really committed the murder, but it is really eye-catching, if you watch the 1996 film “In Cold Blood”, the classic makes much more sense.
