Clint Eastwood returns in the role of Dirty Harry Kalahan in the 4th film of the series Dirty Harry. Clint is older, but he still has, Harry told him to rest after some trouble that happened because of the robbery (where the catchy phrase “Make my day” came from!) The woman turned into an attack after being raped at the attraction and started getting punks one by one. The last movie Sandra Locke will see in Clint Eastwood's movie! Improvement after the Enforcer, which was a bit more comedic and less serious. Clint Eastwood's sunglasses were Gargoyles, which are best known for the sunglasses that Arnold Schwarzeneger wears in the Terminator. Worth a look if you like Clint Eastwood, Films about Dirty Harry or thrillers about action movies.
