Great concept, great cast, and what a pity there was no more time to flesh out the story. I loved it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis and Lane, now there are REAL women! Nevertheless, Dench and her character had enough substance to transfer the script to some of its less important points. I have it on the tape and will continue to watch it, hoping that at the end there is a clue that suggests continuation. <br /> <br /> Top drawer! - No questions! - No arguments! <br /> <br />
