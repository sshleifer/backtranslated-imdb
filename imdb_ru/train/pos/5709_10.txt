This foreign film, shot in 1931, should be watched and watched more often. <br /> <br /> We open a quiet little French village, looking over the roofs of sleeping citizens. Then we hear something like a party. After investigating this scandal, two neighboring men are told the story of two men, presumably friends who chose two numbers for the lottery. <br /> <br /> Our star in the picture has his number, and his friend has his number. When he asks his friend whether he will share half the test, if his ticket is winning, his friend will immediately say no. In fact, X.E. there are no double clubs! so he does about it. <br /> <br /> Therefore, when our man discovers that he has a winning ticket and that he was lost through no fault of his own, he is in despair. Everyone is looking for himself, looking for this ticket, something like the predecessor of the "Great Race". Despite the fact that all these memories, all the time I was confused and was so upset about every little thing in this film “all for me, show me the money in the bank.” Watch Le Million today!
