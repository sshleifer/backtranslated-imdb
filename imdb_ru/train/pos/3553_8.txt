“Guys and Dolls” is a movie that is hungry for a remake. This was done forty-eight years ago. His two main stars are either dead, or 409 pounds. Although the remake, with big stars now, will be a box office success, he will not be able to catch the magic that is included in this version. His boundless energy cannot be recovered, nor is the pure joy that you experience when you watch something like this: a huge widescreen, big entertainment film. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando (who last gained 409 pounds. the last time I heard) plays Sky Masterson, one of the biggest players in New York. Frank Sinatra - Nathan Detroit, whose stupid game, how often he can find, says that this shit is widely known throughout the city. However, when one place he left for himself costs $ 1,000, Detroit needs money quickly. He puts Masterson 1000 dollars on the fact that he can not take the missionary Sarah Brown (Gene Simmons) in Havana with him the next day. <br /> <br /> “Guys and Dolls” is nothing but unpleasant songs and dances, which are usually like this here, add some fun. Obviously, it was a Broadway musical: there were not too many sets, and the scenes were long. If I complained about one thing, how uneven songs were. From time to time there were two songs in the scene; In other cases, thirty minutes passed without one. Guys and dolls are never boring, just a great time. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> No rating.
