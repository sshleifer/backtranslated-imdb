“The offender is often the man who left something unfinished, not always the one who did something,” emperor Marcus Aurelius. <br /> <br /> The Watch on the Rhine DVD could not come at a better moment. This restores to us the main play of Lillian Hellman, actively adapted to the screen by Dashil Hammett (audio commentary by Hellman scholar Bernard F. Dick confirms his authorship). It presents a subtle production by Bette Davis, who occupied a subdued secondary role much later than she became the queen of the workhorse on the Warner Bros. Equally important, it reminds us that World War II had a goal. <br /> <br /> Of course, you say that we needed it. We heard Cary Grant preach in "Destination Tokyo" (1943) about Japanese boys and their bushido knives. We saw boots stomping with living hills in Sound of Music (1965). We toured England, heartlessly occupied by Germany, in "It Happened Here" (1966). However, in truth, we still need to spread the message. <br /> <br /> I have an 81-year-old friend who regularly scolds Franklin Roosevelt. He feels that the FDR has dragged the US into an alien struggle that we did not need, and thus caused his beloved cousin to die. He is encouraged by the fact that Patrick Buchanan demonizes the leaders of the allies and trivializes the second war. <br /> <br /> A political analyst recently released a thick book with detailed studies stating that Adolf Hitler would pose no further threat. to Poland, Europe or the whole world, if only the Third Reich were handed over to the free city of Danzig in 1939. Buchanan believes that if these selfish Poles had not stood up to the Nazis, pulling into the stupidly interfering Britain and dizzy altruistic France, the West would not have swallowed the war. He believes that without the severity of Total War, no one in Germany would have built gas chambers to provide a final solution to the Jewish problem. <br /> <br /> Some commentators on this site believe that “Dozor” is sinking under the weight of stale propaganda. May be. However, neither my friend nor Pat Buchanan seems to have understood the meaning of the film: some people hurt and kill in order to seize foreign lands, goods, and freedom; such people prevailed in the Axis powers and “sufficiently” did not appear in their vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Paul Lucas deserves an Oscar that he won. He and Bette Davis put persuasive passion into their portraits of refugees fighting oppressors. They deal an emotional blow to the intellectual cause, to move away from the curb, for actively resisting torture and murderers. Bernard Dick notes that Hellman did not care for Lukas as a person because he remained apolitical. Of course, being a Hungarian, he saw how the bloody "dictatorship of the proletariat" replaced the outdated empire first-hand, and then overthrew Admiral Horthy's right tyranny. <br /> <br /> A marvelous cameo has been added to Hammet’s play Henry Daniel sardonically depicts a Wehrmacht officer from the class who despises the brown shirts he serves. His Phili von Ramme will no doubt support Field Marshal Rommel in 1944 during a July 20 conspiracy against Hitler. However, in April 1940, he pragmatically incites the Nazi case, although he insults Herr Blecher of the "Butcher" and despises the Romanian aristocrat Tek de Brancovis for trying to give information about the underground leader. <br /> <br /> Tac, a beggar and perhaps a cuckold, wants money and visas to return to Europe, where he can renew the scraps of life destroyed by the great war destroying the empire and even greater economic depression around the world. He has no political convictions, no doubt to exchange a freedom fighter for his future. The graduate of the Mercury Theater, George Koulouris, gives the cynicism of the Old World of this burned-out event an extreme desperate threat. <br /> <br /> Lucille Watson gives an amazing vitality to the grasping mistress of a man, an imperious old maid who knows her mind and gets her by the way, but who does not adequately rate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls. She and her pale son in the office belong to the American version of the privileged family of von Ranme and de Brancovis. However, this family has not seen the ruins and will never see. These are people with money who can silently promote evil, just not resisting it. <br /> <br /> This mother and son can easily make a choice that will reflect that complaint about national socialism and fascism, which Buchanan’s scholar has flourished today in my friend. “The clock on the Rhine” has a well-kept historical appearance. His dialogue reflects an erudite origin on the scene, and does not sound fresh in the streets. Nevertheless, the film Hellman and Hammett has an instinctive force. The audience still has to hear and heed its call to arms against the grabbers without getting tired on the march.
