The reason I say this is because I wrote the script and knew very little about creating it, until I was asked to watch a movie. I wrote it for some manufacturers who sold it without telling me. Since Alan Dobie was my friend, I found out about it. I wrote only the first draft, so I, of course, was worried when I heard that he was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson through my agent if he could ask me to make another sketch. I also asked if I could see my original script, because I lost it. I was told too late. Therefore, I did the only thing I could do in the circumstances, and took off my name. I had no idea what they could do with my script. Then I was invited to watch the finished film. I was so impressed that I quickly asked for my name back. This is a beautifully made piece, from the first draft that was hurriedly written, I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; maybe if I had it it would not be so good. I would like to see my original script again, if anyone knows where it is? I would also like to see the film again, I only saw it once in a small theater in Soho.
