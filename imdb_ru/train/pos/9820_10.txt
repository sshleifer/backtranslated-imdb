It is very well made for a television movie. It depicts problems in the suburbs around the 1970s, as well as neighbors, who, of course, do not want to have. The worst and most distressing part of the film was when teenage punks killed a family dog. Teens do everything to annoy and bother this poor family. But boy!, In the end, the main character takes revenge on those punk teens. The father / landlord, of course, does not perceive the whole aggravation of punk adolescents easily and quickly retaliate after lack of assistance from the police. He confronts them and protects his home and his family. Very good actor ... I can add. <br /> <br /> I watched it on TV when I was 8 or 9. I never saw it again on TV and would like to. Definitely good! This is the film that can be captured on a weekday night very late in the evening, and he cannot stop watching or an afternoon movie on the weekend. This is the kind that they simply no longer show. <br /> <br /> This is definitely worth a look!
