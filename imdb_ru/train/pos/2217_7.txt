I am usually skeptical about watching movies or mini-series based on novels, because the script is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The script was very close to the novel (I think it helps that the author was an executive producer and writer, eh?) <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding. I cannot describe how I liked to see such a wide range of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Richard and Bianca Lawson). <br /> <br /> Venue ... I was expecting to see the houses and cottages that I imagined: what I saw on the screen was slightly different. However, this was not enough to make me dislike the mini-series. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to anyone who read the novel: you will not be disappointed if you have. 8 out of 10 stars! <br /> <br />
