Do you really like an ingenious comedy or do you like “wedding breakers”? If the answer to this question is, stop reading now. I can't believe that this film does not have a higher rating Basically, Meadows plays a character unlike Austin Powers. There are so many inventive moments in this gagoram. Out of rudeness - Leon is playing with himself on the porch, the former guy is cheating on food. , Well. Inspired by the crazy sex clown, Broadway routine, voice overs. The meadows are magnificent, like a childish, but very good-natured Leon. Some wonderful lines of “don't blame Van”, “Monstrous, sexual world” are too many. Why this movie was not huge is a mystery. Great comedy.
