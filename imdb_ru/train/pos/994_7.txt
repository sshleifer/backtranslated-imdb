I watched this movie once and could watch it again, but although Jamie Foxx is good at the movie, I feel that they could use a “less funny” character like Alvin Sanders. For example, the scenes of Fox in prison, when he is opposed by Edgar Clentin (David Morse), are too funny. David Morse is again a beautiful image of a policeman. His tough, but mostly quiet features are perfect for his role. Morse again meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) in the theater. Morse ends up falling for Hutchinson. They are both perfect for this script in every movie. I personally like this quality in the film, where the actors are in the same situation as the previous film, as these two in the Green Mile. In general, it was a pretty good movie.
