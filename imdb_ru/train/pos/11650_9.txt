The most anticipated film of 2002. After three and a half years of hibernation, Rajini played in this film. The buzz around this movie was too high. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical Rajini film, it also gives some spiritual messages in this film. But it also includes Rajiniâ€™s typical performances, style, songs, etc. This is a good entertaining film and gives good messages. <br /> <br /> I will rate this film as Good, not Great due to the script. This is supposed to watch a movie. Do not miss it!
