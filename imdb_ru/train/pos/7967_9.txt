This is definitely one of Disney's greatest films. It is very nice for everyone. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry and make you wait. <br /> <br /> In fact, Homeward Bound are three pets that are sent to live on a farm. while their owners go on vacation. They do not know what is happening, and desperately wanting to return home, they run away from the farm and try to find their way home through the desert. <br /> <br /> This is one of the latest films that Don Amech has played a major role. He provided the voice of the Shadow, an old, wise and friendly golden retriever. Also in this film starred Sally Field, which voiced the Himalayan cat Sassi. But seriously, what this film is about is a chance! Sounded by Michael J. Fox (my favorite actor), “Chance” is almost everything you expect from a dog that is sweet, playful, energetic and stupid, and every time I get upset when watching this movie, for a chance; This is how comedy never ends! <br /> <br /> This film is sometimes very sad. Sometimes it reminds people that they were alone or when they lost their pets. <br /> <br /> One scene that always baffles me is the stage in which the trio tries to escape from the pound; I am particularly shocked that Chance catches the collar in the fence and almost does not. There were other disturbing moments in the film, but none of them seemed more disturbing to me than this one. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great family movie. If you liked this movie, you will probably like the sequel. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!
