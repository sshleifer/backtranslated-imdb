It is great to see that Shane Meadows is already having an international impact - LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT shares many themes with ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS: Vague class identity above work, but far below average, upset father, abandoned urban environment, feeling of adult failure, barely hidden fascism lying at the heart of modern urban life. <br /> <br /> But if Meadows is an experienced formalist, Mariaj is selling images, and his cool, exquisitely surrealistic, monochrome framework serves to separate the dirty and rather gloomy object, which, like Meadows, is deflected. from high farce to tragedy in a matter of seconds. <br /> <br /> There are long-livers and clich√©s, but Polevorde is a completely insane, ordinary person with ordinary ambitions, whose attempts to bring them to life are dangerous; while the individual parts are popcorn / pijon blasts; the best sequence of marriage from the time of the dead and the dead - manages to snatch the epiphany of despair.
