I liked to watch Cliffhanger, at the beginning, when that woman (Sara) was full of horror, when she slid, I thought it was a terrible scene, because I thought that when you see it, your nerves in your body get to you because it makes you scared and your heart beats faster. I really enjoyed watching Cliffhanger, I think Silvestar Stallone is a great actor and I think he will be known as playing Rambo and Rocky.
