It has been so long since I watched this film (for at least 15 years), and yet it still haunts me with a vivid idea of ​​the terrible consequences that prisoners of war may face, despite the conditions of the Geneva Convention. <br /> A division of Australian underwater demolition experts captured in the archipelago near Japan after a successful mine installation mission in the Japanese harbor. <br /> <br /> In prison, these people expect the same treatment as any other prisoners of war. but, to their dismay, he soon learned from a friendly Japanese prison warden that they were being convicted of spies, since they were not in uniform during the capture. The consequences of such a violation by the Japanese military code are execution by beheading. <br /> <br /> Despite their requests and requests from sympathetic prison guards, the day of reckoning is approaching like a time bomb. The tension is so great that in fact you will hear a ticking, although it may just be your chest, pounding from the impact of the strike force. <br /> <br /> The end is actually too painful to reproduce in my head much less. write it here. But I can promise you - you will never forget this. Good luck finding videos in the USA.
