Despite the fact that the "Shining" more than a quarter of a century, I urge everyone not to be afraid of the descent of Jack Nicholson into insanity. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one was able to rip it off; instead, it has been referred to again and again in pop culture. Twins, blood lift, RedRum, crazy nonsense, "writing" ... you need to see it, if not in vain, to understand all the hints about it in everyday life. The film is both scary, intense, beautiful and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic secret of Hitchcock and the horror of the modern thriller. And there is something that is usually lacking in horror films: a great script.
