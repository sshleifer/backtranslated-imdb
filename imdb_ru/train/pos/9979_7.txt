To begin with, since this film is a remake of the classics, the rating should already be lowered. Since in this version of Viggo Mortensen plays a major role in Kowalski, it helps. <br /> <br /> Isn’t it like the government of the United States to terrorize one of its citizens. Sounds like Jason Priestley's character from the movie! But it is true that the government would do everything possible to ruin a person’s life for trying to get to his wife. A wife who gives birth to no less and cannot do it. <br /> <br /> “In this country there was a time when the police accompanied a man to his pregnant wife.” Jockey disc words. <br /> <br /> This film had some great landscapes, great car chases and a lot of spirituality. After much deliberation, I gave this film 7 points.
