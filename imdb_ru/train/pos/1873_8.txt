The brutal and rebellious twenty-five-year-old sailor Entuone Fisher (Derek Luke) is sent to three sessions for evaluation with a psychiatrist of the navy, Dr. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington) after another outbreak and aggression against a top-ranking military man. Reluctantly at the beginning of the treatment, he gains confidence in Dr. Davenport and talks about his childhood, revealing the painful injuries that have arisen in his adoptive family. Meanwhile, he meets Cheryl Smalley (Joy Bryant), and they fall in love with each other. Solving his personal problems, Antwone becomes a new person. This real family drama is a touching and positive story about a person who finds a friend and returns to ordinary life. Denzel Washington's direction is excellent, creating a sensitive, engaging and tasteful story about child abuse. In the hands of another director, this can be a very hard story. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Voltando a Viver” (“Return to Life”)
