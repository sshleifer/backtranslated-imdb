This is one of the best films of “New Wave” of Hong Kong, which began with “Comm Hark: Warriors of the Magic Mountain”. Cui set the tone for the New Wave approach to the martial arts film, which since then almost all the directors of New Wave (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siou Tung, etc.) were taken for granted; namely, the approach to such films will henceforth need not only irony, if not direct comedy. “Flaming paradise” put an end to all this and with a vengeance. <br /> <br /> The point is not that there is no humor; but this is purely human humor, like that of an elderly Buddhist priest in the beginning, who somehow controls the quick sensation of a young prostitute, hiding in a bundle of straw. But this is the same as people, even Buddhist priests cannot be holy all the time. <br /> <br /> When irony finally appears in the film, it becomes the most disgusting, emanating from the “abbot” Temple of the Red Lotus, which is a study of pure nihilism, one that has never been recorded on film before. He is the incarnation of Satan Milton from "Lost Paradise": "It is better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven!" <br /> <br /> It is this motif that underlines the brutal abuse of many images here. : The Abbot does not want to just kill people; he wants them to despair, to feel completely hopeless, to accept his nihilism as a comprehensive reality. Thus, in the scenes of the Red Temple there is a definite meaning that there can be no other reality outside the Temple itself - it has become everything that exists for the universe, and the Abbot, who claims to possess infinite power, is responsible for this. br /> <br /> Of course, fortunately, the film does not end there. Although there is a loss, the human will to be just a man finally prevails. (If you want to know how, watch the movie!) However, there is no doubt that when we watch this movie we visit hell. Hopefully we will not witness our own experiences; but we definitely feel punished by this experience - and somehow it’s better for him.
