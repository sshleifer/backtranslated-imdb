In the film "Kongwon-do ui him", he shows a relatively intimate view of the significance (as well as general meaninglessness) in the lives of various Koreans; empty people are looking for ways to fill themselves, enjoying the journey from nature. From the beginning to the end of the film, we observe the fallacy of various characters; we learn about their shortcomings and desires, about the total complexity imprinted in human life (and yet about the general simplicity of humanity). Although the film is slow, it can be very contemplative. He does not impose any ideas, but allows ideas to be realized, he allows concepts to express themselves. <br /> <br /> The film ends as suddenly as it begins, and the person truly understands the meaning. In solitude, this love is often an act of selfishness and many mistakes we make. This is a look at everyday life, very well and beautifully executed. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action or intense drama, this film is not for you. However, if you like honest, original and meaningful films that are optional and without brilliance, this is a great movie to watch.
