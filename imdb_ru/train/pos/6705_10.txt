And not because since she worked on Clarissa Explains It All, I fell a little in love with Melissa Joan Hart, who, when this show was popular, was well past twenty, but still managed teenage roles. "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" was Hart's next big leap after her Clarissa days. Based on the comic, Sabrina Spellman - you guessed it! - a teenage witch who is trying to balance her antics from witchcraft with the demands of everyday teenage life. She is assisted in her efforts by her two aunts and an intelligent black cat when she goes from high school to college and, finally, to her career in journalism. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hart shows the heart and soul. “Sabrina, teenage witch” is quite touching and very funny, and I wish it took me so long to understand how great it was. The only pity is that there were no new episodes that we all could enjoy. <br /> <br /> 10/10
