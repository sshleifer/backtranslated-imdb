I just finished watching this movie and I can honestly say that it is a work of art. I was very surprised to see a total rating of 5.2 points. <br /> <br /> Guy not only collected the cast from the list and turned them into such wonderful characters, he gave us a fantastic film. A diverse storyline with plenty of imagination left. <br /> <br /> Too many people want movies with a plot that can be understood and passed to them on the plate ... but these films become poor reviews because they are too predictable. <br /> <br /> This film is special. Get it now!
