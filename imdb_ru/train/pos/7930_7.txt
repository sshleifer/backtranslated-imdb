I'll be honest. I got this movie to make fun of him. I mean, come on, "The Hood of the Living Dead"? What is the reaction? The fact is that the film (and its creators) decided that they were not joking about it. Instead, he was going out of his way to be a good film. <br /> <br /> And you know what? It was very close. Slightly less cheese in unpredictable music, a bit more professionalism in photography, acting, unforeseen circumstances (for example, props - the Best Buy bag is really like) ... well, this is not a classic of the zombie movie genre, but it's still a pretty cute little movie by itself. And acting, writing, and walking are surprisingly better than I expected. There is even a bit of decent humor, since the two leading men argue about how to decide whether or not the dead zombie is dead. <br /> <br /> If you can lose sight of the low budget (which leaves its imprints in everything, alas) and almost constant profanity, it can be quite a fun time in the movies. No, that's not great. Yes, it could be better. But the creators, the actors, the film crew, they all tried to make a good film (instead of the classics of the camp), and that means a lot. A line of mile-long zombies in marching style, and thank you guys for not adding it. <br /> <br /> Prestige of the Kirozov brothers. I would like to see what they do next. And somebody, give them a budget!
