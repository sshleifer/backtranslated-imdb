At first glance, this film does not look particularly gorgeous. After all, Bette Davis films with 166 votes on IMDb and rated 6.5 should be pretty bad. But the film turned out to be a delightful and original surprise. <br /> <br /> At first you might expect that this is a regular ordinary film of the 30s with a formal love story, but the film is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story that also helps make this film very enjoyable view. <br /> <br /> The plot involves two main characters, played by Bett Davis and George Brent. They were helped by the cast of the most funny characters, but only two people participate in the film. Their character is involved in the most unusual and intelligent love story, which also works with humor. This makes this film a delightful little comedy to watch, which is very interesting. <br /> <br /> The film is quite short (just over an hour), which means that the story does not waste time on unnecessary plot lines, development, and characters. This makes the film also quite fast, which helps to make this film ideal for viewing by contemporary standards. Perhaps because of this, the film sometimes becomes a bit simple, but it never goes to the detriment of its entertainment or fun. <br /> <br /> A delightful, pleasant simple romantic comedy that you deserve to see more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
