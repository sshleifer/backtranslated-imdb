After watching the trailer, I was surprised that this movie never made it to the cinema, so I ordered BluRay. I had a great time watching it, and I must say that this film is better than some basic animated films. Of course, it has its drawbacks, but I can still really recommend it. The animation is well done, very interesting and unique, and the story made me watch it to the very end. Some of the backgrounds are just amazingly beautiful, and behind them you can see French talent. I thought that the game Forest Whitaker seems a bit lifeless, but this is how the character Lian-Chu is depicted in this film. In general, thank you, I really enjoyed it, and I hope that it will be successful enough for all the studios involved to continue making such great films. I would recommend to give him a chance and wonder how good a movie with such a small budget is. One Hector is worth it to watch a movie, as some of his moments are like a stitch.
