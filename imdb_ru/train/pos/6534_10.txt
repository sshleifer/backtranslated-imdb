I heard that this film was good from many of my friends who saw it, and they all said that it was amazing, so I had high hopes - and Nancy Drew surpassed all those expectations! He had funny roles, he entertained me with entertainment, all the guys tried to kill her, and Emma Roberts was as gorgeous as Nancy Drew. The rest of the cast was also very good. I definitely recommend this movie! <br /> <br /> Nancy: “I wonder why these guys tried to kill us?!” Corky: “Yes, I also find this interesting. In fact, it scares me! ”<br /> <br /> Nancy:“ I hate it when they try to kill me. It's so rude! ”<br /> ~ Nancy Drew
