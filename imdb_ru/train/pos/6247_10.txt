The trailers of this film may show scenes of violence or non-core sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments chosen to attract the audience. They, of course, show the main message of the film: <br /> <br /> People who are constantly beaten on the head in their work and life, using the power that they can have somewhere else, to obviously oppress others. And at the lower end of the chain of oppression, mostly women. <br /> <br /> A movie that demonstrates it as cruel as Hundstage is certainly difficult, but it is even harder to endure such lives. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is in many ways similar to Abbreviations, but consists of episodic episodes in which people like your neighbor play the way they are. Without shine and, what is most alarming, without hope. His documentary style makes the film even more disturbing, because, as you understand, there are many such people and many of them, although our society pays special attention to appearance. Somewhere in the porn industry should do their business, where unregistered domestic violence should take place, where hope must collapse. I am sure I know such people. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie without any funny scenes (some might think that a disabled woman, repeating the top ten supermarkets, is funny, but it really happens) and without any melodramatic, go watch this movie. However, I am afraid that you will lose if you focus on the subtitles, because the subtitles cannot bear the accentuation.
