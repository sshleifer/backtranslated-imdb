It has always been one of my favorite movies, and always will be. Over the past few years, I became a science fiction writer in the 50s / 60s, trying to collect all the best that was done then. I love a lot of things about them, how trivial they can be, how technically correct some of them were. Gorgeous colors and scenery also turn me on. It’s a pity when they redo some of these good old movies; they almost always fill it up - just look at the recent reissue of the Day when the Earth stopped, this is complete rubbish !! The Forbidden Planet is one of the reference space films of all time, and now they are also trying to re-create it, and I’m afraid to think what a new one will be! In my opinion, some things, such as fantastic classic films, should be left alone to be what they are, classic examples of great attempts to tell simple stories and give people the thrill of the process. As soon as they add all the techno-crap we have now, the film seems to be more dog meat from a Hollywood sausage factory - nothing special at all. By the way, I notice that the cosmonauts uniform on the Forbidden Planet was also used for the “Queen of outer space”! It just says that the budgets were a bit lower then, right? Hey, less money and better movies, hmmm .... <br /> <br /> In this film, the great performances of Leslie Nielsen, in a serious role, and Anne Francis, Walter Pijon (which has always been one of my favorite actors) Count Holyman and, of course, Robbie Robot! <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic, and the storyline is not too contrived. This is a great sci-fi experience!
