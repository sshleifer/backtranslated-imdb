Legend of Dragoon is one of those little-known games that people either love or hate. Some people claim that it is too similar to other games, namely the Final Fantasy series, which is understandable, since it was originally assumed that it is equivalent to Sony's Final Fantasy. Honestly, I can not comment on the similarities behind this, since I am not very familiar with FF games. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite aspect of the game is the battle system. Not only do you have the ability to turn into a more powerful form of dragoon, but every time you attack, you must pay attention to complete the attack by pressing the buttons at the right time. Not only will enemies sometimes attack you right in the middle of a sequence, which means you have to press various buttons to avoid taking damage. Even the use of certain objects of attack requires a small button. If you do not want to attack, you can always guard, which not only reduces any damage you take by half, but also increases your hit points without using healing potions. <br /> <br /> FMV is pretty well done at about the same quality as Final Fantasy 8. However, the graphics during the game do not quite match this standard. They are good, but they could be - and, frankly, should have been - better. The translation also leaves much to be desired. This not only raises interesting questions about the relationship with the characters, but there are also some grammatical errors that simply could not be allowed. <br /> <br /> Another thing that seemed interesting to me is that you lose the main characters of the party - one dies and the other basically becomes useless for the party and leaves. Although it is often said that the death of one character does not make sense, it makes you early to realize that characters, while heroes, are still as mortal as the next person. People who replace lost characters just get all their statistics, so the transitional game in the game plan is pretty smooth. Perhaps my only hero complaint is the love of the main character, Shana. She is the epitome of a helpless woman in need of salvation, pathetic to make the player scream from frustration. Although you can use her in your group, she is insanely weak — I don’t even know what her dragoon abilities are like because I didn’t love her so much that I never used her. The Rose character, on the contrary, is probably my favorite female character in any game. She is not a wimp, and part of her dragoon magic is extremely helpful. The measure is also quite strong, although sometimes it annoys a talkative child. <br /> <br /> Character designers, like many others, were inclined to give women's characters attractiveness or something like that, and they never thought. to the actual utility of outfits. Seriously, no armor and the insecurity of most of your skin helps fight monsters. But I will give them props, since they have women acting as knights in different countries. <br /> <br /> I cannot comment on the plot much, since, to be honest, I did not pay much attention to it. where I needed to go further. I'm not sure what this says about the plot itself or my playing style. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very enjoyable game. He has his drawbacks, but for me it’s just the right balance of having to think and just push buttons and kill monsters.
