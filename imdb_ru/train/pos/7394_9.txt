This Chinese film made me feel so much in common with representatives of the culture to which I do not belong and from which I am far away. In an almost Buddhist approach, the film helps to understand each character and the happiness of doing simple routine things. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great, and Xu Hzu exudes kindness and wisdom, but is also vulnerable and vile. Er Min, a backward brother, shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal, and that wisdom comes to all kinds of people in and from this universe. Another China is far from Chinese realism, but it has a lot of humanity and realism of another kind. <br /> <br /> Get it. You will not be disappointed.
