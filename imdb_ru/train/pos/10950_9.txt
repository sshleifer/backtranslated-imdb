When I first saw this show, I thought it looked interesting. I watched it, saw how it revolved around Sarah, how the character sees the world ... revolves around her. I got it, but didn't really laugh. <br /> <br /> On stage and on her show she is racist, rude, insensitive and extremely selfish. I did not receive it at first, and took it all at face value. Then I watched her movie “Jesus is Magic.” I think this was an example for me for Sarah Silverman, explaining to me what language she speaks. She, like Marilyn Manson, works so hard to give us a lot of terrible ideas and images, but in the end you realize that this is not an attack, this is a statement. And as soon as you understand this, you will find that you are glad that someone has finally given it to you directly. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to say that only smart people will understand, or that hating this show is to prove your idiocy. Although I like many smart shows, I still don’t see the humor of “Curbing Your Enthusiasm” . I have the impression that this is good, but I just do not understand. Many people will never get the program Sarah Silverman, but I'm glad that I finally came. <br /> <br /> The creators of this show work diligently, each episode is loaded not only with dialogue and plot, but also songs or sequences of dreams, production numbers. These people do not collect something to fill the time interval, and, please, advertisers, they seem to aim at making the best show they can collect. If I could predict the future of this show, I would say that it will follow the path of Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks. It will be canceled ahead of time and will live in the hearts of the fans and on DVD. But take heart, the creators of SSP, your audience is there, and we will watch how they let you do the show.
