Has anyone been able to buy this movie? My uncle "Hutch" was a real pilot (not a coil), who, apparently, flings his wings into the air, and then snatches them with his fist when he is awarded the wings of his pilot. <br /> <br /> Heâ€™s only on the screen for a few seconds, but my family would like to watch a movie. He was killed in aerial combat for Italy, he was only 24 years old then. Do we know the movie studio that made it? <br /> <br /> Or has anyone seen this in a video store, for example, Blockbuster? I would like them to make entire catalogs of these old films available, because nowadays making DVDs is very cheap. <br /> <br /> Please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy. Thank.
