I first saw this film in the theater when I was 8 years old, and it still does not suit me. The dolls are so cool, and they are refreshingly naive to show business. My favorite scene is when the rats begin to whisper on behalf of Kermit in a posh restaurant. This is one smart and funny movie for kids and parents. Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang.
