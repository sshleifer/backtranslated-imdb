I recently caught up with this little gem of a movie on cable. It took me by surprise, even though I expected this from the team involved in this film. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromwell made this film with confidence, and he shows. Everyone always wonders about the secret life of killer killers. One does not have to go too far to understand that they are probably their own neighbors, social acquaintances, or even friends; they are no different from us, at least on the surface. <br /> <br /> In this story, grandfather is a disgusting character who, without hesitation, selects someone for a reasonable price. He is not shy about teaching his son and even his grandson the ropes! <br /> <br /> Alex is a man in confusion. He knows what he has done in the past, and suddenly begins to realize the consequences of his actions. He must see someone to help him find peace with himself. Going to Dr. Parkes, he tries to find absolution, although he does not find him there. On the contrary, there is an amazing turnaround when Alex finds out who should kill the next one. <br /> <br /> Alex, brilliantly portrayed by William Macy, fascinates us. He is not only a fantastic actor, but also makes us believe that he is the right person. One of the best things in the film is the late John Ritter. He is just as convincing as Dr. Parks, the man who solves the mystery. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, as a grandfather, is perfect. He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell is surprised at Sarahâ€™s key role. It shows incredible features and range. Tracy Ullman - Martha, a suffering wife, and she can do little. Also Barbara Bane, in a rare appearance, is the grandmother of hell. David Dorfman, this is a delight in the film. He shows maturity beyond his age. <br /> <br />
