Halfway through Lajos Koltai’s “Evening”, a woman on her deathbed asks a figure appearing in her hallucination: “Can you tell me where my life went?” The line can be embarrassing theatrical, but the woman saying this is Vanessa Redgrave, leaving it to with utmost simplicity, and the question breaks your heart. <br /> <br /> Again and again, based on Susan Minot's romantic skirts of sentimentality and routine, he attracts attention, offers wonderful ideas and arouses emotional involvement, as do a few recent films. Only six months have passed in a year, and now two memorable, significant and worthy films have appeared in cinemas, the other, of course, was Sarah Polley’s Far Away Movie. Hollywood could turn “Evening” into an elegant car of celebrities with two pairs of real mothers and daughters - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, as well as Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer. Richardson is the daughter of Redgrave in the film (with the sister played by Tony Collette), and Hammer plays the younger role of the Stripe, while the young incarnation of Redgrave is Claire Danes. <br /> <br /> Add Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson and a big cast - yes, it could turn into a multi-star platform. Instead, Koltai - the brilliant Hungarian cinematographer "Mephisto" and the director of "Without Destiny" - created a sophisticated ensemble work with "Continental Sense", a story taking place in Newport high society, in the days preceding the wedding, which is fraught with trouble. <br /> <br /> Missing connections, wrong choices and strict adherence to social and family problems are quite a soap opera, but the quality of writing, directing by Koltay and selfless actor’s work rises “Evening” way above this level, to the refined English air, French (and several American) family sagas a century before its modern settlement. <br /> <br /> The complex relationship between mothers and daughters, between friends and lovers, with the addition of a complex triangle, all face clear, understandable, captivating. Separate melodies are woven into a symphony. <br /> <br /> And yet, despite all the aforementioned emphasis on the ensemble and selfless performances, the stars of the Evening still shine through Redgrave, Richardson, Hammer (an exciting new discovery, vaguely similar to her mother, but a completely different actress ), the Danes carry most of the load - until the Strip appears in the last minutes and, of course, steals the show. Dancy and Wilson are also worth the cost of admission. <br /> <br /> As in the case of “Away from her”, “Evening” stays with you for a long time, offering to rethink your story and characters, and again experiencing emotions, it causes. At two o'clock the film lasts a little longer, but how it will stay with you after that is welcomed among many films that have cooled down long before your popcorn.
