I recently saw this film due to the recent success of Jake in Brokeback Mountain. I thought I'd watch the films I missed. I did not expect to enter the film, so I was amazed that I missed this film altogether. This is an exciting story about father and son, as well as a story about losers. I even cried in the finale of this wonderful story. This film appeals to all ages. The only reason I give him 9 out of 10 is that in the middle he slows down a bit, but in the end he becomes strong again. The acting was great, the story was great, and the cinematography was exciting, given the setting of the movie. GO TO SEE THIS MOVIE! Rent, buy, look, LOVE! I know what I did!
