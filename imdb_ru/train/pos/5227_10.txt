The film "People in White" is definitely one of the funniest, if not the funniest comedy films I've ever watched! (and I watched a lot!) We are talking about two scavengers who become “people in white” and then stop the invasion from space. This is also a parody of many classic films, such as People in Black, Star Wars, or Doctor Strangelove. Anyone who says this movie is crappy has something wrong with his head. There are lots of funny jokes and jokes, and you can get a mouth injury from laughter (it happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on TV, take a look now - you certainly will not regret it!
