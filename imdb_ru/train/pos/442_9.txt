This is what I call a growth movie. Each character is different and better at the end - all because one woman knows that the place they chose is the “bath of love.” Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedienne, really shines like a woman who makes all these changes. Even men in this film are transformed from selfish people into better people. The book has remained very faithful to the novel, which is a plus in my book, since I am a librarian. The scenery is breathtaking and genuine love message.
