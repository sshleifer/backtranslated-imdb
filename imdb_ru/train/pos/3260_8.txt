People call it a comedy, but when I just watched it, I laughed only once. I think the problem is that I first saw him when I was 14 years old, <br /> <br /> and I was not old enough to understand that he should not be taken seriously / <br /> <br / > There were quite a few scenes that were supposed to be funny, but I was too concerned about the characters to laugh at them. <br /> <br /> I invite you to watch this movie the next time you fall in love, <br /> <br /> and try to take it seriously. I think you will understand that, despite some stupid mistakes, this is one of the most touching love stories you have ever seen.
