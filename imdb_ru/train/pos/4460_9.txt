Ah, the musical in the costume of the sailor Kelly / Sinatra. So familiar, right? Yes, but this is not the one you usually hear about. On the town it is. But if you stay, you can learn something. Okay, probably not. In any case, the anchors Aweigh tells the story of two sailors on a three- or four-day vacation. Joe is the "Sea Wolf", and Clarence, the book type, asks Joe to get a "lady." Now, after the coppersmiths take them, they bring the little Donald home. There they meet Suzy, this seductress, this Jezebel. Just kidding! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thinks so. He's right? Or is he a moron? Or is he just misinformed by society? Find out all this and more when you watch {trumpet fanfare} ANCHOR AHEAD! <br /> <br /> P.S. If you want Katherine Grayson to be something not nauseatingly sweet, try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
