This film is a riot. I can't remember the last time I had a good time at the cinema. I saw some good comedies in my time, and usually they are pretty funny. But this wall to wall great lines. I think Best in Show is the last movie I laughed at and laughed at so much. The film was nonstop until the end when they spent 5 minutes of sentimental conspiracy. In addition, it is a constant stream of liners and stupid situations. I would like to see it again before he leaves the theater, because it looks like Zucker's films, where you don't get all the jokes for the first time. You have to see it two or three times to get it all. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, it could use better editing, sometimes it is intermittent, but we have to forgive for that. All characters are great. This is not like Adam Sandler's film, where he tries to be funny, and everyone else suffers around him and is a joke. I think that I will remember all the main characters for many years, because they are all so cute. There are no victims in this movie. In addition, thank God, they got a 45-year-old actress to play his girlfriend. Katherine Keener plays her, and she is the beloved in this film. You just want women like her to really exist. She is not on the "10", like some other leading ladies, but for some reason her smile is warmer than the excessive bite of Julia Roberts. <br /> <br /> If you see a trailer for this film, you can not think about it too high. I assure you, the trailer doesn't do it right. They do not give out all the good jokes. Only some of the mediocre. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing. I hope the critics put it on their top ten list. Many of them complain that comedies do not receive the recognition they deserve, and then at the end of the year they do not put it on their list. It means you, Ebert !!!
