Murder in Mesopotamia, I have always considered one of the best books about Poirot, because it is very creepy and has a brilliant ending. There is no doubt that the television adaptation is astounding, with a beautiful photo and very interesting musical accompaniment. As always, David Suchet is flawless, like Hercules Poirot, the comedic highlight of the episode is the battle of Poirot with a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is good as a rather naive captain Hastings. The rest of the cast turns into decent performances, but tries not to overshadow two leads, which is dangerous in some Christie adaptations. Some episodes were pretty creepy, juxtaposing an episode as tragic as Five Little Pigs, an episode I liked a lot more than this one. In particular, what made this creepy, laying music aside, was that Louise Leidner saw a ghostly face through a window. As for adaptation, it was fairly faithful to the book, but I would say that I liked three things. The main problem was stimulation, it is rather slow, and there are some scenes where very little happens. I also disliked the fact that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer. In the book, I see him as a rather nervous character, but the intervention of the idea of ​​making him a killer and the underdevelopment of it made him a less attractive character, although I am glad that they did not miss his addiction, (I also noticed that the authors did not take into account the fact that Mrs. Mercado the book falls into hysteria when she believes that she is the next victim of the killer.) Another thing that was not so impressive was that I felt that it could be more effective if the adaptation was from the point of view of Amy Literan like this it was in the book, for some reason, Amy seemed less sensitive in adaptation. In general, despite some underestimations by the authors, I liked the murder in Mesopotamia. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
