I love this show, as it is filled with adventure, love and intrigue. Well, a few times, love! Itâ€™s good to see a show where all the characters work well together and treat each other with respect. It is also very good to see Dick Van Dyke in a television role, as I only saw him in Mary Poppins. The mixture of the main characters, Mark, Amanda, Jessie and Steve, is very exciting to the public. This is a show you should watch!
