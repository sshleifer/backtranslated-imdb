I grew up in Brazil and I went there and admired the beautiful coast where the movie was made. This area is called “Paraty” and is part of the “Green Coast” of the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is about 150 miles from the city of Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> This film brings back to life the world of Brazil in the 16th century, where Europeans only began to explore the coastline, which was still in its original form and sparsely populated by various local tribes. The French and the Portuguese struggled with each other for territory and for power in the timber trade in Brazil, while at the same time negotiating with the locals, who also fought with each other for any reason. <br /> <br /> One failure of the French (mercenary) leaves his compatriots to die, but he manages to escape and remains in captivity of a naked local tribe. Although he is the “slave” of the leader, according to the customs of the tribe, he is allowed to live in relative comfort for several months until the right time comes to be killed and eaten in a ritual of revenge. <Br /> <br /> What I like about this film is that it recreates Aboriginal villages and their way of life (they went naked and were cannibals) and asks us to know and accept the life of those times as it was: in a magnificent garden of paradise life was dirty, cruel, full of wretched superstitions and strange customs. Europeans come and bring their own problems, including more violence with better weapons and greed. There are no romanticized "noble savages "Or" heroic explorers "are just people trying to survive in a difficult world. <br /> <br /> The film does not cause undue sympathy and disregard for the natives. From what I know on this issue, the description is quite accurate, which adds to the project uniqueness: how many films have you seen about the life of Brazilian Aborigines and their early relations with Europeans?
