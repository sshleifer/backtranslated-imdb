Well, no, I lie, this is actually not the best movie of all time, but it is a really nice movie that none of my friends have seen. <br /> <br /> This is a movie with a fellow cop starring Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) with a story about a missing car engine prototype or something similar, but that doesn't matter. The reason why this movie is funny is that both heroes do not love each other, who initially don’t like and trust each other, but become shocking friends in a shocking twist of fate. All the difference in culture is made quite well, because it is interesting to look at it, it is completely ridiculous, but at the same time fun and pleasant. The soundtrack is cool, once again in the spirit of the 80s, it fits the film, I tried to find one of the songs for ages, but, working on my memory, I think some of the words I can't find. <br /> <br /> Another thing in this movie is the most fantastic payback for any movie, but I won’t give it up, oh no! In conclusion, I would take this film for 48 hours / most of the output of Eddie Murphy, including a Beverly Hills police officer, and all that friend Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence have in their names. If you're looking for a film about a buddy cop and you're tired of the "straight white cop meets an evil black street cop," do it. You may be pleasantly surprised, because it turns the whole formula upside down: "A straight Japanese policeman meets an unceremonious white policeman." <br /> <br /> I give it 7. To be honest, I like it more than this. I would rather watch this than a lot of things that I would give 8. But I think that I know in my heart that this is a kind of madness that makes me look like this movie.
