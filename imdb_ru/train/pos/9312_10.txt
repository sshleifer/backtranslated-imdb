I love to watch this movie because of all the scary scenes about predators. I love predators because they are scary. My favorite roles are those where the predator looks behind the pillar, because he reminds me of a scene from the Friday 13th movie with a girl who eats a banana. <br /> <br /> I really like to watch a lot of this movie, because computer graphics seems a bit fake, but it's okay, because when you get into a movie, you don’t even notice what is happening, and I think He has a good ending, although I didn’t really understand what was happening on my first couple of views, I figured out with time, and this is an important part. Another important part is how scary dinosaurs can be if you watch them for the first time. <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE BEST FILM.
