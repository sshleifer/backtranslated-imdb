This is not a bad movie. This is not wildly funny, but interesting and exciting. He has some fun moments. Cher gives a good role <br /> <br /> in a role completely opposite to her real life. Just her <br /> <br /> game is worth it. If this film had been released today <br /> <br />, it would not have been nominated, but by the standards of the 80s it was great. <br /> <br />
