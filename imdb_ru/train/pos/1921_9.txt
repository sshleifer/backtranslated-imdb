ABC did more for this show by allowing TV veterans James Garner and David Spade to join the filming of this show. At first the show was watchable and even predictable with John Ritter and Katie Sagal. The loss of John shook the world. Katie and three children are really solid professional actors. Hour lesson after the death of John in real life struck me. I lost my father at the age of 17 and could sympathize with and understand their pain and agony. ABC should be proud to support this show and even keep it as Johnâ€™s last wish. This show has matured and developed due to such impossible circumstances. They should be rewarded with an Emmy.
