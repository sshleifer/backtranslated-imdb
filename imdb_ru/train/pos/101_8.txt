IMDb somehow lists it as 1972, but other sources I have seen, including excellent program notes, mark it as '68. In fact, it does not matter, except for the fact that it is quite interesting to see this abstract collage of film and video (one of the first works of art that appeared to connect both) in the context of the 2001 Stargate sequence, released in the same year Pure abstraction is not really my thing, but I can take it in small doses, and the oversaturated optically printed colors and psychedelic sensations of this series of colors, Rorschach stains, birds, etc. are pretty convincing and quite beautiful. Of course, it helped pave the way for many other budding video artists in the 70s, and deserves to become more famous.
