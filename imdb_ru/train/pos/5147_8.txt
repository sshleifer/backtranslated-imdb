The first week of May every year brings back memories of the Holocaust through movies on TV. Among the many films that they showed, it was one that I had not seen. <br /> <br /> The story of Hilter’s life and how he came to power. He begins with his childhood and ends with the fact that he holds the highest position in Germany. <br /> <br /> Previously, the film was presented in the form of a series, and then converted into a movie format. Scottish actor Robert Carlisle plays Adolf Hitler with great courage, conviction and quick temper to give a real idea of ​​this man. <br /> <br /> This is a good script and story that teaches viewers to the main events led by Hitler. to power, and also trying to show the possible psychological appearance of Hitler. The film is a biased viewpoint of director Christian Duguy ?? Who shows Hitler as a man with one trace, a threatening, angry and screaming person? who so firmly held the Germans and the people around him. Hitler is not shown as a person with charisma and attractiveness, and in this film can not convince Hitler in the image. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the company was intended for television, all components of production are first-class and on par with any. mainstream movie. Production value, scenery, costumes, etc. were impeccable. <br /> <br /> This film is seriously criticized for the authenticity of the presented historical events. But still the film is exciting, everyone is interesting and interesting. Robert Carlyle wins and dominates the screen like no other. Is he amazingly good ?? brilliant! I would like a more balanced view of Hitler's life, because I think that Hitler was able to reveal the dormant feelings of millions of Germans, and not only should he be accused of holocaust. As I have said several times, what ?? very sad - our society loves the garland or prosecute one person, as a representative of the society of good or evil, respectively.
