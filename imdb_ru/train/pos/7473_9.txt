Oddly enough, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more detailed. Thanks to the retrospective, Crow's script is much tougher and more specific than the original Amenabar. The Spanish director must first do justice to think about this story, but there is no doubt that Crowe has improved it — at least a little. Please note that you have no idea what the leadership in OPEN EYES did, but you know almost all about leadership in VANILLA SKY. This is what I mean by more “concretized.”
