It was an amazingly funny comedy with a great cast. John Ritter and Katie Sagal played a great role as parents, and the children were great too. Kaley Cuoco was a good choice to play Bridget, something like a relaxed version of Kelly Bundy from Married with Children. Writing and speeches were first-class. Unfortunately, John Ritter died during the series, and this affected the situation. They had to scramble to change the show and attract more actors, and this was clearly an uncomfortable situation, but they coped with it well. James Garner was a good addition. This could have lasted longer if Ritter lived. <br /> <br /> I especially liked it when they brought Ed O'Neill to the guest house. That was great. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
