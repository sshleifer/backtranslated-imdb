10 out of 10, this magnificent, super documentary film that you definitely need to see, with clips from the war that people have not seen for years until it was shown in 1974. Do not miss the clips in this documentary from the war. anything, some of the clips left me in a dead end. The entire series has more than 20 episodes, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is the narrator and tells the amazing story of the war. It’s just still probably the best documentary about the war, and now that he’s over 25 years old, he is able to deliver a huge blow. You should watch this at some time, even if it is several episodes, even though you will still be amazed at the impact of this documentary on those who were there and died in the name of WAR IN PEACE IN WAR ..
