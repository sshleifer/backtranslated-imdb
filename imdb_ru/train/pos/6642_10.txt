All films made before 1912 really need to be watched with a sense of time and place. <br /> <br /> In 1894, men from the Lumiere family [father: Antoine (1840–1911), sons: Auguste and Louis] owned and operated a photoplate and paper factory. Not a small business; The factory employed more than 200 people who received pensions and social security benefits - innovative for that time. It was located in Montplaisir in a suburb of Lyon, France. Louis Lumer's interest in creating a Cinematagraph in 1894 remains open to speculation. My guess is that the appearance of the Kinetoscope (peep show) of the Edison organization in Paris in the autumn of 1894 served as a catalyst. <br /> <br /> W.K.L. Edison from Dixon invented a movie camera the size of a vertical piano, which was patented in February 1893. It worked with an electric drive (using energy from heavy batteries. This massive machine pumped celluloid film (the newly developed Eastman drove past the lens at a speed of about 40 frames per second (fps). As an “almost stationary object” it was placed in “Black Maria” (in fact, in the first film studio). Kinetescope machines demonstrated phased presentations (less than one minute), which were shot in this studio. <br /> <br /> In 1894, Louis Lumiere decided to invent a camera with moving image He decided that even at 16 frames per second celluloid film, the constancy of the human eye / brain would allow a normal movement to be perceived. His camera, called the Cinematograph, was the size of a large shoe box and was provided with a removable film shop To take the last time for about one minute, when he drove past the lens at a speed of 16 frames per second. <br /> <br /> The size and light weight of the camera (it can be converted to a printer or projector by adding a light source) made it so portable that you could take it with you to any place to record an event (provided that there was enough sunshine). In the spring of 1895, Louis filmed: the tricks of some cavalrymen; the house is on fire when firefighters arrive and flood the seized building with water; and a number of other scenes in and around Lyon. Using the light bulb of Molteni, he turned the camera into a projector and presented his films to scientists who had gathered in the reception room of the “Revue Generals of Science”. Images were projected onto the screen five meters from the lens. The screen was stretched in the doorway between the two rooms. At a meeting of professional photographers in the same year, Louis photographed the arriving delegates, and on the same evening they were shown movies of their arrival. <br /> <br /> With the praise of scientists and photographers, Louis decided to publicly exhibit his invention by the end of the year. Since each of his films will last about one minute, he will need at least a dozen films to make a good presentation. For one of these films, he set up his camera at the entrance to his factory, photographing the exit of workers at the time of his dismissal. <br /> <br /> The public place chosen by Antoine, who offered himself as a “fairground trough" For Cinema ", was the Indian Salon Grand Cafe on Capuchin Boulevard in Paris. It was a winter Saturday evening December 28, 1895. When the first audience gathered, they were presented with a projection view of the exterior of the Lumiere factory (with the gate closed). ed mock movie. This movie has a beginning, middle and end. The doors open at the beginning and people start to leave their workplace; people run out in the middle - many try to ignore the camera and cameraman, as they seem to be happy to leave their working day At the end of the factory gates are closed. <br /> <br /> And this was the first film designed to entertain the general public.
