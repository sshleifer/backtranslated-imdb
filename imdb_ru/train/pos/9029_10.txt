I saw this movie a few days ago. This film is so good that I get the feeling that if you want something really bad that you have always dreamed of, you can get it. It shows how big desires, happiness and sadness, hopelessness and failure come true. But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something that you love, you can change things and be happy.
