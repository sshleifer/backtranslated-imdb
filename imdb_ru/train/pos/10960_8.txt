I really can't remember who recommended it, but they said it was one of their favorite films. This, of course, is strange - for example, a rubber slip in a traffic accident. <br /> <br /> Someone said that the truth is stranger than fiction, and the truth is there is something to see. I really can't understand how a made-up version of this documentary will be released this year. How can you improve it? Aunt and cousin Jackie Kennedy are removed from New York society and hiding in Hampton. In the process, they become hermits and what is best described as "crazy cat ladies." They would have remained hidden if the city had not condemned the property for dirt and the subsequent salvation of Jackie. This film was made after this rescue. All this time, you could not help but think: “How bad was it before?” This is a view of high society from a darker side, and this is very exciting.
