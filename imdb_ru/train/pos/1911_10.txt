I like the new episodes from CJ and Grandad - I also liked the storyline with Kate in the lead role. I want to find out what happens to Rory, Kerry, Bridget and their family. I think CJ is very funny, and I like his scenes with my grandfather. I have always loved James Garner in everything he does, and his credit is that I never think of him as James Garner or Rockford in this series and fully believe in him as in Kate's father. This family is so real and funny. It was terribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessy died, but, as in real life, such things happen, and how it was recorded in the series and viewed was both funny and sad, and it was always extremely sensitive love to deal with. But overall this is a very fun show with lots of laughter and fun.
