After I saw the terrible, terrible, terrible BATMAN: DEAD END, I realized that I should see it as soon as I heard about it. <br /> <br /> Pressing the play button to watch the trailer, I thought that another awful short was waiting for me. from what still looked like another bad director trying to bring new depth to an existing character. But instead, he was greeted with an EXCELLENTLY assembled trailer for the film, which, unfortunately, does not exist, since I would love to see the finished film, even if it lasted only 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> WORLD'S FINEST make up for BATMAN: DEAD END, and then some more. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the next short number!
