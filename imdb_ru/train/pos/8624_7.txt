What is the best way to start a movie review like Der Todesking? Let me start by saying that I just came right after watching this movie, and the images still crashed deep into my brain - and I don’t think they will move anytime soon. <br /> <br /> It will probably be fair to say that if you are on this page, you have a good idea what kind of movie it is, even if you haven’t seen it yet. If not, let me warn you that this is not a pearl with a moderate budget that has been lost for several years in the style of “Around Darkness”, nor is it a low-budget, crazy, jolly B-film. What is such a low-budget art, put forward in a simple, but at the same time sharp way. The idea is simple - seven stories that revolve around suicide and end on them with frames of a decaying corpse. It sounds just like that, even boring? This is not true. Words cannot really describe how powerful this film becomes by the time you are halfway through; it actually draws you in, whether you want to go or not. <br /> <br /> I could go here for a walk about technical pros and cons; It may be noted that the scenes are obviously filmed on Super-8 cameras and sometimes shaky. I could point out that some sound effects are not synchronized to compete with any Fulci film, but in the end it all seems insignificant. <br /> <br /> So far As for extreme movies, I saw the hardest ones, and yet Der Todesking moved me the way few people managed, despite the fact that I wasn’t particularly horrible and had very few scenes which I would consider “useless”. In fact, the most disturbing scene I found was the last story. I will not spoil it, just say that the emotional agony of the character almost drips from the screen and makes you sympathize, if not crave for its end. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not the best film ever made, and in many places it seems coarse and perhaps a little amateur, but, despite these shortcomings, Der Todesking is an experience that I would recommend to anyone who loves a complicated movie. If you like comfortable viewing or “good” movies or just want to get something brutal and pointless, this is not what you are looking for. <br /> <br /> Whether you like it or not, you won’t forget it in a hurry.
