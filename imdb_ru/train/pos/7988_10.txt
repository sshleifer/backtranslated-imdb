Me and my friends are teased all the time for my tears because of the films, and they were not disappointed when I watched this movie. I cried many times, but believe me, it was not excessive happiness. I was rooting for the family, and I was rooting for this man because he was trying to redeem himself in the only way he knew how. Denzel, as always, was great, like Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, I did not even know, though; the years were not kind to him. My husband is not one of those who review movies, unless they are historically accurate war films (snoring !!!!). He had already watched this film 5 times, and I would need a DVD to watch it, because it was worn out of tape, and she jumped all the time while I was watching.
