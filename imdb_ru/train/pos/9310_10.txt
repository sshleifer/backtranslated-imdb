wow, how can i even discuss this movie without tears in my eyes? It was certainly the highlight of my year — no — my life. As if the raptor's graphics were not amazing enough, the award-winning editors continued to use the same frame throughout the entire film, even when the background didn’t really fit the scene setting. Wow, what a genius. And although the film is full of holes in the plot (for example, a few clips of animal type t-Rex, where there should be a predator, and one key moment when Pappi finds the torture chamber, shouts “Colin's girl!” And I will never run out Raptor Planet. Thanks to Sci-Fi for another classic.
