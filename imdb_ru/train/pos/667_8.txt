Although I have long been a fan of Peter Weyr, I did not watch any of his Australian films until I watched The Last Wave. And it was a pleasant, unpredictable surprise. <br /> <br /> Richard Chamberlain plays David, a lawyer invited to defend the five Aborigines accused of killing another aborigine. For David’s peers, this is a clear case of a drunken upset, and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence. But David believes that under the murder there is a mystery associated with tribal rituals. As his investigation continues, he will learn not only about his clients, but also about himself. <br /> <br /> To reveal something else is to spoil one of the strangest films I've ever seen. I can only say that this film goes in directions that no one expects. <br /> <br /> There are many elements that make this film fascinating: for example, the actor Chamberlain; but also the performances of David Gulpil, who plays the young aborigine, who introduces David to tribal secrets; and Nanjeevarra Amagul, who plays the old aborigine, who is the spiritual mentor. The relationship between these three characters is the essence of the film. <br /> <br /> But there is a way Weir offers the supernatural in the film. David has dreams that warn him about the future. Australia has terrible weather, with storms, hail and even a mysterious black rain, which can be nothing but pollution. But it is also related to the case that David is protecting. How this is connected is one of the greatest revelations of the film. From small events, Weir manages to create an atmosphere of fear and oppression, offering future horrors without showing anything. <br /> <br /> The account of Charles Wayne is fantastic, especially the use of the DJeridoo. The photo is also pretty good. Russell Boyd, a long-time DP Weyr who won an Oscar in 2004 for the Master and Commander, depicts a dark, creepy world full of mysteries. <br /> <br /> I also find it surprising that this is not the case for an Aboriginal film. Turn into an indictment against a white culture or a rich celebration of their traditions, such as "Dances with Wolves" or "The Last Samurai." This movie is too smart to be so simplistic. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it can be frustrating, and it can upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything that makes sense; but for those who do not object to any strangeness or ambiguity, “The Last Wave” is a great movie to watch.
