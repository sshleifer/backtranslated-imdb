“My left leg” is a pretty impressive film telling the story of Christie Brown, an artist who was mutilated by cerebral palsy and learned to draw with his left foot, the only limb in his body that he controlled. Daniel Day-Lewis got his first Oscar as the best actor for this film, which, I'm not quite sure, was deserved, but still deserves attention. Day-Lewis gives Brown a realistic and sometimes almost humorous touch. Brenda Fricker, as Brown’s devoted mother, also won an Oscar for a believable and touching role. My problem with this film is that it is sometimes too real. When Brown is desperate and needs someone to help and do it all with his left foot, the film can be difficult to watch. This causes a feeling of depression, which may temporarily disable some viewers. However, if you look beyond this, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have shortcomings and other difficulties that need to be overcome. Those of us who are not crippled and still think that we have problems are inspired by this film, because if something with much worse conditions than we can overcome their difficulties, we can certainly do the same the most. Well done, sometimes nice, but hard to watch. Maybe not for everyone, but not bad at all. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
