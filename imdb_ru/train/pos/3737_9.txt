First of all, this whole movie was a wild ride. The history of training soldiers, battles with superiors and, eventually, grouping together. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning to the very end. This is one of the military dramas that you should pay attention to if you are interested in constant abuse (sometimes without a reason) and the horrors of what constitutes a training camp. <br /> <br /> At times, the dynamics of the interaction of actors was quite amazing. and sometimes with humor. How Bowes (Colin Farrell) deals with Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the storyline, from camp to Tiggerland, and even helps him in the end. <br /> <br /> Innovative shooting in free hand mode added a certain flavor to the film. Constant movement, constant action and just constant confusion. Sometimes it was help. There are not so many others. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, it became increasingly realistic. Some moments in the film (in particular, sex scenes) seemed too realistic, although they added to the film such an effect that would not exist without them. it was a very sandy movie, through and through. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of the best films of Colin Farrell (if not his best performance). The acting for each character was excellent. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
