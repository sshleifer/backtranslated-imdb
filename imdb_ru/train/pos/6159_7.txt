This place is in England in 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) go to live with Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). She does not want them, but reluctantly accepts them. She seems to be studying witches while studying the correspondence course at the College of Witchcraft. (Ok - I understand that this is a family film, but - College of Sorcery ??? Come on !!! David Tomlinson). Both she and the children travel through the bed with the help of a magic pen. <br /> <br /> I first saw it when I was 9 years old, and I vaguely remember how I liked it. It certainly does not stand up as an adult! The story is stupid (even for fantasy), children are terrible actors, and one of them (Charles) is incredibly disgusting. In addition, Roddy McDowell is the third account and appears only in two short scenes! There is also a trip to Naboombu Island, run by lively animals. I thought it might be fun, but the animation is bad (for Disney), and there is a very cruel and too long football game between animals in it. There are several saving graces here: Lansbury and Tomlinson are just great; songs (though forgotten) are pleasant; The long dance sequence on Portobello Road is very colorful and full of energy, and the special effects that Oscars received are still impressive at the end. But the weak storyline, poor animation and unattractive children really attract attention. I heard the enhanced version is even worse! I can only give 7.
