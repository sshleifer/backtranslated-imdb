I love this film, and this is such a wonderful example of family danger, a romantic love story and a very sad storyline. Everything was so beautiful and great in this film. It was such a wonderful mix of actors and actresses, and with laughter and lots of screams, this film deserves many awards. With the mention of a beautiful script, and although I would refer this film to Notebook and Family Stone, it was much more cunning, sad and brilliant than these films. The evening tells of a love story between an elderly woman who dreams of returning to her young years and her two daughters who are with her until she is healthy. The story that dates back to me is so convincing and wonderful that I sat on the edge of my place. You really recognize all the characters, and by the end I wanted to watch it all over and over again. This is an amazingly sad, brightly played and plot film, which is actually one of a kind and should be seen by everyone for how great he really is. All performances are astounding, and the film grabs your attention from the very beginning and never lets go. I really liked it, and I'm so glad I watched it, because it was a really awesome movie ...
