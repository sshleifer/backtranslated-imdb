I remember this show from Swedish television. I was only 7 years old, and it scared me to incredibility. <br /> <br /> I would like to go back to this series and see if it was as excellent as I remember, although I suspect that my taste and requirements have changed. <br /> Although it was released before the advent of aliens and many other space thrillers, I suspect that it comes from the scary films of the 50s and the political climate of the 70s. When I think about it, it was real science fiction, a film that discusses scientific and political issues about who we are and what we are. Since then, the term science fiction has become gloomy and has become a term for any film that has spaceships.
