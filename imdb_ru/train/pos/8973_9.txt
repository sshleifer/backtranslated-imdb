I saw this movie when I was a little kid on television (thanks, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation), and I had nightmares about it for years. <br /> <br /> Trnka was one of the mentors of Bratislava Poyar, one of the Canadians. The best animators of the National Film Council The fire was, in turn, a mentor and collaborator of the great Druin. If you like Trnka, you should see the "Night Angel". <br /> <br /> Symbolism is obvious, but deftly used. The opposites of beauty and life (plants) are contrasted with the anonymity of a gloved hand. Poor puppet hero convicted, despite the lack of a political agenda. <br /> <br /> Most of all I remember the feeling of oppression in the decor. The small room where the action takes place is the whole world of the character. Intrusion by hand is a complete violation of this world. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and haunting movie. I found a copy of this and other great Trnki shorts in the public library and showed them to my children. Must see.
