I watched this movie, not expecting much and not knowing anything about it. I like it. A very good, tense plot, an intriguing hook in the shape of an ugly, fat, deaf girl and a former crook, and a pace that made things flow unhurriedly. <br /> <br /> A much better film than the same director of Crazy Director, which was boring and incredible. <br /> <br /> The only thing that didn’t quite work out was that the allegedly ugly, fat girl was neither ugly nor fat: of course, strong and far from ordinary, but with such a character on her face that she took on yourself screen whenever it was on it. Superb. I wish she was shot in more films, and better than she usually is. I saw the little Gilles' Wives and the little Mustaches, and they both looked like rubbish, and I saw everything from De artre mon coeur s'est arreté, and this is definitely rubbish. It seems that she has several people, so I will keep my fingers crossed.
