A brilliant film about family, wine, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macy is such a wonderful actor. It was almost embarrassing to see him in the same scenes with Campbell, who looks like an object of sexual neurotic, but he does not have the opportunity to work with him at the level that the script requires. But he is such a good actor that he brought her down to a level to make the scenes work. I very much welcome the role of Tracy Ullman in the role of an abandoned wife. Who knew? Sutherland is also very good. From the way he moves, the character looks taller (and even younger in some scenes). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Macy depicts the only situation in which his character can not be careful - nothing more than complete mastery.
