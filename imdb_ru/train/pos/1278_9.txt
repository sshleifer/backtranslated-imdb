"The Last Big Thing" is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically beats up pop culture to the level of humorous self-destruction. Characters so interesting and funny, over which you can laugh / sympathize. This brings me to the acquaintance with the characters that I like most ... <br /> <br /> Simon Geist is a 30-30-30-year-old man who creates an editorial magazine devoted to pop culture called "The Next Big Thing ". ". The fact is that this magazine does not really exist, and Simon has only a reason to get acquainted with the actors by interviewing them, only to give them a foolish prank, insulting their way of buying in pop culture. His living girlfriend Darla also writes a magazine (which is real), which is mainly associated with her and Simon, as well as with her and her father. Darla is a very cute (or hateful) character, depending on how you feel about her muffled neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute, I liked the character the most. Brent is a flat character, he is not so much like Tedra, the queen of the music video for a group of rock bands rated B. However, these characters weave a very interesting network together. And this film calls into question the whole motivation of people for what they do and why they do it. This is a wonderful film, and I suggest you watch it if you are in a crowd of indie / art house. Mark my words! <br /> <br />
