Keep in mind that any film (not to mention a documentary film) that asserts any truth will cause an unfavorable and proportional degree of cynicism on the part of those to whom any suggestion or search for truth is already meaningless, those of you who are already Masters Psychology, cinema and captains of the soul, no doubt, will consider this film superfluous, because you already know everything you need to know. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> For those of us who live in a minority like me, I found the “Guide to the Perverts in Sinmea” ... mostly great, and it’s worth seeing for those interested in cinema, psychology and modern philosophy. . <br /> <br /> A bit like Understanding Comics, by Scott McLoods, director Sophie Fiennes, the Slovenian philosopher, psychologist and social critic Slavoj иižek, in many films and specific scenes he discusses. On the cover is a picture from “Birds” (Zizek takes the boat out to recreate the picture). <br /> <br /> Lacanian psychoanalysis, not necessarily a cry, an evening of great fun ... but it is! If you like movies that ... Having some knowledge of Laconian psychoanalysis helps (Symbolic, Real and Imaginary) - these are terms that are scattered a little loose at first, but the scenes that Zhizek chooses and analyzes make it surprisingly clear that it has always been for me, very abstract topic. In fact, it’s probably better to have an idea about the films he discusses than about the terminology he uses, which becomes clearer with the continuation of the film. <br /> <br /> Why I love this film not because it selects excellent films for analysis or reveals the great truths about Lacan, but it shows in a very practical and intelligent way where the film and psychology meet (and philosophy by default). <br /> <br /> Why “The Sound of Music” is partly fascist, why the “Short Tracks” are about something more than just class and alienation, why birds attack in “Birds”, what can be learned about the mind from the “Resurrection of the Aliens “What does the planet Solaris want, that Psycho and the Marx Brothers are related to each other, and what the hell David Lynch meets in the movie after the movie ... well, Zizka has some ideas. <br /> <br /> The role of the voice in the films “The Exorcist” and “Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith” is perhaps the most powerful and meaningful moment in films when he enters into the female sex life. Subjectivity I am beginning to wonder ... At some point, иižek recognizes that his flowers are a kind of decorative vaginal dentate, that they are disgusting and should be hidden from children (it seems to be a joke, but ...). <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a fascinating documentary film that anyone who has ever seen a movie and thought it means more than what was stated literally should try to watch. <br /> <br /> And anyone who is interested in Slava Zizek is also a necessity, much less dry than the “Reality of the virtual” and more direct than “Zizhek!”, Two other pseudo-docks about the Elvis of modern cultural criticism As he is now in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> “The Perverts Guide to Cinema” is NOT about the role of sex in movies. Zizek claims that cinema is a perfect perverted art, because it teaches "how to want, not what to desire," and that this is the only form of modern art that can allow to formulate these desires. This is not a film about how to find reality in cinema, but about how to find a movie in reality, and how important and exciting it is. It's hard to find, and a little long, but worth it, one of the most "stimulating" movie watching events I've ever had.
