It's not a good movie, but I admire the writers and the director for trying something a little different. The main theme of the film is fate and small, seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future. In a sense, it reminds me of the movie “SLIDING DOORS”, although instead of focusing on one random event, it would seem that random things happen more than once, and everyone helps to come to a nice conclusion. In addition, the strange bald guy seems to understand all this, and he talks about it during one short scene - as if he is some kind of omnipotent creature, but in the film there is absolutely no explanation for him (like two guys who fight each other another in the Clock Tower in HUDSUCKER PRODUCTS). <br /> <br /> On the cover of the DVD, only Audrey Toth is shown. This is based on her success in AMELIE, although she is only one of many actors in the film and there is not a single leading role. The pace is vigorous, the acting is all right, and the conclusion is not bad at all. The only reason I didn’t get more points was because some of the characters were a bit uninteresting, and I think that the film could possibly have been dragged out with the help of several smaller plots.
