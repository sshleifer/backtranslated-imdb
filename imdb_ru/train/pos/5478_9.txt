It makes no sense to revise the story, since enough reviewers did it. Here are a few different slopes on it from one of these "religious nuts", as one fanatical reviewer put it. <br /> <br /> 1) “Baby Face” (1933) offers, perhaps, a classic example of how women can manipulate men through sex. There is a lot of truth that Barbara Stanvik demonstrates in this film: look cute, beat your eyelashes, offer your body for free ..... and men will fall on themselves to help you with anything. <Br /> <br /> In this case, it was a promotion with the ultimate goal of money ..... most of that. At least four people in this film provide it, even if it ruins their life in the process. <br /> <br /> 2) The end - which many of the reviewers hated here - gives another great message: all the money and wealth in the world will not make a person feel satisfied. A sad comment that so many “critics” prefer to receive immoral messages, preferring meanness over content. I think it is not surprising. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is interesting from beginning to end, and Stanvik has excellent features, especially at the beginning, when she scolds her rude father and his naughty bar customers. This film takes a little over 70 minutes and moves at a fast pace and ends until you recognize it.
