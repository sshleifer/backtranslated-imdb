so in the middle of the season I was so keen on school and my activities that I didn’t even realize that the show was canceled halfway through that nonsense. <br /> <br /> I think the followers of this show should write a fox and ask them to at least finish the shoot so that the season can be released on DVD later. maybe then they will see how many people were disappointed that the series did not survive their first season. <br /> <br /> I liked the show, and I was looking forward to it every Thursday after OK. Can you imagine my disappointment when I returned to try to watch the show, only to find that it was gone? Needless to say, I'm not very happy with the fox right now. all the more, having discovered that ANY ANY END WAS NOT CLOSED. I mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see what's going on. a half-shot performance looks like a half-finished car, it’s pretty much useless. Fox, take off the damn end and give some to the fans of the show.
