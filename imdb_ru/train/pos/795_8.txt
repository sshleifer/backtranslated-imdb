It is a pity that a couple of comments to me do not know the facts of this case. It is based on real events, a widely reported disappearance and murder case that took place in Wilmington, Pennsylvania / Philadelphia, from 96 to 2000. I have to admit that I was skeptical about how Hollywood dramatizes the real story and the events were actually quite impressed with how close they were to what was constantly reported in local news and news from the Philadelphia poll. throughout the entire time period. Of course, I immediately noted that the actress (who I really like in Cold Case), who played Fahey, did not look like her (Ann Marie was actually prettier). I have to admit that Mark Harmon really nailed the type of personality that was discovered as Kapano, and the behavior that Kapano showed during this entire period. The details of the case were correct ... no deviations from the dramatic effect ... even down to the carpet, the gun, the furniture and the refrigerator. In conclusion, I would also like to add that I met many times with Tom Carper in various positions (a good man, despite the fact that he is a politician), and I am so glad that he pulled the ropes in the federal sphere necessary to uncover this disgusting of crime. Guys like Kapano are real, and it was great to see how he was finally put behind bars.
