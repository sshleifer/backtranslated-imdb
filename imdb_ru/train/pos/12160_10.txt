Black Undervalued Black Comedy, the best of a series of films about the great guinollet that followed Baby Jane. Reynolds and Winters are the mothers of young convicted murderers (hint of "Coercion") who run away to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for future filmmakers, a group of cheerful, worthless children who are visited by terrible stage mothers. Debbie, in her bright wig (“I'm Harlow, you're more Marion Davis,” she says to Winters), leads the commotion at their concert and wins rich dad Weaver. She also makes a delightfully funny tango and, in general, gives outstanding performance, unlike everything she did before. The atmosphere is a wonderful blend of comic and creepy. This looks great with great detail from the period (30s). Lots of great shots in Hollywood and a terrifying movie. Michelle McLiammoire has the ball as a drama coach: "Hamilton Starr," he purrs, "two, but, nevertheless, prophetic." See it and love it.
