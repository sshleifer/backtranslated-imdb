I can't believe that we no longer have a 70s show. I have all 8 seasons of this show of the 70s !! I absolutely love it !! I lie in bed every night and watch a few episodes before going to bed. At the end of a long busy day, it's nice to lie back and have a good laugh before bed. I was so sad that they took the show off the air ... at least we still have replays !! I hope and pray that they will return, at least with the reunion ... How, maybe, when Donna finishes college, and we finally see each other, and Eric will marry !!!! Wouldn't that be great !!! It would be even better if they continued this for several years !!
