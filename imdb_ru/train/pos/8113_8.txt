This sci-fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors cut it out after it was opened in 1936. Visually, this is surprising, but the script allows too many intelligent speeches about war and progress. This becomes very trite when the actors are given in order to constantly repeat many bright messages. Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwick, both great actors, act as a pair of fanatics. Ralph Richardson is very good as “Boss”, commander-megalomania. The prediction of World War II was very creepy, given that the world was on the verge of the most destructive conflict in the history of mankind at that time. I am sure that I am glad that the war did not work out like in the movies. There are several visually stunning editing sequences linking the jumps in time between different episodes of the film. Although it is not as interesting as I hoped, this film will be remembered to you for a long time after you see it.
