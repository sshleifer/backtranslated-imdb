Very exciting series. I have never seen the exact combination between drama, thriller, suspense, and science fiction. I am impressed with every chapter. The script is very clever, I do not know how the creators invent all these amazing stories, each character has a strange past, problems, turbulent relationships, it gives the show a human meaning necessary to create close characters. <br /> <br /> The most incredible is the fact that all the characters are interconnected: the numbers they met before, not knowing about it, and so on. Others, the mysterious security system and the Dharma initiative are elements that prevent us from losing the chapter. <br /> <br /> Mr. JJ Abrams, what do you think to create this amazing story?
