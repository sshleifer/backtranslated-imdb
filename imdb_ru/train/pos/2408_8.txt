Anyone who saw Mel Gibson's “Passion of Christ” and was concerned about the brutal violence would like to watch this film instead. Despite the fact that it was not successful in rentals or television ratings, Fox Movie Channel still finds a good reason to show it every year. I liked the way they taught Chris Sarandon and the people who portrayed his students to sing in Hebrew. Although Sarandon did not have long hair, like any other Jesus, in other films, his appearance is pretty close to what a Jew should look like. What surprised or amazed me was the scene when Caiaphas told Jesus about Pilate: “And never forget that you are a Jew!” Although this may not have been a racist remark, Colin Blakely tried to make Chris Sarandon look like garbage in eyes of outstanding people of those days. Peylat Michelle's image was awkward compared to his previous performances in “The Story of Jacob and Joseph” and “The Story of David.” But if you compare his image of Pilate with Telli Savala or Heard Hatfield, you can say that he did draw well impressed by the roman prosecutor.
