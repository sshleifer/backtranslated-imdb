This is your standard musical comedy of the 30s, with a big plus in that there are several famous actors of the 30s in it in a small fun cameo. <br /> <br /> There is not much in the story, and basically the film is all about its fun and relaxed atmosphere, with the typical comedy of Hal Roach. It looks like a “Cinderella story”, but I probably didn’t think about it while watching a movie. The story is very confused in telling stories, in which there are many different characters, as well as many small cameo roles, when the main characters get into Hollywood studios. <br /> <br /> Of course, the highlight of the film is when Laurel and Hardy appear and show some of their procedures. It's like watching a movie and getting Laurel & Hardy for free. In addition, Laurel and Hardy, the permanent Walter Long, appear in the routine, and James Finlayson (this time without a mustache) is the director of the short film. <br /> <br /> Of course, all cameos and plots distract from the main storyline and character, but in this case it is not a problem, since watching it all is much more fun and more interesting than the main storyline and the small typical main character. <br /> <br /> The film is undoubtedly no worse than any of its other genre films of the same time period, although the rating here says something else. <br /> <br /> 7/10
