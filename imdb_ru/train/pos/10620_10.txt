When I first viewed it, I found that this story was at least less annoying than other gun movie stories. After many more, I think this is one of the best. Some songs are pretty bad, especially a love song, but two things stand out that make the film, even singing, worthwhile. One of them is the artistic direction. Like other Cannon film stories, this is a beautifully decorated historical exhibit; each piece of cloth and jewelry (both of which have the main parts in the plot of this film) looks fresh and new, and contrasts with the simple clothing of the peasants. Even during a love song, I wonderfully study the dress and hair of the princess. Another thing is comic time. In many films this is stupid, but the emperor's vanity (and, eventually, he ridiculed himself), a suspicious guard, a guard stalking Nicholas, and a stupid prince, were rather funny and seemingly completely ridiculous, and the sequence during the song Weave-O replenishes songs that were not so good.
