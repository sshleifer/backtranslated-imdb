The best of seven Sam Fuller films I've seen (including Park Row, Boom Run, Verboton! Shock Corridor, Bare Kiss, Big Red, and this film) "street" is considered one of the best film noir. This represents Fuller in his most controlled. Of course, I like him when he gets out of control, but almost everything is perfect in Pickup. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals a microfilm intended for communist spies. Gene Peters plays a woman who carried a film for her boyfriend, played by Richard Keely. Peters is forced to find Widmark and return it. She finds him through the pigeon played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes Peters' loyalty (and the fact that she learns that she works for the Communists; the Cold War is really interesting). The love story is written a little quickly and not quite believable, but it’s not so bad that it hurts the film (unlike Fuller’s previous film, Park Row). Richard Widmark is great. This should be one of his best roles, but I’m not so familiar with his career that I can say for sure. Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable presentation. Her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and its final scene in this film is as touching as any other movie. I will never forget this. 10/10
