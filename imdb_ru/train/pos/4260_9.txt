After the first work of Fatih Akins "Im Juli", which was quite good, he created a truly magnificent Italian family epic. This is a German film, which, unfortunately, is a bad precondition, because we rarely produce more moderate films;). But this film takes very good pictures of that time. Solino talks about an Italian immigrant who arrives in the Ruhr region in Germany in the 60s. Then the immigrant and his family open the first pizza restaurant in the region. Characters are well drawn. Especially Gigi, the main actor. You live every second, every feeling he makes. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtroy, is not so good. Well, you just don't believe him in the role. But the character is well balanced and fits perfectly into this scenario. I feel an urgent need to compare the style of this film with the “Godfather” style. Many people are likely to hate this film, say, boring. Not much stress? - Yes, but an outrageous film. 9 out of 10
