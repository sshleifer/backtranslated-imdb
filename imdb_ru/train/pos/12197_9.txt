It is entirely possible that this would be the final film of noir of all time if Columbia Studios had not cut so much of the original by Orson Welles. What we have left is an imperfect, but brilliant film, which demonstrates Wells’s stunning talent as an actor / director and Rita Hayworth as a serious dramatic talent. <br /> <br /> “The Lady From Shanghai” is a film noir in this very sizzling and confusing. Wells with a ragged accent depicts Michael O'Hara, an Irish apprentice who, after a fateful meeting with the seductive, dangerous Elsa Bannister (Hayworth, in excellent performance), is actually forced to take on the job as a member of the team for her and her disabled husband (Everett Sloan) yacht. Elsa, or Rosalie, as Michael likes to call her, plays an innocent, helpless doll very well, luring O'Hara into her network. While the lovers lead a not-so-secret romance at sea, Arthur Bannister’s partner in his law firm George Grisbee (Glenn Anders) appears on board. He is a strange, unreliable figure who offers Michael a unique offer: he will receive $ 5,000 to help Grisbee simulate Grisbee's death, so this looks like murder. The plan is to get Michael away from technical issues and run off with Elsa in the sun. But things are not going according to plan. <br /> <br /> Hayworth presents us one of the best femme fatals of all time in a very ambiguous image. Sometimes she seems really vulnerable and childish, in others brutal, tired and difficult. She is always beautiful, regardless of whether he demands that she be wet in a bathing suit or dressed in black, swinging a pistol. Hayworth is beautifully photographed here, and she is far from her famous role as Gilda. Her then-husband Orson Welles cut off his signature red locks for a painted blonde (annoying Colombian boss Harry Cohn). It was a terrific marketing ploy, and he changes clothes, she has changed her attitude perfectly. She is not a pretty femme fatale, like Gilda, here — instead she is a predatory, black-legged lady who views murder as a very useful option. <br /> <br /> The combination of Wells and Hayworth came at a time when the couple had extraordinary difficulties in their marriage. They would be divorced after the film was shot, so it is also a curiosity to provide some insight into complex relationships. They are hateful, not romantic, in love with this, so it is difficult to determine whether they really had real chemistry on the screen. Of course, each meeting is powerful and filled with coarse sexuality, with Wells playing the role of a “falling guy” (he even admits this in the film!) And with Rita as a twin child. <br /> <br /> Wells's character is a typical drifter noir without much sense. As the voiceover for Wells shows, O'Hara doesn’t really use his brain very much, "thinking about it (Elsa)." Wells usually played smart, charismatic guys, so his move here, like stupid Michael, is unusual and very interesting. Indeed, Wells was an actor of great talent, and he did an excellent job with him. <br /> <br /> Everett Sloan, respectively, slimy, like the crippled husband of Hayworth. I wonder why he hires Michael? Obviously, his wife is interested in them romantically, so why is he inviting the “threat” on board? One explanation could be that Michael provides a “service” to his wife, which Bannister cannot do in his disability. There is definitely something in this theory that is of great importance for Elsa's behavior before she met her husband (was she some kind of prostitute?), And Grisbee’s knowledge of Bannister’s innermost secrets hinted at in several scenes . <br /> <This is a mixed, tangled movie with a plot that is ultimately wrong. We are more interested in the love triangle than in the murder plot, as in most noirs. Wells provides us with many of his usual brilliant cinematic touches, including the justifiably famous climax of the Hall of Mirrors. This is an amazing scene, one ending of which can almost completely erase the flaws in the film and turn them into greatness. This fun home scene is visually stunning, with a dali-like feeling to the painted sets (apparently, Orson painted them himself). Subtle visual images used in the film Wells, reinforce the plot and make you think about it. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is burning and confusing, perfectly transmitted by the alternating hoarse voice of Rita and the helpless, high voice of the little girl. Hayworth proves her acting skills in this, and proves that she is the ultimate femme fatal noir. It is a pity (only insignificant, since Rita was a brilliant dancer) that she made so many amazing, but frothy and often forgotten musicals for “Colombia” in the 40s instead of dark dark noirs like this one. She was a brilliant actress when she was given the opportunity to show her talent. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
