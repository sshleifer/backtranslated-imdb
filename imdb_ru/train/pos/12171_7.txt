I literally prepared to hate this film, so believe me when I say that this film is worth seeing. In general, the story and jokes are invented, but the film has the charm and elegance to cope with them. That gag in which Jason Lee thinks he has crabs and tries not to let his boss / future father-in-law and colleagues see him scratching himself is not very smart, but it made me laugh madly. Very few gags in the film have a high forehead, but they made me laugh. As I said, the film has a charm, and charm can make a big difference. <br /> <br /> The characters are cute too. I have to say that I would like to know more about the character of James Brolin, as he was screaming in the very few scenes in which he was. Plus, I admire any romantic comedy in which there is the courage not to make the character of the wife an obstacle in the plot) a common witch. The Selma Blair character is hardly unpleasant, and there was never a scene where I thought to myself: “Why did he even want to marry her?” The ending is Hollywood, but perhaps it would be much more strange. <br /> <br /> The cast is talented. I didn’t have a positive outlook on most of Jason Lee’s major work I just loved him so much in Kevin Smith’s films that I could not help but feel disappointed to see him in these intoxicated roles. And he never looks comfortable in these intoxicated roles. Even in this film, he doesn’t look very comfortable, but he contributes his two cents and efficiently processes each scene. But I still miss his work in independent films. Julia Stiles again proves why she is so cute. Of course, she is a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint, but she also has a unique charm and seems to have a good personality. In other words, her beauty is manifested from within and without. I do not know the name of the actress, but the woman who plays a drunken grandmother is ridiculous. Julie Hagerty also has a small role, and it is always nice to look at her, so I want her to get the best roles. I loved her so much in “Plane” and “Lost in America” that it is a pity that she does not have such an opportunity to flaunt her skills. <br /> <br /> Do not postpone terrible trailers and even more terrible box office records. This is a funny, charming movie. Romantic comedies are becoming so predictable in our time that it seems that the genre itself is ready to flush down the toilet, so you should always see a good one among all these bad guys. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 (out of 10)
