It could be a better movie. It really doesn’t mean in points, and the central story moves from Boyer, completing his mission, to Boyer, who avenges Wanda Hendrix’s death, but Graham Greene is an author who is really hard to spoil. All his stories are stories about morality because of his own thoughts about Catholicism, guilt and innocence (very relative terms in his worldview) and about the human condition. <br /> <br /> Boyer is Louis Denard, a famous concert pianist who took the side of the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He was sent to England to try to make a deal to buy weapons, which is essential. Unfortunately, for Denard, he is literally on his own - each of his contacts turns out to be a voluntary defector for the Spanish Falagists. In particular, Katina Paksino (Mrs. Melendez) is the gloomy caretaker of the guesthouse, and Peter Lorre (Mr. Contreras) is the teacher of the international language of the Esperanto type. Wanda Hendrix is ​​a girl friend (Else) who works for Mrs. Melendez. The local diplomat Licata (Victor Franken) is already a voluntary partner of the Phalangists. <br /> <br /> The British (Holmes Herbert, Miles Mander and the best, if not the worst, of all, George Koulouris) Don does not give much hope for Boyer's case (which he will soon grasp, maybe the British soon). Herbert and Mander only retreat for the official policy of neutrality prescribed by the governments of Ramsey Macdonald and Stanley Baldwin during the civil war. The Coulouris here is a typical type of Colonel Blimp - he is always flawless in his native English diction, he acutely shows his dislike for foreigners in general. <br /> <br /> The only ray of hope - Lauren Bacall (Rosa Cullen) here is trying to play her part as well as she can - but she really cannot. She is an aristocrat - the daughter of the lord of the press. It was Bacall's second film, and (sadly) almost sank her long career. She works well, but the spark she showed in her first film was caused by the double effect of the main roles with Humphrey Bogart and director Howard Hawks. Boyer is a wonderful actor, but he is not the Gods, and Herman Shumlin is not the Hawks. Her next film brought her back to the Bogie and Hawks, and her star resumed her dominance. <br /> <br /> This is a dark movie (like a novel). Boyer's mission will never be successful, as he has too many hidden enemies everywhere. But villains also lose - often with their lives. <br /> <br /> With Dan Seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant Katina Paksino (and the person who destroys her). Worth a look to catch the Warner actors doing their best, given the weakness of the direction.
