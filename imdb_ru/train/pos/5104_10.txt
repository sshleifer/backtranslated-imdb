This is a clever drama about the lifestyle of the Texas honky tonka in the early 1980s. John Travolta and Debra Winger perform in two very believable performances, like Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really opens the scene of country music and helps to introduce America to the mechanical bull. If you like a good romantic movie, then you will love this movie.
