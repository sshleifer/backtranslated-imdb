This review is for the extended part of this film. <br /> <br /> I saw the Dragon Lord for the first time when I bought it on DVD many years ago. I always liked this movie, and you can read some positive reviews about it to get a general idea. <br /> <br /> As stated. I always found the plot a bit confusing. After all, a movie is a love story. And it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20-minute battle scene. <br /> <br /> Well, in the extended version this is no longer the case. The old “original” version begins with a huge barrel-rise / rugby sequence, which is the new final sequence in the extended version. The opening sequence is the Dragon (Jackie Chan), hanging around his house and pretending to train and read when his father is nearby. <br /> <br /> Other sequences have also been shifted or extended in an extended section, and the story makes much more sense when you watch it. The pace is also better, and in general it works better. It is more like a love story and leaves no questions about why it ends so abruptly and dramatically, as in the normal version. <br /> <br /> I offer everyone who is a Hong Kong cinema, or just a simple Jackie Chan fan, to take the extended version and watch the movie as it was originally intended (or at least I think so it was intended. Why else did they do it and rearrange some scenes)? when I finished watching, I felt I was watching a completely new Jackie Chan movie, although most of the episodes were the same.
