Atlantis: The Lost Empire has some of the best, flowing animations and slyly written dialogues from all the Disney movies I've seen. And I was convinced of this in the first 15 minutes. I especially like the voice of Don Novello over Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongber Sweet. It is a pity that the whole film seems to be moving about twice as fast as would be appropriate - at least in the first act. One of the important aspects of any Disney movie is a satisfactory antagonist, which Atlantis does not provide. He is average at best. Halfway through the movie is a mediocre turn. It's all. However, this is a great movie. Everyone should check it out.
