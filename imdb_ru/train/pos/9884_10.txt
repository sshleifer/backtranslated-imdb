Rawhide was a great western television series. Focusing on the group of drivers of the tracks led by the head of the track Gil Favor. Most of the episodes — especially from the first 3 seasons — were truly studies of the character of Favor and his people. Guest stars came and went, but, unlike the Wagon Train, they rarely dominated the episodes in which they appeared. Rawhide was a real, tough western, and Gil Favor stood out as an unforgettable character that would never be forgotten. Thanks to the performance of Eric Fleming, the show was a huge hit. Of course, he was ably supported by remarkable actors from good actors - Clint Eastwood, Cheb Wooley, Paul Brynegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Schachan, Robert Cabal. All these actors left their mark on the history of television. Rawhide caught the flavor of the time in the west, which no other series for me has yet been able to do. Later seasons tended to divide the lead and give them separate storylines. Sometimes it didn't work for me - chasing cattle and regulars gave the best stories. However, there were a few more classic stories, and Rawhide remained the main business. Black and white photography added a dark, realistic sensation that other Western TV series rarely captured. Rustlers, Indians, Commancheroes, beautiful girls in trouble, serial killers, they all appeared to bring problems to our heroes. The end of the series came unnoticed when the final season was less than half. The reason is that Eric Fleming is gone, and Rohide is now a head without a body — gross realism has disappeared, Gil Favor has won respect and exuded authority — he has never been infallible, and that made him even more interesting. We will not see him again. Watch episodes when you can, they rarely disappoint.
