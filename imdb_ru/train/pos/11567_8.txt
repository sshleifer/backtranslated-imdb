In the 1930s, the studios used similar short films as a testing ground for new actors, given their relative ease of production compared to full-length feature films, so itâ€™s interesting that this film should have a star Shirley Temple, which itself has long been the most famous child star of all time. On the other hand, she was probably not the one tested, I would suggest that it was Frank Coglan Jr., who played brother Shirley Sonny in the film and showed a relatively less impressive performance. On the other hand, the 9-year-old Shirley Temple was probably a difficult act to accompany. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an unimpressive spectacle incorporating a leaking ceiling, which I believe was designed to have Shirley Temple cast a disdainful look at the ceiling, illustrate the status of the working class family in the film and provide a clean transition to the next scene in which Shirley happily stomps in the rain. <br /> <br /> This is Sonny 'Have a Birthday, and his father from time to time makes terribly unsuccessful attempts to hide the fact that he wants to give Sonny the dog he really wants for himself, but Sonny is afraid of dogs because he was bitten once and was scared ever since. It is curious that when his father insists on getting a dog, Sonny decides to run away from the house and not have a dog in the house, and since he runs away without a goal in sight, it is also curious that the film illustrates what seems to be indifference to the homeless, which surpasses even the striking indifference that exists today. <br /> <br /> Sonny misses a man who cooks bacon in an iron frying pan next to the train tracks (right after the train flew past, Considering how close he was to the tracks, you would think that he would rip the guy off track, but it does not matter). After Sonny refuses to share breakfast because of the sour look that his joyful smile gets from the guy, he continues, and the homeless person disappears from the movie. It is interesting to think about what a longer film would do, because this film leaves this poor guy unfinished. <br /> <br /> Not so important, Sonny soon hears the dog whining under the overpass as he drives past. this, and jumps down to find a dog covered with burrs. It may seem trivial that he immediately takes the dog and accepts it, since he simply left the house because of his fear of dogs, but it seemed to me that he just needed to remind not his power over dogs, but their absence by him. As soon as he saw a needy dog, he overcame his fear. <br /> <br /> Hey, if this is all I need, all I need to do is find a helpless spider, and I'm ready! <br /> <br /> This is a very convenient film, in which everything turns out exactly as it should be, but it is pretty enough and pleasant enough (and short enough) to still be a fun movie. We no longer expect an epic storyline in the 19-minute film, but Pardon My Pups still has a significant amount of story and character development in a short time. And it also shows the fight scene at the end of the film, which must have made Charlie Chaplin proud. I hardly understand the films of Shirley Temple, but it is not difficult to understand how she became the most famous children's star of all time.
