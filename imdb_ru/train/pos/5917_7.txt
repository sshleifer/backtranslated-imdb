Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a very unique film made by animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. This is a strange film, and very worth seeing. This live action mixed with animation, which seems to have influenced Disney's legendary Song of the South, almost as if it were a reaction to this film. Philip Michael Thomas, who later became Don Johnson's assistant in Miami Weiss, and Scatman Crothers, best known for his role in The Shine of Kubrick, are prison breaks. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, that Barry White) are friends of Thomas and plan to help him escape from prison. They are stuck at the police checkpoint, and Krothers tells Thomas the story of a black rabbit, a bear, and a fox, who are moving from the south to Harlem to find a more peaceful existence. The story is lively, and provides many amazing things to see. Like all Bakshi films, most of them will be annoyed and they will not like the animation. Real animation lovers will forgive his lack of talent and will love his ingenuity. The film is very brutal, very sexy, and mostly about battles between races. For a long time, I thought I was watching something extremely important, but after a while, especially after I finished watching it, it became more like an ordinary click of blacksploitation, along the line of Superfly. It is very sloppy and says nothing. Besides, isn't Bakshi white? Whatever the answer to this question, Coonskin / Streetfight is still worth a look at both the animation fans and the cult film fans. 7/10.
