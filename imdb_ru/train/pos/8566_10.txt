I really like 101 Dalmations, when she came out in 1996, now, 5 years later, I went to see 102 Dalmations in 2001, I thought it was fantastic, but I think 101 is better because I think it's more funny, more humor, and this movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version (one hundred and one dalmas (1961). I wonder if there are plans for 103 Dalmatia. I hope that maybe, yes, maybe No, all of us, fans of Dalma, will have to find out if in the future there will be 103 Dalmas.
