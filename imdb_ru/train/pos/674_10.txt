Although most people watch the film, it will be of little interest, but of the many hundreds of films devoted to magic and the occult in one form or another, this one is probably the best in many respects. <br /> From Golem to Craft, the theme seems to be of infinite interest for the film industry. Most films that relate to it in any case, do it childishly (for example, “Witchboard”, a real piece of absolute rubbish in all respects), or accepting transcendental elements as a cheap excuse for stupid special effects or cardboard cuts (cf) Warlock " Most often, the subject rises in a hysterical religious context (in various films devoted to Revelations, the Antichrist is inevitably a supporter of some New Age style practice.) Rarely, the film seems to show at least some A great fleeting experience with magic, as practiced in real life, but the presentation of the occult in such films can at best be described as allegorical, not literal, or symbolic, or ... just not quite right. > I watched this movie again many years later tonight. I saw it before on VHS; It’s a dark, gloomy work, and after watching it on DVD, I would say that if you have the intention to watch this movie, watch it on DVD, and not look at VHS. <br /> <br /> darkness and capriciousness are suppressed in VHS, but on DVD the film takes on a completely different tone. I think that Weir deliberately pushed the dark aspects to the style, but when the film is converted to a lower VHS color environment, it crosses the boundaries. The DVD brings the film back to life, and I saw it differently. <br /> <br /> In any case, seeing him as if for the first time, I realized that in this film he handles magic very well. It is difficult to understand all the reasons, so I do not want to spend time on it. <br /> <br /> For all who are interested, in any case, if you want to see how this happens in real life, this film is just very right on countless levels. <br /> <br /> And for those who do not, you really spent a lot of time reading this topic.
