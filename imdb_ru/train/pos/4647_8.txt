A person needs a special kind to make a film that is so terrible, seductive, disgusting and disgusting, but it does so in such a way that it is also a brilliant and quintessential personal cinematic release. Crispin Glover in all his "tricks" and predispositions really created something unique. In a world that has become absolutely partisan, this film seems to shy away from the standard lines of creativity and art and effectively amazes everyone. <br /> <br /> Immediately, the film takes a rather distant paradigm (if there is a model at all) and initially shapes it with the help of Shirley Temple before the swastika, and naked women are appeased by a man with cerebral palsy. This is quite a shocking thing, but if you had the opportunity for question and answer sessions after the show, it clearly opens up a bag of worms that makes you wonder if this is art or just the lowest common denominator. In any case, you feel the tremor that will eventually cause this film. This will never be accepted, even by the supposed authors of the world, who speak boringly about the state of man. You might not like it, but itâ€™s definitely worth a look.
