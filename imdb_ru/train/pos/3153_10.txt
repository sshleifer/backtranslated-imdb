I'm going to make it short and enjoyable, because I don’t think I can tell a lot about this show, who has never seen him, except for his funny funny and unique, for me, perhaps the funniest show ever. <br /> <br /> You have to really watch him in order to understand his humor, and it took me a few episodes to really get into it, but as soon as you don’t go back there. For example, the way a character Hyde always wants his friends to get into some kind of trouble, the more this happens, the funnier it becomes. <br /> <br /> This is a round classic, I mean the cast, the writers, the director, it's just a recipe for success. One actor who, I think, is always in trouble, is Ashton Kutcher, but I mean that he’s great on this show. I don’t think it’s possible for a character Kelso to play someone else, it takes a very smart person to play someone stupid. All the main characters are great, and the review would be useless if I did not mention the cold stone fox Mila Kunis, now it's a keen encounter with a ball that has all the jokes aside from an amazing show.
