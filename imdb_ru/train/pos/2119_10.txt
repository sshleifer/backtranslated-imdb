"Shop around the corner" - one of the best films directed by Ernst Lubich. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, he is filled with a stunning cast of main characters such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. They are the type of actors that Hollywood, unfortunately, no longer uses. In fact, the film itself is a film that Hollywood no longer makes. (The creators of “You Got Mail” claim that their film is a remake, but this is nothing but an exaggerated self-praise.) In any case, if you have a love for the romantic comedies of the 1940s, you will find “Shop around the corner” - None other than miraculous. As good with repeated views. Enjoy!
