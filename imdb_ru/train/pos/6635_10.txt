What can I say about the first film in history? <br /> <br /> You cannot appreciate it, because it should not be interesting. But if you need to rate it, you have to give it 10. Itâ€™s awesome to see 1895 moving images. It was one of the most important films in history. I wonder what it was like to be one of those who saw the first movie in history! <br /> <br />
