Tom has long wanted to make a film, and he did it. as if he had presented a dirty and worn notebook full of wonderful little ideas that he had been filling out and had been wearing for 10 years. no grant transformations of characters, no Hollywood ingredients, just life and a bit of magic. the balance, in speed, in strangeness in the comedy against drama is perfectly weighed. This film takes you on a journey that ends before you realize how pleasant it was. the music is great and your eyes will be equally pleased. the fact that this film is about nothing, just a sequence of sketches of people who are mainly connected through a group of one of the characters makes it very pleasant and surprisingly interesting, it is brilliant because it is empty. between the lines this happens. see or not see it?
