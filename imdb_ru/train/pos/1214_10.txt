It all started when True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse returned the club to a safe place. The Noble Heart's Horse met Dawn and John and led them away to see the True Heart Bear. Later, the departure counter dropped even more — check “Real Heart Bear” and “Noble Heart Horse” to see if it is Dark Heart, but they cannot go if the club doesn't care, so they ask Don and John to take care of the club. After the Faithful Heart Bear and the Noble Heart Horse return, They send Don and John back to camp. Than the bears of the club and cousin grew up to prepare for the fight with the Dark Heart. In the end, the Dark Heart will kidnap all the caring bears, and the children (Don and John) have to tell Christie that the Dark Heart is evil. What do they work together to save the Bears of Care. Later, the True Heart Bear and the Noble Heart Horse discovered the shadow of the Dark Heart and returned to the land of care to find that they were not there. The children (Dawn, John and Christie) come, but they are not able to stop the Dark Heart. The True Heart Bear and the Noble Heart Horse come to help Don, John and Christie release other caring bears, but Christie got in the way and was struck by the Dark Heart's magic. How did the Dark Heart see that Christie was hit and stopped fighting a bear to help her, but he cannot because the Dark Heart (itself) is not able to save Christy. Bears care, and children help the Dark Heart to save Christie. Now Dark Heart begins to take care and becomes a real boy to fall in love with Christie. "Dark Heart" is now a real boy, and help Christie work in the camp. <br /> <br /> This is a great move and the best movie "Caring Bears", which I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I like all the films about nurses, and I can’t wait to see the movie “Caregiving Bears: A film about big desires (2005)”. <br /> <br /> Who likes this movie?
