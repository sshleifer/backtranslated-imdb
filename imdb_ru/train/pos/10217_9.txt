The fluttering of the wings of a butterfly in the Atlantic can cause a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow connected with the theory of chaos, I’m not quite sure how), every action, no matter how small or insignificant, will lead to a chain reaction, which can lead to big events. This little gem of the film shows us a series of seemingly unrelated characters, most of whom are in Paris, whose actions will affect each other’s lives. (The theory of six degrees of separation can be applied as well.) Each story is an aspect of the gem that is this film. The game is fine tuned and perfected (Audrey Totu is bright), the stories are combined with believable, the humor is just right, and the viewer leaves the theater, nodding in agreement.
