One of the dimensions of the film's greatness is â€œif it came on television. right now, would you like to sit and look again? My answer to the Grand Canyon is as strong as yes, as almost any movie I've ever seen. There are so many strong moments, such a smart and moving story, such incredible ideas. <br /> <br /> It perfectly reflects the confusion and violence that was so prevalent in the early nineties. But it also strongly confirms the ability of people to love, think and care. In a sense, the film was its time. This partially depicts society as a balloon that is about to burst. Since the country was experiencing a recession and was deprived of leadership, this was true for that time. But the film is also timeless. I think he can honestly stand up to any film that has ever been made, and this is the most overlooked film of all time.
