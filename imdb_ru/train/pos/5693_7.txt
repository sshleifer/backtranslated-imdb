The real story is about a handful of drug addicts robbing a not very honest businessman about drugs, jewelry, weapons and money. Someone will say that this is a tragic story about America, which lasted in the eighties, when in the sixties of peace and free love drugs and AIDS fell. Honestly, these are just ordinary people without a goal in life who sit idle and decide to rob a ruthless person. What is the second part of their master plan? As soon as they have his things ... they will sit and rise again. Great plan. Even if you do not know the story, there is no expectation in this film and no surprises. The fact that Cox is trying to make some folk heroes out of these characters with the help of party scenes and mounting their loot is weak and offensive. The story was better with a more direct approach. In fact, it's just a sad story about how small drug dealers were killed by large drug dealers. The big story, in many ways, is John Holmes. In any case, he is the center of this story. This film was supposed to be all about him, his life. He was alone in Wonderland, with miracles that would soon disappear. <br /> <br /> P.S. Although it’s not official, Boogie Nights is the best version of Holmes’s life. This is not entirely a fact, but much nicer.
