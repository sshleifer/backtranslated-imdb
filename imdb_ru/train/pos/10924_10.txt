I saw this Kung Fu movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was so cool! Now I am 26 years old, and my friend has it on DVD !!! <br /> <br /> We received a box of brew and watched this classic! He has not lost any of his original kung fu coolness! If you're a fan of kung-fu / karate movies, be sure to check it out ... The DVD is now available I believe this movie is also called "Pick Your Poison". <br /> <br /> Watch it soon!
