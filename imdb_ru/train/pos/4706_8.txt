Of course, this is not a classic, but it is full of classic lines. One of the few films that my friends and I are quoting all the time, and this is fifteen years later (maybe Cinemax was too many times!) her - but he is surrounded by a fantastic cast that knows exactly how to play this parody. Looking for a movie to cheer you up? That's all, but rent it with friends - it will make it even better.
