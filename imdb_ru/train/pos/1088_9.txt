Cary Grant and Mirna Loy are great to play as a middle class couple who want to build their dream home. Everything begins with reasonable plans and expectations, which are torn to pieces by countless complications and the explosion of the original budget. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of great laughter (even if the story is somewhat unconvincing) Be sure to entertain fans of the stars or in the style of the Hollywood comedy of the late 1940s. A certain moment comes when the contractor cuts all expenses, which must have sounded rather excessively for the 1948 audience. As he leaves, he assures the client (Grant) that he may be able to achieve a reduction of $ 100.00. Of the total amount ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but, of course, $ 25.00 Fun!
