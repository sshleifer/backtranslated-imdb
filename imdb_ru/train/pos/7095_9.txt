Terry Gilliam’s stunning full-length adaptation of Chris Marker's short film “LA JETEE” is full of stunning surprises, but still touches your heart thanks to the excellent cast of actors. Gilliam's instinct for phantasmagoric works with the script of David and Janet Peeps played with your head as much as with poor James Cole (Willis is mostly similar to Steve McQueen - even better than McQueen!) he does not know whether he comes or leaves, because the team of scientists continues to send him to the wrong epochs, trying to prevent the 1995 plague, which is deadly for people, but harmless to animals. Willis, nominated for Oscar Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe, as a benevolent psychiatrist, demonstrate some of the best achievements in their careers. Even Paul Buckmaster's tango style is haunted. Do not miss this one!
