The sisters will be released theatrically March 24 in Sweden. A good reason for our Scandinavian friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. This was shown in Gothenburg along with a retrospective on Kim Longinotto, the “director in focus” of the festival. She gave a master class that was very appreciated when she talked about her method as a documentary director and told the audience about the special circumstances that made her shoot the Sisters twice in law: the first version was lost forever, so the second shooting was organized the end. In this case, a rather terrible problem occurred - to create a very strong film.
