I thought the movie "I do, they don't do" was fantastic. In the past, I watched Rob Estes at Suddenly Susan and Melrose Place, as well as Josie Bissett at Melrose Place, and loved to see them together again in I Do, They Do Not. They have excellent chemistry together (I think it helps to marry in real life!) - they are widowed in the film, they have children and careers, they fall in love and try to mix their already busy chaotic families without throwing the ball. Of course, they stumble, but they hold it together - this is what working and raising a family means. So many people talked about this movie - all is well! - and the film left us waiting for more. This would make a great series - attractive for many ages! - it would be so nice to see a real, mundane, family exhibition, like this one, which reflects the reality of so many of our lives today - instead of the so-called “reality television”, that all stations suppress us these days. Someone is telling people from ABC Family that they have the beginning of a new series here!
