Honestly, if someone told me that the director of “Unhappy Events”, “City of Angels” and “Kaspers” Lemony Snicket was going to make a small but inexpensive indie film, and that would be very good, I would say that this person must be joking. But this is what director Brad Sibirling did. And it was really good. <br /> <br /> “10 items or less” is similar to films like “Before Dawn”, “Lost in Translation”, or more recently “Once”. This includes the occasional meeting of two people who, if they had not accidentally been placed there, they probably would never have crossed, or if they did, they would not say a word to each other. As in these films, “10 items or less” focuses on the relationships that are built, and how the characters understand each other and use each other’s strengths and weaknesses. <br /> <br /> In this story, Morgan Freeman plays an unnamed actor who goes to explore his role as a grocery store employee for an upcoming independent film and ends up spending 10 or less days with a lady tracks played by Paz Vega. She has a rotten marriage, and she hopes to get a new job as a secretary. Initially, Freeman's character just needs to climb home. However, after spending time with her, he wants to get to know her and, perhaps, even give her some advice. <br /> <br /> Brad Sibirling almost fully builds characters through exchanges between Freeman and Vega. The plot is simply a setting for the two characters to interact with each other for most of the 80-minute length of the film. Freeman has fun with his character, as he seems to be an outsider in the world of the lower class in which the character of Vega, Scarlett, dwells. Meanwhile, Vega goes beyond a stubborn cashier who is upset about the situation in her life, who wants to move on. <br /> <br /> In this film there are a few things that really stand out. First of all, Sibirling probably paid the attention of independent cinema to ensure that the relationship is sincere and do not fall into any Hollywood traps. This is a very mutual friendship that convincingly develops throughout the film. It works, although the situation itself seems a bit unthinkable. <br /> <br /> I am also impressed with the performances. While the presence of Freeman gives this film credibility from the very beginning, it demonstrates a certain amount of charm and fun, which are usually not visible to him. Meanwhile, Paz Vega is preparing for a breakthrough in the American film in the future. I loved her in Spanish, and she is equally good here, as strong, not stupid Scarlet. By the end of the film, she successfully conveys the growth of her character. I look forward to her appearance in the following films. <br /> <br /> In general, “10 less items” works best as a character, well designed and directed by Brad Sibirling. He did not write much, and his artwork consisted mainly of large Hollywood films. Nevertheless, the artist certainly works here, and I cannot wait to see whether he will follow this path again.
