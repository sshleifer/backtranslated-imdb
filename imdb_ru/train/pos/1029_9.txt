I would rate the series as an ideal top ten for the outstanding and consistently high quality of the development of the plots and characters, if not for the last episode of season 10! <br /> <br /> The last episode of the 10th season, Infinite, in which (it would seem, Asgard) was killed very hastily, unconvincingly and very unceremoniously, left me in disbelief! <br /> <br /> It is obvious from the extremely hasty end of the series that many plot arches were originally planned for at least one season. I guess they quickly sped up these stories to get the Stargate SG-1 franchise for the two upcoming transitions straight to DVD! <br /> <br /> If Asgard does not return in the future SG-1 film (with a very good explanation for the “seeming” disappearance), I think that the fans were deceived by the poor cleaning of loose ends! <br /> <br /> Poor ending in other brilliant science fiction series.
