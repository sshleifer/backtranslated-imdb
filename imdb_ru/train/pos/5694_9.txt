Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are awesome. I saw Kilmer in The Doors, but his interpretation of John Holmes is great. Nothing compared to Boogie Nights, which were a bit slow. “Wonderland” is a film that can show you a horrible crime story from the point of view of a guy who has just indulged his drug addiction and is indifferent to what ever happens around. At the same time, the character of John Holmes demonstrates a very intelligent hustler, able to get through the most unpleasant and ugly situations that are almost not affected. The film deserves to be watched more than once. The sensual and drug-filled atmosphere of the seventies is amazing.
