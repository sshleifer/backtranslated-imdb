This film is good because it is, and unpretentious; However, I would not watch it twice: I am a complete Peter Cushing, and therefore I watched it. The best advantage of this film is: EASE AND EFFICIENCY. Compared to other similar films, it does not pull the legs forever, since each of the four (plus one) segments lasts less than 30 minutes, and the last - less than 10. Good strange vibrations. In the first segment, a horror writer who suffers from a “writer's quarter” moves to a secluded old house in search of inspiration. He even finds too much when he begins to visualize one of his fictional madmen. The plot is similar to PREMATURE BURIAL. Good use of the point of view: the author becomes mentally ill ... or (as the end shows) his trophy wife wants her lover to play with her husband's phobias in order to drive him crazy and secure his property .... After intrigue -Indrigan survive to enjoy the fruits of his brilliant plan? <br /> <br /> In the second segment, two long-lost friends gather together in the same secluded old house, but it seems they cannot help but visit the strange horror museum featuring the wax statue of the long-lost love of their youth, which once their. From the keeper of the Gothic Museum, they learn that the woman depicted is a dead ax with a murderer ... or is she? <br /> <br /> The third segment was less interesting to me. <br /> <br /> The fourth shows a horror actor - who thinks he is the best of all low-budget C films immersed in the depths. Looking for a costume to give more confidence to his fictional vampire, he gets a real deal. This segment also lacks the thoroughness of the first two. <br /> <br /> Act fairly, since the 2 initial segments make a major contribution. A good movie, shot with a crumb of salt. Not the best Cushing, nor Lee ... but worth seeing.
