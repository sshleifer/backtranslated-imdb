This is the first film I saw in the last year! It's incredibly funny, incredibly original, incredibly gorgeous (they chose this super-cool widescreen Technicolor style that just looks amazing), and it really has a deep character and something that says about society. This is a really smart satire that takes everything from National Security to race problems, and at the same time makes you laugh and realize how much the world lives in fear. Carrie Ann Moss turns into a comedic show, about which I did not even suspect that it will come from her! She is cute, fun and sexy! Billy Connolly is great as Fido, who can only grunt and moan! And Dylan Baker as a dad is priceless. Actually the whole cast is perfect. Henry Cherni as the bad guy, Tim Blake Nelson as the neighbor with the hot sexy zombie girl (See now?) It's funny, although provocative, and just awesome! Go and watch this movie! It's like nothing you have ever seen.
