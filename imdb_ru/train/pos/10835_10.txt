I love this film. This is one of those films that you can watch again and again and still find attractive. Congratulations !! I believe that everyone involved in the creation of the film and the script should be proud of themselves. It's so creepy, you feel like you are watching a real band. I would like to see more films like this. I am glad that they did not choose famous Hollywood stars to participate in this film, because it probably would not have worked. And even if Billy Connolly is well known, he was really stuck in that role, and I could not imagine anyone else playing her. Congratulations again, I truly believe that this film deserves a Peter Sellers award for a comedy for Bill Nighy. And when you get to the final scene ..... well, what can I say !!!!
