Charmingly, I approached “I am curious” (yellow), and this was a companion with great trepidation. I read numerous reports about his widely publicized controversy and outright sex. What I got was not this, but carefully thought out, challenging and exciting movie experience unlike any other. I truly believe that most of the commentators who consider this film to be a “lame” or “boring” film came up as if it were pornography. Perhaps this is pornography, suggesting that pornography is something that is meant to tickle feelings, but deliberately non-erotic. Lena, the main character, throws her all into her work, giving it realism and humanity, which is simply convincing and stable. Her breasts may be saggy, her nipples are unusually large, her hips are thick, and her face is puffy. But by the end of the film, viewers begin to identify with it and recognize its shortcomings as human. This touch gives it even more credibility. If the director applied the Briget Bardot bomb, the effect would be nullified. I can't recommend this subject anymore. Be prepared to put a lot of thought into this intentionally made movie. The patient and the humble viewer will be rewarded as most other films dream of.
