This unsung quiet stone tells the true story of the escape of prisoners of war during World War II. The performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on many levels: cerebral, emotional, visual and literal. The dialogue is brilliant and sounds very believable. In fact, unusual all-round authenticity puts this head and shoulders above most of the military epics.
