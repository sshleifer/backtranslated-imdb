I think I'm part of a silent minority who liked this movie. Is this one of the best Nightmare TV shows? Maybe not, but I had a lot of fun with it. Freddy Krueger reaches his evil, witch potential. Since parts 4 and 5 fell behind the series, I felt that this so-called final release (“The New Nightmare” - the real final) brought the series out of recession. There are some wonderful nightmares, including one where Brekin Meyer plays a stoner who gets stuck, falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game controlled by Freddie. This is a very original and fun sequence, especially when we see it outside the landscape of dreams, jumping like Super Mario. And Freddie shrugs off the funny one-line "Great graphics." And since the film was shot about 10 years ago, he remembered when Freddie began controlling the game with the help of Powerglove. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers Powerglove. <br /> <br /> The cast is great. Lisa Zane played a major role. I have not seen Yafet Cotto since The Running Man, and I think the last time I saw this film was about 5 years ago. He is another great, underrated actor who has a powerful on-screen presence. And who can forget cameos? The best of them is Johnny Depp (from the first Nightmare), who plays a representative of anti-drug advertising. <br /> <br /> The 3D sequence at the end is really awesome! So for those who want to check out this movie - please rent it or buy it on DVD! We hope that all editions come with 3D glasses, but I’m sure that the 3D element in the video has been removed. <br /> <br /> I personally have not seen a lot of things wrong with the film. It even clarified the background of Freddie. The film is a great mixture of humor and fear, and its effects are stunning. Could this give a better fair franchise? Of course it might have. But Rachel Talalay did a good job. And finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done. <br /> <br /> And finally, I liked the installation on the initial credits. Fans of the series will be delighted and will take it as a tribute to his beloved Freddie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 (out of 10)
