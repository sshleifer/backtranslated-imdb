I thought the kids in the show did a very good job. I especially liked Emma's performance. Well done! The tricks were pretty good for low budget shows. I could watch a movie and enjoy it without looking at my watch every 5 minutes. I enjoyed the scenes with the tooth fairy and her burning. The ghostly phenomena of the release of children's souls were also good. Another good thing about the film is that he kept moving forward. There were not many slow scenes. Motives for adults were also believable and therefore helped entertain the show. Overall a pleasant night watching movies.
