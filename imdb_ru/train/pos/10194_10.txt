It would have worked much better if it had been made as “Mitchell in Malta”. At least, then we would be spared the sight of Joe Don Baker running around the picturesque Mediterranean region, wearing this ridiculous looking cowboy clothes ... not to mention acting like the gunsmith of the Old West. Mitchell, being Mitchell, the film also would not have suffered from the unjustified cruelty of the police. Well. At the very least, Mike and Botov’s comic comments made this pleasant fare an MST episode. However, I can not imagine that I watch it myself.
