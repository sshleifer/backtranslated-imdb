Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann have teamed up to make some of the best westerns ever made, and this is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The real star of the film is the exciting Canadian Rockies, which serve as the backdrop to the story. Some of the best cinematographic works ever created in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> In all the five westerns that Stewart and Mann did together, the roles of the actors were well played. There are no exceptions, down to the parts that can have only a few lines, the characters are firmly sealed in these lines. <br /> <br /> Stewart is a cynical cruel loner in this film, whose only true friend is his sidekick Walter Brennan. It is the death of Brennan at the hands of the villains that makes him want to finally free the golden settlement from the bad guys and accidentally redeem himself in the process. <br /> <br /> John McIntyre is the main villain of this work, and he was an underrated actor with a huge range. He could play adorable old sober, authoritative figures, and in this case, a particularly vile and treacherous villain. <br /> <br /> One of the best westerns.
