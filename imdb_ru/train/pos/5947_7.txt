The 50th anniversary of this musical comedy fantasy may seem her age, but she wears it with dignity. <br /> <br /> This movie is still very funny. Crosby has never been a truly romantic lead material, but he delivers the material with the light humorous edge he needs. Bendix plays extensively and is very fun in the part that requires his strengths. Hardwicke - how joyous it is for a knight of the kingdom - genuine - to throw himself into such attacks with such persistence. And Rhonda Fleming enjoys the least showy of the main roles. Only Mourvin Vai disappoints as an unconvincing Merlin. <br /> <br /> Although the songs are not musicals, they are very good, and the “dance” routine accompanying Busy Doing Nothing is not perfect - funny, relevant, adroit, not challenging and doing the virtue of the Crosby musical movement, which To be honest, it was essentially funny, because it was never his main force. <br /> <br /> The color is good, in some places the sound is a bit muddy. <br /> And the story - well, with the original a bit of freedom goes away, but I suspect that Mr. Clemens could well be pleased with the result.
