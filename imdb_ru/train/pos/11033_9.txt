I do not think I will ever understand the hatred of Renny Harlin. “Die Hard 2” was awesome, and he presented the world with the Cliffhanger, one of the most amazing action films in history. That's right, little punks, the Cliffhanger rules, and we all know that. <br /> <br /> Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former lifeguard who “just visits” his old town when asked to help his former friend Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) helps in rescue on the top of the mountain. Walker, obviously, returned at a convenient time, because people who are in a quandary, in fact, are a complex team of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & Co. lost a lot of the money they stole from the US government somewhere in the Rockies, and they really would like to get it back ... <br /> <br /> In fact, Cliffhanger is another Die Hard clone. Just trade within the Nakatomi Plaza with the open ridges of the Rocky Mountains, complete with scenes created to point out our hero's weaknesses and keep him mortal. Naturally, this installation is rather quickly torn to pieces, since Stallone’s character easily avoids a large number of bullets and smashes his face into several rocks without visible side effects. After all, isn't that what the militants are about? <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is one of the most exciting action movies. Showcase of great scenes and stunts. One of the early tricks is one of the best tricks I've ever seen in a movie, and although the rest of the movie doesn't get better than at the beginning, it retains its amazing fighting spirit. The main villain John Lithgow entertains, and one bad dude. It is possible, one of the coolest main villains in history. <br /> <br /> “Cliffhanger” is without a doubt one of the best works by Stallone, by far, the best attempt by Renny Harlin and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
