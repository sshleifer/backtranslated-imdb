I admit that I have a weakness for alternative stories, from HIS WONDERFUL LIFE to FOUNDING DAY until 12:01. Among these greats is this little gem. It's quite difficult to go through mr. FATE, not giving gratitude to all the actors, from the kindhearted James Belushi to the murderous Courtney Cox. This film lacks seriousness and scale to make it an excellent film, but it is a wonderful reinforcement on a rainy day. It is also a great rental for a cheap date.
