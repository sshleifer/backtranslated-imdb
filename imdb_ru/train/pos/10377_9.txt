The film, from which I expected very little, and watched how the quiet hour passed - but what time it turned out. The cast is an excellent, if not too serious little story about a “village boy lost in a big city, doing good,” he is funny everywhere, the characters are charming, and the pace is just right. br /> <br /> Toby Malone is a real movie star with his charming image of Matt, said country boy and local football hero Aussie Rules, coming to the big city to try himself in one of the big teams. He is superbly supported by John Batchelor as the local gangster Tini. Beware of these two. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
