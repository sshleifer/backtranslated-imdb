This film was shot in 1948, but today it rings true. Very, very funny. Everything starts with the fact that the family wants to buy a small place in the country, and “builds” from there. Anyone who has ever built a house will find this film very cute. Great cast. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are amazing in this film. This is a classic black and white film that reflects the great style of the 40s .... clothing, architecture and family life. Many refer to the cost of things, and these comparisons with today's costs are amazing. I can not imagine that someone did not enjoy this movie completely. I am surprised by the number of middle-aged people who have never heard of it. This is a classic.
