This is the best movie ever created. This is a masterpiece that caused me to tear. I will never forget my viewing experience. I don’t understand why people don’t think like me. The dinosaur turns into a performance reminiscent of De Niro in Mad Bull, Pacino in Scarfeis and Crowe in Gladiator combined. It should be released on DVD in Superbit format so that I can fully enjoy it, as if it was intended when they produced and filmed it. Wuppi Goldberg truly turns into the idea of ​​life as a tough, stern policeman who, against her, teamed up with a hot dinosaur as his partner, and then at least a high-jinx. By the way, I say that the exact opposite of what is true is nonsense.
