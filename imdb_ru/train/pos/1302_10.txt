So often the band gets together for a re-gig only to find that they simply can't get together. This is not the case. This concert is a stunning brilliance from start to finish. These three musicians obviously gathered in advance and conspired and planned what was needed so that it would not be just a nostalgic blow to satisfy someone's ego. This is obvious from the very beginning, even before they took the stage. Many people in the crowd were not even born when these guys first performed. From the first song, they capture that old magic that was Cream, 3 people, 3 tools, without fuss. Clapton, by his own admission, said that he had to pull himself for this concert, because there were no keyboards, synthesizers, etc., therefore we can see it at its best. Ginger Baker demonstrates why so many drummers today speak of him as some kind of drumming guru. Jack Bruce is great. They really managed to collect the magic that will stand the test of time for many years. This is 10 for me.
