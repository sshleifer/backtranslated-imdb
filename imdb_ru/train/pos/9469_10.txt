In “Real Life” there is a scene in Dan where a family fights to determine which gender can complete the crossword puzzle first. The answer to one of the clues is Murphy's law: everything that can go wrong will go wrong. This is exactly the case when Dan Burns (Steve Carell, office), a columnist for the local newspaper. Dan is an expert in providing advice for everyday life, but he concludes that his picture is not so perfect. Dan in “Real Life” perfectly captured these ironies of everyday life and managed to embrace comedy, tragedy and beauty. Also, this movie is pretty darn funny. <br /> <br /> The death of his wife forces Dan to raise her three daughters on her own ... each daughter has her own life stages: the first is alarming to try out her driving license, the middle one is in the youthful yearning phase, and the youngest is in early childhood. With Dan, things change when he goes to Rhode Island for a family reunion and stumbles upon an intriguing woman in a bookstore. <br /> <br /> Her name is Marie (Juliette Binoche, Chocolate), and she is looking for a book to help her avoid embarrassing situations ... that is exactly what is in the store when they are thrown into the family of the Burns family. <br /> <br /> If you saw Steve Carell in the Office or Little Miss Sunshine, you would know that he is incomparable with comedy time and a very dynamic actor. Steve Carell is great at capturing all the emotions of family life: disappointment and sincere compassion. The family, as well as the house itself, create a warm atmosphere for the film, which contrasts with the internal turmoil that accumulates throughout the film, and finally broke out in a rather tense climax. The film falls short of some predictable results, but at the same time, life consists of irony and predictability, which in itself is irony. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life is definitely worth a look for the sole pleasure of watching all the funny subtleties that we often miss in everyday life, and I will most likely enjoy it a second time or even a third time. Just "put it on my tab."
