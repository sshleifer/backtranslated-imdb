Damn, it's so hysterical! Why aren't American comedies written like that? For those who consider the comedy to be stupid - in six episodes of this series there is more mind and intelligence than in the shelf of novels! Hugh Laurie - a complete cry. I could not believe that it was the same guy as House! There are so many great lines and jokes in this series that you can watch every show dozens of times and learn something new every time. Rowan Atkinson is jolly, as verbose, and wears on the butler Edmund. This is my favorite from the entire Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson is as beautiful as Baldrick’s somewhat stupid heart of the series “The Depressed Mass.” Some of my favorite lines are: “When someone messes up Wellington, he really puts his foot in it,” and Baldrick explains how he got his name and cousin McAdder, the “best seller-hunter” and killer of a fencer from Scotland.
