This is one of my favorite Govinda films of all time and the best film of 1994. David Dhavan copes well with the direction of this film, makes it funny and adds family drama. Govinda is superb as Raja Babu and gives an excellent performance. Karishma Kapoor is an actress I hate, this film is a little less annoying, but still annoying in some scenes. Kader Khan is a maestro in acting, and at the same time he performs brilliantly. Aroona Irani is amazing as a mother and gives outstanding performance. Shakti Kapoor is gorgeous as Nanda's helper. In this film there is a comedy, an action movie, family drama and romance.
