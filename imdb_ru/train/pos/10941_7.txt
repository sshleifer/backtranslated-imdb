At first, I was worried about the idea that Sarah Silverman would arrange her own show. The films in which she starred were not very funny, and her humor was a little crazy. However, I was very surprised to see her true colors shining in this Comedy Central gem. I could put her on a par with Amy Sedaris in the movie “Aliens” with Candy - Sarah’s character is a real sociopath, very comparable to Jerry Blank Sedaris. <br /> <br /> The only downfall of this show is the cast. Her sister's character is good; From time to time is funny, but ultimately meant not stealing Sarah's show. However, the rest of the cast is extremely inconsistent. <br /> <br /> However, I am glad that Comedy Central gave Sarah a chance to show her unique and insane sense of self-esteem and humor.
