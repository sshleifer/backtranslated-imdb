I completely disagree with other comments posted in this film. For example, the film is based on a book, and if the writer had a gay character, then how “Hollywood” could simply add a symbolic gay to the film. And besides, there were two funny characters, and I thought they perfectly reflected each other. One was normal and the other was more feminine, but it was not too much. And Diane Keaton gave a great idea, and if another reviewer had the decency to watch the whole movie, they would see that her character developed in the film, interacting with other characters. For example, when he and Adam went to look at the car in which Sarah broke in a landfill, you saw her mother side, and later in the film you saw that she was also invincible. But I think that if you are too concerned about gays and characters who have flaws, then this film is bad. But if you are more unbiased, and I don’t know if you have any thoughts about what is good, then you will like this movie.
