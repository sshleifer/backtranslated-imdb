This is one of the first independent films I've ever seen. For such a very low budget, this was done well; as insomnia, I can sympathize with the main character, although my sleep problems have never been so intense and disturbing. <br /> <br /> A well-staged, well-played plot that I have not often seen in cinemas, lighting and staging both are ideal for filming. There are a few noticeable nonsenses, but they can be intended; You will see after watching the movie. The film is very personal and worth watching twice. No film is perfect, but the Hollywood version cannot make the story better. only 8/10.
