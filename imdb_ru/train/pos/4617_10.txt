I have been a fan of Jennifer Connelly since the Phenomena, and after I heard about seven minutes in heaven, I saw it as soon as I could. The film is not just a comedy, if you think that many of these things that most of us have experienced in childhood, and are currently experiencing not only that the movie was terrific, led by the phenomenal Jennifer Connelly, he caught my attention, that this film was badly written by the director and it was a good deal that was playing, I loved it and watched it again and again, and for those of you who like to laugh or love Jennifer Connelly, you canâ€™t postpone watching this movie !!!!
