As the jacket says, this film is “Superbly Shot and Masterfully Edited,” and, yes, it is fascinatingly beautiful. The timelessness that we feel in the stoic stone and in the incessant ebb and flow of water frames the ephemeral works from the hands of Goldsworthy, so that in their ephemeral nature they point to eternity. <br /> <br /> And so the beauty of his writings pursue us with a slight interweaving of melancholy or Matthew Arnold’s words from Dover Beach: <br /> <br /> Listen! You hear the rumbling shingle of the Pebbles, which the waves recede, and rush, Upon their return upward in high spinning, Start and stop, and then start again, With a trembling rhythm of deceleration, and enter the Eternal Note of Sorrow. br /> <br /> Once at the end of the film, Goldsworthy says that "the words do their job, but what I do here says a lot more." Being a master of words, I do not take offense and never for a second consider him immodest, because the combination of form, time and changes, as well as texture, color and composition, which Goldsworth diligently and intuitively creates, is really something more than just say the words. <br /> <br /> At another moment, he says: "What is to stay here and what is not." This is his topic. <br /> <br /> I think that artists in the twentieth century were acutely aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast space of cosmic time; and therefore they began to reflect this understanding, writing works that were intentionally ephemeral. The idea was that, emphasizing how short-lived even the most powerful works of people, you can express the feeling of infinity of art. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, part of the effectiveness of Goldsworthy work lies precisely in this. expressions. He painstakingly makes up some form of straw or leaves where it reaches a tide, or places it in a river, where it will be swept away; and in this process, both the composition and its ephemerality merge. <br /> <br /> Both temporal and timeless are necessary for understanding our world and our place in it. And it is important that these works are carried out in the context of nature, so that what consists is within the limits of what is natural. Thus, the walls of stone and eggs of stone that Goldsworth builds are silent and durable, but we know that they are not monuments of eternity, but instead will remain for some indefinite period of time, and then scatter and return to a state like the one that existed before we came along. <br /> <br /> This is art, as art should be, akin to spiritual. <br /> <br /> In a sense, the work of Goldsworthy is a vague understanding. It is an experience of pure time and form. In a sense, his work "responds" to Shelley's famous poem "Ozymandias", saying that even when the flow washes away all the work, and even when the river disperses the expression, art continues to live thanks to our experience. In the same way, we think of Tibetan sand paintings, which are so carefully drawn up and extinct, and then, just as they are so beautifully and preciously trimmed, they are given to the wind so that we can know that all this is a flow. <br /> <br /> However, in the modern world, these works of art are transferred to photos and videos. Goldsworthy is an experienced photographer (of necessity, I would say), and all his work, even unsuccessful, he says, is photographed so that he can look back at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has achieved and what he does not have. <br /> <br /> This cinematic production, filmed by Thomas Riedelsheimer with Fred Frit’s beautiful and worthy pursuing music, cannot be missed. This is one of the most beautiful documentaries I've ever seen, and one of the most spiritual.
