It breaks my heart that this film is not properly rated. he is greatly underestimated. people have forgotten what films really are, nowadays they only think about movies that can be watched with popcorn and friends, for example, transformers, films targeted at super megapolis, for example, 300 million or even more, special effects only and which are dumb movies without a storyline. This is the movie I watch the most. Of course, it’s interesting to watch very well done CGIs, but we don’t get anything substantial from this kind of films. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that the performance was excellent. Philippe, especially busy, along with Erica Christensen and Victor Garber (whom I respect) made this film worthy of an Oscar. Busy Philipps' emotional performance was astounding, so disgraceful that we won’t see Oscar in her hands, which she deserves.
