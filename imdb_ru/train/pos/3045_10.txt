This is undoubtedly one of the funniest films ever made. Amitabh, like a village beetle, Arjun Singh, cheerful. The best thing is that laughter never stops. The plot is the same old same old story, where the child is separated from the mother, who sacrifices everything for her duty — with a happy reunion at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sasha Kapoor), and there are foxes (Parvin Babhi), and there are lovers (Smith Patil), as well as a blind brother and grandfather, added for good measure. But this film is about Amitabha, and that’s all you remember at the end. <br /> <br /> Amitabh comes to the city to earn a living, and his dialogues and fun manners. Later in the film, he turns into Angry Young Man, for which he is known, but the humor remains. The memorable parts include his walking, speaking and speaking in English, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and all with his dadoo. <br /> <br /> In general, I was rolling with laughter during the film. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at its best, this is it. This will easily give him 10/10.
