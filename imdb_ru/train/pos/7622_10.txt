I love this show! It's like watching a mini-movie every week !!! The first episode was so exciting and frightening ... like part 2 of the pilot ... I will definitely continue to tune into this show! This is a real Survivor! I looked through a few other comments and I see that already after one or two episodes the idiots here are already wolves crying ... Sorry if this is not just another reality show, kids! There was one time when you were ... now get ready! Current TV shows! And this one is actually good, unlike most crappy comedy shows today, or a bounced copy of Law & Order copies, or the NYPD Blue series or CSI, which they release ... See for yourself to form your own opinion, don't you take one of the bones here!
