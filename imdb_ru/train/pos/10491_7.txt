A delightful tender comedy gem, until the last five minutes, which degenerates into a mill of British television farce. The last five minutes cost me 2 points in my ranking. Despite this serious lack of plot and style, itâ€™s worth looking at the characteristic game and the unique setting of Cornwall. A lot of beautiful little pieces that you can enjoy, such as a tense eternity that we all experience, awaiting bank approval after the clerk steals a credit card ... making it more piquant when we are not quite sure that the card is not maximized.
