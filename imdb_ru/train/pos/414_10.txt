Cecil B. de Mille really knew how to create a classic, and after 7 decades his western looks like a real McCoy, exciting, interesting, exciting; by no means outdated. <br /> <br /> Being a real fan of DEADWOOD TV, Iâ€™ll tell you about the performances of Gary Cooper as Will Bill Hikak and Jean Arthur as Calamity Jane. /> <br /> We no longer have giants in Hollywood. PLAINSMAN is just one of dozens of classical works of the decade of 1936-1945, which for decades after a decade experienced a constant commercial life: released, reprinted, reissued again and again. Filmmakers like Spielberg, Jackson, Bruckheimer today, like children playing in a sandbox. None of today's films will be found in 7 months, not to mention the 70s.
