I can agree with other comments that there was not a huge amount of the story discussed in the film, but it was not a documentary! It was supposed to be entertaining, and I think it worked very well. <br /> <br /> I agree with the black family. The scenes with them seemed out of place. As suddenly, it would have been added, but later I understood the story and the connection between the families and found it quite good. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it was not a re-production in the 60s, it revealed very large and important landmark periods of the decade. I found it very interesting and worth my time to look.
