I have to start by telling you how I came across this movie. Alaska in 1990 was winter time. My friend from Australia stayed with me and my girlfriend in the apartment shoe box. Winter in Alaska can be a bit cruel, and most people stay indoors, drink a lot and watch everything that comes on TV. I found this film outside a charity store, lying in a snowdrift, and was immediately new, it was a treasure. the worst worst movie ever. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drank like a fish. In fact, we watched it so many times that sometimes we turned the TV on its side or upside down to get a fuller filling effect. This is a real gem. Laughter will never stop, and memories will last forever. If you see this movie in a video store, steal it. You will not regret it!
