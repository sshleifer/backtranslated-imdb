SPECIAL DAY (Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada, 1977). <br /> <br /> From time to time you come across a film that really touches your nerves. This one offers a very simple premise, almost perfectly executed in all respects and incredibly moving at the same time. Surprisingly, “Una giornate particles” Ettore Scola is relatively ignorant, even hated by some critics. Time Out calls it "rubbish", and Leonard Maltin is somewhat softer, "nicer, but more trivial." I do not agree, not only because this film is very touching, but in its simple story it shows us more understanding of everyday life in fascist Italy than most of the films that I have seen. The cinematography is obviously messy, even a bit soft, and the storyline is straightforward, which may explain the relative unpopularity of the film. Considering that viewers of the late 70s were not spoiled by great Italian films, it is even more strange that critics did not like this film very much. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a ten-minute collage of archival materials. after Hitler’s visit to Italy on May 8, 1938. Against this background, we first meet Antonietta (Loren), a lonely, loving housewife with six children in a Roman apartment building. One day, when her Beo escapes, she meets her neighbor Gabriele (Mastroianni), who seems to be the only one in the building who does not attend the ceremony. He is educated, cultured, and soon she attracts him. Throughout the film, we hear a fascist rally on the radio concierge, screaming in the yard. Scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the process. After the opening scene, the camera moves around the courtyard of the modernist (at the time hypermodernist) apartment building, apparently looking for our main characters, whom we have not yet met. <br /> <br /> Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in two major roles, all the more surprising because they are completely opposed to the type. Born in Canada, John Vernon plays her husband Lauren, but he is only on screen in the first and last scene. I believe that his voice was dubbed, because he is not of Italian origin and never lived there, as far as I know, so I can not imagine that he speaks Italian. If his voice was dubbed, I did not notice it at all. On the contrary, he is completely believable as an Italian, even more than other actors. The story is simple, but extremely effective, the performances are outstanding, the ending is just perfect, and the framing does not look too pretentious, but it works completely. Do not miss this one. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
