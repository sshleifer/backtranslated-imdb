I do not give out ten star ratings easily. The film really should impress me, and Born's ultimatum went far beyond that. In addition, this trilogy has developed so well that I consider it one of the greatest trilogies of the cinema of our time. Although all three films could no longer differ from the novels of Lyudlum, they are still an important milestone in cinematic achievements. Born's ultimatum made me cry that the series was complete, but I could not even try to stop smiling for hours on end. <br /> <br /> From the moment the introductory title appeared, I knew that we were in for a trip. Paul Greengrass did it again. Everything that we love from previous films about Borne is here again: action, dialogue and, of course, a shaky camera. However, for me this last one was never a problem. I think it adds uncertainty. <br /> <br /> I’ll come back to this film several times before it is released on DVD, simply because it’s brilliant. This is quite a satisfactory conclusion, and he must stand the test of time as a fantastic film and, in general, an unforgettable trilogy.
