Let me start by saying that War, Inc. is not a cup of tea for everyone. This, however, is very nice (and makes you wonder - “Oh, shit”). The comedy about the film is not quite obvious - it is quite thin (Tamerlane's tanks, dry cleaners, etc.), and it changes depending on the plot turns. <br /> <br /> I can only be one, but I will not compare it with "Grosse Point Blank" because it is different. John Cusack - I would not say that he is “magnificent” or “magnificent”, but he was good. On the other hand, his sister (Joan Cusack) was incredibly good in her roles and comedy time - although she was hardly in the film (I would say the same about Ben Kingsley). <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei plays a convincing reporter and copes. Hilary Duff is very commendable for her role as pop star from Central Asia Yoniki Babiya. Duff's development as an actress is very noticeable in the film, and she does a very good job (although her accent is a little fake). <br /> <br /> In general, the film is what I would call “entertaining”, It doesn’t have a certain storyline, and sometimes it’s pretty silly, but it has a subtle message. I would say it's worth a look.
