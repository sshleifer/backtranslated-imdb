Hey, people, what happened. This is me man, the only Mike "Sonny Sakura Killer" Kelly. You know ........ you cannot write a review of Sakura's script, because we did not have it there. As far as I know, the story was just made up as we walked together. I had the best time in my life when I was filming this movie, and I smelled so badly that I ended up with Jism ........... fun times. So glad you all liked the movie. I really could not do the fights that I envisioned. Every time I set up some moves, the director of the battle kept changing them. Nevertheless, I was delighted and met some really wonderful people. Especially the purple ninja woman who seems to be on the stage of filmmaking.
