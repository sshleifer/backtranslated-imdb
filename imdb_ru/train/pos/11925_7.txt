Once I accidentally caught this movie by telegram. I have to admit that I have never been a big fan of baseball, but sometimes I can get into a good sports movie. What seemed more interesting to me was the description of the system of foster families. As a therapist who saw both good and bad in the psychiatric and educational system of the community, I was quite pleased to see a film that shows both the ups and downs of this system: people jump from family to family, parents do not always take an active part and transitions that can only be heartbreaking and melting in the heart. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the presenters of this film, and both bring very believable performances. Perhaps it was just my emotional state, but I did shed a tear at the end of the film.
