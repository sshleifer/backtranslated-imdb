Another comedy about a bold little country that fights in the jungle of the modern (for the forties) global world, in which they only hint at sharpness, is an excellent entry in the Ealing gun. Terry-Thomas, as usual, gleams in the role of leader, as a helpless servant led to the brink of disaster, when the country for which he supposedly answers is beginning to attract the interest of the whole world, Ian Bannen makes a great romantic leadership, Peter Sellers adds one of his quieter speeches as a corrupt politician, and the ruthless John Le Mesourier plays against the type as a stormy revolutionary leader. Everything is fun, especially the viewer; perhaps not at the very top of the Elinga classic of Eling, but rather high.
