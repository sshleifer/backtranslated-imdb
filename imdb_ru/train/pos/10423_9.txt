Yes, "Be my love" was the rapid success of Mario Lanza and is still popular today. His voice was strong and even, so powerful that MGM decided to use it in the "Great Caruso". Lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of Caruso. After reading the book of Kostelanitsa, who wrote a biography of the Lanzians, he explains that the constant practice and vocal lessons became Caruso's visionary for the Lancians. There is no doubt that Lanza did a great job in this story, but the story is not entirely true; it's Hollywood's fault! I practiced singing his songs a few years ago, and I became good enough until I lost my voice because of emphysema / asthma ten years ago. Reaching the high note “Be my love” is not easy; but beautiful!
