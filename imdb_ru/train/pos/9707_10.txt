About a year ago, I finally gave up on American television. I was thinking about completely abandoning television until my friend, who lived in England, showed me several programs, including Office, Extra, Black Viper and League of Gentlemen. Then I decided to switch to British television. Among all the above-mentioned TV series "League of Gentlemen," perhaps the darkest and perverted of all, with guilty laughter and material, which was not in any other comedy that I saw. Among the characters is the most miserable married couple, the butcher who puts the ingredients into meat that is unsaid (probably for the better), the abnormal couple who looks at the local store that serves only the locals, and the worst vet in history. This program is one of the best I've seen.
