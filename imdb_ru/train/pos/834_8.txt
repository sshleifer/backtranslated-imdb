Dark comedy? Hangman humor? How to make a comedy from the murder? This can be a risky business, as the viewer must give up his moral values ​​and laugh at the antics of the person who kills people. Thus, the story must be solid with a good feature of suspended reality in order to make it work. So, Pierce Brosnan, the Irishman’s answer to question 007, now sounds like an alcoholic, addicted to smoking chains, who kills people for the sake of life and experiences a crisis of life. He meets a struggling businessman, Greg Kinnear, and after a hard start, he learns that he needs a friend. But Greg is happily married to Hope Davis, and Brosnan sees in him the main things he does not have: love, home, and life. Add a character actor, Philip Baker Hall, as a hitman’s manager, and we'll go racing. Brosnan is surprisingly rude and rude as an anti-hero, and Kinnear is delightful as his colleague is a very human businessman. Hope Davis adds brilliance as the very ordinary wife Kinnear, who is fascinated by this abandoned man who plunges into their lives. The finale is amazing and with some surprise. You have to leave the theater, feeling at least partly well - if you are able to stop being terrified of killing people.
