<br /> <br /> What can I say? This is one of the most advanced films in history. This is a return to the brilliant romantic comedy of the 1940s, but with a modern touch. The script explodes with wit, charm, humor and tenderness, cinema is breathtaking (New York has never looked so beautiful), and, of course, there are Cast! Dudley Moore performs his career as Beloved, drunk Arthur Bach. He is also thoughtful and real ... one of the best lines of the film is its sharpness: "Not everyone who drinks is a poet ... some of us drink because we are not poets." Great Sir John Gilgud received the honored Oscar for his great game as Hobson, valet and caretaker Arthur. Although he considered it the role of “take the money and run,” he brings to the hero all the talent, experience and skill of an experienced tragedian and a cunning comedian. The cast also came out of this world, from the cheeky grandmother Geraldine Fitzgerald to the pompous mafia Steven Elliott. <br /> <br /> The score is also extremely memorable and perfectly complements the film. The only real problem with the film is that its unfortunate sequel spawned it.
