This film, adored by critics at the time, but loved by fans, has now become a classic. Supposedly mixing “surrealistic” shots taken at the home of John Lennon among other places, with live shots of Mark Bolan and T.Rex at his best, this film is not just necessary for everyone who liked Mark Bolan, but gives a fascinating insight into the era. <br /> <br /> These were times when Mark was addicted to such things as Ringo Starr from the Beatles [who led him], and you can even find a short clip from one Reg Dwight [Elton John to you] beating ivory in the amazing [and never officially released] version of Tutti Frutti and the rock and ballad versions of Children Of The Revolution. <br /> <br /> There are also great scenes featuring Chelita Secunda [they say she “created glam rock” using her brilliance, etc.], Mickey Finn and even the actor from Catweazle !! <br /> <br /> The best scene for me is in the garden when Mark leaves the dining table, sits cross-legged in front of the string section and knocks out acoustic versions of the classics such as Get It On and The Slider. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended! FIVE stars [out of five]. <br /> <br /> Rory
