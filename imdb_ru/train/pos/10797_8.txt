Composed, graceful Carol (amazingly played by beautiful Rebecca Brooke), her sweet husband Eddie (cute David Houseman), stupid Carol, constantly eating her best friend Anna (delightfully composed by the infectious comic zeal of charming Chris Jordan) and wild Anna Love husband Pete (typical lovely Eric Edwards is a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy frequent group sex with each other. Their usual routine is broken when the lonely, depressed, but still inviting widow, mother Jennifer (wonderfully touching work of the beautiful Jennifer Wells) comes to visit. Pretty soon, Jennifer weakens and becomes a willing participant in the carefree and carefree carnal lifestyle of the swingers, where everyone except Carol wants to seduce her. Writer / director Joe Sarno comes up with a sharp, exciting and insightful study of suburban anxiety and the limitations of the entire sexual revolution of the wild and simple 70s; Sarno reverses the traditional mores of the middle class on their heads and gives a bold and provocative plot between the mother and daughter even more. In addition, Sarno reveals equally top-notch behavior from the cast: Wells and Brooke are both exceptional, with excellent support from Edwards, Jordan, Hausman, Arlan Blue as the abnormal sex therapist New Age Shandar and Erica Eaton as a daring neighbor of Mrs. Fields Even better, all women are extremely hot and tempting; In particular, Wells seriously lifts the screen with his exquisitely sweet figure and smoldering erotic presence. Sex scenes are really hissing and quite frank, but never rude and tedious. Steven Colwellâ€™s bright, polished cinematography and the cheerful, melodic acoustic folk score of Jack Justice and on money are solid and effective. Recommended viewing for fans of Sarno.
