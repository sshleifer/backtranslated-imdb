I found “Still Crazy” surprisingly interesting, and not only for those of us who survived this turbulent era of rock of the 60s - early 70s. My 15-year-old daughter watches it with me every time I pull out a DVD (don't worry, it was only three times), and she loves it too. <br /> <br /> This is a really loving, sharp and cheerful bow to the era, and each actor hits his notes with perfection. This was my first acquaintance with Bill Nighy, and I am glad that his somewhat similar turn in Love in fact attracted him more attention. Bruce Robinson was unbelievable in the role of Brian, making it a reality that could be a caricature of the drug-damaged rocker stereotype. It was interesting to see that Robinson made a name for himself as a writer. <br /> <br /> I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after I first saw the movie, I ran into Billy Connolly at a local mall (he lived here at the time) and told him that was one of my five favorite movies of all time. He invited me to sit at the food court with him, and we discussed the film for a while. We even talked about the idea of ​​a remake oriented towards America before it was wise to deny it. Why bother with the original? <br /> <br /> My only problem with “Still Crazy” is that he was not very popular in cinemas, and too many people missed a wonderful experience.
