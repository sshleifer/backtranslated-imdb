I saw the second half of this film about a year ago, and was very happy to finally find it on DVD. I recently watched several reality shows on PBS on cattle breeding, etc. None of them came close to the story as closely as this film. Based on REAL reality, without shock, joyless, happy, tragic and informative, this film should be shown to students or anyone interested in life at an early age. A great game from the Rip Torn and Kontchaty Ferrell complements the well-executed scenario. The initial loan says that this was done through funds provided through the National Endowment for the Humanities. If this kind of commodity taxes could go, I would be glad to see more. I highly recommend it and encourage people to tell a friend if you saw it and enjoyed the movie.
