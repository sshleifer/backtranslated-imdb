I showed this film several times here in college, and every time I show it, the number of people watching with me grows exponentially ... in addition to the virgins, everyone I already showed, you MUST see it again! It takes some time to enter it, but by the end the whole hall screams, screams, screams, rewinds the scene many times, repeats the dialogue and just completely immerses itself in what is happening in the film, which Pia Zadora is in The Lonely Lady! Scene behind the scenes behind the scenes of the most ineptly shot, poorly written, horribly acting TRASH rushes at you in a full-scale attack, which is considered to be my most obscene thing that I own (considerable statement, friends). For me, nothing compares to 2 U, Pia ... and I don't think I'm the only one who ever felt it!
