The film was screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival entitled “Bring Your Will” on April 25, 26 and 27, 2001. The cinematographer uses techniques that complement the story. Even with the fall / winter background for the “real” and spring for the “flashbacks” there can be some difficulties with continuity. <br /> <br /> Regardless of whether the leadership is gay, the actors well depict novice relationships in real conditions; from physical abuse to each other to passionate lovemaking. At first, the story slowly draws you to the characters. But as the end approaches, you really care about where these guys will be next summer! You also want to know the sequel.
