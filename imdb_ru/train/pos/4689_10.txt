I completely agree with the comments so far. I remember this documentary as one of the most amazing and informative I have ever seen. As mentioned earlier, I recall that I began to look, thinking that it was just another exploration of nature — interesting, not necessarily special, but I was so wrong. Not only was the history of the colony incredible, but I remember that music was part of its appeal. If I remember correctly, these were the pipes of Native Americn (akin to the music at the end of “One Flew Over the Cook's Nest”). I was also looking for a copy. This should require monitoring anyone, but especially schools. It must be reprinted.
