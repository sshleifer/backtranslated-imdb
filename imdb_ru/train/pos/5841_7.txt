The history of peace-loving farmers and citizens fighting for land, water, law and order, as well as the respect and ultimate subordination of the long-established interests of cattle and their hired guns was better worked out in the early (Shane) and possibly later films There are a few good action films, and the overall layout of the story, with the exception of the disappointing finale, is well executed. Law and order and religion are rooted in the city, but the old order of cattle drives, cowboys and shooters still exists. The clash of the two takes place in a well-arranged ambush scene, where the townspeople go straight into the trap. Granger, a former shooter, plays a guy who is avoided by the very citizens who need his experience with weapons.
