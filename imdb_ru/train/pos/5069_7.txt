The film is more about Pony than about Gray Owl. It is also about Aborigines, Canada, the English, the aunt of the Gray Owl and the Nugget North Bay. Great story. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film, more like a book that raises interesting questions about cultural identities and values. The key scene is a gray owl, which recognizes its dishonesty before Pony and her reaction. <br /> <br /> A few comments about user ratings Note that user ratings are bipolar clustering on 5 and 7; it is not for everyone, but has strong followers. This film is underestimated and overlooked, but it will be noticeable for many years. In addition, few women watched the movie, but rated it higher than men. Was it sold properly? <br /> <br />
