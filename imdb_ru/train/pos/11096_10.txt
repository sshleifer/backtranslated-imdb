Based on Elmore Leonard, this is a brutal and intelligent fighter. History: a business person is blackmailed about three criminals. Roy Schieder copes well with the role of the protagonist, and he should pay tribute to John Glover, who plays a kind of naughty psychopath. I should note that the characters of the villains are very complex and interesting - something that is very rare in action movies. there are also some beautiful and sexy women - the most famous are Kelly Preston in the role of the young heroine Schieder. Vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as a prostitute who is associated with three blackmailers. I am glad to say that Ann-Margaret has not yet lost him - this lady is a real baby. Do not look at the speed of this movie. I really do not know what the public and some critics have against this film, but I propose to ignore them and watch this really exciting and undervalued film. You will like this promise. Recommended A +.
