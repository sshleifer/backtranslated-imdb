My grandmother bought me this film when I was 5 years old (I always love scary movies), and even then I liked it. The atmosphere is amazing, and the story is original and entertaining. I especially like the scenes where the RV is attacked in the desert. The rocks are really convincing for such a low-budget movie. Acting is above average for such films, and the music is terrible. This is definitely an incredible gem. I recommend it to anyone who likes these strange films of the late seventies, the early eighties, such as Alice, Sweet Alice, Poor Sweet Eddie, Nightmare, Hospital Massacre and Returning Aliens Deadly. Spawn. "Definitely a classic!
