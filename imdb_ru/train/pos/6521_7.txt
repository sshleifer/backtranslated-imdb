Taken in the context of the time when it was done, I found it a worthwhile film. Although the details can be “dramatized,” the general story was a great tutorial. In addition, I found spotters who I knew were really nice. Who could have imagined Ben Cartwright a mean guy? I will leave the rest of the star in place. As for the minor casting, there are a lot of nice acting characters in this film (as one would expect from a film made in the late thirties), but he appreciates Andrew Jackson Peavy's right hand. The perfect touch of comedy. Well shot, with beautiful ships and competent play throughout, I recommend it to anyone who has a taste for a small camp, or an eye on a two-period piece set at the dawn of America and made at a time when the Names are great pleasure.
