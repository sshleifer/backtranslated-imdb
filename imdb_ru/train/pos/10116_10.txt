An excellent and accurate film ... McGovern makes great efforts to investigate and document his letter, and it pays off. He is not afraid to tell the truth, although it may cause adverse reviews and comments from those who love stories to be clean, sweet and glossy. <br /> <br /> And again, McGovern cites Christopher Eccleston, albeit in the role he played in Hillsboro. I found this film as accurate, well-played, and well-represented, like Hillsborough, and I applaud McGovern for his sharp, non-apologetic writings. Great, my hat is off to the writer, the actors, the crew. A great movie!
