This movie is not your typical horror movie. It has some humorous humor and death scenes that can be kind of funny. I personally liked the movie because of its unusual humor. This is definitely not a super scary movie, which is good if you don’t want to be afraid and be paranoid. I liked the country boy and Lester's performance ... very believable. I think I'm going to dye my hair red like that Scarecrow girl — very cool! In any case, it is generally worth renting for a humorous and unusual horror.
