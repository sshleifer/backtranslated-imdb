I first saw the Frailty trailer in Yahoo Movies when I heard Stephen King praise him to the skies. In fact, I didn't want to see them, because I am a big fan of thrillers. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The game was excellent, especially from two young guys. I usually hate child actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton did a good job managing. It was beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> It is also necessary to note the turn of the plot. Three turns at the end hit hard and fast, and I did not expect them to appear. The last turn of the film, combined with the seriousness of what has just been revealed, makes me cold until today, even though I have watched the movie many times. <br /> <br /> A real gem
