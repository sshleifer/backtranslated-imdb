I loved watching it. I had no idea that this was part of a larger series. I should have been 6 or so at the time it was on TV. I just thought it was funny, and for some reason I had a deep admiration for what was clear in the pile of presidential bathroom toys. My parents shot it on television when it was originally broadcast on NBC. On the tape was even an advertisement for old Sanka coffee along with several others. I plan to return home soon and try to write the tape to my computer so that those who want a copy can do it. If any of you would like to contact me, I think that you can do this through the IMDb website, do not hesitate. I will keep you informed and let you know when I have a digital show.
