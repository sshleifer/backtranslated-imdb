Iâ€™m sure I would like to see the resurrection of the renewed Seahunt series with the technology that they have today, and this will give me back my childhood excitement. I grew up on a black and white TV, and Seahunt with Gunsmoke was my hero every week. My vote for the return of the new sea hunt. We need to change the pace of television, and it would work for the world of underwater adventures. By the way, thank you for such an outlet, to watch many points of view on TV and a lot of movies. So I think I have what I want to say. It would be nice to read a few more pluses about sea hunting. If my poems were 10 lines, would you let me imagine or leave me alone? in doubt and ask me to leave, if this is the case, then I have to go, so let's do it.
