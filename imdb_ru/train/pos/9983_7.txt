This film is about human relationships and interactions between them. The main character is an old woman who, in the twilight of her life, begins a journey into her past, analyzing how she lived her life. This journey is accelerated due to the economic crisis of the son and his intentions to put her in a nursing home. This is a very honest look at some of the questions that we all ask ourselves at a certain point in life, and there are many secondary ideas in this film, such as family heritage, true love, marriage, or destiny. Although there is nothing new about this type of movie, it may be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas. The actors played a good role, and the characters are very plausible, but due to the fact that some characters may not be fully developed. I highly recommend this movie for a quiet Saturday afternoon.
