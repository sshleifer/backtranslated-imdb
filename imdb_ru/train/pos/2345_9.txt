I really enjoyed the first episode and am looking forward to more. A little gently on the front of the crime (it's almost an afterthought, not terribly tense or pretentious), but the idea of ​​a romantic perspective was wonderfully charming. Will look again for sure! <br /> <br /> I hope that they will have more roles for the aunt, who are wonderful actresses and who this time were not enough used. The actress who plays the assistant / waitress (I think also from Bewitched) is very sweet and playful, and turns out to be very stupid and sweet, and not stupid and annoying, which is very nice. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
