I rented this movie and watched it 20 times before taking it back to the store. Bill Paxton hired some top-notch talents to make a good thriller with some interesting twists and turns. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton both show good results. The story is told in an interesting way, with both memories 20 years ago, then with spots in the present, alternating back and forth. This style of narration makes a good thriller, which can not get boring. Bill Paxton, please make more horror films, you have a talent for this!
