Actually, I really enjoyed this show. As a child I was interested in all kinds of sports, including horse racing. It has always been difficult to make a series based on racing corruption, and at the same time get permission from the racetracks to record shooting on this controversial topic. One episode, which I especially remember, was centered around the horse, which is expected to win a big race that looked a little out of color. A syringe was found at the stable, and everyone thought he was a drug, but nothing was found in the blood tests. Too late, they realized that the horse was not doped, and the cartilage of the knee joint was removed. Like driving a car without oil and a dead engine, the horse broke down with tragic consequences.
