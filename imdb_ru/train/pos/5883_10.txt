I watched, fascinated and hypnotized, with vocals and physical play. The roles played by each character were excellent. Lyrics, words, every gesture, sunrise told about everything. The film spoke to me. This enlightened me to a different perception of a person who believes in humanity. Who believes in peace and gentle behavior. I was also in unbelief, victims and images of human dignity. Power without grace, crazy and without feelings. To desire power at the cost of humanity is incredible. This film made me so afraid for people who are no longer in this world. And with sadness, I think about them. I like this film for talking and facial expressions for all of this. May this film be blessed.
