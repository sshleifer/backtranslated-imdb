I have NOT seen this movie, but I have to. After reading all three books by Tora Heyerdahl (Kon Tiki, Ra, and Aku Aku), I actively look for a copy of this film. <br /> <br /> The thesis that Peruvians migrated to Polynesia is alive and well. Given that this crew did not have GPS, and only an old-fashioned valve (tubular) radio with a power of 6 W, their journey was at least heroic. <br /> <br /> Please reply to this message if you can Tell me where the copy of this video is located. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in buying it.
