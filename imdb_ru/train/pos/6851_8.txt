De Palma's technique reached its high maturity by the time this film was released, which is an excellent showcase of his classical techniques, although unfortunately, like in many films written by De Palma himself, the story serves as a meta-point more than interests to put forward an emotionally convincing story . <br /> <br /> The story begins with the CRAZY scene, in which Angie Dickinson masturbates in the shower, looking at her husband. Then she was caught and raped, while his husband forgetfully stands near ?? - and it all turned out to be Angie's fantasy when his husband shakes her mindlessly in bed. She has a short scene with her son, a dead melody for Harry Potter, which ends with a joke: "She will tell grandma that he is playing with her Peter." She then goes to a therapy session where she complains about her dead marriage before trying to seduce her therapist Michael Kane. He refuses, and it hurts her and she feels unattractive and dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Then, a bravura 22-minute, almost wordless sequence begins, which is perhaps the highlight of the film. Among the many things that De Palma drew from Hitchcock is the understanding of the film as a purely visual medium for storytelling. and in the typical manner of De Palma, he turns it into a way to show his formidable mastery. The problem, for me, is that in this case you begin to feel that the scenes are being overly delayed in order to further demonstrate the mastery of the director. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Angie at the art museum. She watches the strangers involved in sexual or family activities, then begins to wind up the man who is sitting next to her. De Palma very skillfully tells an extremely complex narration, without saying a word about Angie's attractiveness, embarrassment, retreat and, finally, searching and submitting to a stranger in the back of a taxi, and all this is surprisingly lush with Pinot Donajo, who also scored Carrie. <br /> <br /> In the second part of the episode, Angie slept with a guy and got up to return to her husband. Again, De Palma squeezed a ton of narration without saying a word of dialogue, as Angie realizes that she does not have panties, that her husband is already at home and undoubtedly wonders where she is, that she probably contracted a sexually transmitted disease and that lost my wedding ring somewhere randomly. This is all great, but the person begins to feel a little agitated when we are forced to do things like a long elevator ride down from the seventh floor, and then up again, almost in real time. <br /> <br /> ... Spoilers from here! When Angie reaches the seventh floor again, a big woman with blond hair kills her. The woman hacks her until she reaches the first floor when the door opens, and Nancy Allen sees her there. There is a remarkable slow motion sequence when Nancy reaches the elevator, Angie reaches for her, and the assassin blade is held ready to cut Nancy's hands. Then take a few shots while Nancy looks up and sees the killer in the convex elevator mirror. That's all well and by the time we have a dialogue again, you think; “Wow, that was just 22 minutes of purely visual narration!” Or maybe not, but I do. <br /> <br /> Junior Dennis Franz plays a big role as a sleazy and tough New York detective who would prefer everyone else to do his work for him. He interviews Michael Kane, making an outrageous assumption (although this sounds like a common occurrence) that Angie WANTS to be killed. Angie's son is there too, and he contacts Nancy, and they are going to spy on the therapist Kane and find out who the murderer is. <br /> <br /> Once again, there is a strong connection with Hitchcock’s movie in this case, Psycho (just like Obsession is a remake of Vertigo). You have a woman who we must understand as a secret whore who is killed in the first 30 minutes in a confined space, in this case, an elevator, not a shower. Then the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation, which shows that the killer is a man who dresses as a woman for murder. De Palma even adds a doctor at the end, which explains the psychology of all this. <br /> <br /> This is very interesting, but at the same time, the viewer may feel a little twitched, and this is my main reservation to this film. This is definitely an important viewing and demonstration of some of De Palma’s greatest stage productions, but the feeling that the story occupies a solid third behind De Palma’s need to show off and his somewhat obscene sexual fantasies makes it hard to look back on it from Hearts. <br /> <br /> --- See other reviews on my site about bad and cheesy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
