The story of four teenage girls who grew up in California. Gini (Jodie Foster) is the most balanced group, but she wants to leave her home, where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Kerry) addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad guys, and her father beat her. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has overprotected parents. Deird (Candice Straw) believes that she is more mature than the rest. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in what we have seen many times before, but there is one significant difference in this - it is exact, I finished high school in 1980 (when I first saw the film), and I was surprised at how realistic it was. They understood the dialogue, the dress and the relationship perfectly well. Even the main song of the film (Donna Summer's “On the Radio”) was a hit before it came out. This film impressed me more than any other teen movie of the time, because I could understand and understand the characters. I knew girls in high school who were like that! The film is (of course) dated, but it captures the time that we will never see again. <br /> <br /> The acting is good in every way, and Foster showed the best performance. The relationship between her and Kellerman (who was excellent) was realistic and well made. Even Scott Baio (who plays a small role as a friend of girls) was more or less realistic in playing with a teenage boy. <br /> <br /> A very good movie is a very important preview if you came of age in 1980. The film has a well-deserved rating of R (a lot of drug addiction and abuse), but all teens should watch. I give it 8.
