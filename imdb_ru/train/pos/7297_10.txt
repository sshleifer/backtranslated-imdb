I really liked this movie. The game was awesome, as was the plot. Jeff Combs has more talent than he believes. The only part of this film that I wanted to change was the ending. The death of this creature was too terrible for the Science Fiction Channel. <br /> <br /> There were several interesting religious posts in this movie. Jeff Combs obviously played the role of the Messiah, and the creature (or shark, if you will) represented the anti-Chirsta. There were some particularly frightening scenes in which this “doomsday” was felt. I noticed this only after the third viewing of this classic creature. I know that many people will not receive references to Christianity, but if you look closely, you will get it.
