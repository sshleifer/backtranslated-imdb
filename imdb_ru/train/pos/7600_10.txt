After I became totally addicted to Six Feet Under, I did not think that there would ever be another show that would be as good as this show. Well, I was wrong! Lost it is fascinating! I really love this show and can not turn it off. The richness of the characters, the subtleties of the plot, the beautiful setting - all this is amazing. I am completely and completely hooked. I donâ€™t know how the creators do it, but every character touches me very deeply. I feel their joy, their pain, everything, right down to my essence !!! I have no cable, so I shot a series on Netflix. When I put it on, I watch all the episodes at once and sad when everything ends. I can't wait for the next drive to come to my house. This is probably the best TV show I've ever seen !!!
