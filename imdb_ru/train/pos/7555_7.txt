Gender Bender is not interested in secret materials. This episode has an interesting premise, a good story, but a desirable ending. Gender Bender also makes his debut in The X-Files for actor Nicholas Lee, better known as Alex Krycek. In this episode, he plays Michael, a man who was attacked by one of the "Kindred". You need to see this episode to see the less exciting beginning of Nick Lee. An interesting thing about the "power of seduction" Kindred. When Marty does this with his victims, they turn to him. However, when Andrew seduces Scully, she is only because she is disoriented and sloppy, and does not appeal to Andrew. Maybe it's because Marty has more experience than Andrew. This episode reminds me of why it would sometimes be awful to be filmed in British Columbia. Throughout the episode, he is so wet, wet and dirty that it could not be so fun. Despite the disappointing finale, Gender Bender is still a decent episode to watch.
