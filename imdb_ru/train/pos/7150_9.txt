What a great movie! It is so reminiscent of the classic Disney family movies of the 60s and 70s. I was so pleasantly surprised after over the last 20 years of absolute detritus, Disney film crews came together live. <br /> <br /> This film is an absolute joy. The baby stars were just that; professional, high-quality actors. I was most impressed with the quality of this film. <br /> <br /> Sigourney Weaver was simply a sycophant *, inserted a hyperbole here *, she ran a prison camp for naughty boys. Siobhan Fallon was a wonderful star mother. <br /> <br /> I will not deny the story here, since it makes no sense to do it again, but the story is wonderful, the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was excellent! This job reminds you of what it means to be a child without becoming sweet or too gloomy. Deleted scenes presented in the DVD version are indeed best removed. They were too harsh for this film and would have taken so much from it. Although the finished product hinted at abuse, it was not openly shown to a certain extent. That was better. <br /> <br /> It was an absolutely amazing movie to watch. <br /> <br /> He gets 9/10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend:
