It's just such a joy to watch this intriguing project. So refreshing and learning. Not only a director who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes of screen time, but also an audience who may not be ready for such a big love in such a short time. <br /> <br /> 20 short All love films in Paris are unique, but some, as expected, stand out. I thought that the Tom Tykwer segment (Natalie Portman) was the best, although the mimes made me smile inside just the same. <br /> <br /> I clicked on the "spoilers" option for this review bus alas ... that you read enough spoilers. Just look. Do not read what I write, but watch a movie. <br /> <br /> And smile.
