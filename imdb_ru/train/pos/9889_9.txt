Read Eric's review again. He perfectly described my own feeling for this film as eloquently as I ever could. I am writing here only to encourage you to look and see it. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago on TV, I think, IFC. This is such a unique film that I do not dare to compare. It was filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere in the ruthless barren lands of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. This is not like Sedona Durango, Mexico (from the films of John Wayne), but a really harsh and wild place. I have to find a novel now to check the original location of the story. Like the location, this film is strange and wild, wonderful and strange, and absolutely not for everyone. This is a production that almost motivates me to study film. <br /> <br /> I have not forgotten this film, it is indelible. And yet over the years I have forgotten about its existence. I do not know anyone who saw it, never read about it and did not see any references to it. Erendir is such an unusual name, I even forgot the name. Well, now I want to buy a copy. <br /> <br /> ** I have since the aforementioned publication became a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and therefore I regret that I have not read it before. <br /> <br /> Regarding the MsMyth comment below; The film was shot in Mexico, but the author is Colombian and does not comment on Mexican or Mexican history, although Marquez currently lives in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm still desperately trying to find a copy of this film for my library. Liked the film? You have to read the story, and then everything else that Garcia Marcuse wrote. And by the way, the original place in history was Colombia.
