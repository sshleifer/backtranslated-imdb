This is a great example of what can be done in a small budget film. The acting game is gorgeous, considering the script, and the whole atmosphere of the film is very premonitory. The blood is well made and used sparingly (pay attention to the excellent death of the barbed wire), and the action when used is very sharp. It is true that in the script sometimes tricky lines, but compared to other films with the same (or big!) Budget, this is hardly noticeable at all. In general, it is recommended. Believe me, this is better than it seems! 8/10
