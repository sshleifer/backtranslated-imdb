I just turned thirteen when I first saw this series, and I watch it again on DVD more than thirty years later. Pictures on the opening credits never left me. It influenced my view of the world and the people in it. My parents were with me long enough to see the series with me, and we always discussed the program after that. It gave me a love of learning history and the highest marks I received in the open exams at our school! <br /> <br /> Sir Lawrence Olivierâ€™s voice and his performance are timeless and flawless. I have a feeling that people who have experienced this will feel that this is their version of the history of the Second World War. I can not imagine when I will be bored to look at it. Perhaps now one could think of a similar series of times of the Cold War, although it is difficult to imagine who could replace Sir Lawrence. <br /> <br /> Buy!
