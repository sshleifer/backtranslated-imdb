The handsome and dashing pilot of the British airline George Taylor (solid image of Gizeppe Pambieri) was beaten by bandits after a wild night in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with sweet and virgin Dr. Amy Wong (beautiful and charming presentation of the beautiful Chai Li). George regains his health and returns to work. When Amy does not hear from George for a long time, she falls into despair and becomes a prostitute. While the director / co-author of the film Bitto Albertini does provide a satisfactory amount of expected nudity and sexual sex sex, this film is nothing but a routine routine in mocking meanness. Instead, it is an amazingly thoughtful, touching and tragic love story between two well-traced and very attractive characters (Teas in the role of Amy Wong especially shine and fascinate). The picture begins sparkling and fun, but the tone is radically shifted to a darker and harsh mood by about two-thirds of the way. Amy’s descent into a vice after she falsely believes that George has abandoned her is sad and frustrating; also surprisingly sad and heartbreaking end of a break of surprise. Of course, the story is, of course, melodramatic, but never too stupid or stupid. Moreover, the sex scenes are pretty tasteful and even truly erotic. The notorious Italian porn star Cicciolina has a pleasantly significant base, like the jealous and relaxed secretary George Helen Miller. Polished Cinematography Guido Mancori offers many strikingly magnificent shots of exotic places. Niko Fidenko’s startled, throbbing score strikes a great place. It is worth looking for those who are looking for something else.
