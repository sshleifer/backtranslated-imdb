Zombie Bloodbath is a film created by zombie fans for zombie fans with real love for the horror genre. As I understand from the comments and the things I read, this was done during a huge flood in the Midwest in 1993, when half of Missouri was under water. The buildings were under water. cars and houses were under water. One article said that zombies and film crews from this film would help the sandbag after shooting every day. The fact that this film was made at all is a miracle. It’s like a huge rubbing of every zombie movie ever shot through a Troma filter. This is a party movie that can be enjoyed with friends who love a bunch of dirty and stupid characters. And it is fast, energetic and truly fun. <br /> <br /> An accident with a spill of toxic substances in a nuclear power plant causes people to melt or turn into zombies. The local government covers it, demolishes the factory and builds houses on it. Some displacement of land (?) Causes the development of the cave, and some new residents find the cave and release the undead in a newly built community. From there, it becomes just crazy, bloody and fun. <br /> <br /> I have read these reviews here several times. And it seems to me obvious that the same person thrice attacked this funny little movie like another reviewer, using fake names. They use the same words and sentences. Zombie Bloodbath is cheap. This is a raw material. He has a bad game. Just like half the movies. There is much more than this funny movie. If you hate this film so much, don't buy it. There is no need for personal attacks and call the team or make up the "Trailer Trash" And obviously, you are not from Australia or England. It is just sad that this wonderful IMDb service does not catch people using it simply to kill others. There are bad reviews and good reviews, and I do not mind. I give bad and good reviews myself. But it is painfully obvious that some fool just wants to use this forum to personally attack the director of this film. It's sad. <br /> <br /> Some of these so-called “Reviewers” ​​even basically sue their “reviewer” just to advertise their own films. One called this film boring — well, love it or hate it, but you can never say about this film that it is boring. He moves fast and is never dull. <br /> <br /> Oh, and this reviewer from the Netherlands ??? Um ... Liar. You tried to publish the same review on Amazon, and you pulled it there. SAME review, only he said it is from Missouri. <br /> <br /> This nonsense needs to be stopped. Love it or hate it - give a real review or do not print anything. Obviously, you have not seen movies yet. <br /> <br /> But I did it for recording, and although this film is not the best I have seen, it is far from the worst. And even in the worst case, I would give a real review and would not attack the director personally. <br /> <br /> I hope this review will help some people see through the stupidity that is happening here.
