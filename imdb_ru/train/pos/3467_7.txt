I still wonder why I watched this movie. True, before I watched this movie, I knew almost nothing about the Beatles. I didn't even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a lot of fans, they had several albums that, according to some, were the greatest in history, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono, and John was killed. <br /> <br /> Also, VH1 is not even my favorite music station, MTV. And yet, for one reason or another, I decided to watch it, without expecting much. Surprisingly, I really liked it! The dialogue was written and handled very well with a slight accent. This is very important because the conversations of John and Paul are almost the entire film, although they are taken out to explore more possibilities and keep you in sight. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn performed well on the whole. <br /> <br /> The ending was also very clever. I liked how the film inspires you to SNL, and then gives you a slap in the face and makes it clear that it would be better if they just let it go and ended up on a good note. My favorite moment is probably the touching scene on the roof. <br /> <br /> In general, I recommend this movie to almost everyone. This is a very good way to solve your curiosity about what could happen if, 6 years after breaking up, Paul only appeared on Johnâ€™s doorstep. Which is probably the main reason for watching this film, and I decided that in fact it was the Beatles and what could have happened to them after the collapse.
