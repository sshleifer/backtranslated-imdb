It was a delightful presentation. Gemo (blood) as a Greek god was so well played by animation with vanity, arrogance, snobbery and innocent amazement. The quote (or scene) that I vividly remember is when Chemo gets tired of "all this plumbing ... you never knew my secrets" and threatens to break out, the Scientist answers him with one word "Thalassa" - salty water that terrifies the Writer , but softens Gemo and so gently penetrates the chemical aspects of blood. <br /> <br /> Such a great combination of entertainment and information makes this classic as fresh and exciting today as on the day it was released. Stimulating interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching children to love to learn.
