When I sat down to watch the Largo Winch, I did not expect anything but fighting scenes and exciting cars. When I got up, I saw both of them; and much more. <br /> <br /> Karl Rodin was finally not the main character of the film. Kristin Scott Thomas played her role well, but the real two stars, in my opinion, were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manoilovich, who behaved perfectly. In Radivoye Bukvich well portrayed Goran. <br /> <br /> Mixed linguistics has brought a pleasant flavor to the film, but I understand why people are bored. <br /> <br /> Hong Kongâ€™s landscape, and especially the stunning Croatian coast, struck me both, and I barely wanted to look away from the screen when Largo entered an incredibly beautiful island. <br /> <br /> Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500 and BMW 7; if someone likes expensive limousine cars; This is their film. This is also a film for people who love action films, a good game, landscapes of great beauty, and, above all, a fast-paced, well-written action movie, with a dazzling battle and carefully woven internal drama. <br /> <br /> My voice as he enlightened the dark day: 10/10
