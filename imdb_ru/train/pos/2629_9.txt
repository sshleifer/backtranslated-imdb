I was not sure when I heard about this exit. I thought how dumb Disney becomes. I was wrong. I found it very well. I mean, this is not the Lion King, but it's cool to see the other side from a certain point. It was very funny. In addition, it was not one of those Disney sequels that were animation sucks, it was similar to the animation of the Lion King. The only thing that annoyed me was the whole movie in the cinema. Do not give anything, but you will understand what I mean. I also find it funny that it was cool to have most of the actors from the original come back. It was a very good movie for everyone.
