Nina Foch insists that "My name is Julia Ross" in the 1945 film Noir, which also starred Dama May Vitti and George Macridi. It is short, and because it is, the film suffers. This could last from fifteen minutes to half an hour longer. <br /> <br /> When I was growing up, Foch played on television, playing for a neurotic woman, a wife with a cheating husband, a nervous breakdown. She became one of the great acting teachers in Los Angeles. Here she is quite a young playing role, playing a major role. Julia responds to the secretary's announcement and immediately hires Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. Little does she know — although we will immediately find out — that the recruitment agent is advanced, determined to get exactly the woman who is suitable for this appointment, a woman without family and without a boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This is a living-in situation; as soon as Julia gets home, she gets drugs, and when she wakes up, she is told that she is Mrs. Hughes and she is not allowed to leave. <br /> <br /> The game is very good. Low budget, but still interesting - some things, especially at the end, happen too fast, so I said that the film is too short. However, I recommend it.
