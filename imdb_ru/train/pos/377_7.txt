The gentle, quiet drama from Steven Spielberg was his first real adventure in this genre. Departing from his usual adventure / fantastic fare, he paved the way for his 1993 success, Schindler's List. <br /> <br /> Based on a novel won by Alice Walder’s Pulitzer Prize, the story concerns a young girl’s arranged marriage. difficulties for the cruel, evil farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister, Nettie. Although the plot — about compassion, insult, and the power of love to heal all wounds — is often powerful and touching, it loses its way due to the continuity error and Menno Meyes’s scrambled script. “Purple” is sometimes difficult to adhere to, and in one or a few cases it tends to be slightly unstable with respect to the time frame. This scripting error cost the viewer the depth and detail evidently present in Miss Walker's novel. It’s a real shame that maestro Spielberg couldn’t identify and correct these problems, as most of the show is an excellent example of his skill as a director. <br /> <br /> There are strong performances everywhere, with Whoopi Goldberg debut - which she never encountered from an acting point of view - like the broken heart of Seli, who just wants to be loved. Danny Glover provides solid support, although his "Moses" was for him the best turn in "Places in the Heart." An outstanding show comes from unbridled Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia, a lonely, fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronizing, white upper class woman. Good support is also provided by Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Ray Don Chong. <br /> <br /> Quincy Jones (co-producer of Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall) composed an excellent melodic score, and also provided several original blues for the occasion. Editing from Michael Kahn sounds like always, while photography director Allen Daviau demonstrates unsurpassed mastery in capturing some of the magnificent southern landscapes. <br /> <br /> This true heart matter will surely make you cry, it's just a pity that we have so many unanswered questions left. <br /> <br /> Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - Videos
