Norman, is that you? was (this is all the third hand, so take it with a crumb of salt), adapted to the African American family from a Jewish one, when she made the transition behind the scenes and onto the screen. In addition, it was one of those films that were originally filmed in the video, so prints from the theater could not be so great. However, the performances of Redd Foxx and others were pretty good. <br /> <br /> I would like to tell all of you that this film is a PART OF THE PERIOD: it reflects the attitude of the middle and early 70s towards finding out that your family has a son or a homosexual daughter. For this reason alone, this is quite interesting - if not a small “Hollywood”. You do not trust me? Check the lines about curtains, etc. Very stereotyped. Not too deep. <br /> <br /> But ... the film really shines in several areas. There is a side split scene when Redd Fox tries to find his wife, who escaped with her brother (!) To Ensenada in enchanted Pinto. A telephone conversation across the border is really memorable. <br /> <br /> But ... the best scene in the film is when Weyland Flowers and Madame fulfilled their gay routine, which he did in gay bars and nightclubs. As far as I know, this is the only time the routine has been removed. And this is a slightly refined and much shorter version, I was told. However, this is a vintage Madame, and you can't miss it. People still steal lines from Wayland; the man was really gifted. Enjoy the movie!
