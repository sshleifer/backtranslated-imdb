Despite the fact that the actor's plot is occasionally shot and “saw everything before” the story, this is a pretty convincing film. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of time in it, scenes with a demon are actually quite creepy, some visual effects are excellent and, best of all, there is no funny humor that distracts from the movie because there are too many (imitators) horror in them now <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is not the best movie ever made, but in fact it appeals to you and, at least, tries to develop the character. <br /> <br /> I was glad I watched it
