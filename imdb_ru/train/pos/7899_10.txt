It was a great movie. I don't understand why so many people don't like it. There were so many things to connect with, so many beautiful images and so much compassion in what was not said. I was completely entertained, and I had a feeling of joyful abundance, like me, when I finish most of the stories about Tom Robbins. Now I have not read this particular book of Robbin, so I do not know how it coincided, but I can not imagine that this film could be a very bad interpretation. The film has left you a lot to define yourself, which is the best part of any Tom Robbins novel, coming up with details. <br /> <br /> To all of you who said that this is the worst movie, Iâ€™m sorry that little is left of the dim light in your hearts. Not the worst movie was glorious. Long live the American crane.
