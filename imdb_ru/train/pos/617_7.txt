Hello from the dark again. This one will be compared to the Princess Bride, and although it does not fit this classic, it is extremely interesting and well-made by itself. The storyline is a little strange, and the whole thing in the walls is never explained, but the penalty is good, even creating strong uncertainty. <br /> <br /> Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls in love with the wrong girl (Sienna Miller), and agrees to bring her a fallen star ... played by the great Claire Danes. There are not many expectations about what is happening with these two, but this tense role comes with an evil witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and Prince, son of King Peter O'Toole, who want to regain the ruby ​​necklace that our "star" wears . A lot of bad in pursuit of good. <br /> <br /> Meeting with the strangest pirate you see (including any of the Caribs) along the way. Robert DeNiro plays Captain Shakespeare - hard on the inside, and, let's say, in touch with his female side. Another meeting involves the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a fast-talking trader, which is good for a couple of laughs. <br /> <br /> Not your typical pursuit, legal age, or fantastic film, but directed by Matthew Vaughn ("Layer") Cake ") deserves an audience. Unfortunately, a bad marketing campaign will probably prevent her from making money. I think that it will have great success on video.
