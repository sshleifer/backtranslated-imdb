Reign Over Me (named after the song who) is a film that will surely cause a tear in everyone's eyes. It was a touching story about a guy (sandler) who lost his family during the attacks on the World Trade Center 9-11. Years later, he encounters an old college roommate (cheadle), whom he does not even recognize due to the post-dramatic stress caused by the loss of his family. They foment their old friendship, and Cheadle's character, Johnson, understands that he needs to help Sandler's character, Fineman, a little help, before it is too late. <br /> <br /> This was the first film that made me cry for a long time. It’s absolutely worth seeing, and seeing this, I’m sure the viewer will appreciate his or her family.
