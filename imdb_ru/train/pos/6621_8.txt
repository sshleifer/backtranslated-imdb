I just got back from previewing this excellent sci-fi movie. This style is definitely unique and very well made. He's shot with real actors, but turned into a black and white comic style you've never seen before. He goes one step further than the City of Sins, and does it well. This is a successful combination of French culture of comics and cinema. The story and mood are reminiscent of Blade Runner, and if you like this one, you will surely like it. The storyline is smart, never boring and has nice little twists and turns. This film is a must-see for any movie lover, except perhaps those who absolutely dislike science fiction or b / w.
