Famous was "famous" for his tension and style of release of cartoons, where the semi-main character is in terrible danger, and the hero saved him at the last second. This particular Casper is the only one I remember, where death actually takes a hand. But even in death there is still a happy ending. <br /> <br /> In Famous Studios cartoons, the constant reads: "Virtue always wins." Popey always gets to his spinach on time, Little Huey always overtakes the fox, Little Odery always "learns the lesson." And some FS cartoons are really dark and depressing. <br /> <br /> We must give them their due. As much as I love Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry, I donâ€™t think that someone produced a better animated product at the time than Paramount. Color, animation, music (great Winston Sharples), montage, voices. They were a consistent and vivid example of what art has to offer.
