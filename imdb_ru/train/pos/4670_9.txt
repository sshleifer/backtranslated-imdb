Those who remember only the late Sir Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or the professional raconteur would succeed in the search for this charming piece of satire from the late 60s. Ustinov plays a major role as a convicted embezzlement (we see him for the first time during his last day in prison, where he prepares a tax declaration of the prison governor), who, feeling that the future is computer, represents (through clever identity theft) intends to penetrate the American multinational corporation. <br /> <br /> Ustinov (who co-wrote the script) is in excellent shape, as is the amazing Maggie Smith, who is unusually played here as the unfortunate Cockney Sparrow Bob Newhart also plays an amusing role as Maggie Smith In addition, Karl Malden is contentedly untidy, like Ustinov and the boss Baba Newhart. <br /> <br /> What do I especially like about this movie? This is not only a well-thought-out film with capers, but also a touching love story; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing, since these two losers stumble upon love (the whole scene, including a deck of cards, is especially effective). <br /> <br /> So what's not to like here? Well, the script is no more computer-literate than most films (that is, almost none), even though it reflects quite well the feeling of the “iron” business of the late 60s. There are also a couple of small plot glitches that you can hardly notice before the second or third viewing, but I think these are minor flaws. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a movie that is worth looking for, and after you once saw it, you will want to see it again at regular intervals. <br /> <br />
