The first part of this infamous horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film, discovered by manufacturers and installed as an amateur video camera, complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame. It depicts a woman abducted by a gang of black-clad men who tortured her for several days before finally killing her. The unfortunate victim is brutally beaten and slaughtered with raw meat, and then her nails are pulled out with pliers, her arm is smashed with a hammer, a needle is punctured by the eye, etc. live burns to burns. The series was widely publicized when the American actor Charlie Sheen, believing that the series contains the real murder, tried to ban its distribution in the United States. An investigation by the FBI revealed that the films were only what they seemed to most viewers - sick recreation with the use of unpleasant, but obvious special effects. Awfully staged by the famous Japanese comic book artist Hideshi Hino, who also directed the third and fourth episodes, this film is the surest way to clean all but the most tolerant rooms. But, gorehnds will probably not find anything special.
