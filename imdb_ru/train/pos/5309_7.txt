The best thing about this movie is that it’s fun. He is full of humorous characters and interesting situations, starting with the nonchalant, innocent Pecker (played by Edward Furlong), who loves to photograph almost everything he sees in everyday life. Other great characters include Pecker's friend Matt (“he is a thief, but he is a really good guy”), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar) and Pecker’s Catholic grandmother, who discovers life in a statue of the Virgin Mary in her room. <br /> <br /> The film gently tells you that there is a lot of wealth in everyday life, and he succeeds in doing it without undue effort. When reporting on the value and dignity of “ordinary people”, there is always a risk that they will turn into something like “holier than you” - but Pecker avoids these pitfalls, allowing the audience to get a point, allowing viewers enough space to compare this message with own thoughts on this topic. <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie mainly because it’s so much fun.
