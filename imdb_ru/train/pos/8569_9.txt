This is as good as the original 101, if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with her outrageous behavior and outfits, and the film was probably made because the audience wanted to see more of Cruella. This time we see a lot more of it. I also like John Griffith as Kevin, a rather clumsy man. Using Paris as the climax of the movie was a smart idea. The film is worth watching at any age, if you love animals.
