This is one great movie! I played all the Nancy Drew games and read books, and I never expected the movie to be so exciting and fun! If you have never heard of Nancy Drew, read the first book (“The Mystery of the Old Clock”) so that you can “get used to Nancy, and then watch the movie, because they don’t represent characters in the movie”. names quickly. ;) All my family enjoyed it, and the plot was extremely interesting. This is the final return from previous Nancy Drew films, which the actor Nancy Drew did not seem to match. This film is very similar to Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. It's so cool! Nancy drew lovers, you should watch this!
