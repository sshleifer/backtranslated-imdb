The third and, in my opinion, the best of the Blackadder series. <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that there is no Lord Percy, who would be the funniest character from the previous series, but Prince Regent Hugh Laurie, respectively, is laughing insanely. line. <br /> <br /> As a package, this quality is right through with convincing sets of regency, excellent cutting sarcasm and small pieces of wacky, outstanding Macbeth actors and the impression of the chicken “happy us” of Prince Georges, and words from Dr. Johnson’s dictionary. <br /> <br /> Few comedies were as clever as they were funny, okay, strange flimsy observation or storyline, but mostly it's a scream.
