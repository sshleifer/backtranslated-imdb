I remember watching this movie at Radio City Music Hall when it came out. I didn’t really understand humor then, but this film can make me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> With all due respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Mattau really deserved an Oscar for this film. His performance is amazing - given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willy Clark. His manners are first-class. (“Do you know which songs he wrote? Sh * t!” And when he talked to a Spanish-speaking guy at the front desk: “No! No! No enchilada !!”) Absolutely funny! <br /> <br /> Kudos to Richard Benjamin, who played straight Mattaw. <br /> <br /> I just want it to be on DVD, because my recording on VHS is getting a bit older. <br /> <br /> It’s not interesting to see a remake with Woody Allen, because he can’t compare with the original.
