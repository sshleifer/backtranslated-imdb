Not sure what to expect from this film, given his amazing collection of stars and directors, but in the end he did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the main moments was the last episode with an American tourist. speaking with a terrible French accent (which made me feel better), which was actually quite touching and was a great way to complete the movie. <br /> <br /> The story of the medical assistant and the victim was very Moving and for the clean comedy the Cohen brothers and Steve Buscemi receive an award. Tom Tykwer's clip was also impressive, albeit rather ambitious in scope. <br /> <br /> However, the Bob Hoskins segment was completely unacceptable, and the vampire story was completely ridiculous. The dialogue in the Wes Craven section also looked very forced, and the story in Chinatown was completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is worth seeing from the good side and has a strong final. Viewing bad areas is not too painful - they still only last 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Ca vaut la peine !!!
