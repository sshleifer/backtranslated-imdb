This movie is just great. It's interesting from start to finish, you'll always be on the edge of your place throughout the entire movie. In my opinion, this film is greatly underrated by critics. <br /> <br /> Sly fits in perfectly with the role of a well-trained lifeguard from Mount Gabe Walker. With him, Michael Rucker looks great like Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances that I saw in him as a villain. <br /> <br /> And the fact that 75% of the film takes place in the mountains with a lot of bad guys on it is a place for many actions! <br /> <br /> Brilliant movie!
