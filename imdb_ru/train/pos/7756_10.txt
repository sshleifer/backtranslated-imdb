I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just a dirty fluff raised by performances and visual effects. Anyway, I'm sure I liked it. From the surprisingly tangled, dark, intertwining stories, to the delightfully sinister ideas of Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, to the bright, vibrant colors with which it is all imprinted, this is high-class trash, and it is very fun. Not to mention the funny tricky and thinly veiled sexual overtones that permeate the entire film, always threatening to break out of the image into a dialogue, but never doing so. I would have lied if I said that the value of an entertaining film did not affect my love for him, but behind an unintended (or not) comedy there is some kind of strange artistry, and I really, really, dug it up. I could really immerse myself in this melodrama.
