I saw this movie recently. After 2 hours I still have a headache with laughter. The plot was so horrible, the jokes were so bad, but I didn’t expect that: <br /> <br /> 1. 2 scenes before and after the movie in which Pat and Jay posed for (which caused more than enough laughter) <br /> <br /> 2. Blow through the windshield that beheaded the villain. <br /> <br /> This film is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and my copy was even accompanied by a disclaimer, which said that you didn’t like the film, send help to HBO. While I was thinking about it, you should have sent it in January 1991 (which also caused foolish actions).
