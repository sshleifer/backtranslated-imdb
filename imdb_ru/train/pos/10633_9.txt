This film is as unique as it is overlooked ... Another story is simply that you can find the ability to love if you have an open heart, as well as an open mind. I first saw it by telegram in the late 70s, and it really reflected the limitations of the gay community at the time. I believe that this film was ahead of its time in depicting a small piece of obscure lifestyle. This is truly a classic in the sense that it was the forerunner of what is now portrayed as an extended family. This film should be available on DVD / VHS so that you can not only learn about the unusual speeches of Meg Foster and Perry King, but also show how far we have come and what else needs to be done when it comes to relationships.
