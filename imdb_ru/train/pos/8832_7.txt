“Hey, Babu Riba” is a film about a young woman Mariana (nicknamed “Esther” in honor of a famous American movie star) and about four young people, Glenn, Sachet, Quiche and Pope, who are probably 15-17 years old in 1953 . Belgrade, Yugoslavia. All five loyal friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans or something American, as it seems. <br /> <br /> The relationship of adolescents is very close, and ultimately the victim eagerly comes to the aid of one of the group that has fallen into unexpected difficulties. After the change of communist politics, they separated and reunited in 1985 (a year before the film was made). <br /> <br /> I liked the movie with some reservations. The subtitles on one side were difficult. Especially in the beginning there were several dialogues in which there were no subtitles at all. Perhaps the conversational tempo demanded this, but I could not always read the text and perceive the scene at the same time, which made me not always understand which character was involved. I watched a movie (video from our public library) with a friend, and none of us really understood a part of the story about purchasing streptomycin for a sick relative. <br /> <br /> This Yugoslav film of adulthood effectively conveyed adolescents' invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal ties with each other. There is a main flash forward, and it was intriguing, forcing me to the end to guess who these characters are in relation to the throws of 1953 and what really happened. <br /> <br /> I would rate it 7 out of 10, and I would like to see other films by director Jovan Atzin (1941-1991).
