*** SPOILERS *** The half-blood Zach Provo, boiling for hatred and revenge, James Coburn, has spent the last 11 years in a gang planning his escape. What Provo wants more than freedom is to level the score with the man who captured him, and in the process, during a wild skirmish, killed his Navajo wife: the former sheriff of Pima Sam Burgad County, Charlton Heston. <br /> <br /> Fleeing after killing two prison guards, Provo goes to Yume, knowing that not only Burgada lives here, but also his younger daughter Susan, Barbara Hershey. Using his fellow escaped convicts to lure Burgadeh into the vast desert of Arizona, promising them $ 30,000 in gold coins that he buried there, Provo plans to achieve his bloody revenge on Burgada. But only after he witnessed how his daughter was brutally raped by his cellmates, or, without being with a woman for many years, as excited as a rabbit during the mating season! <br /> <br /> A brutal and very effective western that updates the classic 1956 John Wayne “The Seekers” when a father searches for dangerous Indian territory for his kidnapped daughter. Charlton Heston as Sam Burghade, guilty of guilt, in his logging, somehow responsible for the murder of Provo's wife, and then for having to face the fact that the same thing could happen to his daughter Susan, fine plays the role of an aging and retired sheriff. Charles Coburn as a vengeful half-breed, Zack Provo is also at his best as a man possessed with hatred and murder, avoiding the convict. <br /> <br /> The man who escaped from Provo is not really interested in his personal affairs, but he has no choice in that he knows the territory, as the back of his hand, but go with him. It’s just the thought that they come with Susan when Provo gives them the green light, as well as buried 30,000 dollars in gold coins that prevent them from parting and going their own way. <br /> <br /> Also Susan Hal Brickman, Chris Mitchum, goes along with Burgade, who ultimately proves that he is just as good as Burgad, who felt that he simply didn’t have it, just like tracking down criminals, and in the use of common sense, which in this case is not enough Burgade, at the same time. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS **** An incredibly cruel and blood-drenched standoff between Burgada and Provo is too much to put up with. Provo, who hates Burgada, bordering on right insanity, wanted him to endure a slow and painful death. it was the hatred that Bograd took advantage of, and, taking about half a dozen bullets, thereby finally cast aside the madman and bloodthirsty, as well as the mad madman!
