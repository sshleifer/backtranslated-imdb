This awesome superhero game Marvel pays tribute to the comics. Of all the Marvel superhero games that were so weak with weak graphics and gameplay, Spiderman is improving in both departments. It also has the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of the comic book about Spider-Man. <br /> <br /> As you would expect, Spiderman does everything a spider can. He does more than just weave a web. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When he does not use the net in combat, he also strikes with his hands and legs. Spider has his hands full when he fights with Poison, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpio and Dr. Octopus to name a few. Look for “Captain America” in a cameo. <br /> <br /> Most levels are difficult, but some of them require patience to win. The only claim to this game is that it is so short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you are a real fan of Marvel superheroes, this game is for you, but do not expect a long gameplay. Good luck with Spiderman 2. My rating is 9 out of 10.
