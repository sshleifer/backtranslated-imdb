I just saw this movie a second time on TV. It is sweet, warm, sentimental, very very romantic. I rarely saw actors capable of uncovering their love for another with their movements and gestures — Sibill Shepard, Ryan O'Neill, Robert Downey Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson is simply superior. Masterson probably plays the most difficult role and is simply fascinating. <br /> <br /> The film is based on romantic films such as While You Sleep, When Harry Met Sally, Insomnia In Seattle, and great tricks like Big, Back To the future, ”Peggy Sue got married. I don't want to say this because this cast was excellent and I would never change any of them - but I think he did not succeed as much as the films mentioned above because the box office cast appeal was simply not the case. as big as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made. <br /> <br /> Not very nicely written - for example, lines of characters are not particularly remembered. Yet it is performed to perfection. <br /> <br /> Romantic longings are truly tangible, the “feeling” of lovers is gracefully transmitted, the infinity of love and comprehensive reach, the sense of loss and the desire to return this connection so touchingly delivered. You will be moved again and again. In fact, the similar film “Made in Heaven” is the same romantic longing. <br /> <br /> See it - it's beautiful.
