This film about adulthood tells the story of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, when they learn about life and love one fateful summer. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Mulligan, best known for his excellent work in Kill a Mockingbird, the film never hits a fake note. All actions are excellent. Like Dany, Reese Witherspoon makes his debut in a terrific movie. Watching this beautifully photographed and perfectly shot and edited film, I felt that I was looking out the window of reality, and not watching the film. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at least 5 times and I can honestly say that this is one of the best films ever made about youth, love and experiences, problems and changes in adulthood. Families with children between the ages of 10 and 15 should look at it together and use it as discussion material, as this raises a number of questions about the rivalry between brothers and sisters, how to cope with love, about the responsibilities of parents, etc.
