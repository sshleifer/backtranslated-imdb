I did not know about Steve McQueen in 1958. I only knew that I was very scared that I would see this film. (I was devastated by the film "Trantula" at the age of seven ... but now I was ten). The first scene in which Blob crawls along the farmer's probe and grabs his hand was enough for me to want to leave the theater. But I stayed and suffered from every attack of our monster. I felt such horror when Steve and his girlfriend barely left the doctor’s office (poor man), and even more when The Blob entered the cinema and devoured most of the audience. so much in fact, that he oooooooozzzzzzzzzzzz outside the front door, too big to go through one. He seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential, and when he found poor Steve in a diner that looked like a sieve, he seemed like a real dinner. <br /> <br /> To say that Blob was cold would be a modern description, but in the end it’s better icy than scaring and mentally destroying young children. <br /> <br /> I remember going home in the Evening with my uncle Nick trying to behave bravely. He knew that I was in trouble, and when I went to bed that night, I not only felt a blob in the room, but also had the courage to look at the floor, there the red pulsing, hearty hungry dude was sitting, expecting me to try to get up and go to the bathroom. It took months to recover. <br /> <br /> I am 57 years old. I did it. <br /> <br /> Of course, Blob was not destroyed.
