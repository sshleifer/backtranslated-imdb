This is truly one of the best love movies I've ever seen. He is followed by nothing more than “Before Dusk,” which technically is not another movie at all, because it tells about the same two people and the same novel. <br /> <br /> This is “love” in the real world. Well, only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the main characters of the film. Reading other reviews, I am pleased to know how many other people are also crazy about dialogue-based dialogues. And this is what makes "Till the Sunrise" so good. The dialogue is perfect. It is so real, so attractive and fun. It's no wonder Jesse and Celine fall in love with each other because you fall in love with them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene in the cafe, where they pretend to call. their best friends, while others pretend to be best friends. It's perfect. It takes you back to the moment when you first fell in love with your life. <br /> <br /> I have to say that if you have a choice, watch “Before Dawn” before watching “Before Sunset”. ". If you, like me, first watched "Sunset", it is difficult to get rid of feelings of pity and sadness for two young lovers throughout the show. <br /> <br /> And again the best romantic movie in my books. Beautiful game, great script and beautiful locations. Young love, at best.
