In Mexico, this film was shown only in PayTV. The life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer is a true example of a good German, and especially a good person. The conversations between Tukurâ€™s character and the Nazi prosecutor are particularly interesting. The war of true ideas: two different Germans, both with faith in it believe. Bonhoeffer was a very complex man: a man, a freedom fighter, a guy, a churchman, and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is known as Bonhoffer. I highly recommended this film, especially in this difficult time for the planet. In Mexico, we know little about the life and heritage of Pastor Bonhoffer, this is a great job in saving a forgotten hero.
