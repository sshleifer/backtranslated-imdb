The paradoxes of time are a devil's trap for undeveloped minds. They are interesting to consider in "what if?" Like as. Filmmakers and authors have repeatedly discussed many films and TV shows, including Star Trek: First Contact, the trilogy of Back to the Future, Bill and Ted's Great Adventure, Groundhog Day and Stargate SG1 homage, Window of Opportunity. Heinlein's All You Zombies was written several decades ago, and yet it will still attract the attention of people reading this story for the first time. <br /> <br /> In the case of Terry Gilliam’s wonderful film “12 Monkeys”, it’s difficult to establish what may be continuity problems compared to plot elements that force us to rethink the concept of the film. Repeated views will lead us to different conclusions if we remain unbiased. <br /> <br /> Some will see Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as schizophrenic when they see the film for the first time. Most of them will see Cole as a person worried about what Adams calls the “constant painful experience” that befell him during time travel. <br /> <br /> Unlike other stories about time travel, “12 Monkeys” is unclear, the future story can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells his psychiatrist Raleigh (Madeleine Stowe) that time cannot be changed, but the phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists AFTER he was sent in 1996 on his personal schedule. <Br /> <br /> Even this can be interpreted as an event that should have happened in a single universe of the timeline to ensure that the timeline has not changed ... Cole must die before the eyes of the younger self for destiny to be realized . If so, time is like a liquid, it always finds its own level or path, regardless of the external forces acting on it. It is incomprehensible to dwell too much on such things. <br /> <br /> If you can change future events, which then direct the actions of those who have the ability to send people back in time, as we see on board. the plane at the end of the film means that the future can be changed by manipulating past events ... or not? The film probably led to a lot of drunken fights in bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians. <br /> <br /> Bonus materials on DVDs make watching very interesting. Gilliam was under more than normal pressure to attract the film within budget, which is not a special surprise after the defeat of Munchhausen and in light of his later attempt to make the film Don Quixote. I would rate the “creation” of a documentary as one of the most interesting that I saw. This, of course, is not whitewashing and accurately observes the difficulties and random conflicts that arise between the creative people involved. A description of the film by Gilliam as his “7½th” release, because the film was not written by his own writer himself, and therefore is not his “film,” does not in itself justify itself. <br /> <Brad Pitt portrays Goyn with curiosity, although his character is not particularly sympathetic. Watch his slightly gaze in one of the scenes of the asylum. It is disturbing and distracting. <br /> <br /> Probably a coincidence, Louis Armstrong's song “What a Wonderful World” was used at the end of “12 Monkeys” and the final episode of “Avtostopchik”. Guide to the Galaxy. Both the film and the television series also featured British actor Simon Jones. <br /> <br /> “12 monkeys” is a science fiction story that entertains as much as mental stimulation of the game of chess can entertain. This is not a meaningless rest, that's for sure.
