Such was the black society before the epidemics of crack, gangster rap and AIDS that engulfed the ghettos in the eighties. Worthy, hardworking families who struggled to get through and all the injuries and misfortunes they faced. Black America was another group of people in the seventies.

It hurts to look at what the black ghettos were then and who they are now.
