For quite a long time in my life, I either didn’t like this film, or I liked this film, but not as much as it did. I watched it recently (at night, oddly enough), and I liked it more than when I was under 6 years or so. Now I appreciate it more, like some other Disney classic works that I recently watched (including “Sleeping Beauty” and “Pinnochio” or as you write). <br /> <br /> Now I really appreciate the animation, the cunning plot of Disney, the humor from the mice, the expressed emotions and the plot. The animation is very well done, it often seems that you are where other characters are watching them. The animation also displays background styles well, including the city (which is shown twice briefly). Disney changes this from the original fairy tale in an amazingly good way, introducing clever plot twists, such as mice making clothes and a key role (I usually don’t like Disney movies if they don’t look very much like the original story, but with that I am not too concerned. I feel that they made the necessary changes to make this film a good Disney. Often I don’t think that Disney changed the book in a good way in some of his films). <br /> <br /> You already know this story, Cinderella is a girl working for her terrible stepmother and step sisters. She goes to the ball with the help of her fairy and loses her glass slipper ... <br /> <br /> This film is very popular with other people. The immediate family is not good enough. To enjoy this, I recommend that you watch it with friends (and immediate family if you wish. :-)). <br /> <br /> I recommend this to people who at least love Disney a little, people who love fairy tales, and people who love mice. Enjoy! :-)
