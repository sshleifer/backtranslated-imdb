“People's Show” is an absolutely amazing silent film directed by King Widor with Marion Davis and Billy Haynes in the lead roles. What a jewel of them both in this charming comedy about a young girl, Peggy Pepper, whose game is the story of Savannah trying to do it on the big screen. Although she has succeeded in comedy, she wants to make "art", so she goes to High Arts Studio. Soon she becomes Patricia Pepoir and is too good for the likes of her friend Billy. <br /> <br /> Many stars of the era of silence have episodic roles in the People Show, including Davis herself without curly hair and makeup. I’m sure that when people watched the film in 1928, they recognized everyone who appeared on the difficult dinner scene; Unfortunately, this is not the case at present, even for movie lovers. However, in one part of the film she meets Charlie Chaplin; the other is the author Elinor Glyn, and Vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film. Other stars that appear in Show People are John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Leatrice Joy, Bess Flowers, Rene Adori, Rod Larock, Eileen Pringle and many others. <br /> <br /> Davis was a charming and lively comedian. It's a shame that William Haynes threw a movie - he was a sweet and energetic, deservedly huge star of that time. <br /> <br /> “Show People” is a simple story told wittily. This is also a look back at an exciting era in Hollywood history and contains performances of two great stars.
