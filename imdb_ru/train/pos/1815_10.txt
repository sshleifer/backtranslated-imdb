“May contain spoilers” * <br /> <br /> “All dogs go to heaven” is a great movie. I saw him in 1989 when I was two years old. I did not understand him very well, but as I saw him more and more I liked it. I like the songs in this movie. My favorite songs are “Let me be surprised” and “You will be back home soon.” These are wonderful songs. The only thing that bothers me is the movie - Charlie is dying. When I was little, my sister could not even watch this part. In addition, this film is wonderful. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the film is Annabelle and Charlie flying around. Heaven is beautiful in the film, and the “clock” is very smart. I also love Itch, in fact I have 3 own dachshunds. They are so cute. <br /> <br /> In general, I love this film and invite everyone to see it. I put this movie with 10/10 stars.
