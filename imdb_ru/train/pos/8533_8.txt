This film is more Lupine than most, especially from Funimation. Besides bad duplication, this is not bad. <br /> <br /> The first hour is very similar to the comics (this is the basis of all the material of Lupine of the 3rd). Lupine is trying to get a huge treasure. Fujiko uses Lupine’s weakness for women to try to extract something from it. The latter is not so bad, he is with other women, but, of course, Fujiko is still number one. <br /> <br /> Many other Lupine films are more Family with curses than Lupine. Any good Lupine fan, I think, will be pleasantly surprised (I know I heard so many bad things about this movie). Perhaps it would be a little better if small animations did not appear during the titles (they make it a bit soft), but overall the film is not bad. Good enough to be one of the few I’d watch again from Lupine III’s films.
