The murder investigation goes into the background, while The Vanities, in its premiere, plays on the ignorance of the audience. A strange combination of the musical and the mystery of the murder is worth a look at the cast, staged numbers and the obvious novelty of the film. <br /> <br /> Gertrude Michael plays a spectacular actress, intending to dissolve the marriage between the stars of the show, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, and also starring in the infamous Sweet Marijuana (which was also on the Bette 70 x). So, while the girls of the choir bustle backstage, the awkward detective Viktor McLaughlin looks at the girls, trying to uncover the backstage murder of an unknown woman. <br /> <br /> We quickly learn that the maid (Dorothy Stikny) loves Brisson from afar, that the cloakroom attendant (Jesse Ralph) is Brisson's mother, and that the director (Jack Okey) is drawn into everything. A lot of plot twists among the musical numbers. The most famous song of the show is Cocktails for Two. Kitty Carlisle also sings the haunting "Where are they from?" And there is a strange rhapsody, which breaks into a special room of Harlem with the participation of the Duke Ellington! Good cast. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing game, especially Michael Gertrude and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is not bad either. Brisson - complete zero. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays the doctor, and also finds out if you can notice Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the show girls.
