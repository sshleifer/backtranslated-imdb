I have not seen either the restored or any version of "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwick until I found it on TCM. What a great movie! In short, Lily lives in secret haste, her own Father despaired of her from the age of 14! Then he still explodes, and he is killed, leaving Lily (Stanwick) alone, for her black maid Chico, who Teresa Harris played very well. Lily leaves for the big city (New York), deciding to use her sex to get to the top. She does it great! <br /> <br /> She seduces a plump clerk to get to the first floor, and sorts out men like disposable candy! One throws his bride and kills his close father-in-law, also sugar dad Lily, then commits suicide! Lily barely blinks! Stanwick is amazing like a girl who really doesn't know what love is. <br /> <br /> Then in Paris she falls in love with Cortland, played by George Brent, they get married, but when he is in a deep financial position, she bolts. Almost free with Chico and half a million, she realizes that she loves Cort! Lily rushes to find him, but will she be too late? <br /> <br /> This is the preliminary code of Hollywood at its best. Stanwyck is awesome, and the look and music of the film is impeccable. It reminded me of “Original Sin” with Angelina Jolie, another unfairly ignored film with an immoral woman, those who didn’t like films of ultra-romantic inclinations, no longer like Baby FAce, those who believe in sex, love and strength, love it. Highly recommended! See it!
