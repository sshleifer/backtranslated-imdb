Classic, very influential low-budget thriller, which spawned an icon of horror and marked the beginning of the career of director Carpenter and the stars Curtis. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the unstoppable killer escapes from a psychiatric hospital and returns to his hometown, where he begins to pursue a local babysitter for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a film that never ceases to justify its reputation as a masterpiece of horror! Carpenter’s scary story and clever guide give this film such a frighteningly good life that one needs to see it in order to really feel it! The direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors, which makes even the daily atmosphere of a small urban area really creepy. Carpenter is experiencing his suspense and his shocking blows to make them most striking, which in itself is a feat that horror directors ever cope with! In addition, he is wise enough to give us really cute young characters and a very terrible villain to keep the tension even stronger. The highest score also goes to Carpenter’s simple but frighteningly intimidating music. In a sense, Halloween is a great example of a perfect horror movie! <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis makes a very good turn in the role of cute babysitter Lori Strode, she is so good that she will go to a series of other horror films before getting into larger films. The great Donald Pleasants performs very well in the role of Dr. Mayer, who is desperately trying to capture him again. It is also good to play actors Lumis, Soles, Castle and others. <br /> <br /> Halloween, like its own villain, is an irresistible force that never ceases to tremble. This is MANDATORY for all fans of the genre! <br /> <br /> **** of ****
