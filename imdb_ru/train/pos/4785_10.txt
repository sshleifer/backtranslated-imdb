[No spoilers] <br /> <br /> As a David Lynch film, you might think that it depicts his mysterious mind, as in most of his feature films. But this is a very straightforward story, as the name suggests. Not except to be caught in the usual Lynch void of incomprehensibility, which usually occurs after seeing, for example, the Lost Highway. It's a simple movie, but it's a really great movie. It is both innovative and entertaining. This is innovative because it is not Lynch. But maybe it's Lynch. He likes to distort our thoughts and therefore collects the film, which may seem very popular and far from Lynch himself. Being a very avant-garde director, he can just make such a film to tease his regular audience, because he knows what they expect, but does not give them that. That would be tricky. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is slow. I would almost say, the speed of the lawn mower ... Do not expect action-orgy, but the film is really interesting for those who go with the flow of the film. Look closely at the small details that Lynch portray throughout the film for our entertainment. Look for great cinematography that makes this film come to life. And listen to the Badalamenti score and the main theme that really animates the landscapes of Iowa and Wisconsin, which are often shown. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth puts one of his best performances in this film, making him one of the cutest old people ever depicted in the film. He does not need to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. His cheerfulness simply shines through him, and his acting game brought him an Oscar nomination. Do I have to say that his poor health is not played in this film? He was diagnosed with cancer, and he shot himself immediately after the film was completed. This knowledge only places a greater emphasis on the film, because it becomes more tribute to Farnsworth. <br /> <br /> All of the above forms a very cute film that is suitable for all people who like the movie as they should be. You can ask for sermons that are not so obvious and a bit naive, but this does not spoil the big picture, as this is a memorable film. 9/10.
