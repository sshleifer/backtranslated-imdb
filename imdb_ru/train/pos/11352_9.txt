This is a fascinating story about the hunt for the first known serial killer in the USSR. I tuned in, just waiting for a semi-decent television film, but was attracted by the compelling way in which the story was told. As others have said, there is something to admire, which, unfortunately, is not enough in many releases of large screens. <br /> <br /> Much of the merit should belong to Chris Gerolmo, whose clever script and direction attracts the viewer until it is impossible not to feel emotionally involved. The action of the entire cast is also excellent, especially with the two main characters, Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. Their convincing images give the arcs of their characters greater certainty, and the scene where they hold their first meeting of the committee after perestroika is genuinely touching. <br /> <br /> If you prefer your crime films with more depth and a little less, I strongly recommend that you pay attention to "Citizen X". <br /> <br />
