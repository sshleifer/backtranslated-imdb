In fact, one particular person / character is not “right there”, but my summary line refers to the strength of the film. And all this is achieved without any bizarre camera movements and / or large shooting series, but with a great story and very (plausible) and good actors, transmitting the story (arc). <br /> <br /> You can call this companion for the great Japanese cinema / cinema (for example, “Tokyo Story”, etc.), not so much the plot, of course, but also customized! Great acting, nuances in performances that are truly precious. If you want to experience a touching story and want to watch a film that concerns you emotionally, then this is what you need. As you have noticed (as in many of my reviews), I will not go into the story. Here, on IMDb, there are places where you can find them, I'm not one of those who spoil the story!
