I missed almost the entire first season, but when the other shows went into repetitions, I started watching. In the end, I bought the entire first season from iTunes. Now this is one of my favorite comedy shows. Patrick Warburton is the key. His dry sense of humor makes me ride all the time. David Spade is funny, but sometimes little Russell goes a long way. I like the other actors more (but I'm not saying that he doesn't add to the series). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. If you haven’t checked it yet, try it. If you manage to catch an episode in which “Jeff” goes to the sperm bank, you will see how good this series is. <br /> <br /> I hope this series will be long.
