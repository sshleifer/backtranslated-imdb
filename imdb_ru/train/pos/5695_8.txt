Some films manage to survive on almost one originality - “Wonderland” is definitely one of those films. The script manages to throw everything in an area close to a fever, but without making it incoherent. The speed of this thriller is not intended to hide the weak script, but to accurately reflect the addicts of reality. <br /> <br /> As a director, James Cox is a very peculiar way of working for his actors. Most characters are constantly on the verge, and often because they are rather ugly personalities. Val Kilmer described John Holmes as a hustler able to manipulate and control. Do not be offended by Kilmer, but his version of Holmes seems to be able to control only the radically weak-minded. However, this is an amazing performance. Comparing this with Kilmer's more “Hollywood” roles, as in “The Holy”, this seems to prove that he feels much better at home in tough indie films. <br /> <br /> Actors are the main force holding everything together. There are several small speeches, especially women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow have limited screen time next to their male colleagues, but they are all fantastic. Besides Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott gives strange, stunning energy into their roles. <br /> <br /> I initially put off watching “Wonderland” because I suggested that it was a film about porn actor, in the strictest sense. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but it literally has nothing to do with his professional career. In fact, this film is a murder mystery, and therefore it is great. <br /> <br /> RATING: 7.5 out of 10
