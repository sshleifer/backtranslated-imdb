Tim Meadows should be the most misunderstood of recent SNL actors. What was originally a low stare at a vile gigil turns into a very interesting 90-minute run, although still low. Do not show it in anticipation of beautiful cinematography or Oscar-worthy performances. Go into it, expecting brilliant folly, when Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell will do what they do best - make the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Leon "The Ladies' Man" Phelps is a naive, cute radio show host of the radio who knows very little about anything but the ways of Van. Being a gifted ladies' man, he wastes the wives of countless juices who have teamed up to track him down. The director does an inspired job, directing the actors to a comedy date, which fully compensates for the lack of plot development. How much plot can you expect from a SNL parody? While some scenes are a bit confusing, for the most part, one Meadows insert and absurd sexual comments strike a funny bone straight. For example, in one scene, Meadows compares herself to Mother Teresa, but for bonin '. Of course, this is stupid, but can't we all, in the privacy of our homes, laugh at his advice to the whole city for “doing it in the ass”? In another scene, right after a heart kiss with a leading woman, he suddenly remembers how his name will be the benefactor, the woman with whom he slept many years ago. He stands in front of a woman who clearly fell in love with him, and proclaims that "The ladies' man is back," to her obvious chagrin. <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams is hitting the ball from the park when the bartender / narrator. Will Ferrell, a repressed homosexual, completes a solid performance. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you like adult humor. If not, stay away from extreme prejudice.
