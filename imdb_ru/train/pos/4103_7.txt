The main characters of this film fall into two categories: smart and stupid. Simple enough. <br /> <br /> Jiri Macacek (Standa) plays an unfortunate, lethargic guy arrested for a crime he did not commit. When he tries to get a financial refund from his evil former boss, the situation is out of control. <br /> <br /> While Standa is sincerely (albeit charmingly) stupid, his friend Ondrej is an absolute dazzling idiot who will ruin everything and manages to talk and do wrong every time. Without Ondrej, Standa could have had a chance to go through life with some modest degree of success. With Ondrei, life will never be boring, but it will certainly not be without special headaches! <br /> <br /> Ivan Troyan plays Zdenek, an evil genius who turns into some kind of delusional tyrant of Hitler. Zdenek and his minions are trying to kill the Stand to keep Zdenek's secrets safe. <br /> <br /> I am very impressed with the quality and fantasy of Czech films. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic certainly produced more than its share of excellent entertainment. The best Czech films I've seen are: 1) Peli ?? ky and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two films, you have seen the absolute best of Czech cinema.
