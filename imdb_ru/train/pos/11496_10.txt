Love this movie too. Seen when he was first shown in Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was really crowded, and it was a very ambitious atmosphere. The erotic film hit the audience, and the discussion with Moritz Burner, the producer and director, has always been underlined by this. In his genre, it was a very ambitious film, especially considering that it was an independent film. <br /> <br /> With few copies of this film, Mortitz Burner came from the theater and made two or three more short films working for television before he became a kind of therapist. <br /> <br /> For people who want to watch this movie again, you can find it on its homepage, which is not so easy to search for, but it is possible.
