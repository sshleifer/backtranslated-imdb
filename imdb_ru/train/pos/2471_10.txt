I never read “Shakespeare's Hamlet” before watching it, but I had Shakespeare’s book, and I could follow its dialogue. My view of the film may be partly biased, since I have never read the play before, but I have been drawn into the essence of this film. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever lived, and the story of Hamlet is certainly one of his best achievements. <br /> <br /> But now about the movie ... <br /> <br /> I found that all the actors in the movie had a clear idea of ​​what they were saying, and thus were able to articulate it's pretty good. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Brana and the King. What I liked about it was that it worked very well as “FILM”, and not like the piece you are studying. You do not need to be rich with Shakespeare to relate to everything the village of Miseri goes through. I would recommend this movie to a wide audience. <br /> <br /> This is my two cents.
