Oddly enough, all previous comments just described the beginning and left the details. I feel the need to confirm that this is a family work, since Marina Vlada was also the wife of Robert Hossein, and jazz music was written by the father of director Andre. Under these conditions, it is not surprising that it was a really good thriller, seen when it came out and immediately identified with the music. The wait was impeccable and kept to the end. Robert Hossain, one of the best European players at the time, managed to impose himself also as the main screen and director. He still has great stage performances, preferring religious themes.
