Karla works for the developer, where she is unattractive, underestimated and desperate. She is also deaf. <br /> <br /> Her boss offers to hire someone to ease her heavy workload, so she uses this opportunity to protect herself from some kind of male company. Help comes in the form of Paul, a tattooed hooligan who has just come out of prison and is clearly not suitable for a mannered routine in the office. <br /> <br /> Implicit sexual tension arises between them, and Carla is determined to keep him, despite his unwillingness to cover the work week. When Carla is suspended from an important contract, with which she negotiated with a slimy colleague, she uses Paul's crime, forcing him to steal the contract back. A colleague quickly realizes that she is behind a robbery, but when he confronts her, Paul’s willingness to beat people in the face also turns out to be useful - but this banditry comes at a price. <br /> <br /> Some acquaintances of the crowd call Paul "inverted" as a reminder of unpaid debt. He formulates a plan that uses Karla's unique lip-reading ability to disrupt a gang of violent bank robbers. Now it’s Carla’s turn to enter the frightening new world. <br /> <br /> Jacques Audiard’s fourth film, READ MY LIPS, begins as a thoroughly enticing romantic drama between two marginal losers just to change gears halfway into a sharp thriller where their symbiotic flaws turn them into winners. Leads great; effortlessly convince us that this strange couple can really connect. Carla's first meeting with Paul is a pleasant farce in which she tries to get around his inhospitable restraint and style of jailbird, only to discover that, until recently, he was a jailbird. Emmanuel Devos, who plays Karl, has an almost exceptional ability to move from fashion to luxury and back into the frame. Vincent Cassel plays Paul as a pounded dog that really only seems to be at home when he gets a beating or fabrication that can kill him. <br /> <br /> Like many French films, READ MY LIPS At first, it seems that there is nothing special until you scratch the surface and find out that this is probably about everything. The only task is a subplot about the missing wife of the parole officer; a device that seems invented only to help transform the main point of the story into an elegant little dead end. <br /> <br /> It was the French “New Wave” of the 60s that first introduced the concept. The “genre” of film making, and I always felt that any medium was somewhat compromised when you needed to use a tag system to help define it; so it's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to go beyond the genre, or, even better, challenges it.
