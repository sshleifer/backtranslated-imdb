Freebird is the perfect combination of a road trip comedy, a film about bandits, a stunning film and a good British film. <br /> <br /> It is the brilliant protagonists that distinguish this film from other films of this genre. Stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Jeff Bell have excellent chemistry and make their characters incredibly cute and realistic. The main story tells about their trip from London to Wales, as well as about the adventures and failures that occur along the way. This little film also has a big heart - it’s not just for bike lovers, because it’s based on the character’s relationship with each other, including dreams and regrets, such as Fred Gary Stretch, who is eager for the family he left behind. Cinematography is also great - a love letter to the countryside of Wales, as well as capturing the gloom of London streets and the typical pub life in Welsh provincial cities. <br /> <br /> Stylish, brilliant, fantastic soundtrack, nice characters and funny storyline - I would recommend Freebird in an instant!
