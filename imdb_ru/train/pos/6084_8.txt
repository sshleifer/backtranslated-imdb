I was pleased with the actors of reputable players. The story is to defend the cause, even if you risk at the same time. At a time when violence and pain are often at the forefront of a film, this film focuses on an old-fashioned good cop. Although similar stories were made more than once, these guys do well. Lean back and enjoy. Dennehy - the master of filming.
