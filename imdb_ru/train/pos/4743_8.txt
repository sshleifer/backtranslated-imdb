This is a very strange HK movie in many ways. First, many of the sequences of actions are really not that interesting. The very first shootout in the film was just stupid. Not cool stupid or even funny stupid, but just stupid. This does not mean that there are no good action films, but most simply do not reach the level of some other films that I have seen. The other side is that there are actually characters in this film, not just people. All the main characters are interesting (except for the head of a bad guy who is as flat as a billiard table), and most of them are pretty well played. All the main characters in this movie are just fun to watch. The dialogue is quite witty and does not seem to lose much in translation. This film is worth seeing, but I hope that an uninitiated American audience does not think that this is the best thing HK has to offer.
