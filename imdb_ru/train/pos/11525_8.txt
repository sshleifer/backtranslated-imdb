This movie is awesome for three main reasons. It is aesthetically beautiful. I really liked it. The film has a bright color theme with unusual costumes and picturesque decorations. A photo that looks very expensive (and probably wasn't) completes the look. I always like these stories about groups of losers / singles who get together and become a family. Sometimes they fall into clich√©s, but they are not. This group of actors really portrays sophisticated, but extremely cute characters. Alan Larkin - the best (between him, the van and the theme of the road film, I could not help but remember my favorite film last year's Little Miss Sunshine ??). I found Fabrizio Bentivollo, a very interesting actor, and I was sometimes annoyed by the performance of Tyla Schweiger. The opening scene, all the scenes where they spoil their stunts, are very funny. Throughout the film are mixed feelings of humor and emotion. I really like the end. And, of course, it's all about the topic of the Magician. A good magician makes the audience look where he wants to create an illusion. This is exactly what the director does, and therefore they call it movie magic.
