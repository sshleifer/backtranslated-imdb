Funny. Sad. Charming. All these words flashed through my head as I watched this beautiful, simple film. <br /> <br /> Rarely does a movie really touch me, but will we dance? achieved this with grace to spare. Gentle humor, mixed with occasional subtle agony, made it easily one of the best events in my film history. This left me with a quiet feeling of exultation, but with a touch of sadness. <br /> <br /> And dancing, oh yeah, dancing. Even if you are not an art lover or cannot put one foot in front of the other, the steps shown here will take you by heart and you will want to sign up for classes as quickly as you can. It was absolutely charming, even the pieces that show Sugiyamaâ€™s walking steps (touchingly portrayed by Koji Yakusho), when he first learned to dance, were beautiful in a humorous, childish style. And yet this film was not only about dancing, but also about the intricacies of human behavior and feelings. We are witnessing how a shy person learns to express his repressed feelings with the help of dance, an excellent dance teacher rediscovers his love of art and the personal growth of each member of the wonderful cast. <br /> <br /> Beauty. Pain. Emotion. All the love and little agony of life here, expressed by a delicate sense of beautiful Japanese watercolor painting combined with emotional strength and grace of culture. <br /> <br />
