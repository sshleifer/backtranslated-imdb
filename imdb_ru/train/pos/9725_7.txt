“How to lose friends and alienate people” is not based on the unfaithfulness of Tiger Woods. This is a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Young’s book about his experience working as a celebrity journalist. The film starred Simon Pegg as Sydney Young, a crazy British journalist who takes a job in the famous celebrity magazine in New York. Young is worried that he will be grabbed for all sorts of machinations to push him around, hence the name of the film. He is noisy, brash and moronic. But, nevertheless, for some very bizarre reason, he is a somewhat likeable character. Sydney became friends with fellow journalist, composer Alison Olsen, who was superbly played by Kirsten Dunst. Nevertheless, Sydney is first and foremost eager for sex sweat actress Sophie Maes, played by Fantastic Miss Megan Fox. This foxtrot does not cope with acting skills, but it is very good for the “eye candy” material. Sydney gets all sorts of tomfoolery to climb the journalist’s stairs in a magazine. This is the peak comedic moments of the film. However, I think that director Robert Weide and screenwriter Peter Straugan might lose some viewers and alienate the original rom-com material by developing an incredible romantic plot line between Sydney and Alison; even if the team Vaidstraugan really formulated an entertaining story otherwise. Pegg really tied his character to the wire with his fun game of Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges again built the Dude bridges with his mysterious support work in the role of Clayton Harding, a suave presentation of the magazine. But the rest of the action of the film was not worthy enough to show here. “How to lose friends and alienate people” should not be completely alienated, but you can lose some friends from the movie if you advertise it as an excellent romantic comedy. *** Average
