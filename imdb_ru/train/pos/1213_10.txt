This film really contradicts the first one as regards the origin of the Care Bears and the Care Bear Cousins. I will not deny it. However, if you watch “Part II” as a separate film, this is a very good film. I remember watching it in the early 80s (and then fit into the target demographic audience) and absolutely loved him much more than the first film (not that I didn’t like it either, it just seemed to have a little something superfluous). Of course, it is darker than the first, but maybe that's why it is so good. And even darker, darker, thinner (which children may not fully understand, but they can still be a little scared because of the atmosphere they emit, and adults probably watch faster, as I watch this movie again now) in my mid-twenties) when you have mostly a young girl making a deal with an evil spirit / demon in exchange for something else. Get the picture? But just to watch it, as a child, of course, as I said, it could be a little scary, but nothing terrible. In fact, if something gave me another fantastic game, I could play at that age. I cannot tell you how many times I pretended that the Dark Heart wanted to imprison me, so that I could help him catch the Care Bears, tried to make me turn over to his dark side, and other such things, etc. the film was also good for my imagination. And it also has great emotional depth. I watched it at least once a week. <br /> <br /> In addition, Hadley Kay was the perfect choice for the Dark Heart voice (I always thought so and I always will). <br /> <br /> Now it’s a pity that they never released a soundtrack. Sometimes I just want to hear “Growing Up” without watching the movie, no matter how good it is. <br /> <br /> “What good is love and care if she cannot save her?”
