Holes is a terrific movie. I like it a lot, and this is one of my favorite movies. This is one of the few films made by Disney, which is not too stupid. Holes are usually a very cool movie. I would like Disney to take more of these photos. Holes - a really rare breed of Disney flick shows, that's cool. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean Disney's bad mouth, but most of his stuff is aimed at children and IT'S OK. Children deserve fun too. But Disney was guilty of trying to reach a teenage audience, and they usually fail. But not with holes. This is a type of film that any person of any age can watch and enjoy, and never think that this is trivial. Indeed, this film may even appeal to many young hoods, as there are characters in it that they can relate to. <br /> <br /> Holes are perfectly combined with good family entertainment not to be too stupid and to live a little on the edge. I hope that Disney risks more and makes movies as sharp as this one.
