And that is why historical / biographical films are so important for all of us, moreover, when they are so well made, like this one! <br /> <br /> Before I looked at Young Victoria, I knew something about Queen Victoria, but in the end I got a lot more knowledge about it. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is just as gorgeous as Victoria (who would have thought!), and she will probably get an Oscar nomination this year. Personally, I support her ... <br /> <br /> With technical questions, I am pleased to announce that this is a very successful production with excellent decoration / scenery and, of course, the way it was. Expected stunning periodic costume design! <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that I want to see more and more to know about this interesting queen, but above all, an incredible woman and mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
