This is one of my favorites for all time. <br /> <br /> If the film has a flaw, then this is what it goes to you like a mad bull. This does not so much attract the viewer as it attacks him. “Scarface” is just as voracious and not inferior to the production, like Tony Montana himself. Nothing remains in the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> Moroder’s languid syntipop is coming to the game. Like the choir in the Greek tragedy, it screams and grinds, broods and jerks, a constant reminder of Tony's inexorable fate. <br /> <br /> Not so much a story about caution as about a disaster in progress, Scarface torn across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train.
