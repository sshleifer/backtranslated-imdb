I would give this terrific series for the full 10 votes, if Claudia Black had not continued in this! Her inclusion as a stupid "Vela" led to the fact that the series was in my assessment. Attracting her as a regular at the same time as Ben Browder to replace the RDA was a mistake. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we were simply shaken by the loss of “Jack”, and we really didn’t need this great series turned into a new episode of “Farscape”. <br /> <br /> I was a big fan of Stargate, and when the series was first announced, I had doubts that it could fit the film, but after Watching the first episode, I have to admit that I was hooked. I always looked forward to new episodes with a lot of anticipation.
