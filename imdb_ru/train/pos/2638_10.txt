One of the best films for all ages. You can never look at LION KING again without thinking about the extra story this movie adds. For almost 40 years, I watched it tonight with my wife and two sons after work, and I did not laugh or enjoy the movie for so long. <br /> <br /> Take a time out and look at it with the children, It will remind you of what Disney was like when you were young.
