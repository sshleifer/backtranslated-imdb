Well, it was a pleasant surprise. his trailer did not predict a good movie at all, he was even a little misleading. Especially the role of Jeff Bridges was a positive surprise, well written, sardonic and funny. Less real, though, I don’t think the guy who got what he got would show signs of such disrespect towards everything that his current company supports. Man does not become the best master to again doubt all this. The ending of the film, during the Dolce Vita show, was too banal, cliché and rather disappointing. And, of course, such a guy as Pegg's character will not last more than his first week in such a bright New York magazine as this one. I hope one day I will see a decent role written for Megan Fox, here she looked like a poor actress playing a prank. And, by the way, I do not understand why she is the “sex symbol” of the year, I see hot girls on almost every cover of every magazine.
