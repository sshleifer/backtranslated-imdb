"One shot, one kill, no exceptions." You need to see if you are in the marines or snipers. two thumbs up! Excellent overall storyline, great camera work, good drama, action, details and more. Pretty close to the real thing. But this is not a movie to smash and reveal editing errors. It is to sit back and have a good 99 minutes. The plot has some depth, but this film does not make you think. to enjoy sniper life and action. Sniper 2 and 3 - a good continuation, but the first is still the best movie. Tom Berenguer plays his character well and shows the hidden side of sniper life. simple matter with all death. Be sure to look for sniper fans.
