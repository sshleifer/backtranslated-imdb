Inventive, intense exercise with claustrophobia. Japanese thriller, which sets itself a difficult task, being fully installed in two rooms. Not entirely successful, but taut, amazing and well acting. Can someone find a movie somewhat reminiscent of SAW ?? two men were trapped in the room and set on each other ?? but unlike this film, he dares to stay with his premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the film. It's like watching a laboratory experiment. Some might find tedious waiting, but this reviewer found it fascinating. The sound and images of the film are amazingly well implemented. This is definitely a good movie to show a good home video system. Just for the late night film festival, when you're in a paranoid mood. It certainly did not let me fall asleep that night.
