This long episode contains many startling surprises, thrillers, secrets and fears about the battle of Sherlock's minds against Charles August Milverton, the chief blackmailer. This is a great long series by Jeremy Brett-Holmes. In the film, the usual Holmes cannons appear in the role of Inspector Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson, although not Moriarty, but the greatest villain, Charles August. <br /> <br /> This is a real yarn with intrigue, thrills and uncertainty, including an exciting final twist. This is a special film about Sherlock, but Holmes falls in love with a servant, kisses, cries and even robs. This time, together with the episode "Scandal in Bohemia" with Irina Adler, the only one that Holmes charmed. Brett's first-class play, he and Peter Cushing are the best Sherlock TV, while Basil Rathbone remains in the cinema forever. Brett acts as a decisive, stubborn, swift detective. Here, Dr. Watson is not a comic, a scoundrel and clumsy friend, personified by Nigel Bruce, but an astute and cunning partner, well embodied by Edward Hardwick, Brett's perfect counterpoint. Casting is frankly gorgeous, especially to mention Robert Hardy as an insightful opponent. Hardy, now known for playing Cornelius Fudge in the film Harry Potter, is a veteran actor with a forty-year career and with several successes, such as Tenth Kingdom and Winston Churchill. In addition, minor actors appear with stunning performances, Nicholas Grace, Sophie Gordon, Serena Gordon and others. The film takes on a colorful atmosphere, the streets of London and 221 Baker Street are well designed. The film is well shot by Peter Hammond, director of various episodes. This is a must see for Arthur Conan Doyle fans.
