I love Korean films, because they have the ability to really (very quietly) capture real life. I tend to watch Korean films just for this reason. I've seen it directors of other films before. Most of all, my feelings are “Oasis” and another stunning film “This charming girl”. <br /> <br /> However, my summary of the title should be from the Christian point of view, so I’ll just start instead of praising him. <br /> <br /> For a non-Christian perspective, director Chang-don Lee captured an impartial and almost frighteningly real depiction of the modern Protestant church (regardless of religion) and all warts. I always waited for a Christian film in which the dark corners of church life are indeed depicted. Because Christian films tend to speak a language different from those they want to share their faith with. Many films with religious overtones, although they have good motives, tend to have a resonance in the Disney film or after the school program. They need to show life the way it is. Real people curse, real people crave, real people fall. And while Christians believe that salvation is available to those who seek it, we still face the daily horrors of this life. And the character of Dawn Eona is an absolutely honest and almost cruel depiction of a woman who has found God, but because of the bitter realities of life, she loses the love for Him that she once had. She does not deny that God exists. She simply refuses to accept the idea that He is a loving and forgiving God. <br /> <br /> In her respectable moral behavior and insanity, her character asks questions that are in everyone’s mind, religious or not. <br /> <br /> “If God is Love, then why does He allow such horrible things?” This film doesn’t answer that, right. And I believe that the last 10 minutes of the film, although open to interpretation, leave us a promising future for our main character and give an idea of ​​the "secret light" of the full circle. <br /> <br /> I don’t believe for a second that this film tried to be religious or in any way tried and intended to be like that. This is the reason why it worked even more. It is true, it is honest. And because of this, this is the best of the real Christian life that I saw in the film.
