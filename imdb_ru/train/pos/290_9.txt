Edmund Burke said that "all evil is needed so that I do nothing." Hollywood often gives us rubbish, because few families attend quality films. This film was an inspiring tale of losing and restoring faith. It was no violence, no obscenity, and did not deserve a PG rating. Western landscapes were shot well, and some of the prospects were breathtaking. The actors were a little young for their roles, but otherwise believable and talented. The music was too loud, and in some places completely drowned out the dialogue. I rarely wonder more about the end of the movie, but I was pleasantly surprised by this. Sometimes the good guys win, and they win by honest efforts. We liked the movie and the message, and we recommend it for the whole family.
