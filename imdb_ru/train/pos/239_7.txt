I watched it in films with my girlfriend at the time, and I can say that I didn’t have a better time because I didn’t know about Ned Kelly or his story. <br /> <br /> But since this is a biopic, it’s important to at least know what to expect from the character. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if the way events are described is true or everything is fictional. But the way Ned Kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me believe that everything is true. I do not think that he is portrayed as a criminal or a thief, but this is just my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a reliable western-style film for every taste. Heath Ledger is great, as always, and sexy Naomi Watts enchants the screen. <br /> <br /> Give this film a chance if it will be broadcast over cable. Otherwise, I don't think I could recommend it.
