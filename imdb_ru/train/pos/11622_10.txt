Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams star in this action / thriller, written and directed by Wes Craven himself. The whole movie begins with some troubles at the Lux Atlantic Hotel, a hotel in Miami. The problem is solved by Lisa Reisert, the hotel manager. Then she goes to the airport, and that's where the trouble begins. She meets Jackson Rippner, who doesn't like when his name is Jack because of the name Jack the Ripper, if you know him and I mean. Then they get on a plane, and crazy enough, Rippner and Reisert are sitting next to each other. For the next half hour Lisa is terrorized, tortured and frightened by Rippner. I will not give anything. Then we go to the place where Jack is chasing Lisa at the airport. Then Lisa goes to her house to check if her father is ok, and, oddly enough, Rippner is already there. In this whole scene, almost twelve minutes of violence and intense intensity. In the end, ends about 25 minutes of intense action. <br /> <br /> The film was not only rich, but also an excellent plot. As I said, I will not give anything, because it is so shocking, worried and somewhat disturbing / scary. And the actions of each character in the film, even those who have no lines, were completely flawless. That was incredible. Everything was cool in this movie! Acting, music, effects, makeup, directing, editing, writing - everything was great! Wes Craven is definitely Master Pendants. Red Eye, of course, must-see, and it is worth spending money. You can watch this movie again and again and again, and it will never become boring. <br /> <br /> I want to say that red-eye is better than 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Original MPAA rating: PG-13: some intense violence sequences and language <br /> <br /> My MPAA rating: PG-13: some very intense violence sequences and language <br /> < br /> My Canada rating: 14A: violence, frightening scenes, anxious content
