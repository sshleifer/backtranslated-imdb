The innovative Technicolor Cinematography (Oscar winner for special technical achievements) is really charming. Add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a team of romantic cinematic dreams, such as Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer, and you get a pretty nice picture. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the contrived plot and the excessively carried away acting game leaves much to be desired. However, before that (1936) there were no more breathtaking Technicolor films, and since then very few that can surpass this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors. Fans of the cinema who enjoyed great color cinema at Robin Hood (1938), Jesse James (1939) and Gone With the Wind (1939) will not be disappointed with the fantastic work done here. "The Garden of Allah" will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography.
