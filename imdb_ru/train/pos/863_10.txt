I was completely absorbed in this film from the first to the last minute. It is beautifully shot, with many interesting and original angles and techniques. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who loves friends and colleagues. She hires an assistant at work, her true intention is to find love. He is a former prisoner, and she uses him to take revenge on those who hurt her. In return, she should help him with a robbery, which requires her to read lips. The film surpasses the dark noir film, with a pair of really excellent scenes and an even better ending. The real beauty in this film stems from the way the director uses the disability of the main character. The use of sound maintains a constant voltage, and abrupt transitions from silence to noise cause blood to pump, that's for sure. Add a little black comedy and shades of erotic sexual repression, and you get a great movie. This is the film that Hollywood really wants to make, but simply can not.
