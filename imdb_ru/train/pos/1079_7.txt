Although you haven’t seen too many films before, you’ve probably seen mainstream themes since. <br /> <br /> Not one of the best films of Grant and Loy, they make an outstanding effort together. In the end, with such a great talent and a very good cast, you know that they will laugh there. <br /> <br /> The film is lightweight, with some dramatic spots, but it makes the plot move and makes you smile as a whole. <br /> <br /> A great example of a classic American movie that stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> A definite sabbath afternoon snack, heavy for popcorn.
