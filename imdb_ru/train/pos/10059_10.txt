This movie is the best movie ever. I can't remember when the last time the movie caused me to cry. with tears in my eyes, I admire this film. It has all the elements that a good film should have: excellent dialogues, music, acting, plot / plot. The story of friendship, courage, kindness and devotion between the performance on the street, the famous King of the Masks, and the little girl sold by the boy at the fortress market. The little girl loved to be his granddaughter, and the King of Masks loved her grandson. They were not ordinary in real. Every scene where they were together was priceless. The camera work is flawless and captures you. The game is inspired. Xu Zhu was excellent as King of the Masks. Zhou “Doggie's” revival looks cute and her character plays well. Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was great. He played his good and kind-hearted character very well. If you do not have this film, try it once, watch it.
