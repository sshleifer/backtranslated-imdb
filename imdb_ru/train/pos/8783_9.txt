However, his opponent John Sullivan is still better - the old-school gangster played by Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is a person who fights for his big chance. Corbett leaves his worldly life behind and builds a new personality like Gentleman Jim. Jim is a casual person who can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and selfish.

And Errol Flynn gets a girlfriend.
