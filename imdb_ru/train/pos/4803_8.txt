It is difficult to find a frankly bad historical drama based on the life of any number of British monarchs. Just take with you a respected British or Australian actor, make things beautiful, and you are guaranteed the Oscar success formula. <br /> <br /> Young Victoria is no exception, realizing that everything is correct, the cinematography is striking and beautiful, with soft lights and lush colors and fabrics. In the lead role of Emily Blunt in the role that she can finally take off, the film begins with the 18th anniversary of Victoria and goes through intrigue and problems that surrounded her possible ascension to the throne and her famous marriage with Prince Albert (Rupert's Friend). As young Victoria herself complains, she moves like a chess pawn in various games, as she finds her footing and voice as one of the most influential British rulers. <br /> <br /> Although this movement around the chessboard is a fairly typical area, it is the development of Victoriaâ€™s relationship with Albert that makes the film a bit more interesting. I admit: I have a degree in history with a specialization in the Victorian era, so I am a little tied to these numbers. Despite their many shortcomings as rulers, Victoria and Albert were among the first leaders to devote themselves to improving the civilization of their people. They left their heritage in art, health care and education, as well as in the conservative views of Victoria and mourning culture after the death of Albert. But these things are only briefly hinted at during the film. <br /> <br /> It is well established that Victoria and Albert were not only madly in love, but also respected each other, which usually was not between monarchs. in contractual marriages. Even if it happened behind the scenes, they certainly were one of the most famous. Blaine and Friend have only the right type of chemistry to pay tribute to the famous couple, the right combination of restraint and despair. This is another love that is not usually shown on the screen, especially in this kind of films. It is encouraging to finally see relationships in which a man and a woman are on an equal playing field. <br /> <br /> But we cannot see this love enough. While the filmmakers are trying to fit into political attributes, this does not quite create the impetus necessary to maintain high tension. In addition, without delving into the more advanced, important social work of the couple, things seem a bit vague, superficial, not intimate, and sometimes confusing. This is not such a big problem during the film, but after that the effects are erased fairly quickly, and you try to remember what you just watched, despite the wonderful performances of the presenters, especially the noticeable Blunt, who even captures the expressions of the famous monarch. <br /> <br /> Despite all her efforts, Victoria succeeds on many levels, but she lacks that specific spark that would turn it from solid to classic.
