Pushing Daisies is just a cute fairy tale with hints of aesthetics and romance Amelie. He has a beautiful palette, his frames are well thought out and detailed, his names and dialogues are whimsical and too picky to be real, his imagination is great, and his romance is deep. <br /> <br /> Watch the blue sky on you, as blue cannot be found in other sets or frames (with rare exceptions). <br /> <br /> Watch a strangely natural and completely satisfying song coming out of the scene. <br /> <br /> His score is great, his cast is supremely cute, there is great music, and the two leading romantic stars can't touch each other, or she will die. How much more sexual tension do you need? (Actually, I would like them to find a way to get around this, but this is not true. <br /> <br /> This is just a show to spend an hour with, and I highly recommend it. There has never been such a television and I would like to see more. One week led to the flu because it's a good company. <br /> <br /> Return it!
