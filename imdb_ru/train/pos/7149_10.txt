Holes is a wonderful movie to watch. There are good messages in it, such as: be a good friend, never give up, etc. I highly recommend it to everyone. I still say that the book is better than the film, but the film makes the book run for its money. Also Cleo Thomas plays Zero. It really adds to this !!!! Lol !!!
