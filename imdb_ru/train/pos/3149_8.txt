Not since the Simpsons debuted, there was a comedy series, from which I did not want to go out for two minutes. Of course, it was said that The Simpsons killed the comedy. But not this one. <br /> <br /> The first season was such that the teenage characters were not as outrageous as they were later. They even sometimes went to school. The following seasons of the character somewhere have leaned. Erik, sarcastic fuck, Donna, his balanced girlfriend, Kelso, dim bulb, Hyde, conspiracy theorist and anti-establishment punk, Fez, a perverted exchange student, and finally Jackie, a spoiled rich whore. As for the adult characters, it was Eric's mom, suburban mom. "Can you believe she's so dizzy," Eric's dad, a straight arrow that certainly wasn't as tough as he seemed, Donna's dumb dad and her stupid blonde Mom. Everybody is true to their characters, but a special thanks to Kurtwood Smith, who finds the perfect balance between stamina and at the same time makes his Red Foreman very responsive, not forcing us to cheer on with unexpected appeal. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace, of course, is the main reason why this show is so good. This is a complex character, because he does not allow the actor to engage in wild replay, like the character Kelso, whom Ashton Kutcher played competently. I liked to see how these two characters interact, because they are very different. <br /> <br /> The character Hyde is a little harder to enjoy, because he is more realistic, and we really should see the story of the orphans for the hundredth time, although I will say that the writers have come up with a brilliant storyline for him in recent seasons. <br /> <br /> Jackie, played by voice musician from “Family Guy” Mila Kunis, is very funny and she has nails on the board. a voice that actually fits her character. The only sad part is that we did not see more scenes with her and Eric, because they were fun together. Too much of the story was wasted on her relationship problems, since we already got it in spikes with Eric and Donna. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the actors of the invited actors have always been great. A few favorites: Feza's huge girlfriend in the middle of the season, Pastor Dan, absolutely stunning Leo, played by no less amazing Thomas Chong, another of Fez's girlfriends, who is fully certified and has a special appearance with teenage witch Sabrina as a dissolute Catholic girl. <br /> <br /> Next time on Fox.
