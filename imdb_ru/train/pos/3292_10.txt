Paperhouse is the most touching and sharpest film I've ever seen. I think this is often considered a “horror movie.” This is a serious mistake. Some magazines once called him "The Nightmare of a Thinking Person on Elm Street," and although I accept the logic of his conclusion, I can't help but think that this is a tag that has badly earned and misleading. Those who can only see horror are really absent here and serve only to demonstrate what they do not think at all. <br /> <br /> In fact, just trying to classify this great work is probably a bad idea. Simply put, Paperhouse is perfect in every elegant detail and will always hold a special place in my heart. As someone wiser than I once said, “the film strikes you on a completely emotional level”, which can somehow explain why my comments flow so relentlessly. Honestly, I don’t apologize for this, so if you feel that my words are too saccharin for your taste, stop reading now because this is not all. <br /> <br /> It is very rare to find a film that his heart is the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the terrible sensations of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us in this fragile time in our lives. It is even more unusual to find child actors who can really play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence necessary for all this to work. At Charlotte Burke and Elliot Spiers, we had an inspired cast, and the long-term influence of Paperhouse is largely due to their ability to flawlessly and convincingly portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood (often overlooked). <br /> <br /> Yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to slip through the grip of the studios and somehow disappeared. <br /> <br /> Add to all this an incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose), creative cinema and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you have ever heard, and you can begin to understand why I have such affection and affection for this film that no amount of words can express. <br /> <br />
