Very clever, very pre-sented code, and yet very sassy. I highly recommend watching this movie, even if you're not a Stynwyck fan. She is funny, she is sexy, she is hardworking - and she likes this perm! <br /> <br /> Barbara Steenwick is a fantastic little fool who rises in the world and is beautifully depicted in the bank building. John Wayne (in costume!) Plays one of his first victories. <br /> <br /> The last three minutes are disappointing, but the sets, the lines, the clothes all add to the movie about a vertical lift in a horizontal position.
