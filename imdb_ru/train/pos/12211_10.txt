“Hook” or “Crook” is an extremely innovative film from a pair of incredibly intelligent and talented directors, Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They manage to tell the original story in a characteristic cinematic style, and it is beautifully filmed by Anna T. Rosetti and wonderfully written - truly poetical. <br /> <br /> The protagonists are true heroes and serve as a rare role model / inspiration for dams and trenches around the world. In this film, so much energy, so much sharp passion and a battered heart of San Francisco. I can not recommend this highly enough! <br /> <br /> Best Friendship film of all time!
