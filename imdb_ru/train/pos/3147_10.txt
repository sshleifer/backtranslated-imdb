This show is beautiful. He has some of the best works I've ever seen. He has a brilliant director from Dvid Trainer, who also directed another clever television series called BOY MEETS WORLD. <br /> <br /> This show is one of the most outstanding. Like THREE COMPANIES, ROSANNA and the famous KOSBI SHOW, it will be on television for a long time. <br /> <br /> From perfect jokes to great performances that you only dream of, this is a wonderful show for people who lived in the seventies and people who did not live. This show appeals to young and young at heart. The perfect show.
