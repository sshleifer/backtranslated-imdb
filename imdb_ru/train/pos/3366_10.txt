Ettore Scola, one of the most sophisticated and great directors of whom we have citizens of the world, is not yet available on DVD ... (it's summer of 2001 ...). <br /> <br /> This great classic returned to the cinemas in my hometown thanks to Sophia Loren - a summer retrospective, and see her again on the big screen after all these years of watching on video tape ... this is a real gift. <br /> <br /> To avoid criticism, but, nevertheless, try to prove your point: I took my reluctant little brother with me to watch this movie. He had never seen the film before and “does not like these Italian old men ...” Like everyone else in the theater, he was intrigued by this miracle. Even during the final titles the theater was silent. <br /> <br /> This SPECIAL DAY is really special. Miracle of refinement. And a big loss if you haven't seen it yet ...
