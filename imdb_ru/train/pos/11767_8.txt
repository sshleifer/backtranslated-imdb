What a good movie! Made Men - an excellent action movie with many turns. James Belushi is very good as a former hood who stole 12 million from a boss who must protect the gangsters, kill his wife and the local sheriff (Timothy Dalton). You will not be disappointed, jump aboard and enjoy the ride. 8 out of 10
