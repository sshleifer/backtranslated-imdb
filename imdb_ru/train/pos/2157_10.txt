Good. As you can see, this is one of my favorite, if not my favorite films. This is a characteristic drama that is absolutely fun. The main character is a business man who is stuck in the “same day, another day” mentality. He sees a woman who sadly looks out the window of the dance studio from his train every day, and is surprised by her and decides to learn more about her. He decides to join the dance class, only to find out that she is not an instructor. From there, he communicates with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing, as well as learning about the mysterious woman. <br /> <br /> There is no useless (or any) sex, just how a small group of people learn. how the friendship develops and develops. <br /> <br /> This film was remade along with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, and the new, though attractive, is nowhere in the same pleasure as the original. The film has never been a big success in America because it did not have an Oscar title, as it was shown on television in Japan (films cannot be released on television, or they cannot be nominated for an Oscar). In Japan, he received many awards for best film, actors, directors, etc. For his Oscar awards.
