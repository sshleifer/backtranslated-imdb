The fact that this film was released on DVD, still formatted for television and with a fuzzy picture, really annoyed many supporters of the film ...... and rightly so. It deserves much better treatment. <br /> <br /> A story about a street performer who needs a son to transfer his skills (the rules of the day), and instead he turns out to be with a little girl (not the usual way) .... and the problems that arise later. The old man bought the child at the slave auction and soon discovered that the child was not a boy, which, obviously, he thought so. <br /> <br /> Old Man “Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is a kind of funny looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin. Little girl "Dog" (Zhou Rening) cutie. The rest of the story is how the two manage after that. I usually love a good sentimental ending, but it turns out a little carried away in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a story that includes drama, suspense, humor and sadness. Just don’t expect a good quality picture for the money you spend on a DVD. Until it comes out on a widescreen screen, rent it.
