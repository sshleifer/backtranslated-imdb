I was 10 years old when this show was on TV. Of course, it was my favorite. The actors were very trustworthy. Alexandra Bestedo was just great ... I just order a DVD (15 episodes). They did not have superpowers. They simply possessed superior human skills (strength, hearing, vision). 3 actors were very good in their roles, very believable. Every episode had a good story. There were no special effects or explosions at that time, so the script had to be good, and the characters great. There were no fancy things like in other shows. They did not try to joke every 2 minutes to arrange a light show. I highly recommend this TV show to anyone who likes good things.
