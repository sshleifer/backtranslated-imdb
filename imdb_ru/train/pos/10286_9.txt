This movie is awesome! Being fun and interesting, he is also deep and opening his eyes. I will watch it again and again. Bruce is a guy who is not happy with his life. He has a job and a life, but he thinks that this is not something that will bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, dissatisfied and resentful that his life is not what he believes. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce loses his job and blames God for everything that he believes is wrong with his life. God comes to Bruce and gives him divine powers. Bruce uses these abilities to get everything he always wanted. His life, finally, is exactly what he thought would make him happy ... with one exception. In the process of getting everything, he loses the only person who really loved him. When the film unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change that was to happen in his life was not the circumstances, but his perception of what really was. This film was inspiring and deep. If you really pay attention, it makes you look at your life with deeply humiliating respect for the fact that in most cases we are much more blessed than we realize. As my wife says: "Since when does anyone know what it takes to make them happy?" And my modest addition: "May we not lose ourselves and those who matter as long as we try to figure it out."
