Similar films about young adolescents who struggle with their own sexuality were something unique, daring and audacious a couple of years ago, but more and more of these films have been made over the past few years, making it still difficult for movies to stand out. . . <br /> <br /> In addition, this film received little publicity, with the exception of the usual small film festivals, in which this small French film was shown, as well as major festivals, which always like similar small films about everyday topics that are not handled too much. often in the movies. The film premiered in Cannes in 2007, and in fact it also received several awards there. <br /> <br /> The film doesn’t stand out among the others, because in fact there’sn’t much of new in it when you’ve already seen several similar films. such as this, but this, however, does not really mean that "Naissance des pieuvres" is bad to watch. This is certainly a good watch that does a good job with its theme and tells its story steadily, and therefore effectively, in a typical, rather slow, French cinematic pace. <br /> <br /> This is an adult film, which focuses on the lives of mostly 3 completely different teenagers. Sexuality is a big theme in a film that is delicately and subtly solved. This makes the film and its history as a whole rather realistic, although perhaps a bit predictable, since the film does not offer anything original enough in its genre. <br /> <br /> This type of French film is likely to scare many people because they probably expect it to be very clever, with deep layers and meanings for it. "Naissance des pieuvres", however, is a very affordable film for everyone, and you really do not need to get involved in European teen films to appreciate this film. It is a pleasant and somewhat sensual film due to its plot and visual approach. <br /> <br /> Actors who have not had and have extensive experience in the cinema, make the film realistic. the movie business, but they look genuine in their roles. Strong individual characters give the film good themes and good moments. <br /> <br /> Good movie on this topic. <br /> <br /> 7/10
