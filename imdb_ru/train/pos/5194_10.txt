This is one of my favorite martial arts movies from Hong Kong. This is one of the earliest films of John Woo and one of the few films about traditional martial arts that he shot. You can see his influence from working under Chang Cech in this film. The action is good, the battle choreography is led by Phong Hack He, who appears as one of the bad guys in the film. It starred Wei Pei, known as The Five Poisons, and many people familiar to fans of the Golden Harvest and Brothers Show productions. The storyline is interesting, there are several decent plot twists, and the creation of characters and their relationship with each other is clever. This film was released only in the UK. Media Asia has released a DVD for Region 3, and there are DVD versions available from the USA. The film is nice to watch in original or English language. I highly recommend this movie.
