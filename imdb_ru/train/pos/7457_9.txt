This is one of the best connections I've ever played, because: <br /> <br /> Playing missions is a lot of fun, there are a lot of actions in them, sometimes they can be very difficult, which makes them even more fascinating. the weapon you use is really good. The cars in this game are really good, the driving missions are fun. This James Bond game has a good story. The voice acting of the actors in this game is really good, and it's great that Pierce Brosnan in this game, and what the characters look like is really good, because they look the way they look in real life, which is really great. Also the graphics in this game are pretty good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating ********* of **********
