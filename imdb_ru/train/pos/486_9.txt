“Protection Luzhin” is a film worthy of anyone. This is a thoughtful, intense film that constantly attracted my attention. John Turturro is absolutely stunning in his image of a gentle, eccentric chess grandmaster, and Emily Watson is fascinating as a gentle, but rebellious daughter of a highly respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on the screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in history. Overall, this film is one of the best detailed reviews of the life of a chess grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson bring to the film a non-mainstream sensation without a cliché. Most people will leave the theater, thinking and feeling somewhat moved by this brilliant look at the most incredible love stories.
