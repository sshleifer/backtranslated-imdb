The filmmaker breathed in Andy Goldsworthy's art, his search for intimacy with earth and water, and his sense of proportion — and so gently, so beautifully returned it to the film for all of us. “Rivers and Tides” love the work of Goldsworthy and join it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world, a world that hides its power in plain sight. Watch this movie!
