Unfortunately, this film did not get on DVD. I saw it when it was first released in theaters in 1983, and then again when VHS was released in 1992. When I recently saw a copy of VHS at a flea market, I immediately bought it. I was not disappointed. First, the obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and joy to contemplate. But then the film takes you to an unreal world where you have to think about your values ​​and decide what is really important to you. A film about many things. It’s about how the World Bank and large corporations exploit and enslave the developing countries with their capitalist schemes to get them into debt that they can never repay. It's about how our economic system exploits us, forcing us into debt with credit cards, mortgages, and paying cars. It is about trying to save innocence, which perhaps we never had, and perhaps we cannot really save. It is about good and evil and how difficult it is sometimes to distinguish one from the other. This raises many questions, but does not give answers. I think sometimes it's good. For this reason, this film is really worth saving and watching.
