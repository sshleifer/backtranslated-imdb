I looked at the description of the film on TCM and let it run, because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really liked the film and found it rather exceptional. Of course, this is seriously outdated, but as a historical material one should look only at subtle humor in understanding life and lifestyle almost forty years ago. Now the only problem is to try to find it on DVD, so that I can watch it more often. I was also very passionate about the performances of Smith and Ustinov as presenters, as well as Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and the occasional roles of Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
