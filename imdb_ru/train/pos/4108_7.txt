Kurosawa, fresh in color, loses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and chooses a dismal look at Tokyo's slums. Kurosawa is drawn to a style that, in my opinion, was his opposite, that is, I feel as if Kurosawa wanted to make a picture of Ozu. Poorly thought out, poorly thought out, this film is a rare failure in this author's body of excellent work. While Ikira, being mundane and depressing, was still interesting and dynamic, and the Stray dog ​​portrayed the slums and social poverty of Japan, not being too heavy or boring, all the gloom that can be expected , without any redemptive qualities of the previous paintings of Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> Be careful, this is not a film by which Kurosawa must judge.
