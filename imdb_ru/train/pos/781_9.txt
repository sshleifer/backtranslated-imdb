Crush explores female friendship, for the most part avoiding the quality of saccharin, which spoils so many films with the same theme (for example, Steel Magnolias). At the same time, it reveals the power of sudden passion to crush and surprise. The events depicted were incredible, but the underlying emotional truth seemed very sincere to me. Not a film for a car huddling at speed and an explosion, but adult women will surely respond with laughter and tears.
