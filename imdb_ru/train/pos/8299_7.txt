When scientist and family man Matt Winslow (Robert Urich) finally accepts an invitation to work with Micro-Digitech in the space suit project, he moves with his beloved wife Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and their son Robbie (Barret Oliver) and daughter Krissy (Soleil Moon Frye) in a huge modern home in a corporation complex. They meet their friend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family, completely adapted to the new way of life, and Tom invites the Winslow family to join the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom is trying to seduce Matt, telling him that every member of the club has a swift professional ascent to the Micro-Digitech, but Matt does not seduce the offer. Later, he is introduced to the club’s director, Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci), who is friends with Patricia and convinces her to join the club with her children. Matt feels a change in his family’s behavior and decides to investigate the club, finding an evil secret about Jessica and her members. <br /> <br /> In the 80s, when I saw Invitation to Hell, I liked this film, which partially resembles Stephen's Wife, with people changing behavior in a suburban complex. I just saw it today, and I found a great metaphorical message against large corporations when people literally sell their souls to the devil in order to rise to positions and get higher salaries. I’m not sure if the author intended to give this interpretation of the story, but I think it’s perfect. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Convite Para o Inferno" (Invitation to Hell)
