While on the plane, flipping through a large selection of films, I came across Live! almost by accident. Oh, man! which choice. <br /> <br /> I remembered dimly when I saw the trailer more than a year ago, and completely forgot about it, expecting nothing more than another stupid, meaningless film about a stupid reality show. Now I can easily say that it was a hell of a trip. I don't remember the last time I was so excited, scared. I'm not sure that it was a great height, playing with my feelings, but the tension gradually increases throughout the film until it reaches a climax when you can not turn away from the screen, literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails you received. <br /> <br /> First you will pass a personal moral assessment of how you are right to the show. You stop thinking “why can a person be so angry” and “why not?”. Ask yourself if you do this. Then learn about the contestants, their motives and start guessing. Then you will observe how the participant pulls the trigger one by one and you are worried even if you know that the first candidate is safe. <br /> <br /> A good game, good direction and experience that reminds you of those old films where you knew what would happen in the next scene, but still craved more. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * a couple of things that I would change: <br /> <br /> - casting participants. I was really touched by the farmer, and we should have been a bit more like him. The thought of a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit silly, it seemed that you didn’t care about some of the contestants. Although this could have been done on purpose, I think the audience should have been able to communicate with most of the participants. - rules of the game, big crash: <br /> <br /> what will happen if the 5th participant does not die when he pulls the trigger. You seriously think that the last guy standing will pull the trigger and perform himself !!! they had to give a chance to all the participants to survive, that is: if the 5th is also an empty space, then no one will die. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, these bad moments didn't bother me too much, because I had a really good time. would just like popcorn with me!
