We recorded it on tape when it was broadcast on television in 1995, and all these years have been waiting for it to be released, as it quickly became one of the favorites in our family. The children are now teenagers and must have seen it many times, but they still watch it with friends. This timeless treatment applies to all age groups - similar to Lubricant. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams is impressive. Jason Alexander is amazing and wonderfully light on his feet. I noticed that other commentators on this site are rather rude to him, but our family gives him top marks. (We liked his number “Giant Pitch”.) Mark Kudish (as Conrad) provides us with comedic relief and wonderful musical numbers. And Bridgette Dow (like Ursula) just steals the show. Probably our favorite character in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment was Chinna Phillip’s performance over Kim. This is partly due to the writing. The role of Kim is completely one-dimensional. Complicating the fact that Phillip’s delivery is flat, unimaginable, incredible and just awful. The director had to see and fix it. Or never drop it from the start. <br /> <br /> Overall, the picture is amazing, and I highly recommend it for families of all ages.
