For example, I shamelessly enjoyed every episode of "Pushing Daisies" this season, and I hope that the writers' strike will not lead to a cruel end of the very good show. Ned is a cake maker, he owns a restaurant in the city center and has a secret talent. Emmerson is a private investigator who has his own unique features, such as his love of knitting. Charlotte (Chuck) - once deceased, but no longer a childhood friend and the sunny spot of Ned's life. Olive is jealous but kind-hearted waitress. Oh, and add the dog. Jim Dale brings together all the characters along with his wonderful narration of the show. Chuck, Ned and Emmerson, along with Oliva and sometimes the dog, solve many mysteries of murder with the help of a special gift from Ned, which brings dead people back to life. The show is funny, clean and romantic, very sweet and kind-hearted, and I recommend it to everyone.
