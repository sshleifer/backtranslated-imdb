I always have some distrust before watching films of the British period, because I usually find them boring and boring scenarios (such as, for example, Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl), but with magnificent European design landscapes and those thick British accents, which give films an artistic value that they don’t really have. Fortunately, the great film "Young Victoria" does not fall into this situation, and it deserves an enthusiastic recommendation because of its exciting history, the excellent performances of Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent, as well as the costumes and places that suddenly make quite rich in appearance. And I say “unexpectedly,” because usually I don’t pay too much attention to these details. <br /> <br /> “The Victorian era” was (in my humble opinion) one of the key moments in modern civilization, not only in social, but also in scientific, artistic and cultural aspects. but I, frankly, did not know very well about the origins of that era, and perhaps because of this I really liked this simplification of the political and economic events that prepared the landing of the modern era. I also liked the way Queen Victoria is portrayed as a young and intelligent monarch, whose decisions were not always good, but at least they were inspired by good intentions. I also found the description of the novel between Victoria and Prince Albert very interesting, because he is equally interested in the combination of intelligence as well as the emotions he evokes. The only flaw I discovered in this film is that screenwriter Julian Fellowes used some of the cliches of a romantic movie in a love story, which is a little out of place in his script. /> <br /> I really liked “Young Victoria”, and I was really surprised by her. I hope that more historical films will follow the example of this film: costumes and landscapes should work as support for an interesting story, and not as its replacement.
