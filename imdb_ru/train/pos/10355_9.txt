A fascinating film based on real events about an Australian woman Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), accused of killing her daughter. She insists that the dingo took her child, but the story is very suspicious. The film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case, the way the Australians interpreted what was presented in the media, and the mentality of the vigilante crowd that ultimately led to the conviction of a woman solid evidence. I love films that call into question the media, as well as films that examine in detail how people are affected by the justice system. I always thought that jurors should be shown 12 Angry Men before they fulfill their duties. This is not, as they often say, a liberal film, but a clinical view of how we, people, interpret events based so much on our prejudices and the desire for revenge. Creek in the dark is also clinically. She tries not to make the film melodramatic at all. Some people may find the film dull or dry, but I found it attractive.
