In New York, when the shy and lonely project manager of the design firm Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets in the subway Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman), he invites her for a date and dine with him. Jenny immediately falls in love with him, they have sex, and she reveals to him her true identity, saying that she is a powerful superhero G-Girl. After meeting with her colleague and friend Hannah Lewis (Anna Faris), the needy Jenny becomes jealous, controlling and manipulating, and Matt follows the advice of her best friend Vaughn Hage (Rein Wilson) and throws her, breaking her heart. Jenny turns Matt's life into hell, while he has an affair with Hannah. However, the sworn enemy of G-Girl and Jenny’s former school sweetheart, Professor Bedlam (Eddie Izzard), offers Matt to lure Jenny to deprive her of her superpowers. <br /> <br /> “My super ex-girlfriend” is amazingly silly and funny. This romantic comedy-adventure has many fun moments and is very interesting. Luke Wilson is great as an idiot, Anna Farris is extremely sexy as usual, and Uma Thurman is great as an insane neurotic superhero recalled by Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction" or Evelyn Draiper in "Play Misty For Me". My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Minha Super Ex-Namorada" ("My Super Ex-Girlfriend")
