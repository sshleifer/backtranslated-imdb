Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I've ever seen in theaters. My father took my sister and me, and the funny thing is - when we returned home, dad asked us: “What do you want to do now?” And we said that we want to see Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad actually drove us back to the theater to watch it again - at least that's how i remember it. At that time I was five years old. <br /> <br /> This film was pretty scary for a five year old child. A scene with a giant ocean of sweets and a hypnotic camel scene. I don’t remember much of this movie, naturally, the beginning was magical, and a few scenes - I would like to find it again, and I will most likely look for it now. <br /> <br /> I remember that I loved Raggedy Ann & Andy.
