Hardly a masterpiece. Not so well written. Beautiful cinematography, I think not. This film was not too terrible, but not much better than average. The main story of extremely immoral adolescents should have focused more on the forbidden romance and why he had ... really had to penetrate it instead of scratching the surface mostly "because mother says we can't." Some pieces had to be rejected completely or recycled to make a difference in the plight of the two main characters. A couple of times I wondered if the writer / director was a fan of the classic American graffiti of George Lucas. Not that it's wrong to be a fan of this movie, but that your movie sometimes looks like this, I mean, come on! Worst of all, Madhen Amica had such a small part, I mean, come on twice !! She was the only one or two lines who actually tried the southern accent. (Listen carefully, it was there, although her character was from California! DOH !!) Maybe if she were a star, followed by others, and we would have a more authentic sounding film. Well, what can you do when you have a director who is just a director and not an artist? Very bad. In general, I give it to B-, and this is a bit generous, because I am partial to Miss Amick.
