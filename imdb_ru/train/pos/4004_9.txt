“Mother” is an extraordinary part of filmmaking — it makes you think, it doesn’t pull blows on itself — and, in the end, it makes you think. The very open fate of the main character. Ann Reed (whom I only briefly knew from her performances in some projects led by Victoria Wood and thought it was a good comedian) is really great here. A non-stereotypical widowed housewife who was perfect in marriage and motherhood. And not everything is so free and bold at first sight. She plays her character only with the right note, which rings true (well, it did for me). Powerful cast. Great script. Renaissance European cinema really;)
