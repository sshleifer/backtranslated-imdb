If in your life there was a drama, or yours, or someone from your loved ones, the stage of pain that this woman is going through (but, in my opinion, it could be a man) is very, very real. This is a film that you cannot cope with your pain, that you donâ€™t know what to do to help yourself cope with it. Obviously, this is also a film about how not to know how to help people close to you through their pain. This is a movie that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering. This is a film that can push someone ... which hardly sounds like a recommendation. I'm not sure that I would recommend someone to go see this movie, especially to someone close, but for me ... this is a film that shows things in perspective, shows real pain and is therefore very important for life. It makes you realize that hey, you or a person close to you have experienced pain, that hey, all that you are worried about right now is so little important.
