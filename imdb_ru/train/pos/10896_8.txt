At first, I didnâ€™t think that Ben Affleck could actually make a funny Christmas movie. The boy was wrong, my daughter invited me to look at it with her, and I was not at all disappointed. James Gandolfini was funny, I really liked Christina Appelagate, and Catherine O'Hara was also good, the storyline is what really sold me, I mean, put up with my family too much at the table for people you barely see but once or twice a year, and probably not getting along with you anyway, you really need as much alcohol as your system can handle to cope with Christmas, so I thought the package was good buying a family with 250,000 dollars was a bit far-fetched, but as it turned out It worked quite well for me because it was a riot, it shows the class struggle of different families. He has a lot of funny moments, including awkward things on a computer for a teenager. In general, I loved this film and will watch it again next Christmas or earlier, if my daughter also wants.
