This is a great film, it shows that our government will be in relation to other countries if we do not like their government. This is not as bad as what Reagan and Bush are number one with South America, but the US still does not have a business, messing with other such countries. These films also prove that the American media is spreading government propaganda. This is exactly what they did with Aristide in Haiti. The reason that this coup against Chávez was not successful is that Chavez was elected with more than 90% of the vote. <br /> <br /> This film is not just a political documentary, it would still be a great film, if it were a drama, it's amazing that this is real. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer lies when he says: “Chavez is capturing the broadcast,” private media all the time carry out propaganda against Chávez.
