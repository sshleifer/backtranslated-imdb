This movie was awesome. He had an original concept (a film about vampires meets a film about a mafia Yakuza). This is a humorous, but at the same time very dramatic and tragic film about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness, and subtly commenting on society. On Gact Kamui’s part, Sho’s role was superbly performed, and HYDE was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured but humorous vampire Kei. I also laughed and cried over the happy hero Toshi, who grew up with Sho. I liked every second of this film, especially moments like a funny cigarette scene, fighting scenes and, most importantly, a heartbreaking ending.
