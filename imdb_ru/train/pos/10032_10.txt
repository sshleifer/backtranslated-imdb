I liked this movie since I was 7, and I saw it on opening day. It was so touching and beautiful. I highly recommend seeing everything. This is a movie that is worth seeing with your family. <br /> <br /> My MPAA rating: PG-13 for thematic elements, long scenes of catastrophes, nude / sexuality and some language.
