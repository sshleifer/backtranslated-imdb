BACK TO ME (2007) *** Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burroughs, Donald Sutherland, Robert Klein, Melinda Dillon, Mike Binder, Jonathan Banks, Ray Allen, Paula Newsom. Occasionally affecting and sometimes even the average drama about a deeply depressed person who lost his family on September 11th (Sandler in his best role after “Punch-drunk love”), who eventually reunites with his old roommate and college friend (Cheadle ) continuing to do impressive work with every role today), a wealthy dentist who seems to have it all ?? family, wealth, happiness ?? but really sees an ally in freedom with his problem friend's own life donations. Written and directed by Binder (who is acting as Sandler's former best friend and current accountant) with equal humor and sincere heartache. The film works best when the two stars share the screen, until the last act turns into an almost motion picture. weekly molasses to tidy up the solution at hand.
