I am disappointed by the lack of posts in this amazing and effective little film. Geordi Molla is probably best known for his role as Diego in The Beat by Ted Demme "Writing, directing and shooting stars." <br /> <br /> I will not give out any plot points, as in the film (at least for me) it was very interesting, not knowing anything about it ... If you have an account on Netflix or You have access to the video store in which it will be ... I highly recommend it. This is a crazy, fun, and sometimes very thought-provoking creation. <br /> <br /> The direction of Molla is quite impressive and promising. <br /> <br /> Unpredictable, with stunning images and Awesome performance on the beautiful Spanish "No somos nadie" (God Live) is an amazing movie that you can show to your friends. <br /> <br /> LOOK.
