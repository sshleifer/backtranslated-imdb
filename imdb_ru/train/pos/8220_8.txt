Fourth in the Dirty Harry series, this film shows one of the most disgusting, ugly, unsightly, obscene, disgusting women I have ever seen in the movie: Ray Perkins, played by Audrey Ninan. She is the modern vile, unassuming version of the 1945 Detour character, Ann Savage. <br /> <br /> Her disgusting mouth and inhospitable mood pushed me away so much that I never watched this film until I acquired a profanity filter that plugged it .... and at least some of it! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Wherever “Harry Callahan” (Clint Eastwood) goes, violence follows immediately ... in a few minutes! It happens so often that it is almost ridiculous, but it makes a fast-moving, entertaining film with a satisfactory ending, since all the scoundrels are destroyed one by one. <br /> <br /> This is a very sophistic film that appeals to our basic instincts ..... and connects, unfortunately. Most of us like to see how these dirty balls get it at the end, and who does it better than Dirty Harry?
