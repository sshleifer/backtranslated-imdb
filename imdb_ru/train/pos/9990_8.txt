I recently watched a movie, and I really liked it. I was surprised and wept. This film belongs to the same genre of the niche as Far Away from It - or even the Bucket List, but handles the entire topic of aging with incredible certainty. It's really hard to have a main character as unpleasant as Hagar. The director masterfully copes with the task. Hagar is hard to understand. Her world has sharp edges, and she is not a warm, charming woman at all. <br /> <br /> The first scene shows this without any compromise. Agar (Ellen Bernstein) is taking her son and daughter-in-law to the nursing home. She finds this out on the way and goes crazy. Its edges are really hard. She is mean. It is degrading and selfish. She is a stone. I did not like it - even a little. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, we understand. We find out why she does not like petunias, why she prefers one son to another, how her losses shaped her character ... I began to see an angel ... and I began to love her. I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to a boy in a shack. Ellen Bernstein, you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene! <br /> <br /> This is not a “feel good” film, but this is a film that arouses sympathy in the viewer. I more clearly understand that in human life there are hard edges that need to be protected, they exist for a specific reason ... <br /> <br /> Hagar is not my mother, she is not even my mother-in-law or a neighbor ... but parts of it are present in many women (and men) in my life. These parts for some reason make more sense to me now that I watched the Stone Angel.
