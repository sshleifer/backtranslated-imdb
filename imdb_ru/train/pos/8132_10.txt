I do not remember when I first heard about this film, but I shot it about six years ago, and it still remains one of my favorite comedies. I admit that you will probably despise this film if you know nothing about rap music. But if you're a rap fan, even a random one, you'll love jokes and links. One of the best lines in the film about the difference between a b **** and a h **; I still use this line today and get a lot of laughter from it. One of the best performances - Larry Scott, who played the botanist Lamar in "Revenge of Nerds". Unfortunately, this film will most likely never get a DVD release.
