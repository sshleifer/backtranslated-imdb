I liked these movies. This is another film about Yash Raj, which, as you know, will look good on the screen, all the characters are always good or very good, with one exception, which, as you know, will eventually turn into a pleasant one ... Another rule Yash Raj movie - hero or heroine; s have only one or no parent. Remember all these movies. Sukman didn't have a mom at the IPC, Salman had no parents at the HMAPK. And finally, the rule is that you will see Alok Nath with a 90% chance ... <br /> <br /> The film is also good. At first it's a little slow, but it entertains you. There is almost no comedy, but it makes you smile quite often. A small child (the hero's nephew) is in a good position and delivers very good liners. The actress is very beautiful, but shy, you will not get it in real life. In this film there are no big happy families living in a BIG house, which I think was a good idea and allowed us to distinguish the film from other films. At the end of the film there will be a lot of women crying. There are no strong messages in this film, but this is a good watch. If you are married (arranged a marriage), the film will remind you of what you went through. And if not, he will inform and may scare you ... <br /> <br /> Overall, the film looks very good. No big plots or twists, but a very gentle film, very similar to the Bollywood classics.
