and possibly closest to Dickens’s storyline. Although I find young Ebenezer difficult to observe (whose idea was in that period, of course, they could do better!), Scott does an incredible job as Scrooge. His delivery of some lines from Dickens finally brought me to my senses. Edward Woodward is all that we expect, and even more gift "Ghost of Christmas." I find gs Scrooge Scott is a much more believable miser than the more recent version made by Patrick Stewart. The “Christmas Morning” scene, when Scrooge understands that he “did not miss,” is enough to convince one that Scott knows how to act, not replay. He is phenomenal here. Almost the whole cast is incredible. Tiny Tim in this version of “The Christmas Carol” is a bit complex, almost too sweet. However, music and landscapes make this a must for every holiday. Enjoy!
