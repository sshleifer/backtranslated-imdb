“Upcoming Events” is an early science fiction film that shows the imaginary world, or “Everytown” in 100 years. You can break it into 4 different scenes or parts. The film covers the period from 1940 to 2036 and mainly tells about how this ruler or “Boss” wanted to get the opportunity to fly again on airplanes after the bombing of Everytown and the start of the war. <br /> <br /> This film only has about 3 errors: the sound is fuzzy, there are some quirks in the video, the characters are not at all deep, and the plot is not quite solid. The plot lacks something that I can't understand ... it just seems a little fluffy. But if you like science fiction and are interested in what could happen to HG Wells in the next hundred years, you should definitely see it. It is worth looking to find out what everyone was afraid of: a long, protracted war, because they were going to go to war with Germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything else. <br /> <br /> “Upcoming Events” is a pretty good film that most people need to watch once.
