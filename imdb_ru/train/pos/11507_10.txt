I remember the original series mainly because of its unique combination of wry humor and dark plot. Kolchak was a cruel journalist from the school reporting on the big cities of Ben Hecht, and his resolute determination and wise behavior made even the most ordinary episode extremely noticeable. My favorite movie was Spanish Moss Kills because of a completely original plot. A poor, restless Cajun youth from the state of Louisiana, who sheltered the country, takes part in a sleep study experiment to analyze sleep. Something is inexplicably wrong, and he literally dreams about the life of a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth. This malevolent manifestation reveals all the people who have offended the dreamer in his conscious state, and cruelly stifled them to death. Kolchak investigates and uncovers this terrible truth, much to the chagrin of police captain Joe Mad Dog Siski (wonderfully written by grumpy Keenan Wynn) and a sleep researcher played by the founder of the improvised Second City epoch, Severn Darden, to be content with playing up perfection. The ominously funny, tormenting finale takes place in the Chicago sewer system and is the highlight of the series. Kolchak never recovered. Timeless
