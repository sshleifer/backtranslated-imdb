The first word that comes to my mind after watching this film is “beauty”. Beauty is everywhere, in the acting game (Andy is gorgeous as always), in well-designed shots and in the idea of ​​the red line of the authors - in Love. <br /> <br /> I think Kenny's character is the only white place in these three women of an otherwise boring and predictable life. His interaction makes Andy's character alive as interesting as possible. When he left, it became obvious that we could not truly appreciate and adhere to our inner convictions and sacred desires. <br /> <br /> The fact that Andy is recovering from this loss is not a bad thing, but shows that life prevails in any form, even in this small British village, which is beautifully shown. <br /> <br /> Another reason why I love this film is that it is so British in all respects - all this is at home, "jokes" and accents :))). And Andy does an excellent job again! It's a shame that this film received such low marks. 10 out of ten!
