This film is so wonderful. This happened in the 40s, and the character Meg Ryan is fighting to be called "smart." Plus Tim Robbins is so cute in this movie. And all this has a magical feeling for it. Every time I watch this, I feel happy. This is definitely a female movie, and I'm a girl, so I like it. I love music too. The violin is awesome. but beyond that, I think it's a sweet story, and everyone should watch it.
