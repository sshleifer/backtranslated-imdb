I love Paul McCartney. He is, in my opinion, the greatest of all times. However, I could not afford a ticket to his Tacoma Dome concert on the Back in the US tour. I was upset, to say the least. Then I found this DVD. It was almost as good as being there. Sex is still human, and I will enjoy it for years to come. <br /> <br /> I have one complaint. I would like to hear all about Hi Jude. <br /> <br /> Also, Paul was not dead. <br /> <br /> The biggest live DVD ever. <br /> <br /> ** *** outside *****.
