This is what one of the girls said at the end. <br /> <br /> Is playing football a metaphor for a qualifying game between girls (or, in a broader sense, a free-thinking group) and power? “To Germany” means a future that has hope? <br /> <br /> This is one of the most memorable cinematic experiences that I have ever had - despite the rough cinematography and plot, as well as moderate overstrain (although I like the cast - they are attractive and much higher than the expectation for fans ). Funny situation is well captured. I feel deeply disappointed when they refuse to play me (being a woman and a fan of football), and I can't stop thinking about how to make a convincing disguise. It is interesting why there is no female section in which you can provide protection from dirty vocabulary and bad behavior - by defeating the wrong reasons for refusal. <br /> <br /> The film is made very cleverly - an amazing title, shooting during the game itself, spontaneity and various methods to put the audience in the skin of the characters - a game that is so important but not available (not shown), seductive light the cheering sound from the stadium, the conclusion of the van, and the futility of it when those inside are connected to the celebrating crowds outside. I feel comfort coming from the radio, drinks and food, and, of course, the kindness and attention of each character to others. During the final credits I am surprised that not a single character has a name - he is just a “soldier”, and she is just a “girl” or “sister”.
