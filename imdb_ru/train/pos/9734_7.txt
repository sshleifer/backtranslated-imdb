Well, here's another, well, romantic comedy ... but unlike all other films of this genre, this is definitely the best I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> I admit, at first I wanted to watch this movie because of Megan Fox, and a little because of Simon Pegg ... <br /> <br /> First of all, if you watched a decent amount of movies , you will find out that Sydney and Alison will be together in the film, anyway ... but from the beginning to the end of the film you won’t know how ... <br /> <br /> OK, now this film is only for Simon Pegga. I don’t see another actor in the role of Sydney, and I’m sure that it would be a very weak film if it weren’t for Pegg’s great game. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of great jokes and jokes in this movie that made me laugh a lot, thanks to the character of Simon Pegg Sydney ... but I think everyone in this movie is good. For example, Kirsten Dunst is really solid in this film, do not think of her as something more res, but she was really good at it), then Jeff Bridges, Gillian Anderson and, of course, Megan Fox, who plays a spoiled bitch Sophie Mace. .. excellent role for her ... <br /> <br /> In general, although I usually disagree with her estimates on IMDb, this time I completely agree with them ... <br /> <br /> Go and see this movie, it's really carefree and positive, and I recommend it deeply ... My rating is 7 out of 10 ... well, 7.5 actually ...
