Going Berserk is actually one of the funniest Candy films I've ever seen. Of course, this is a bit of a budget, but this is a non-stop comedy tour. There are tons of memorable quotes. For example, when his future father-in-law asks him how much he earns, Candy replies: â€œOh, I pull somewhere from thirty to ... eleven thousand dollars a year, sir. Oh, of course, this is Candy's supply, which sells it. Just a classic. Eugene Levy also turns into a funny performance in the role of a sloppy director. The clip from his horrible, low-budget movie "Kung Fu U" will make you ride. <br /> <br /> So if you're a Candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem, I can't recommend this movie enough.
