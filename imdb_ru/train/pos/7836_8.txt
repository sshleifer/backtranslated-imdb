Canto 1: How Crimhild mourned Siegfried and how King Attila cares for her through her ambassador, Rüdiger von Behlarn: Crimhild (Margaret Sean) insists that her beloved husband Hagen Tronier (her), but her brother ”King Gunther (Theodore Loos) refuses her request. When Attila, the king of the Huns, is courting Crimhild through her ambassador, Rüdiger von Behlar, she forces him to take an oath on behalf of his king that no one will ever offend her. Hagen Thronier hides the Nibelungen treasure at the bottom of the lake. <br /> <br /> Song 2: “How Crimhild takes her left her homeland and how she was accepted by King Attila”: Crimhild brings some land where Siegfried died and goes to the Huns' yard, where she is welcomed by Attila himself, who also vows to protect her. <br /> <br /> Song 3: “As King Attila besieged Rome and as Crimhild called her brothers: when Crimhild” delivering the boy, Attila returns to his kingdom and asks Crimhild that she would like the most to please her. She asks him to invite his brothers to come to his kingdom. <br /> <br /> Canto 4: How Crimhild accepts his brothers: Crimhild insists on having the head of Hagen Tronier, but her brothers remain faithful to their friend and again do not accept her request. <br /> <br /> Song 5: As the Huns celebrated the summer solstice with the Nibelung: Crimhild asks Attila to kill Hagen Thronier, but he refuses, because according to the laws of the desert, the Guest is considered sacred. Crimhilda offers gold to Khums for the head of Hagen Tronier. There is a fight, and Hagen Tronier kills the son of Attila. <br /> <br /> Song 6: Trouble of the Nibelungs: the Huns lose the battle with the Nibelungen, but keep them under siege in Attila's castle. Crimhilda promises to spare them on the condition that they deliver Hagen to Tronier, but her brother Gunter says that the German people are devoted to their friends. <br /> <br /> Song 7: The End of the Nibelung: After the death of Rüdiger von Behlarn, Gieselher and Gernot, Hagen Tronier and Guchter are finally captured. Crimhilda kills Hagen Throne, ending his revenge with the destruction of Nibelungen. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of the poetic saga about Siegfried in The Revenge of the Crimhilda is also described in seven dramatic songs. The nature of the first part is a magnificent fairy tale about fantasy, adventures, romance and betrayal; The second part is a dramatic story of hatred, revenge and devotion. The solid script with impeccable character development, the excellent characteristics of the cast and the amazing directorial work of Fritz Lang ahead of another epic. Margaret Sean impresses with a completely different woman, possessed and inflexible in her desire for revenge. The costumes that Crimhild wears are also very impressive, and her actions are based on her face and appearance. I was a little disappointed with Attila’s reaction after the death of his only son, as I found her too passive. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Os Nibelungos ??
