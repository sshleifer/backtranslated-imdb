They are not jaw journalists Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell from His Friday Girl or witty detective William Powell and sassy Lady Myrna Loy from Thin Guy, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly adorable as Scoop lovers-detectives. Their rehearsing blockhead is more postmodern than after the Depression, Allen's writings are full of ironic self-deprecation and simple old New York fear. Shades of old wit are rare, for example, when he, like Sid, the Great Magician Splendini, talks about his origin: "I was born in Hebrew beliefs, but when I got older, I turned to narcissism." Johansson, who just emerged from Alls Match Point, like a bad girl, becomes a pretty good, sometimes few, journalist student who has fallen into a murder riddle, suitable for London: a serial killer. The plot is an alteration of his recent London thriller Match Point, up to the sins of the upper class and the "American tragedy" / "The case of the sun." In fact, Allen is reworking Manhattan Murder Mystery and Purple Rose from Cairo to name just a few other examples. I don't care if he does it; I would like the new material to be at least equal to the originals, and, alas, this is just a reflection of his young greatness. <br /> <br /> Allen, as a director and actor, cannot hide his love for an actress as he could not for Diane Keaton, and therefore takes a mediocre comedy in a suitable place according to Allen's canon, not great, but funny, sometimes brilliantly satirical : about a suspected murderer of the upper class, Side (Allen) jokes "I would be very surprised if he killed one person." This is vintage allen humor. While there are hardly any vivid literary hints, as in most of his films, he sings Scanty with the music of Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss to tell us that Woodman has not lost his classy nuance.
