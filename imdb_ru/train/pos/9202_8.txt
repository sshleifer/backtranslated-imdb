Admittedly, Virgo has an eye for beauty and talent. He gave a respite to Zeenat Aman, a successful model, as well as to the former winner of the beauty contest, playing her a role specifically designed for her debut. Her stunned appearance of stones and swinging under hypnotizing music instantly attracted the attention of viewers. This film is a pleasure for the eyes, with its scenic areas, ethnic people, these Buddha temples and cheerful, mischievous Mumtaz, which looks quite attractive, in its ethnic dress and dance skills. Dev is, of course, amazing, and this is one of his commercially successful performances. Hare Rama manages to maintain interest, thanks to a carefully written script, editing and fascinating music. Like Des Pardes, in his other film, Anand dealt with the topic when young people got used to drug addiction, and the theory that they come from concerned families and troubled childhood is quite plausible. Good artist, this film keeps its freshness up to date!
