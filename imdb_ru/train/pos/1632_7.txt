Inappropriate in a military school? Hmmm, it sounds funny, maybe offensive to some. There are characters, an Arab thief, a sexually crazy teenager, a clever mouth, a pot smoker, and not to mention a guy who burns things. Do not throw a strict mad sergeant, homosexual sergeant and one sexual teacher on ammunition, and this makes one crazy adventure in the movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this film, and it's funny, because comedy revolves around the fact that if you try to work together, everything will be done. <br /> <br /> This group of students who are not suitable at the Weinberg Military School turned out to be here because, as Sergeant Litzman quotes, “because you are outcasts, you feel discomfort for your families” and the community, shame. ” One of Ralph Macchio’s early performances before Karate Kid and My Cousin Winnie, also featuring Barbara Bach, this film is intended for teens and young people. <br /> <br /> The excellent soundtrack keeps the movie in motion.
