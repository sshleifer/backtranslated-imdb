Having heard about Modesty Blaze before, but never reading novels or comics, my wife and I really liked the film. This fascinating gave a good idea of ​​the character and its origin. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that there are some elements of an action movie, it is a much more intimate piece, written beautifully. Unfortunately, this is also where the main drawback of the film is found. An intimate game depends on the abilities of its actors and, unfortunately, only half of the cast. While Alexandra Staden perfectly coped with the role of Modesty, Blaise, her colleague Nikolay Coaster-Waldau - like the villain Miklos - did not do that. Smiling, making his way through the plot, as if it were a commercial for a toothpaste, he cannot create an atmosphere of anxiety that would make the film a masterpiece. The supporting cast is somehow similar, from the stereotypical gangsters and whores to the decent performances of Fred Pearson in the role of Professor Lob and Eugene Yuan in the role of Irina.
