This film is not only about school shooting, in fact, it was not even seen. But it only adds strength to this film. It's about people and how they deal with tragedy. I know that this was shown to students who survived the shooting in Columbine, and it gave a feeling of closeness to many of them. The game is great. All three main actors (Bisi Phillips, Erica Christensen and Victor Garber) are great in their roles ... I highly recommend this film to everyone. This is one of those movies that makes you talk about it after watching. This provokes a discussion not only of school shootings, but also of human emotions and reactions to all forms of the tragedy. It's a tear wrench, but it's worth it, and I'll watch it again and again.
