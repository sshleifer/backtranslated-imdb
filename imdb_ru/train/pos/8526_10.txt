I like this movie! Chris Shawerman did an amazing job! Not only is he an incredible actor, but he's great with a terrific physique! He did a great job of delivering his lines, and also turned into George better than Fraser. Great performance for his first big roll! This film is full of funny scenes that every child will enjoy. My children have watched this movie many times since we bought the DVD on the day it was released. In addition to the film, the additions to the DVD are just as fun. Two thumbs on it! I highly recommend this to everyone!
