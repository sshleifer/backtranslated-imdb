“Purple Rain” is a great movie if you are a music lover over 40 who took part in the Prince’s music in the 1980s. This story is a widely used formula: a growing musical talent must overcome personal and professional obstacles in order to find its audience and self-esteem. Prince is a bad actor, but his performance, especially “Purple Rain” / “I would die 4 U”, makes him worthy of watching the film. He himself and as a showman, as powerful on stage as Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, is near Thriller. Apollonia Kotero, a former protégé of the prince, is beautiful and demonstrates acting talent and chemistry with the prince, but her script prevents her from leaving. Morris Day and other actors play the role of comedic elements.
