saw it in the preview - great movie - great performance - witty and intelligent dialogues - the actors were fantastic - Peter Falk will be on the lookout for an Oscar - Paul Reiser was charming - the photo was amazing - Reiser was in the theater when we watched the movie and he gave a bright a report on the making of the film - his long dream was to write a semi-autobiographical report on the relationship between sons and fathers, or rather, between him and his father - this was achieved in a dramatic and entertaining fashion - the cast was well chosen and gave the film a sense of family - I would recommend this film to everyone who want to see an intelligent drama and great performances
