I was a Star Trek fan as much as I can remember. When they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> The Enterprise Premiere was worth it. It was well done with a perfect setting and great acting work that all the characters did. The NX-01 Enterprise is the perfect ship to show off what many people have loved. <br /> <br /> Scott Bakula surpassed Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock has played a commanding role as sub-commander T'Pola. That only two people from this wonderful new team will boldly lead us into the great history of Starfleet. <br /> <br /> The Enterprise looks like itâ€™s going to be a good show to watch, and I recommend it
