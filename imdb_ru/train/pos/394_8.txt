This is an incredible return from mastermind filmmaker Tsui Hark. This is one of the few films that deserves to come face to face with Stephen Chow's Shaolin Soccer. Since the beginning of the film, there were striking backgrounds on each edge, which were decorated with superb style. If you are a fan of science fiction or Chinese martial arts, you will enjoy a huge amount of 3D effects and realistic weapons created on the computer. There, as always, comes the excellent performance of Ekina Cheng, who plays the Heavenly King. He teams up with Louis Koo (Red), whom I was very impressed with by his flexible “wing”, which repelled incoming attacks. The fighting movements of these actors were skillful in all respects. Not only is the action superb, but it also has a somewhat complex storyline. Many critics of this film complain about the lack of a plot / theme, or simply “push it into the rubble” and even call it “The Legend of Pu”. However, the viewer cannot count on watching Dragon Ballz and other similar manga cartoons to understand this film. Others who have gained popularity in the Xia Wu films will have a better approach. In due respect. there may be one weakness that can be foreseen. The blow that was delivered to the enemy on the very last battle scene could have been more significant and destructive. Despite all this, you must see it.
