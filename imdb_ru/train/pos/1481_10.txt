Now I understand that nowadays some people do not want to watch a film without styling the film, so many Dogmas, Lars Vaughn, Watcheski Brothers, have changed what we expect in the film, perhaps Kazomay is no longer an independent American film that the film uses all the resources and language of the films to tell us a simple story about love and marriage, but much more .. Fully looking, giving lectures and letting you think ... and I am sure that you cannot be bored at any second from the long 116 minutes. I expect that no scene is longer than 3 o 2 1/2 minutes.
