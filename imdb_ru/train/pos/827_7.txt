Perspective is a good thing. Since the release of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, claims and counterclaims on how Episodes II and III will take place have attracted the attention of the “original” Star Wars films, making them part of a single whole. and new films on separate trilogies. What new films have done is to allow new perspectives to be placed on old films. This new look allows us to better appreciate what was often viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy: The Return of the Jedi. ROTJ, often ridiculed by an overly “sweet” factor, is in some ways just as strong as the original, and only a little less impressive than the almost perfect “Empire Strikes Back.” Indeed, the “cute” element of ROTJ, namely Ewoks, remains the weak link in the entire series. Did George Lucas put fluffy dwarfs in a movie solely for merchandising opportunities? Only he can answer this question. <br /> <br /> In addition to this nice factor, the film is a brilliant full circle And the evolution of the saga. Following the conclusion of the Empire Strikes Back, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows his rebel alliance friends to Tatooine, his home planet, to save Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the space pirate became a rebel hero who was captured by Jabba Hutt for expired the debts <br /> <br /> Skywalker has changed since leaving Tatooine with Ben 'Obi Van' Kenobi (Alec Guinness) to fight the wicked Empire. Now that Luke is all in black, the discovery of his origin has left him confused and torn. His psychological appearance is not as strong as his appearance suggests. Although he may strive to always help his rebel friends, he longs for another chance to resist the evil Darth Vader again, despite his uncertainty about whether he will destroy him or, eventually, turn to the Dark Side and join Vader on the Emperor’s side. . br /> <br /> The early scenes on Tatooine are impressive, from Jabba’s lair to his floating palace and the almighty Sarlak, the intestine that lives in the sand. Lucas's CGI improvements in the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of Sarlac, making him look fake and overworked. <br /> <br /> The scene of the Battle of Tatooine is outstanding and is one of the most memorable of the saga. Luke almost single-handedly destroys Jabba and his minions, arguing that his Jedi skill is now almost complete. <br /> <br /> When Luke returns to the Degoba system to visit the sick Yoda once more, the viewer is let down. Yoda clearly doesn’t have enough time to screen. Undoubtedly, the star of "The Empire Strikes Back," Yoda is almost erased from history, as the progress of Luke's fate unfolds on the screen. <br /> <br /> ROTJ is truly Luke's film, perhaps even more than the original. His journey carries the film as he approaches his confrontation with Darth Vader and his fate. Other rebel characters certainly work in his shadow. The romance between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo is almost non-existent, unlike Empire. In fact, only Leah’s character develops in ROTJ, Solo’s character seems to disappear, as the edges of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films. <br /> <br /> Their roles are to work together with the rebels to destroy a completely new Death Star, which is nearing completion. This time the emperor himself oversees the final stages of construction. The empire intends to destroy the Uprising once and for all, while the Emperor himself plans to transfer the now powerful Skywalker to his side in order to work together (or will it replace?) Darth Vader. The Emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, less cunning than Governor Tarkin (Peter Cushing) from Star Wars, more psychologically darker than anything else. The Emperor, who was brilliantly played by Ian MacDiarmid, is one of those characters you love to hate. <br /> <br /> All other actors are well established in their roles. Hamill is surprised how wiser Luke, who turns his character from a tearful teenager, an impatient student into an enlightened warrior, is one of the few real characters in the series. Ford’s role is diminishing, since all his charm and charisma were spent in the first two films - after all, he was the REAL star of the first film. Leia Fisher is more like a prop, at least until the end of the film, where she learns about herself something she was never sure of ... Add to favorites, like Alec Guinness as Kenobi, Yoda and pretty Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 and the show are more like family than actors. <br /> <br /> Despite the cunning forest battle of the film, in which Ewoki and the Empire participate, it ends well and includes a sequence of battles in three directions: on Endor, in space and on the Death Star, each with very impressive special effects. . Music, as always, is gorgeous and perfectly conveys the mood in each case. Just as the Blue Danube worked perfectly for “2001: A Space Odyssey,” the score of John Williams is as much a part of Star Wars folklore as Light Swords and Strength. <br /> <br /> Lucas left the end, open to interpretation, meaning that more episodes could be made. Indeed, science fiction fans created their versions of Episodes VII, VIII and IX in their heads again and again. ROTJ works when there is a chance, and cute furry animals aside - a good end to the series. <br /> <br /> When all six episodes can be watched together, this saga could well become the best one ever created. Is it already? The addition of Episode I has changed the landscape of the series. That is why the Return of the Jedi can now be viewed in a different light and get a new grade almost 20 years after its release.
