I spent the last week watching the John Cassavetes films - from “the woman under the influence” to the “premiere”. I am completely amazed, especially by these two films. from the first minute to the last in the “premiere” I was completely and completely absorbed. I experienced it only on a few occasions, but the feeling that this film was perfect lasted from two-thirds, until the appearance of captions. everything about this film, from how it was filmed, the incredible performance of Jena Rowlands, credits, debut, music, plot, feeling of depth, tempo, tenderness, originality, characters, dexterity, small moments .... for me it is really sublime. I could not agree with the previous comment on how to transfer it to an uninhabited island, because the depth of this film is what you can see. if you are unlucky enough to make a fire in the house, I guarantee that instead of making one last attempt to save this supply of money under your bed, you will save your copy of this film instead.
