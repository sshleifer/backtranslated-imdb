"Bruce Almighty" will win an Oscar with Oscar's record 14 wins! He will surpass Titanic as the highest-grossing film of all time! Jim Carrey’s fame will be at such a high level that he will announce his candidacy for the presidency in the 2004 White House playoffs. Almighty then! These magnificent fantasies would come true only if the filmmakers (including Kerry) possessed the powers of God. This premise is the primary component of the Kerry Riot "Bruce Almighty" riot. Kerry plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who is so obsessed with being the main anchor that he holds God to complete blame for his own problems. God, played by Morgan Freeman in heaven, bestows on Bruce the “Gift of God” (his powers) to challenge him if he can do God's work better. Obviously, Bruce is keen on his newfound blessed abilities and uses them selfishly. Kerry is back in his familiar all-powerful comedy form in Bruce Almighty. Jennifer Aniston was not "unhappy" as Bruce's girlfriend. However, my main authority goes to director Tom Shadyak because he didn’t let the dog out at # 2 and showed us the most fun doggy scene in the bathroom of all time! "Bruce Almighty" - not the most deep film of Kerry, but it is still a powerful funny exhibition "Carreyism"! **** Good
