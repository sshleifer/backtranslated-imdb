"The house in which blood dripped" - one of the best anthological films of that period. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Tracking a missing movie star, Inspector Holloway, (John Bennett) discovers that the last thing that was found was in a large mansion in the countryside. During the inspection of the house, he is told four different stories about past inhabitants of the house. <br /> <br /> Good story (s): method of murder - moving to a mysterious manor to find peace and quiet, while Charles writes his last masterpiece, horror novelist Charles Hillier (Denholm Elliott) and his wife Alice (Johanna Dunham) is excited about the story that centers around a serial strangler named Dominic. After a series of strange incidents and experiences in the house, Charles begins to believe that My creation came to life and follows him and his wife. Probably one of the best recordings in the film, she is by far the most creepy. The atmosphere here is what makes it stand out. The scenes with a fictional character are really creepy, the mystery surrounding it is really effective, and there is always a classic moment of creeping out. The classic moment is the murder in the psychiatrist's office, which is the highest indicator of eeriness. The build-up to it, with creaking sounds, quick flashes of a mysterious creature and thunder and lightning in the background works well for the benefit of this. <br /> <br /> Sweets for sweet moving to a new home, widower John Reed (Christopher Lee) hires former school teacher Ann Norton (Nairi Don Porter) for his little daughter Jane (Chloe Franks) while he leaves on business. Ann gradually begins to uncover a dark secret from Jane's past, which John vehemently denies. When she discovers the true nature of what happened, it is much more shocking than what she could imagine possible. With the most terrible frank storyline and the biggest twist of stories, this is a rather pleasant record. The mystery of the family is wonderfully played out, with a small amount of clues accumulated here and there, and the last revelation is completely nervous. This part alone is the main reason why it works, and Lee also does not harm her. <br /> <br /> Bad Story (s): Wax works exhausted by memories of his lost love, Phillip Grayson, (Peter Cushing) and his friend Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) are both passionate about the statue of a woman in the Wax Museum because the statue takes their lives, they discover the shocking secret of the museum that haunts them both. There is a clever premise here, and it gives a reason to spend time in the wax museum, which is always creepy. This is no exception, and it looks scary, helped by the fluorescent lighting exhibited in sculptures. The sequence of dreams provides an excellent moment of waiting, but ultimately it kills a slow pace. Events unfold very long, and most of the time goes to the exhibition. It also creates a shock ending that can be seen within a mile. Those will really drop it a bit. If the turn had been changed, he would have scored more points, the rest is acceptable. <br /> <br /> The horror actor Veteran Cloak Paul Henderson (John Pertwee) is upset by the lack of realism on the set. his new film leaves and buys a new vampire cloak in a specialty store. Soon the cloak turns him into a vampire, going crazy on the set with his colleague Carla (Ingrid Pitt) and other vampiric actors at home. An unconvincing cloak is the reason he does everything possible to prove that it is only in his imagination. It has a pretty decent premise, and there are many opportunities for some decent scares, but what absorbs it is several factors. First, itâ€™s too stupid for your own good. Turning the plot at the end is a great example that is so exaggerated that it is not at all shock, it just looks silly. There are so few scares or attempts to scare that it is just a bore to survive. This is the weakest film. <br /> <br /> The final verdict. Pretty decent movie, in each story there are a few small problems that make this movie not perfect, but still very watchable. It is highly recommended for those who star in such films of the time or who love British horror films. <br /> <br /> Today's Rating-PG-13: Violence
