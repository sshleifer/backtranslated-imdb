I started watching the report of this television film on Sunday afternoon, thinking that it was just another dumb strike on the plane. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> “Pandora’s Watch” is an intellectual political thriller that far surpasses the quality of most television films. He might as well make his debut on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The cast is great, including veteran actors Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga turns into one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the CIA, and Jane Livs from Frasier is also very good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is well written and the story is irresistible. In fact, the last hour is so filled with plot twists and expectations that you cannot leave your seat for a second. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, take the time - almost four hours. You will be richly rewarded!
