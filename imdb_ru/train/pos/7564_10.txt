In my work, independent directors are sometimes associated with me who are trying to advertise their film. When I can, I look at these low-budget films, and often they make me think that the future of Hollywood depends on dogs. From time to time, however, there is a film that is born out of pure passion and desire, as if created to remind the film industry that good films are still possible. The short film “Broken”, shot by Alex Ferrari, is a real surprise and deserves a second look. <br /> <br /> Throwing in a scant 20 minutes, BROKEN tries to tell a convincing (but surrealistic) story with almost no story. The audience is in the middle of the action, having no idea what's going on. A young woman (Samantha Jane Pauley) wakes up from sleep to hear a shot, and is subsequently kidnapped from her home. When she wakes up, she is surrounded by a group of hired thugs who look like at home in a comic. These lousy guys and girls are bigger than life. These are all shotguns and knives. No exit. <br /> <br /> The kicker here is that, despite the fact that the film is low-budget, it does not play like it. From the very beginning, it seems that B R O K E N was shot, edited and created by professionals. It seems that Quentin Tarantino could have done on his day off when he was playing with the Wachowski brothers. The film is sharp and cool, looks good and looks like something big. <br /> <br /> The situation is much better than what I usually see in these small films. Paulie and Paul Gordon (who plays the main killer, Duncan) were well chosen. As two of the few speaking roles in the film, they themselves carry the film. No special effects, no matter how good they were, would not save this film from a bad game. Fortunately, Paulie manages to convey real fear, and Gordon manages to express himself as a real psycho. Some of the more limited roles seem to be filled with less talent, but this hardly shows. <br /> <br /> The disadvantage of B R O K E N is that it is only 20 minutes. The story ends with the twilight of the Twilight Zone, which seems a bit far-fetched and hardly subtle. Watching this, I felt that I should have had some kind of epiphany, but there was only the feeling that it was much more mundane than I had hoped for. The film struggles to be one of those puzzles that make viewers talk for hours at a local coffee shop, but this seems to be unsatisfactory. I keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes of a longer movie. <br /> <br /> MY RATING: 8 out of 10.
