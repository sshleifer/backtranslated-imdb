Eddie Murphy - one of the funniest comedians, probably the funniest. Delirious is the best comedy I've ever seen, and it is obligatory for anyone who likes to laugh !! I watched this movie hundreds of times, and every time I see it, I still enjoy it. This is definitely one for your video library. I guarantee that you will have to watch it several times to hear all the jokes, because you will laugh so hard - that you will miss half of them! Crazy - fun! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that there are a lot of funny comedians - after watching this comedy, most of them will seem second-class citizens. If you have never seen it - get it, look at it - and you will like it !! It makes you scream !!! :-)
