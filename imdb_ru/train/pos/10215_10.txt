Most people who are chasing movies with Audrey Tautou do not seem to understand that Amelie was a character - in fact, this is not the real personality of Audrey Tautou, so every film she participates in will not be Amelia, part 2, part 3 and so on. <br /> <br /> With that said, I also took this film simply because Audrey was in it. Yes, it is true, after the first scene there is a big gap, when she was not seen at all for 45 minutes, but I didn’t even miss her because I had so much fun with other characters. The guy who lies about everything is too funny, the guy who justifies the people who run out of his cafe and miss the bill, finding coupons and those that balance the loss, in fact .... penetration into all the characters here might take for a while, but this is one of the best films I've seen lately. <br /> <br /> The person Audrey Thothou, Irene, is not too sweet a girl, who was Amelie. In fact, like Irene, her rudeness to her ass, which requires a change, first took me by surprise. In this film, Irina is a girl with good intentions, but during the (very terrible) day her temper becomes more and more sour and pessimistic. <br /> <br /> What makes this film absolutely wonderful is that I have all these really interesting stories and plots that are very interesting to watch, gorgeous landscapes and shots, very vivid and never too slow, and all the characters really can act. The best part of the film is about 20 minutes ... this is when all the plots begin to grapple with each other, and the trip really is gaining momentum, and everything binds together and makes sense, and the whole butterfly effect flourishes. I swear it was the best 20 minutes of the film I’ve seen lately, and the ending ... It made me think: “Damn, I was really lucky when I found this film.” The end of this movie is top notch. The one who wrote the script for this is great because not only all these other scenes occur, but also somehow make them all come together (and in a reasonable manner, like here), but also so that each character feels human and alive, and not some callous persona used as a support for creating all this butterfly effect ... very impressive. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie because it is a great movie that you can watch at any time, in any mood, with any company or alone.
