This is not the worst film ever made, the actors are not thrilled, and the script and director are not completely inept. <br /> <br /> This is not the best movie ever made, the actors are not great, and the script and director is not exactly brilliant. <br /> <br /> He falls somewhere in the middle. Fun somewhere. Nice, well constructed somewhere. <br /> <br /> No need to say “don't take it seriously”, “so bad, it's good” or “it was not scary”. None of these comments are relevant. <br /> <br /> Cut has an atmosphere. This is the atmosphere that is actually very unique, and one really original aspect of the film that personally makes the film for me.
