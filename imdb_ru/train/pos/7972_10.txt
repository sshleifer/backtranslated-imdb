I watch this movie all the time. I watched it with the family from ages 3 to 87, and everything in between; They all loved it. It really shows the true scenes the dog has, and the love and dedication you get from the pet. Just beautiful. <br /> <br /> Great for those who love comedy films, films about tears, and even pets. <br /> <br /> The music is wonderful, the animals are spectacular, the scenes are really thought out, and the characters are perfect. What I liked about the characters were true and well mixed personalities: Shadow (the oldest, golden retriever). He is wise, filled with the wisdom and thinking of any dog, Chance (American bulldog puppy) is basically a puppy wit, comic character; And Sassy (Gimiliysky cat) She is a real cat, which shows what a real cat will do for its owner, a real little girl.
