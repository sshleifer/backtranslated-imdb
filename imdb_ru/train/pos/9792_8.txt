Once a year such a film comes and makes your life easier. You do not need to make an effort to think that it is good, it is just like that. You like it when you watch it, and you take it with you home. I can not say that it is absolutely impeccable, but it is close. The acting game is a great, interesting story and with elements of anticipation. It's a small family story, pretty much predictable, but the secret itself doesn't matter. this is the way a blind girl gets to him. I was impressed with the way the director portrayed their deep relationship (the blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I didnâ€™t like was the actress who played the mother, she was too tough and unnecessarily. Keren
