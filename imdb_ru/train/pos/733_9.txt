How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones? What a crime that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of the joke of Dennis Leary about great musicians dying in kitchen fires, and useless ones live forever. I rephrase here, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of deprived children who fought against their repressive high school administration. These are very stupid things, but there is optimism that is refreshing (even if they resort to a building explosion). Who knew that this would really be a problem for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a temporary capsule of an era when people still believed that music matters and that it can matter to society as a whole. It is full of children who know that the authorities do not have the right answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust. <br /> <br /> But the most important thing is pure operation. <br /> <br /> Don't take it seriously. Just go and have a good time. If in the seventies life was not the same as in high school, then it should have been.
