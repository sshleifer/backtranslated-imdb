Over the past few weeks I have become very fond of Lawrence Olivier and I was very excited when I discovered this gem. I always found it amazing when I came across a movie in which I didnâ€™t have to hold my finger on the remote control in case nudity lifted its ugly head. <br /> <br /> Lady X's divorce is enchanting before the final scene, and it must have been a real delight for the audience in 1938. I just want people today to accept and love real humor instead of the terrible garbage that people now call funny. <br /> <br /> Lady X's divorce is worth some time.
