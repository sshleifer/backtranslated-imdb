I saw this film only once, about 25 years ago, and to this day I have always told people that this is probably the best film I have ever seen. Considering that there was no verbal dialogue and only mental dialogue, I found the film fascinating, and I even held my breath so as not to make a sound. I highly recommend this film, I would like it to be available on DVD.
