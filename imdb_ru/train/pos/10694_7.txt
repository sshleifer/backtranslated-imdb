I had a great experience with women in Russia, and, unfortunately, this film tells about many of them. They are very cunning, ruthless and greedy, and also very unfair. From robotic sex, fussing over presents, to lies and betrayal - I experienced all this in Russia. <br /> <br /> I know what I'm talking about. And here are my qualifications: here are the photojournalists of my three trips to Russia in search of a bride. It includes thousands of photographs of many hot Russian girls I met, a black comedy, a scam to which I was involved, and the story of my robbery and appearance on Russian national television. <br /> <br /> http: //www.happierabroad .com / Photojournals.htm <br /> <br /> This is similar to a reality show. You will love it. I spent a lot of time assembling it. So check it out. The Russian woman played by Nicole Kidman is very similar to Julia and Katya in my photo magazines. <br /> <br /> My three brides looking for trips to Russia turn out to be very interesting and sell them, so why not make a film of my bride in search of adventure in Russia? However, in this film there is one actual impossibility, and this is how the guy orders his bride from the catalog and delivers her to the airport. It doesn’t work at all, so I don’t understand why the media like to perpetuate it. There is not a single Russian dating site for brides who would work in this way, and I urge everyone to find one that works. The fact is that you can order only the contact information of the Russian lady (e-mail address, address, telephone number, etc.) from the site. From there, you correspond and then visit her, and if you want to bring her to your country, you start the immigration process at your INS office and wait several months after that. This is how it works in real life. You cannot simply order her to arrive at your airport. Immigration in the US will NEVER allow this to happen. <br /> <br /> WuMaster <br /> <br /> - I got everything I wanted when I went abroad! You can too! http://www.happierabroad.com
