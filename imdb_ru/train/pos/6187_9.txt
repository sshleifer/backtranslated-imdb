There are such horrible moments in the film that your teeth hurt. But knowing that only a few weeks remained before Codex made the films harmless and harmless, Paramount threw it into production before the understatement and dissatisfaction went out of fashion. Vanity is so terrible against women that it is delicious. As Kitty Carlisle sings, women are displayed with price tags that insult a prostitute from the Bronx. They emerge from mollusks (nudging, nudging; winking; winking) in postures of absolute submission. Minions of the law are so stupid that they can't find the door, look at their skirts and laugh. Naked girls choirs sit awkwardly in giant cacti (maybe they can be a source of hallucinogens?) While we listen to "Sweet Marijuana" and watch blood fall on the chest of horin. <br /> <br /> Of course, Karl Brisson learned his lines phonetically and doesnâ€™t seem to understand what he says. But it's worth it, since Norma steals the show, while no one is watching. <br /> <br /> Serious attitude towards this fragile gun is an omission from the whole exercise. Look at this with the NOW charter member and get ready to justify the whole Hollywood stunt between body strokes. <br /> <br /> By the way, Toby Wing is the icing on the cake. And the Duke Ellington was also not injured. <br /> <br /> Need to stroll through the memory lane.
