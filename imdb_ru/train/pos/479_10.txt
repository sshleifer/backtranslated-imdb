Natalia Emily Watson is absolutely the most loving and romantic main character I have ever seen on the screen. She is the queen of this film without any doubt. Or is she turned into a king? The internecine interplay of chess parties and the struggle of families for control, power and victory are staggering. Like the chess masters in the film, the director plays many simultaneous games with our mind at the same time, but they all intertwine in major or minor models. The period, costumes and images of the lake region of Italy in the beginning of the 20th century are beautifully imprinted. Not a single square of space will be wasted. <br /> <br /> There are so many brilliant scenes that I cannot list them all. I recommend allocating enough time to watch this film twice, perhaps at weekly intervals, because you cannot cover all the poetry in a 64-square, but multi-dimensional structure in one setting. <br /> <br /> I did not read Nabakovâ€™s book, but to try my own analogy, what I read reminds me of another romantically triumphant movie Poetry as a Game, Barry Levinson, The Natural. This completely rejected the grim ending of the fatalistic book of Bernard Malamud in favor of romantic impressionism, which was exclusively American. Well, the director did it better, smoothly combining Russian and Italian morality and morals as a background for enlightenment. The real story here is that zero-sum games; there is a winner and a loser, if both participants do not draw. But in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are limited only by these limitations and life conventions to the extent that we allow others to break our spirit. <br /> <br /> Pure love, as embodied by Natalia Emily Watson, can transcend and allow all of us to intensify at the same time thanks to her gifts. Only barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from it. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie (10/10).
