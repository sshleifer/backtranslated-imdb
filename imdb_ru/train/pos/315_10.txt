I absolutely loved this soap. It was one of my favorites. Highly recommend :) I just love Brazilian soaps, they deal with real life events. I am very sad that the soap is over, but Iâ€™m sure I can find it somewhere. For those of you who have not seen it, please take a look. I really liked the characters, the plot and how it turned out in the end for the villains. The only thing I would change was the end of Xica and her love for life. I can't wait to see it again and highly recommend it. Xica was by far the best soap I've ever seen. Forget the rest :) GO XICA .. I hope you all enjoy it too.
