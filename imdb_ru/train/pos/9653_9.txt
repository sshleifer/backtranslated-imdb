First love is a desperately difficult subject that can be convincingly practiced in the movie: the all-encompassing passion usually ends in a pale imitation or, even worse, a bit ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Lifshits manages to avoid all the pitfalls and tells a touching, sexual, completely exciting story of love, disaster and possible redemption, while at the same time touching on some deeper themes of human existence. <br /> <br /> The main story is about an 18-year-old Mathieu, a lonely, reticent boy who meets Cedric, who is more impudent, more sociable, but just as lonely when he is on holiday with his family. With the onset of summer, they fall in love and, when the holidays end, decide to live together. A year later, the relationship ends in disaster: Cedric cheats Mathieu, who, in confusion, is trying to commit suicide. He survives, and to get an idea of ​​his life, he returns to the seaside town where they first met, this time in the winter cold. <br /> <br /> If you say it like that, then it will never have the impact it has: a lot of this is implied, it all happens not consistently. <br /> <br /> A complex story is necessary for a deeper sense of the passions experienced through the counterpoint and a temporal perspective. Fortunately, the three timelines used (love summer, mental hospital after suicide and winter reconstruction) are color-coded: warm yellows and oranges for summer, almost frighteningly cold blue for hospital scenes and warming brown colors and blues for the winter coast. <br /> <br /> Both main actors showed excellent results, while it's nice to see that Stefan Rideau (Cedric) was used to his full ability (I’m more used to seeing him under Jeremy Elkaim (Mathieu), stretched in rather soft Gael Morel's dramas should be noted: you can feel his loneliness, then his almost unbelievable passion, and then his character collapses behind the wall of aphasia. Beautifully crafted gestures are more common than dialogue ever could. <br /> <br / > The topics covered are almost classic in French cinema: our and the difficulty is to really understand what the other feels, our difficulty in communicating fully, moving sands of meaning ?? The name of the film “Presque rien” (almost nothing) indicates all this and, indeed, one of the key scenes of the film : trying to understand why Mathieu tried to commit suicide, the psychiatrist asks Cedric, has he ever deceived him? "Not in the enfin, nor in the foy, but in the past." (No, well, yes, but nothing ). Cedric still loves Mathieu ?? he brought him to the hospital during a suicide attempt (we see nothing of this) and desperately tries to contact him again as soon as he leaves ?? but he cannot understand that he has lost him forever, because something that seemed to him nothing (meaningless business) is all for Mathieu. <br /> <br /> Although the film is darker than Pierre and Gilles's rather unfortunate poster may seem. This is not without hope: we see Cedric's slow, painful attempts to return to life, first through the adopted cat, then through work at a local bar and, finally, contact with Pierre, who may be his next love. But the story ends here: teenage passion for a year, perhaps another beginning. So what was it? Almost nothing? Of course not, when do you live it ??
