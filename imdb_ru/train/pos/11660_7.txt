A wonderful piece of children's cinema is buried in the world of archaic Celticism. A narrative of the story around the famous Book of Kels, which is believed to have been compiled by monks from the small island of Iona off the west coast of Scotland. <br /> <br /> Tells the story of a young student of the abbots, who goes into the woods in search of Krom-Kruik, a furious headless horseman from pagan mythology. Hoping to restore the lost artifact. <br /> <br /> The real beauty of the film lies in its animation. The cell is shaded by a bright and inspiring style of deep complexity, with the result that the look seems less simple. Based on the artistic style of the brilliant Cartoon Network series 'Samurai Jack' for the ingenious use of marking and background depth, The Secret of Kels creates a consistently affective Celtic world living under the shadow of a Viking invasion. <br /> <History can be very inaccurate, and lifestyles are depicted without realism, but these facts are completely irrelevant, as the film plunges into the world of fantasy and Celtic-revival mysticism. The forest girl is a wonderful complement, and, in my opinion, makes the picture what it is when it slides from branch to branch. Appearing and disappearing as a mysterious nymph with qualities reminiscent of the legendary Cheshire Cat from Alice and Wonderland. <br /> <br /> The secret of Kelsa is an absolute pleasure. For all genders, for all ages, this is a great family movie. <br /> <br /> Do not expect reverence, but pleasantly surprise!
