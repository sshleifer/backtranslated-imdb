One of the most interesting films that can be classified as "blacksploating", "The Uniform" Bakshi - is a rich text, full of amazing insight. He wrote this in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who also appear in the film. Racist imagery can often be troubling, but the idea of ​​the film was so powerful that the NAACP approved it (but reluctantly). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in exploring the pervasive atmosphere of racism that Bakshi is trying to destroy. Wonderful things.
