I remember this game. He always sat on the shelves alone, until one day I decided to try something new for a change and got this game. I looked at it with admiration, since it was my first game for PS1, which had 4 discs. When I played it, I could not seriously remove the controller. <br /> <br /> The plot of this game is so good and curved that it is almost as good as the plot of Final Fantasy VII, and it is difficult. to execute. When you play a game, you are so addicted to characters that it’s incredible that this is just a PS1 game, as if it were a movie. And I think this should be turned into a movie. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this game is a very unheard of game, and almost no one has played it or loved it, because it is one of those games that play the ends of the shelves, with 50% written on it trying to sell. Well, I'm one of those people who always look at those who are at the ends and try them, and most of them turn out to be really good. Damn it, this is how I got to the final Fantasy VII, looking through the catalog and finding it. But this is different from Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> Legend of Dragoon, the only game or RPG that is surprisingly better than most Square Enix games. I won’t be surprised if Square Enix does it, but it’s not. Hardly any games I play are better than the Final Fantasy series or the Dragon Quest series, but this one is there. But what really bothers me is that he is very little known and does not praise him, as it should be. <br /> <br /> The graphics are pretty good for a PS1 game, but what to expect from it? This is a PS1 man made in 1999. The story I mentioned is amazing, almost surpassing VII. The characters are awesome, you are so keen on them and their actions. <br /> <br /> Definitely 10 out of 10. Definitely deserve more praise, and a very well-made RPG by a company other than Square Enix,
