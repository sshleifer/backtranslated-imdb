Having lived all my life in Ontario, in the same city where Marlene Moore grew up, I heard stories about it from my parents, grandparents and family members. So when I found out that they would make a film about her, and that the beginning would be made on my street, and her house very close to mine, I was excited. <br /> <br /> If you read Rock a Bye Baby, about Marlene Moore, you get a completely different picture of her as a person, she was considered awkwardly beautiful by people who really had the opportunity to know her, except for her own family who often abused her as a child, with the exception of one of her brothers. In addition, if you live in my neighborhood and are smart enough to listen to those around you, who knew her from school, you will find that she was really injured before she entered any institution, she was always protected and, no matter how it seemed, the unwillingness to study in a school setting really embarrassed that she was not able to. <br /> <br /> Marlene didn’t deserve the life she was given because of the lack of help she desperately needed. It was the government and the people around her who helped her with her death, not trying to understand her needs and why she did what she did. I am still outraged by the fact that she was put in prison for self-defense from a man who tried to rape her. As her brother once said: “They didn’t know what to do with her, so they locked her, and it killed her.” I believe it with all my heart. <br /> <br /> Rest in peace, Marlene, you so deserved it.
