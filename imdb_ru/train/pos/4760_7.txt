Well, I gave this movie 7. It was better than Third Space, but not as good as In the Beginning, as far as B5 movies go. I really think that the television series did a much better overall job with special effects and character depictions. Let's hope that the producers and the cast will receive the next series of “Crusade” at the level of B5 standards.
