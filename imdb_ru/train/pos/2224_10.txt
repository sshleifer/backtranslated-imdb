A hangman woman (played by the sexy Jennifer Thomas II) is having fun, fulfilling all the fantasies of all the men on death row before they meet their creator. And what a way. Fortunately, this film is not real, or in this world there would be many more people on death row. <br /> <br /> It starts very slowly. Low light and poor play, as in most (B) movies. Getting better as you move forward. And ends with an explosion. <br /> <br /> I would rate it very highly in inexpensive, very sexy films of the 90s. It needs to be seen as soon as the children leave or in bed.
