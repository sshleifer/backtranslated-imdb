*** SPOILERS *** Both in real life and in the cinema there is a familiar story that happens to many young people who fall into the war zone with a weapon or rifle in their hands. The case of a young and innocent man who never handled a gun or shot it, Jimmy Davis, Francho Ton, has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when people, such as Jimmy Davis, are forced to take up arms for their country. <Br /> <br /> Jimmy, who at first wanted to be kicked out of the US Army, but had to stay, being fastened to his mouth, his good friend Fred P. Willis, Spencer Tracy, found himself on the front line in France. With the Jimmy squad, shackled by a German machine-gun nest, he single-handedly put him out of action, selecting half a dozen German soldiers from the safety of the nearest church spire. Just when Jimmy shot the last surviving German who raised his hands in surrender, an artillery shell hit the bell tower, seriously wounding it. <br /> <br /> Recovering from wounds in an army hospital Jimmy fell in love with US Army Voluntary Nurse Rosa Duffy, Gladys George. Rose was really in love with Jimmy's good friend, the lucky one, Fred's lucky one, despite his disgusting antics to her. It was when Fred was lost during the fighting on the Western Front that Rose, thinking that he was killed, fell in love and later married Jimmy. When Fred suddenly appeared in a French city where Jimmy was, now fully recovered from his wounds, things became very unpleasant for him and Rose, who had already accepted Jimmy’s proposal to marry her! <br /> <br /> With the end of World War I and the marriage to Jimmy Rose, he left Fred, who still loves her, a bitter and resentful young man. Almost by chance, Fred ran into Jimmy on the streets of New York and, to his surprise and surprise, discovered that he had completely changed from a meek and non-violent man whom he knew before he was sent to war on the European Western Front, Smug and confident in himself and his ability to fire a pistol, Jimmy became the main thug in the underworld of New York! Not only that, but how Fred later found out that his wife Rose had no idea what Jimmy really was involved with when Jimmy told her that he was working as a law-abiding and harmless insurance agent. <br /> <br /> Jimmy’s criminal life has come. full circle when Rose, having learned of his secret life, introduced him to the police to prevent him from massacring, like "Valentine's Day", when members of his gang were dressed like policemen from his rival gangsters. During the trial, Jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt, wanting to meet with the music, and then, after his three-year term had expired, to bring his life back to life. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER WARNING *** Heard from other prisoners that Rose and his best friend Fred had an affair behind the back. Jimmy escaped from prison and found himself on the run from the law. It was in Fred's circus, where he works as a manger and breadwinner, Jimmy, seeing that Rose and Fred were faithful to him, that he, like at the trial, suddenly changed his mind. But the thought of returning to prison at least ten years later, added to his sentence, was too big for Jimmy! It was then that Jimmy decided to end this by allowing the police, who had tracked him down by then, to do work that he himself did not have for him!
