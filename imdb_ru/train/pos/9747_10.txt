I remember watching this film when it first came out in 1982, and then I liked it. After about 4 years, I was lucky to see how Luciano Pavarotti sings at the Metropolitan Opera in New York (in Tosca), so watching the finale of this film reminds me very much of that great night. What's not to love about this movie? The music is gorgeous, and Pavarotti (Fini) was at his best and still looked great. The plot is actually very funny, and the “food fight” scene still remains one of the most funny I have ever seen. A balloon flight over the Napa Valley was beautiful, as was the song he sang “If we were in love” (one of the few times when Pavarotti sang in English). And hearing the magnificent duo of Santa Lucia. Get real people, it was a film about an opera singer named Giorgio Fini, who was accidentally played by Pavarotti. Catherine Harrold and Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> I am VERY glad that I still have this almost worn out VHS recording of this film, but I would really like to be released on DVD, especially now that Pavarotti is no longer with us, because that I think it includes the best rendition of Nessun Dorma, sung by him, which is still being filmed!
