The monstrous mother-son-duet (Alice Krieg and Brian Krause) sucks the life force of virgins, and their new goal is sweet, but lonely Tanya (Madhen Amik).

I have never been a fan of sloppy, overrated bestsellers like King, Kunz or Barker, but this B-movie, written by Mr. Dang himself, is not really that bad as could be.
