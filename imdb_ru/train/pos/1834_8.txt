This film is very touching. I don’t care what people say about this movie, it’s a very good movie. In playing the role of Amitabh Bachchana, the dying father is great because he wants to teach his son to deal with life in case something happens to him, and Akshay Kumer was great in his role as corrupt Aditya Thakur. The supporting role of Shefali Shetty, who played the role of Sumithra Thakur, was magnificent. Priyanka Chopra was good in her little role she played in the film. Ragpal Yadav as a dead servant and Boman Iran in the role of her father-in-law have a very good connection, and the comedy scenes were hilarious. The direction is very good.
