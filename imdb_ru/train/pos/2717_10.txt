I can't remember a lot of details about the series, but I remember how passionate I was about it and how determined I was not to miss a single episode. Unfortunately, we didn’t have a VCR at that time, so I’ve never seen the show again. However, I remember well how I felt, watching it, and how I was excited every time it happened. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor these days (I think I was almost in love), and he remains one of my favorite actors to date, mainly because of his appearance on the show. I would love to buy / steal / download this series, I think I would go to great lengths to see it again and return to my long-lost childhood ... Any ideas? Does anyone know the site dedicated to the series, or are there episodes on the tape from their first broadcast?
