This is a great movie of the Classic of the 40s and well shot. In this film there are very dramatic scenes in which John Garfield (Al Schmid), “The Power of Evil”, “48” and Dane Clark (Lee Diamond), “Last Rites”, “88” fight the Japanese during World War II, being completely surrounded and with only one machine gun. When Al Schmid was able to return home after being injured with a terrible trauma, his problems only began with his family and engaged girlfriend. Dane Clark played a prominent supporting role in the role of Lee Diamond, who did everything to help his friend Alu begin to live together again. War is never a complete victory, and let's not forget all the brave wounded soldiers in veteran hospitals from all wars and our current Iraqi veterinarians!
