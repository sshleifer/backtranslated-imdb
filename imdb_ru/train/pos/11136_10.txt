“Midnight Cowboy” - one of those films that were a valid basis declared a masterpiece - is truly one of the best films ever made in America. This is artistically sound, and at the same time fully accessible and commercially. Not surprisingly, it was a huge success when it was released. But beware, this is also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made. Characters are memorable, well developed and ultimately tragic. The authors of the film should be welcomed for not giving us the Hollywood finale, which was mostly mandatory by the 80s. However, this is why I value American films from 1967 to 1977. This is the time when well-made, innovative and, most importantly, joyless films could be made with the big budgets that Hollywood could offer. It all ended by the time Star Wars was released. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger makes the material for the work. It combines a simplified style with some experimental editing. Unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects, Midnight Cowboy did it pretty well. It is still as strong as it was at the beginning of the release. However, it is the acting that makes it a masterpiece. The background of the characters is never fully explained, but the actions make them fully developed. John Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and responsive (despite their sometimes reprehensible actions). In addition, being a fan of films about old exploitation, I liked the scenes on the infamous 42nd street. Midnight Cowboy is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made.
