This is one of my favorite films of all time. I read the book and I liked it, but this film expands everything the book has made famous. The game is fantastic, especially from John Voight, who plays Mr. Sir, a very evil character. In this film there is a certain way of telling stories that holds you everywhere, to the end, where everything is brought together for a great end. I also love the way it is directed, flickering back and forth between modern days and the stories of Stanley's ancestors. Yes, this story was written by Louis Sachar, but it seems that this story was created for the cinema, and Andrew Davis does an excellent job of managing. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves good movies.
