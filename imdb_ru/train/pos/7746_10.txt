Those of you who are familiar with dEUS know the lead singer Tom Barman. He made this film a little bit, as if he was making music, it's a mixture of everything. This is a comedy, although for the most part absurd and cynical, drama, none of the main characters have a happy life, to say the least, and she has no purpose. <br /> <br /> The film begins on Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, with scenes of several people, some of them have nothing in common, but they will be in contact with each other day and night. There are several main characters: a teacher who writes books that no one reads, a young researcher with a painful taste of death and his sister, a gallery owner, two young men who are constantly in touch with the law, a man who works in a movie theater and two young women. Throughout the film there is a man who is somehow connected with the wind. All characters have their own problems, with their family or friends, or simply with life itself. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in Antwerp and shows some beautiful pictures of the city and port. The events of the day are not so easy to explain, I advise you just to watch the movie, there is just too much to tell. But I can say that the Bartender uses the camera perfectly and uses a lot of music (mostly dance music, not rock) to create a mood, especially the party is filled with great music. <br /> <br /> This film is an experience in itself, it will not leave you any wiser in life, perhaps only because you have to live it and not waste it, or have some false moral truths. <br /> <br /> In short, see, it is definitely worth it!
