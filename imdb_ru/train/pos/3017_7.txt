Did Philo Vance have a lot of similarities with the Bulldog Drummond ?? He was a gentleman with the brilliance and elegance that was usually associated with the British upper classes, and was he also independently wealthy ?? <br /> <br /> But there were significant differences? Was Drummond an adventure seeker, charming, gallant, alive ?? Could Vance be pompous, boring and complacent? In his manner there was a hint of fundamental cruelty. <br /> <br /> "The case of the killing of the nursery" - the most impressive of the 14 films of Vance, filmed between 1929 and 1947 ?? The story of the murdered Chinese-made collector, does it contain all the components of the classic puzzle of the private eye ?? Exotic situation in the blue nose of the Long Island Kennel Club, three murders that Vance has to solve, including an incomprehensible "murder in a closed room", the key to the whole case and many suspects ?? <br /> <br /> Usually the detective stories were too static and talkative to make convincing films, even if they work well enough on the printed page, but here Michael Curtisâ€™s manual and good editing give the film the tempo and Urgency, which makes it in whole different from similar films of its type? <br /> <br /> The elegance and grace of William Powell made him the perfect Vance, and although a year later he changed the studio, he remained in the same genre with the extremely successful and popular "Thin Man" in MGM ??
