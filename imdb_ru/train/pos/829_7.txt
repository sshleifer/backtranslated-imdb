I admit, I thought that this film would not be good, but soon changed my mind. The film made you guess which direction it was going. Pierce Brozon is great in the role of an assassin who suddenly became exhausted and asks the man he met at the Mexican bar for help. Greg Kinnear is terrific straight, as his role is a soft-bred man from Denver, who begins an innocent conversation with Pierce in a Mexican bar. In the film, you'll laugh while Pierce is having fun with funny players (mostly about sex). <br /> <br /> Imaginary in this film is very well done, especially on the bullfighting scene and when Pierce sees himself when he tries to finish his last works.
