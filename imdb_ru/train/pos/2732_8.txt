Herbet Clutter, wife Bonnie and their teenage children Kenyon and Nancy were very loved and respected in their tiny town of Holcomb, Kansas - but early on November 14, 1959, all four were brutally murdered. Quite unexpectedly, the crime impressed the author Truman Capote, who rushed to the scene of the incident and followed the course of the matter until its completion. The result was the book "In Cold Blood." Controversial, shocking, and exceptionally well written, it has become an international bestseller and remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day. <br /> <br /> The 1967 film version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself. Filmed in black and white in many real places, it has a bit of documentary quality, icy and detached - and the cast is generally exceptional. This is the film on which Robert Blake’s reputation as an actor is based, and deservedly so. As Perry Smith's killer, Blake puts you in a trap between deep disgust and shock of unexpected sympathy; This is a masterful performance from start to finish. Like Richard Hicock, Scott Wilson is equally good. <br /> <br /> Like Capote’s book, the film begins with Smith and Hikok when they travel to Kansas, and leads them to Clutter’s house - only to suddenly flash past the crime to detail the investigation, which ultimately led to their arrest and conviction. The central element of the film has always been the moment when we finally see what happened in the house of Clutter; actually filmed in the Clutter house itself, it is a series of horrors and horrors. <br /> <br /> Director and screenwriter Richard Brooks leads the film with a very strong sense of deliberation, mistaken only in the sense that it allows the film to become a bit preaching. However, given the general strength of the film, this becomes a trivial annoyance. Strong things - and recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
