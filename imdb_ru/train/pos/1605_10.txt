"Moonstruck" - one of the best films of all time. I have this movie on DVD! The film tells about the New York widow (Cher), who falls in love with her boyfriend's evil brother (Danny Aiello) (Nicolas Cage), who works in a bakery. I'm glad that Cher got an Oscar for this film. Nicolas Cage and Danny Aiello are great too. The direction from Norman Javison (who filmed The Fiddler on the Roof) is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is a great movie for everyone to see and laugh. Be sure to take a look! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars!
