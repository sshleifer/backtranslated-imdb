This is one of my favorite Mr. Motos, and I saw them all. As usual, Lorre is charming like Mr. Moto. Lionel Atville plays the delightfully cool curator of the museum, the usual comic relief is pretty funny here, and there are many suspects to look at. He is fast and fun. <br /> <br /> The archeologist has no special talent, like Thomas Beck, the usual second leader in these programmers, but he is adequate. Stepin Fetchit on board, and while he speaks stereotypically, his lines are funny, without demeaning his intellect, and he actually saves the day in his short time on the screen.
