When celebrating Kurt Weil in Brooklyn, WHERE ARE WE HERE? was finally excavated for screening. Surprisingly, the screen may be missing a movie from any era with the participation of Weill-Gershwin. The score stands high, and the CD with material in which Gershwin and Weil only emphasize its merits, which are significant. Yes, the film has its own problems, but the rating is not one of them. Ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy, and Fred McMurray cannot quite understand the material. Then the “modern” segment is poorly written. But the elements of fantasy raise the film to high praise, as well as the work of two delightful leading lady - Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have a charm that this kind of work desperately needs. As the salute of the Second World War, the history of our country - although in the framework of "never was", the film has its place in the Hollywood history of music and should be available to everyone to see and find its significant advantages.
