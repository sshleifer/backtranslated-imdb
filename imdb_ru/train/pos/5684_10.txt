Wonderland is an exciting film chronicling pornographic film actor John C. Holmes participating in the brutal murders of Wonderland. <br /> <br /> the promotion of the film is misleading, thinking that it is a romanticized image of the porn industry in Vienna Boogie Nights, and that it’s not so here.In fact, several references made by the speakers that John Holmes is a porn star and a brief montage of the real life of John Holmes frames, except that this film is strictly a drama about the fallen celebrity’s involvement with murder and how it happened. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film is misleading, the film is really interesting. The play of all the actors is great, and I would like to say that Val Kilmer is striking in its ability to descend. all the manners of John Holmes. I was completely convinced that I was watching how John S. Holmes probably looked and acted in real life. <br /> <br /> If you are a John S. Holmes fan or like Hollywood stories, then I think you will love watching Wonderland.
