Honestly, I was expecting a chase in this movie. There was only one, but other than that, “Autostrada” was a great movie, which I gladly shoot on DVD. The only truly big names in the cast are Richard Belzer of HOMICIDE as a radio psychiatrist and B-Movie villain Billy Drago as a freeway killer who quotes Revelations. But the rest of the actors usually give good performances. I especially liked how Darlann Flugel gave her character, Sunny, a little courage. She could have been a helpless victim, but she’s completely rounded when she’s looking for Drago with the help of the bounty hunter James Rousseau. <br /> <br /> Rousseau, I’m afraid, looks pretty wooden, but then again, the character he plays, Frank, is not very well crafted, except for the story that Sunny gives his former commander. The threat tone is superbly maintained throughout the film, and the atmosphere of a lonely Los Angeles freeway at night with a killer sneaking up its length in its ominous gray sedan is a great way to create tension, and the music used to underline the film is accordingly composed. I don't know why there are people who hate this film so much. I guess different touches for different people. But I really liked Autostrada, and I highly recommend it.
