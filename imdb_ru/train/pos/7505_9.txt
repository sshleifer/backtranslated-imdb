If there is one genre that I have never been a fan of, this is a biopic. Always misleading, filled with false information, overly dramatized scenes and all sorts of tricks, biopsies are almost never done correctly. Even in the hands of truly talented directors such as Martin Scorsese (“Aviator”) and Ron Howard (“Beautiful Mind”), they often do a disservice to people who are trying to capture on the screen. Skepticism takes the place of deception with most biographical films that make their way to the big screen, and the Notorious Betty Page was no different. Some critics and audiences objected to Gretchen Mol playing the role of Betty Page, saying that she is no longer a celebrity and she had no choice for the role. I never doubted that Mol would be able to cope with this role since then, but I never expected her performance to be as stunned as when I watched the movie a few hours ago. The mole provides a knockout Oscar, a worthy performance as a pin-up cult girl of the 1950s, which after an abusive early life (visual and tastefully made, which few directors would probably have done) would accidentally become one of The most talked about models of all time. For 90 minutes of work, the picture covers most of the plot, but, despite no less than three scenes, there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion in the plot. The director / coauthor of the film Mary Harron and the fantastic screenplay of Guinevere Turner are overshadowed by just too harsh and not as clear as it should have ended. Nevertheless, one should pay tribute to two women for creating an almost flawless biographical film, which manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade to which he masterfully imitates. Come, the time of Oscar, Maul, Turner and Harron should receive nominations. I doubt that this will happen, although, of course, there are no three women who deserve them anymore. 9/10
