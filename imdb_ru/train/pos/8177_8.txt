I'm surprised no one thought about making such a film before. Horror is often most effective when he uses real trouble as a theme. And no one (except Steve Martin in the “Little Horror Shop”) likes to go to the dentist. Dental torture was carried out earlier (see, for example, “Maratan Man”), but it terrifies the suburbs. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a dentist, Dr. Alan Feynston (Corbin Bernsen), who descends into madness. Now our dear doctor did not play with a full deck, but because of jealousy and obsessive-compulsive disorder, he begins to smell like chaos around people around him. The psychological state of the doctors is similar to what we see in the character of Michael Douglas in the film “Fall Down”, but with horror. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by horror stunt Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna. great flow. Ken Foree also always plays the role of a cop. <br /> <br /> Now I believe that this film will not work without Corbin Burns’s absolutely fantastic performance. I really saw him only in Los Angeles before, and I was amazed at his game. <br /> <br /> The sequel to The Dentist 2 is also worth a look, but slightly lower than the original. <br /> Bottomline TTKK is a funny movie with some scenes that make you cringe, topped (pun intended) by Burnsen's magnificent performance
