Every great gangster movie has human dramas. Do not expect the emotional history of guilt, retribution and despair from "Scarface". This is a story about ferocious greed, corruption and power. The dark side of the legendary "American Dream". <br /> <br /> Anyone who complains about the "gaiety" of this film does not see the point. Superficial characters, gentle music and outdated fashion further fuel the criticism of this life of devilish excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters matters, at least on a human level. In fact, the film is almost bordered by satire, ironically, given all the gangster rappers who were positively inspired by Tony Montana's lifestyle. <br /> <br /> This is not the most powerful directorial work of Brian Depalmy, sometimes it is excellent and well-crafted (especially the memorable finale), but often descending to sloppy and misled. Fortunately, this is supported by Oliver Stone’s very strong scenario (probably a good therapy for him, given the Coca-Cola habit that he was doing at the time). The themes coincide, with an emphasis primarily on the life of Tony Montana and the evolution of his character, as he is absorbed in greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, comfortable to see between humor and drama. There are many outstanding lines that have since penetrated popular culture in one form or another. <br /> <br /> The cast helps to make it what it is, but this is indeed the film of Pacino. One of his earlier, less subtle speeches (something much more common in his life these days) is a world completely separated from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. And yet he is, as always, watchable, in a very interesting (and deliberately excessive) form. It’s hard to imagine another Tony Montana after watching this movie, perhaps in one of the most imitated performances in history. Pfeifer looked dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I understood how she played the role of a bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly wrong. Supporting players are also very good, especially Paul Shenar as courteous Alejandro Sosa. <br /> <br /> Powerful, sometimes funny, sometimes shocking and constantly controversial. Scarface is one of the eighties films (whatever that means to you). Essential and affordable gangster film and landmark culture. 9/10
