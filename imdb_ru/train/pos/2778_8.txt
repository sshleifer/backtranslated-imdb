I saw it with a little anticipation and absolutely loved it! Bend him like Beckham - a rather typical film about coming of age about a rather atypical girl. This is the role of Parminder Nagra (“ER”), in which Jess, a teenager from England, found herself between her traditional Indian family and his love of football (this is football for us North Americans). And although she is actually much older than her character, she plays the perfect role. <br /> <br /> This is a film about friendship, in particular about Jess’s friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), her team-mate, who also meets because of family problems, especially with her mom who wears purple nail polish and the little bows on his shoes, and which wants Jules to be more feminine, wear lace underwear and flirt with boys and fear that playing sports means that her daughter is a lesbian. Jules and Jess both love to play the game and run into problems trying to convince their families to let go of their dreams. They also, unfortunately, both love the same person - Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers). The love triangle causes some tension in their friendship. <br /> <br /> In some places, “Bend over Beckham” gets hit. In others, the scenes are dragged out for too long, and this film could probably benefit from more dense editing. <br /> <br /> But it was a refreshingly funny film about growing up, the clash of cultures and the love of football. It is about empowering women, chasing their dreams and supporting their friends. Funny, charming and funny, Bend It Like Beckham is a small film that could ... did. <br /> <br /> Great. 8/10.
