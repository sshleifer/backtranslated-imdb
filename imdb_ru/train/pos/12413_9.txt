The story of a wrongly executed prisoner who frequently visits the prison where he was electrocuted and kills random prisoners, waiting to take revenge on the person who substituted him. <br /> <br /> Viggo Mortensen is great, and overall the game is good, Lane Smith is delightfully evil as the guilty warden. In addition, this film has some blood, including the death of the mummification of barbed wire.
