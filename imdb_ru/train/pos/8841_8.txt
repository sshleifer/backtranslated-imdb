“Before the devil finds out you're dead,” is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. The game from <br /> <br /> of the excellent cast is incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman demonstrates outstanding performance and electrifies every time he is on the screen. Ethan Hawke picks up the scene behind the scenes, and Albert Finney just chews the screen. Marisa Tomei, however, is criminally undervalued, but looks amazing for her 42 years. The script is excellent, the storyline is non-linear, but easy enough to follow. Sydney Lumet, although not known for his blockbusters, turned out to be a real decoration with this!
