I saw this movie after watching Capote and Infamous. It’s unbelievable how homosexual relations between the author and the main characters are sublimated in the film. The reporter is straight, the main characters are more beatniks than gays. <br /> <br /> The film begins slowly, but when we re-examine, we get all sorts of interesting information from the comparisons created by screenwriter / director Brooks. <br /> <br /> Notice the incredible cut at the beginning, where the killers and being killed are related. The cutter on the phone is matched to the perry on the phone. The cutter washing his face is matched to Perry washing his face. Only Perry, looking in the mirror and seeing his erotic male body, puts forward the fantasy that he plays the guitar in Las Vegas on empty chairs. This failure / fantasy coincides with the unfortunate fantasy that Perry tells us about his father, who built a beautiful motel in Alaska just to find it constantly empty. <br /> <br /> Dick talks about the execution of pheasants and the fact that pheasants donned I don’t know that they will die. we shrink to a mess. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about his dream about the yellow bird “Above Jesus,” which attacks the nuns who were chasing them. “The nuns asked for mercy,” he says, “but the bird killed them anyway.” The bird raised Perry to heaven. Strangely, Perry says he is disgusted with the nuns, God and religion. This is repeated later in his last words, when he wants to apologize, but does not know to whom. <br /> <br /> The director inserts all sorts of “what if” and “only if” answers. <br /> <br /> Nancy Cutter is offered to sleep at a friend's house. She is holding a horse. Perry will comment on the photo of her and at home later. Nancy can't sleep in her friends' house because her boyfriend is coming for dinner. The decision seals its fate. <br /> <br /> Perry speaks of Bogart in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. But this is another painting by Bogart “Fight the Devil”, written by Truman Capote in collaboration, where the fictional treasure hunt is McGuffin. But Dick knows that the main characters of this film ended in nothing. Dick wants to get cash, those 10,000 dollars, which, in his opinion, are in the Clutter safe (which ironically turns out to be the same fantasy as Perry’s Mexican treasure. <br /> <br /> Herb Clutter signs the insurance in the amount of 40,000 US dollars). policy. He is thinking about mortality at the moment. Ironically, his death rate ends in a few hours. The insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes him a long life, again ironically, when we know what will happen in a few hours. br /> <br /> Dick said that they didn’t want witnesses that no one remembered them. Later, in fact, precisely because they destroyed all the witnesses, they were remembered. <br /> <br /> “There was one witness,” the detective continues to tell Dick later. But was this witness a friend from prison, Dick, Perry, Truman Capote, or God? The viewer becomes a witness after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> A fascinating movie.
