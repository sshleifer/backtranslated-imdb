“Strangler of the Swamp” was made by low-cost studio PRC and is certainly one of their best films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The man who was hanged for the murder, he did not return as a ghost for revenge to the people who accused him. He uses the rope to strangle his victims, and after several deaths, including the old man who runs the ferry through the swamp, he disappears. The old man's granddaughter takes the ferry herself, and also falls in love with one of the local men, and they decide to get married. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of hazy atmosphere, which makes it very creepy. <br /> <br /> Starring Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as the "Strangler". <br /> <br /> “The Swamp Strangler” is a must for old horror fans like me. Fine. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
