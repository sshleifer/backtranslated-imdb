“The Girl in Need” is a delight for the great songs of Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and a terrific cast, led by Gracie Allen and George Burns. <br /> <br /> As a rule, he has a stupid plot for an Aster film as an American dance star in England, with Burns as a publicist and Allen as secretary. They make up the story that he was a love bug when women became victims of his left and right. He bumps into Fontaine, who is held in her castle by an imperious aunt and obedient father. Stupid conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Great songs include “Foggy Day”, “Things are looking up,” “Good work if you can get it,” and “I can't be bothered right now.” Fontaine does not sing, but makes a short (and decent) number with Aster. Surprisingly good in several dance numbers with Astaire are Burns and Allen, including an ingenious and funny romp in the amusement park. <br /> <br /> The cast also includes Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montague Love, Harry Watson (as Albert), Ray Noble and my favorite - Jan Duggan as the lead singer of the Madrigal. <br /> <br /> Ian Duggan is in the middle of a faint trio that sings "Good work if you can get it." Her facial expressions are funny. She was also a stage thief in W.C. Fields's comedy “The Old Fashioned Way”, playing Cleopatra Pepperday. <br /> <br /> In this film, a lot of abuse is due to the absence of Ginger Rogers, who, as noted elsewhere, could have been terribly missed. The TCM presenter notes that Ruby Keeler and Jesse Matthews were reviewed. Clap. Two more potential disasters. Fontaine is great in the role of Alyce, and the dynamics allow the musical numbers to belong to Astaire, with abundant comic relief by Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> Funny movie, great songs, good cast and Jan Duggan in a rare light!
