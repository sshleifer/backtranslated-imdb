The costumes and makeup were great, there were some exceptionally funny lines, and the role was made for Jim Carrey. Kerry did such a good job, which could only be done, given the rather disappointing scenario. Of course, it was basically a film for children, but if you are going to spend so much money on making a film, you really should at least give the plot enough reason to go beyond Dr. Suze. I expected more from Ron Howard. It's worth seeing, but he lacks the necessary qualities to become the main classic anyway.
