Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an ordinary person who feels that God has ruined his life. God opposes him and shows Bruce the error of his path. Of course, the transfer of God's power to someone may change for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is a good one, as always, Morgan Freeman is first class and seems to feel at home, as God and the cast make a good mix of plot. The jokes are almost always aimed, although sometimes they pay too much attention to the facial expressions of Kerry. I liked the fact that the film actually depicted God not only with this, but also with a black man. I thought it was very good, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some funny scenes, for example, a scene with an opening cookie, others a little out of target, but still a good movie. 6/7 out of 10
