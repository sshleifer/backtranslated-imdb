I love this show and my 11 year old daughter, and I love to watch it together. He teaches good old-fashioned values ​​in a fun, engaging and engaging way (although in most cases this is a fairly predictable story). It is also very fun to laugh at ... you know, rewind and paste your own dialogue instead of the actors. <br /> <br /> I have a DVR installed to record all the episodes, and I accidentally catch the end of the episode (shortly before the start of the next ... so I don’t know what the episode was), but an absolutely HORRIBLE sequencing error occurred ! Adam handed over a small sample of “skin” to Sheriff Coffee, which was torn out of some criminal's coat when he tried to escape, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Well, Roy had a coat, so he put it on the table and put the sample right where he was torn off. The sample was EXACTLY rectangular ... which, I think, would be almost impossible to tear off a piece of skin (Naugahayd after the 1950s? Yes. Leather? I don’t think so). Well, the pattern was lined up perfectly, and the secret was revealed. <br /> <br /> In less than 10 seconds, we again saw the coat still lying on Roy’s desk. But this time the pattern is more like the shape of North Carolina and is now in a completely different place on the coat (but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the coat) and the seam (which WAS smack in the middle of the sample) is no longer ... like a seam in the coat . My daughter had fun laughing when we played the short scene again and again! This is the main thing for YouTube, I tell you! <br /> <br /> We still love the show completely, and the sequencing errors make it very exciting!
