Fatal Error - really cool movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato, Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart and David Lewis in the film. All the film actors played very well. Robert Wagner played his part well. The relationship between Saboto Jr. and Turner was good. There may be a big age difference, but they are a unique pair. These two actors really worked together quite well. The music in the film is really good by Ron Ramin and fits the film very well. A lot of things happen in the movie that you donâ€™t know what is going on and what will happen next, and this film will help you move from beginning to end. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato, Jr. and Janine Turner, watch this great movie!
