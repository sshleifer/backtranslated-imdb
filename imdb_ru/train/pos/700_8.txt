The Nightmare of Insomnia was an incredibly interesting, well-made film. I liked how it just throws you into the subconscious of the main character, without listening to the viewer ... the game was top notch - honestly, I would watch Dominic Monaghan reading the phone book! - but everyone else, especially the young girl, was also great. I was very impressed with the look of the film. Usually, “independent films” look grainy, as if I were shooting on a video camera, but this director knows what she is doing. Lighting, cinematography ... quality work. I look forward to full-length work from Tess Nanawati!
