Beloved Joan. Great performance. What is she not good at? I watched this movie, and then Jane Eyre right after ... she just gets better. My heart was beating. Great old drama. Just what I want from a classic movie. Facial expressions are worth the whole movie. I'm glad I have this on video. I do not know what else is needed in the film. Beautiful woman .... wealth ..... greed ..... murder .... detectives ...... test ..... <br /> <br /> The costumes are very good, Makes me What was the budget for this film? It is a pity that they still do not shoot such films. Whenever they try, they seem to make a funny movie. Black and white films still hold a certain mystery.
