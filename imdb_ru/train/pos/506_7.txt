Strong pilot, this two-hour episode does an excellent job of setting up characters and backgrounds for the Enterprise, the prequel to the original Star Trek series. Several times he encounters the Track convention and the cliche — space candy-colored strippers never seem to go out of fashion, and I can already anticipate funny references to T'pole as The Seven of the Vulcans — but the ensemble looks Strong, the characters are well traced , and it is already possible to see hints that this particular team will have to be more inventive, differently than in the earlier (later?) series. Scott Bakula, like the captain, gets on the right note with Kirk's boldness and audacity, but without his complacency and swagger, and I look forward to when an engineer, weapon master and communications officer (and not just a famous telephone operator!) Will be introduced to the series. as supporting players. Script writers seem to have caught one big mistake made in Star Trek: The Next Generation, Deep Space 9 and Voyager: instead of starting from a large cast and giving the characters a short bias, it starts with a smaller number of characters , to which you can add a little more variety later - which I hope will happen, because after about half a dozen episodes more diversity is required.
