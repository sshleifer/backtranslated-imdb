This movie was awesome! I can't get through this songs. I think I'm too old for musicals, but this film deserves special respect guys! My special favorite was Jack Wilde. I, being a British amateur of actors, you can not keep me from all these nice young people with a fresh face. I never knew that when Jack was in this movie, he was sixteen! He looks like an eleven year old. He is short, that's what helps. Try publishing your answers, colleagues, posters, so that I can tell you about your experiences. Oh, and about Oliver Reed, that guy, Bill Sykes, I think the look of the drones is really familiar. Any idea where he starred before? If so, post it, I really would like to know.
