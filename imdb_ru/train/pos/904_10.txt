Suraj Baryatya is the best in marriage films. And here it is; back to his basics vivaah. In the course of history, this is a story from engagement to marriage. The film, which you can watch the whole family. A movie you hate to watch alone. The story is simple, but the music is good, the cinematography is excellent, the direction is the best, everything in the film has its own class. There are many scenes that make you cry, and I’m sure that if you watch a movie with your sweetheart, both of you will certainly hold each other’s hand until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Shahid & Amrita Jody gave us such hits as Ishk Visk and Shikhar. Although Shihar was a good film, it was not well received by the public. This is a real movie "Shahid and Amrita".
