I recently bought this movie with a bunch of other LaserDiscs from eBay. I usually enjoy movies about war and action movies, but sometimes I like romantic comedies. <br /> <br /> If you are bored with today's special FX movies and romantic bright comedies, you should go to the store around the corner on a quiet evening. What I like about the film is that the characters have a lot of decency. There is nothing false or pretentious about them. Take, for example, Mr. Matushek: when he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his co-workers, he is trying to shoot himself. Not only because of the humiliation, but because he was unjust to the character of Stuart. (Ok, tired example.) <br /> <br /> Yes, the filmâ€™s focus is limited, and the plot is predictable. And yet I really liked it. If you like Notting Hill, then you will love the store around the corner. In fact, Hugh Grant reminds me very much of Jimmy Stewart.
