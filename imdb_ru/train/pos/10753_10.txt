I do not agree with those who say that this film deserves something below the unremitting grace that he showed. This is a stunning documentary about a shocking day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks us to rate this film. Please consider the fact that the documentary was made. The courage it took to make this film is most noticeable. We find that the two brothers broke up when this moment came. They continue to document the most courageous of the brave, not knowing about their safety and that of each other. To judge whether it is more noble to shoot a video about this tragedy or to save lives, as these amazing, amazing firemen did, is not my decision. I just know that in 30 years a class full of children will not recognize one without the other. <br /> <br /> I represent the sincere ten. That is why the art of cinema was created! To capture the natural emotions that real life offers. You can keep your junk kung fu. Romance is cute. The action will never reach this level. This movie, 9/11, will be eternal, because he does not glorify himself. It was not a sneak. He didn’t have all the glaring fuss that the lion’s share of many films on many screens is blinding. He had class, coolness, substance, and he had a record of the day that changed the modern face of America and even the world. He talked about the things that were inevitable for the camera eyes. Please consider this film as he himself proclaims an exhilarating tribute to all those who fell because of the free, beautiful name of America. <br /> <br /> How can you give something smaller to a film that shows, decorates, the natural courage of real people acting in unreal times. I love “The Godfather”, but “September 11” is a different kind of film, because now it’s a different world. This art without questions and questions. <br /> <br /> JF
