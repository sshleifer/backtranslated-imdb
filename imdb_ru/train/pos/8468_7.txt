A surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in terms of her attitude towards paranoia. There is a lot going on here, because the running time is only 74 minutes, but it works. Panics are very subtle, not frightened jumps that seem to fill the latest Asian horror films. The way the "panic" works is similar to the alarming moments in "The Uninvited" (4 Inyong Shiktak, director Su-Leon Lee), but this is not the same. The film balances the classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological. He is not perfect, but does what he has to. I would recommend checking this out if you have a chance.
