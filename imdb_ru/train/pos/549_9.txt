1896 Jeff Webster (James Stewart) does not like people. He has only one friend, and he is Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), an old sympathetic man. They lead a herd of cattle. their key to wealth. In Skagway, they run into problems when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntyre) takes cattle. Now Jeff just needs to pick him up and take him across the Canadian border to the United States to Dawson. Now they have a group of other people with them, like Ladies Rhonda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Rene Vallon (Corinne Calvet). There are two men in the gold business. The fourth collaboration of Anthony Mann and James Stewart, The Far Country (1954), is indeed a wonderful western one. The acting is great. Walter Brennan makes a terrific assistant to Stuart. Ruth Roman is gorgeous, and Corinne Kalvet is amazing. Jay Flippen is very good in the role of Marshal Dawson Rube Morris. The great Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman play small roles. It's fantastic to watch Jimmy Stewart overcome everything. I have problems on his way. There is only a man and his rifle. But he is also vulnerable.
