When you first watch this movie, it is difficult to understand exactly what happened, but upon subsequent viewing it becomes clearer. I like this movie. Dean Cain was excellent as Bob. Lexa Doig's character was embarrassing to understand, at first she was going to trap Bob, but I really believe that she landed loving him, although by then she had broken his heart. Dean Kane's performance was usually superb. He gets better with every movie he makes. My only question at the end of the film was about what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. It was left for the viewer to decide
