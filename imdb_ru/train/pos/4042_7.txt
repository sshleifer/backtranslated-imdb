The film begins with the group The Walking Dead, who sit in separate cells in anticipation of their imminent encounter with death in the form of an electric chair. <br /> <br /> Then our “hero”, who is called Tenshu, climbs into a chair, gets picked up, and then .... he is still “alive”. Aha He is given a choice by some terrible war guys who look really cool: either we will kill you until we are convinced that you are actually dead, or you can go through this door and accept any fate that awaits you. ” Our hero says “yes” to option 2, and then the real story begins. <br /> <br /> He wakes up in another type of camera (very high-tech and very large), where he finds another cellmate who also managed to survive an electric boogie-woogie. A voice in the speakers tells them that they can do whatever they want as long as it happens in this room. It sounds a bit suspicious, but two men agree: what else can they do? <br /> <br /> What these two don't know is that they were gathered together, so that they can awaken the inner urge to kill within themselves. In fact, unknown scientists in the background discard them until they decide that they should kill each other. Sounds weird? Indeed, but there is a big goal for all this. This is the part that cannot be disclosed, and therefore it will remain undisclosed. <br /> <br /> But don’t be afraid, it’s the uncertainty that prompts the viewer to look more than this pseudo-action movie, because it’s a completely different approach: how long can you be with a person who is SOB and will you kill him to get freedom ? <br /> <br /> The first hour is basically trying to arouse your interest, it sneaks up so that you do not know. He then turns into a rollercoaster with battle scenes in the spirit of the WILD Matrix with a touch of personality in honor of the comics on which the film is based. <br /> <br /> The film is really very special, therefore it is special that normal cinemas will not watch it under normal circumstances. Nevertheless, the story is exciting, the music is fantastic, and the actors do their best (some more than others) to make the film truly unique. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky that your movie or video is in the store, watch it and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to shoot mainstream movies to earn huge money. <br /> <br />
