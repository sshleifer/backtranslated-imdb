OK, so that fx are not high budget. But this story is based on real events. Not that brought together to make a couple of rich actors, even richer !! Like most book-based films, there are things that just donâ€™t fit. Only a few people said that this film is based on real events, and not on a fake, as most people believe that this is so !! This film has nothing to do with TWISTER! In addition to both films, this is a tornado. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have problems with the science of tornadoes and storms in the film, there are a few things to remember ... The Night of Scorpions was held on June 3, 1980 So this film was released 16 years after the real events. Try to think how far the storms have progressed during this time. It happened in a big city; Grand Island, Nebraska, is the third largest city in the state. Although the film calls the city something different and says that it is a small city.
