Wow! This is one thing I can say about this movie. Personally, I am one of those people who love cats, so that would be a big drawback in the film, but I liked how cats took revenge from each one at the end. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, but I have to admit that it was because I found Brian Krause, who played Charles Brady, very compelling, I think, thirst overcame me while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There was one thing that I was disappointed with. I’ve watched 'Charmed' before, and Brian Krause is married to Holly Mary Combs, his kissing scene being OK in Lunatic, but very bad compared to his kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I don’t know if this is because Krause and Combs have excellent chemistry or maybe a little more, it was the only disappointment in the film, but I think it was made for Brian Kraus in those tight jeans he wore in the film. <br /> <br /> If you are used to seeing Brian Kraus in the role of heavenly husband Holly Mary Combs and her son's father, much to the surprise of this film, he was not at all like a boy. Although now, when I think about it, it would be great to see the character Krause on Enchanted, captured by evil, making him look something like him in Lunatics. <br /> <br /> I also have to say that the music was GREAT in this film too!
