I had no idea what this movie was until I read about it in the Los Angeles weekly. I generally agree with the reviews in LA Weekly and decided to purchase a ticket for this film. movie stars Molly Parker (from my favorite television show Deadwood) and Lucas Haas - I suspect we'll see more in the near future. The film is fun, touching, great acting and beautiful photography. I do not know whether the film will have distribution, but I hope that this will happen - or will be - soon. it is destined to be a real indie gem. he even has the music of my favorite band of silver jews! the only disappointment was that Molly Parker was not in the show. even without her ... it was the best movie I ever saw at the festival.
