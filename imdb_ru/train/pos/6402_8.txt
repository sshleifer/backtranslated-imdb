I thought this move was very good. There were a few things that were not perfect, but overall I was rather surprised. The scene in the courtroom at the end seemed a bit unreal, but it was real enough to be interesting. I found that the film tells about the difficulties associated with military training and the casualties associated with this. Being a military pilot, I could relate to many of these parts.
