I found this movie really funny because you have a young black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and goes back to earth in the body of a white man of the mid-50s. He does not understand that his behavior must change, and continues to act as before. He listens to rap, sings and plays the stereotypical role of the urban black man. The real humor in this film was the observation of the problem with which this behavior connects him with the black community.
