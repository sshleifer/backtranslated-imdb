The film reveals the blatant exploitation of a Chinese worker, usually a woman who collects footage from a Chinese business owner who shares his shameless and delusional point of view, his American counterpart as well as shameless and delusional, oppressed workers who are given a voice and, of course, Drunk Americans who wear beaded necklaces are mindlessly celebrating in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> A glimmer of hope appears when some Americans actually resent the fact that people who make their beaded necklaces pay for it like $ 0.10 per hour. You also have the feeling that the workers may have a chance to quit their work at the bead factory, but this will probably happen when they get tired of the punishment regime that is popular with the factory owner, and / or they are just too tired to work before 20 hours a day hard labor. <br /> <br /> I wondered where these necklaces came from, not realizing how exhausting and difficult it would be to make them. I just really appreciated this film, as it perfectly reflects the influence of American condescension on what we consider to be relatively harmless in our society for the people on the other side of the world. A commendation goes to Wal-Mart. This is just awesome. And clearly, only the tip of the iceberg!
