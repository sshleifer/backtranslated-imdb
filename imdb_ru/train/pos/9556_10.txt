When our local TV channel was launched for the first time, it filled most of its schedule with old British programs. "Lock up your daughters!" was properly shown, and I - shook the first few seconds of the film - popped into a blank tape. The best I've ever done. <br /> <br /> Actors are perfect for their characters and lead them into a delightful life with appropriate accents (Christopher Plummer’s “Fopingpington” will leave you in the seams, as is Hoyden and her family), Double the number is present in large numbers the lines inside the wheels mix and match characters, funny sights are hidden in each scene, and comments about the risks are made regularly. <br /> <br /> I showed the film to my friends a few years ago, and they called the play “lost treasure”, both for the actors and for the story. To this day, I can go crazy just thinking about dialogue. If this gem ever gets into a DVD release, I'll be ahead.
