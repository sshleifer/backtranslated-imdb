This is one of those films that are difficult to see without giving away the plot. Suffice it to say that strange things are happening and unexpected twists and turns that go beyond the original surface plot of “Tom Cruise Unfolding with Several Women.” <br /> <br /> The quality act raises this film above the norm, and all the actors are well suited to their parts: Cruz as an annoyingly self-satisfied playboy who has everything - and then loses it all, Diaz as an attractive but slightly abnormal lover , Cruise as an exotic new girl on stage and Russell as her father’s psychologist. This story includes elements of romance, morality, the secrets of murder, suspense, and science fiction and, as a rule, is a fascinating journey. <br /> <br /> I have to add that photography also perfectly combines with various visual metaphors. beautiful when you understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> If you like well-played films with unexpected turns and the willingness to accept a slightly fantastic resolution in the style of Philip Dick, then this is a must see, <br /> <br /> 9/10
