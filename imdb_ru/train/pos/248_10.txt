"Ned Kelly" - a wonderfully made Australian film, in honor of this Australian hero. We fall into the world of Ned, his best friend Joe Byrne and other members of the Kelly gang, as the film explains and perhaps justifies Ned’s actions. <br /> <br /> There is an exceptional cast that all give stellar performances, thanks to which the film comes to life. (Great job, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was fantastic, like Joe, playing the role of a quiet, loyal lady very well. I was caught in the moment. For a moment, I almost believed that the gang would win the battle in Glenrouen, alas, this did not happen. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are fictional and are an avid fan of Ned Kelly (and his supporter). was a little disappointed with this. Perhaps the film could have lasted longer to cover more of Kelly Gang / Ned’s life — I felt I wasn’t covered enough. <br /> <br /> Despite some flaws, this is a moving film that interferes with all sorts of emotions. (And, hey, I would suggest that this film is better to watch than Mick Jagger trying to portray Ned ...)
