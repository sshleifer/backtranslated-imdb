This film is the first film experience for several actors. All of them are experienced actors and played in several TV shows and performances. Sahan Gokbakar is a famous comedian in Turkey. It is strange to see him in a thriller when he is at the peak of his comedic career in Turkey. This film is the first long shot of Togan Gokbakar and almost the first experience of the director. But they all did a good job. We are glad to see such an enthusiastic young cast. They seem very promising for the future of the Turkish film industry. Doga Rutkai, longtime beloved Sahan Gokbakar, is also a talented actress, known for her recent play in the theatrical play number 27 and several TV shows.
