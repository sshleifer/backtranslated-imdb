I noticed that NEW HOPE and BACK EMPIRE are in the TOP-10, but this is not even in the TOP-100. <br /> <br /> This film has a bad reputation because of Evoks, but there are many reasons to fall in love with this movie: <br /> <br /> - “Saving Han Solo from Jabba”: this official completes the plot the debt of Han Solo, which was established when we first met the hero in "NEW" HOPE. <br /> <br /> - “The Emperor was finally revealed”: “Well, okay, now it may not work so well when the prequel came out, but we first saw the Emperor as a child.” <br /> <br /> - The Speeder Bike Chase: Alright, so this was a moment of special effects. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films! <br /> <br /> - The culmination of 3 parts: 1) The Battle of Endor (under the direction of Han and Lei) 2) Luke confronts his father & the Fall of the Emperor 3) Destruction of the Second Death Star (The moment of Lando) <br /> <br /> - The final holiday with our heroes: As I said, this film gets a lot of shit because of Ewoks, but I think it's cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the FALL of the EMPIRE, our heroes have their own private party forest with each other. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a great final chapter for our heroes and a suitable conclusion to the story of STAR WARS.
