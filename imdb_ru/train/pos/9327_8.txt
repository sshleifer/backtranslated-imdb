I write this after seeing the “Ideal Son” at the gay and lesbian film festival Mardi Gras in Sydney, Australia, in 2002. <br /> <br /> When their father dies, two estranged brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that of the brothers die of AIDS, they embark on a heartfelt way of reconciliation. The two heroes are doing an excellent job of creating a gradual warmth and respect that develops between them as the film progresses. Although I have some doubts about the film - although the dying brother is behaving badly, he does not watch it. A person with 0 T4 cells would look completely sick - even work on makeup to make an actor look bad was not busy. A small grab, but one that makes it a little less realistic. Despite this small complaint, “The Perfect Son” is a wonderful film, and if you have a chance to watch it, do it. I hope to release a DVD in the near future!
