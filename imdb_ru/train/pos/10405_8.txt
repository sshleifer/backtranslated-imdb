This film was one of my favorites in childhood, and I must say that, unlike some other films that I liked during that period, “The Thief of Baghdad” retained its quality while I was growing up. This is not just a film for children; adults can watch and enjoy it. The only drawback is that it is impossible to see behind the “bad” effects (compared to the effects of today) as one could when he was a child. I did not remember anything about these effects, of course, about ten years have passed since I watched this film when I was about eleven years old. Who is watching the effects then? One is looking for only good stories and entertainment, and this is exactly what this film gives. In my opinion, this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. After thinking about it, I feel that Indiana Jones films are very similar to this film. Comedy, romance and adventure - all in one, which creates an amazing mix that captures you from the very beginning to the end, and although the film is old, and the music and style of the films are clearly not modern, it cannot be dusty and old. All this is mainly due to the great story, good direction and good acting of the actors. In this section, Sabu (like Abu) and Konrad Weidt (like Jaffar) stand out, providing mostly comedic and frightening elements of the film. A great movie, and although the "old man", definitely "golden." I hope someone has enough intelligence and courage to release this movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
