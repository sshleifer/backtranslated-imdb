Barbara Stanwick plays Lily Powers. She is the waitress for her father to talk in a dirty little mining town. He also sells it to men. She runs off to New York and literally sleeps on top. <br /> <br /> Initially, I saw only the 71-minute version, but it is quite extreme for its time. Nowadays, this is pretty tame. The film moves very quickly and has many sexual hints - some of them today look rather silly (but fun). It moves so fast that you can easily ignore that most of this will never happen - even in 1933. There is nothing classic or monumental about it - it's just a quick, fun dirty little film that delivers a lot of fun. It only falls apart at the end with a slight “moral” ending that the censors demanded. It seems incredible and stupid (I saw it in the theater, and the audience laughed at it - one guy quite rightly said: “For nothing”). I just saw the uncut 75-minute version, which has a different, somewhat tragic and MUCH better ending. This version was considered lost until 2004, when it was discovered by mistake! I believe this is the only release, but be warned. <br /> <br /> The acting is good - Stanvik starts to play his part and GOES. She makes you believe that she likes to be cruel and sleep around. There are also strong support activities from beautiful Donald Cook and George Brent. Also look for the deathbed John Wayne as a cheerful and gentle office worker! Fun, dirty and fast. I give it 9.
