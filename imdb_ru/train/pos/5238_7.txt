I liked Top Gun. It held my interest. Predictable plot, decent character development and storyline. It is very similar to noon in that city people seem weak and scared to confront the villain. In this film, there are several quality actors who really have not had the opportunity to share all their talents. Also, some actors did not receive credit for their roles. Denver Pyle was a young man in his youth. John Diener, Rod Taylor outstanding in their roles. Sterling Hayden did everything he could with bad material. It is hard to imagine it as an arrow. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was a disgusting character. She seemed flattered that two men might have fought for her. Ugh. Finally, how can people travel without luggage? Especially women.
