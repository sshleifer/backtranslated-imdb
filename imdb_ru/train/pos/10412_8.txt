The thief of Baghdad is a treasure. First of all, it is a good story. Despite the fact that my four children tell about this story, the most famous of the “Arab Nights” stories, is owned by Disney Corporation, “The Thief of Baghdad” brought their interest to the end. The story moves at a good pace and includes one or two turns, which reduce predictability. Sabu, who plays a young thief, Abu, also takes part in the consideration of any of today's teenage actors, judging by how many times I heard my eldest daughter say: “He-ee!” <br /> <br /> In 1940, the film won an Oscar for cinema and special effects. Today, of course, these effects seem very outdated (“Look, this is Barbie flying through the air,” my daughter announced at the sight of the flight of a gin). And yet they fit well into the story. The film, after all, is over 60 years old. Effects correspond to the scenario. In addition, what the Thief of Baghdad sees is largely modern over the next twenty-five years. Just compare the first montage from the 1967 Star Trek episode to see this. In this he was a real achievement. <br /> <br /> This can be called a family film, although at the end there are several stab wounds. Acting is so obvious, and wounds are so bloodless, that these scenes are almost as artificial as animation. <br /> <br /> In general, a funny film that is worth seeing as an evening of pure entertainment, as well as historical value. from effects. I recommend it.
