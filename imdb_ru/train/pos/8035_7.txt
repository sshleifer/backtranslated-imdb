Sunday would not have been a resurrection without an action movie, and when you want a tense battle, you turn to Tom Berenger (Platoon). <br /> <br /> Here he plays a sniper in the jungle, pursuing rebel and drug lords. Life is a bitch, so he gets a green office type (Billy Zane) to assist in the mission. <br /> <br /> The film is in the hands of Luis Llos, who stunned Anaconda. he doesn't get much better here, but Berenguer makes the film worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Of course, this may be a bit long - who wants to see a lot of walks through the jungle, but this is good, intense action when the time is right.
