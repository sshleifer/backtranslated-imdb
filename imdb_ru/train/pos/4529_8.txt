As is well known among longhaired young people who are incredibly interested in the silent riots of this Herr Graf, in the summertime aristocrats love to travel to exclusive and outstanding places to avoid the heat, as well as crowds of rude people who relax. Such strange journeys around the world occur in the "Three Centuries", a charming and elegant piece of the silent creativity of old hands, namely Herr Buster Keaton and Herr Eddie Klein. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this German earl liked most the first segment was devoted to the Stone Age because of the closeness of this aristocrat to that ancient time. preferring this to the second segment, which occurs at the time of the glory of Rome (it should have included the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire, that is, the barbarians, or the same thing, the Germans). Of course, the third segment takes place in the modern era, but this Teutonic aristocrat believes that even 100 years ago it must be considered modern. <br /> <br /> The leitmotiv that makes Herr Keaton and his companions travel and carry strange and funny events over three different eras is a search for love, a very difficult subject to understand for aristocrats who prefer to search for money and personal interest. Every time when “Three Centuries” is shown in the Schloss Theater, it is always pleasant to watch a funny, witty silent film (even for a serious German count), an essay full of jokes and gadgets, puns, traps and acrobatics, visual and amazing techniques, Absolutely silent delicacies, perfect for bearing different and rough summer weights. <br /> <br /> And now, if you let me, I have to temporarily leave, because this German earl should flirt with an old Teutonic heiress who does not look her age. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand von Galitsian http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
