Although it is generally accepted that “Fearful symmetry” was strongly influenced by the episode “Kolchak, which they were, they are, they will be”, whether it makes plagiarism or a tribute, it is generally more controversial. As a big fan of both episodes, I join the last conviction, although less charitable might not work. James Whitmore was brave enough to take on the task of leading such a complex episode, the invisible elephants and gorilla costumes sound like a recipe for disaster, but he copes with the style, the teaser is an absolute gem. Lance Guest does a great job of creating a trustworthy character from Kyle Lang, and Jack Reider is boiling against the threat of Ed Meecham. Forget about the dubious originality of Fearful Symmetry and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying X File.
