I have to say that the events of September 11 did not hit me until I saw this documentary. It took me a year to cope with the destruction. I was the one who changed the station on the radio and on the TV channel, if there was talk of towers. I'm sick of hearing about it. When a year later and a day later it was broadcast on television, I did not take my eyes off my eyes. It was the first time I cried after the attack. I highly recommend this documentary. I watch it now on TV, 5 years later, and I'm still crying about tragedies. The fact that it contains one of the only video snapshots of the first aircraft hitting the turret is amazing. It was an accident, and see where he got them. These two brothers make me want to be there to help.
