Just funny, look! <br /> <br /> OK, they want 10 lines, so here: this is a parody of the werewolf movies of the 50s / 70s. A lot of satire, a little political. Sounds like Clouseau's early movie (probably due to Alan Arkin), but with less slap. If you like movies with “Nude Guns”, you will also like it (this time less farce). <br /> <br /> In fact, humor varies from a slight sexual hint (inevitable in a juvenile comedy) to a really sharp socio-political satire. The transformation of the high school moon from the 50s to the 70s is really fun. The sequence with changing presidential portraits is brilliant! OK, maybe not brilliant, but still fun. There are many (historical) cracks, starting with the paranoia of the Cold War of the 50s and inflation of the late 70s. <br /> <br /> In any case, just watch the movie if there is a chance!
