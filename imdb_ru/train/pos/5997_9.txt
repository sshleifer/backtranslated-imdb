Let me start by saying that I had never watched a movie on IMDb before; However, I myself am in the video business. And based on this perception; I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that this film is something that should be short. He has a very good story and one more thing I love - (even better turn). The discovery was very well done, I liked the video selected for it and how it was edited. <br /> <br /> I'm not a B & W fan, but the way this film uses the effect that it works. And with any movie, that's all that matters. The movie stream works fine, and the editing was very well done. On the technical side (with which I usually work) everything is also very well done. There are no core technologies. things to indicate. The only thing I have is that the end credits are a bit vigorous. This is probably due to the problem of rendering. Let me also say that I would prefer to see more of the love scene, but I am a guy (so you can rate it to the double factor). <br /> <br /> In general, I rate it as 9/10, It is worth seeing if you are a fan of India and / or short films. <br /> <br /> ps. sorry for bad grammar or spelling.
