An interesting animation about the fate of a giant tiger, sloth and mammoth who saved a child who was close to being killed by a group of tigers during the ice age. The moral of the film shows that good behavior with others can be beneficial at the end. One of the tigers in the group was ordered to finally catch the child, who was hardly saved by his mother when the tigers attacked her community. The child was saved by a sloth and mammoth, but the tiger joined them in order to finally take the child. They passed very difficult paths with many dangers, and immediately the tiger had to fall and escape from the mammoth. At the end, a group of tigers attempted to catch the child, but the mammoth, which his tiger colleague had incredibly helped, was able to overcome the attack and return the child to his father and the community to which he belongs.
