Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait, I happily switched to the channel, showing it at the very beginning. First, “Canon” Pachelbel brought a lump to my throat, then the sight of a tiger moth (on which all my grandfather, my father and I flew) caused a light moisture around the eyes, and then the name Crowe hooked me completely. I was fascinated by this film, Crow's performance (again), the subject (and yes, the duty we owe), how various issues were solved and solved, flying episodes (my father also flew Avro Ansons), the story - and, as noted another member, Crow talks about High Flight. I won't spoil the movie for anyone, but being separated from my wife for more than 4000 miles, as a former army officer who was involved in several wars, and as a private pilot, I confess that I cried from my heart a couple of times, Buy, rent, download, ask, borrow or steal - but look. <br /> <br /> PS Did I spy on Bristol Blenheim (yellow) on the ground? It looked like a twin-engine twin-303 Browning aircraft in a dorsal turret.
