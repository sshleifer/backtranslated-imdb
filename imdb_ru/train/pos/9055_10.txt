This is a terrific movie and all the actors and actresses are very good! Despite the fact that some actors and actresses were not very popular in show business, they seemed to be acting from the age of 1! It was funny, rude and just a very good movie. In most cases, I just did not know what will happen next! It seemed to me that this would happen, wait, I think that this will happen. All age groups will love this movie! In some parts I could not stop laughing, it was so funny, but in some parts I was completely unconscious and could not believe what I saw! I am definitely going to see this movie again! This is one of those films where you never get bored. Every time you see, it's so tense. I definitely recommend watching this movie!
