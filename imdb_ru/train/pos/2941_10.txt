This is the best show for one person in which Eddie Murphy is at his best. Just forget about Nutty Professor and respected gentlemen, this is a real Eddie Murphy. His imitations of Mr. T. (pretending to be gay), Michael Jackson and other artists are killers. I think it is also quite brave to laugh at artists who were really popular at the time. My favorite act is where he, at his annual barbecue, plays with his family his drunken dad and aunt Bunny, who fall down the stairs. <br /> <br /> This show is the best medicine when you feel bad! If you are watching the continuation of "Raw", do not be disappointed. This is also good, but does not correspond to 'Delirious'.
