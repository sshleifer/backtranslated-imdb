Well, I will be honest when I first saw the program’s trailer, I thought it was an advertisement for some kind of sunscreen product. With all the people walking along the beach. Despite this, I decided to watch it, thinking that it would be some new show that I could laugh about. But I was seriously surprised. <br /> <br /> From the first 10 seconds of the program I was hooked on why it lies in the trees, why the plane crashed, and so on. <br /> <br /> Not every day there comes a show that combines intelligence, humor, action and suspense. But "Lost" rules it all. With a great cast and film crew, beautiful locations and pretty decent special effects, “Lost” will catch anyone who tunes in to him, and you should definitely see everyone who is tired of stupid comedies and crappy reality show. <br /> <br /> Lost on Tuesdays at 10 on channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O
