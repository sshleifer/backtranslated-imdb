Roman Polanski plays Trelkovsky, who rents an apartment in France. The previous tenant is in the hospital after a suicide attempt. He goes to her where he also meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani), Simone's girlfriend. He and Stella get pretty close. Later, Simone dies. Trelkovsky begins to think that the owner and neighbors are trying to turn him into Simon, so that in the end he too jumped out the window. “Locator” (Tenant) since 1976 - the last film of the Polanski trilogy about apartments. The previous ones were “Repulsion” and “Rosemary's Baby”. Roman Polanski does not cope with the work only as a director, but his acting is also great. Isabelle Ajani with her big glasses is gorgeous. The host, Monsieur Z., plays the great Melvin Douglas. Van Fleet plays Madame Dios. The fantastic Shelley Winters is a Concierge. The tenant is sometimes scared. This causes a lot of psychological fear. This film is not the easiest to understand or explain, but it makes it all so exciting.
