Bill and Ted's fake journey is arguably the best movie I've ever watched. Although the game, scenery, and so on. D. Bad, who cares. The storyline is brilliant, and the jokes and words that they came up with are the most excellent, the ideas are great too. I recommend everyone to see this classic. The best part, obviously, when they “melvinit” death, I understood for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the film. This is much better than the first one, which was also great. Perhaps the funniest movie of all time !!!!! I think the best parts of the film, however, when Bill and Ted scream and play guitar solos, it was fun. Rock to Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen, release the third movie!
