Seeing this movie again, it seemed to me infinitely better than the last time I watched it. The game is amazingly beautiful. Characters are very clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is just as gorgeous as a lost son who rebels. Other actors and actresses are equally good in all respects. Robert Redford creates a remarkable historical play from the speakeasies of the 1920s. The landscape is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western Montana. In general, this is one of the best films made in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> You should watch this movie! <br /> <br />
