First of all, the female leader is too magnificent not to notice. Now the actress Wang Zu Xian, who played Xiao Qian in the film, is 42 years old, and she is well aged. It is always nice to look at these glorious times when you see such old works in Hong Kong as this one. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the most influential films of the 1980s. The decoration of the scenery and other aesthetic facets fascinate. More fantastically, the film was a completely black humorous shade in it. It looks like a horror movie, but in the end it does not scare, but only entertains. <br /> <br /> I had the experience of translating the second script of “The History of Chinese Goats”, and I thought that the script was a decent record, However, when I watched the movie, I was at first disappointed to see that the film was different from the script for example, on a smaller scale and with more comic roles. Nevertheless, he was better executed in terms of entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you saw the Lord of the Rings, you will notice the similarities in this film with LOTR. The climax is like the mirror of Miranda Otto, fighting the Ring Witch. This is definitely a laugh out loud. Bravo!
