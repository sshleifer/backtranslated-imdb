Difficult film to comment, how do you say this is bad? Well, it is not, but at the same time it is difficult to say that it is good. What it is, it is an irresistible observation, it is as close as you get into complete devastation without being there. These are photos of a tsunami approaching the coast of Thailand that have come to life, you know that you want to turn away, but you have to look. <br /> <br /> Brothers Naudet very well cope with the comments, even in the majority of tragic circumstances, views on what is happening in another country are not condoned or insulted. The facts focus on pulp, and the viewer does not need much to understand or understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> You can’t change the story, and you don’t want to, this film is a testament to humanity at its darkest hour.
