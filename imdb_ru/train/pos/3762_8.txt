Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as two drug addicts from San Dimas who are sent on their next trip for life, as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite of how it was presented in the first film. The only difference is that their journey is “somewhere” between Heaven and Hell, and in the end they are both. When they meet the Grim Reaper, they have the chance of an afterlife to play with him to get a chance to come back and stop the two evil robots from destroying the future they were to have. In addition to the roles that they ... uh ... improved, they also play (and in the process animate a few extra sales) some classic games (I even have my original copy of Sea Battle in the closet). <br /> <br /> The reason why I liked this film more than the original is because it says “what it could be” instead of “what it was”. Without spoiling the film, I can’t give you more information about it (I guess you just need to watch them both and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10 stars.
