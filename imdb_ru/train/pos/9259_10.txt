It was simple and yet so nice. I think that the whole sense of segregation by gender in a society that can be bitter, manifested itself very delicately. It was a bitter hammer. The fact that most of the actors were not professionals made the film more tangible and more realistic. There was also a “documentary” side of the film. The best scenes were those that all the girls who are forbidden to watch, listened passionately to the soldier who should watch them, broadcasting the game. If you are an Iranian, then friends who greet and dance on the streets after winning a game fill you with national pride !! If you are not an Iranian, you will still like it!
