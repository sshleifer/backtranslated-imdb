American cars directed by Paul Verhoeven differ in quality, but most of the films he shot in his homeland are undoubted masterpieces. This is the story of an alcoholic writer (and bisexual) who lives with a beautiful rich and very strange woman. But the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting with a beautiful lover, a man. Meanwhile, the writer suffers from strange visions - at first they look like hallucinations caused by alcohol abuse, but soon he begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some kind of foreboding. Fascinating hitchcock thriller, very original and provocative. I love films that make you think that they are about something, but then you realize that they are about something completely different. This is one of those films; thriller in the first half and quasi-religious surreal saga in the second half. Very erotic, original and blasphemous, not for children or people who go to church every Sunday. Great cinematography of the future director Jan de Bont. Highly recommended!
