What a delightful film ... <br /> <br /> This film, accompanied by the juicy, emotional and dreamy music of the composer who won Oscar Rachel Portman, remains a real delight, worthy of viewing more than once a year. <br /> Incredible cast ... <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for the role of Emma. Tony Collette was great as Harriett Smith. <br /> <br /> The character who stole the movie was Miss Bates !!! She was hypnotized to watch, everyone is on the edge of his place, just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her. One of the cutest characters I've come across over the centuries. From one of the first scenes when she thanks Mr. Woodhouse for sending "this beautiful quarter of pork ... PORK, MOTHER !!!" she screams at her stupid and obviously hearing-impaired mother, Mrs. Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother, Phyllida Lowe), who looks miserable and lost. <br /> <br /> The funny ways Emma could have avoided the decisive Miss Bates By herself on one really heartbreaking picnic scene when Emma insults Miss Bates, who takes her cruel dig in her heart. Then we see how poor Miss Bates stutters and is on the verge of tears and just so crushed that she can't help but feel that her heart has broken out on her behalf. This is a classic scene that needs to be rewound and played again and again ... <br /> <br /> The Sense & Sensibility Final is right there and gives one of the greatest lessons in life about how to get married. one of the best friends ... <br /> <br /> I hope that this film will delight you all just as much as myself. <br /> <br /> I adore him!
