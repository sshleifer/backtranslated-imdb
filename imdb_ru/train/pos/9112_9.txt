Being half Portuguese, I do not get half blind (and not half prejudiced) when I discuss Portuguese films. Not that I did it anyway very often. But this film was such a rush of adrenaline! Yes, this is true - it was basically exactly in terms of history, but she did not bother to go beyond the usual territory of Portuguese cinema: things like using real places in the middle of busy Lisbon and a real crowd to stand for a real crowd almost 30 years ago. And they got it right by God! Well, to summarize: very emotional if you have experienced it, but you will notice the slight improvements that could be made, as well as the plot needs that were. If you just look at it at random, a good historical joke awaits you, only the most recent story and a little more convincing than usual. Even by European standards, yes.
