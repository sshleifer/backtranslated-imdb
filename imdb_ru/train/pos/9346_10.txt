If you didn’t like this movie, or your deceased, or you hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. <br /> <br /> Excellent cast, all of which gave good performances. This film proved that Adam Sandler is a good actor, despite what critics say. Adam Sandler becomes a very respected actor. It all started with his performance in the movie “Big Daddy”, then he made a couple of bad films, then with a terrific performance he performed in the movie “50 First Dates”, “The Longest Yard”, then “Click”, and now - “Reign Over Me ". <br /> <br /> Return to the film. Adam Sandler plays the man who lost everything. He has a mother-in-law and a father-in-law closest to his family. After his old college roommate (Cheadle) ran into him, he seems to have turned his life around. I will not say more, because I do not want to spoil the film, but I highly recommend this film. One of the best films of 2007.
