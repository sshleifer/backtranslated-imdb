Freddy's film is dead, the last nightmare is as terrible and disturbing as any other Nightmare on Elm Street, yes, this is the essence of comedy, like all other films, but how can anyone say that you will not find Freddy Krueger? It’s scary if you met this person in your dreams, you wouldn’t find him even more frightening with a comic essence about him, because his comedy shows that he doesn’t care to kill you, that he considers it very funny, and Freddie also plays comic intellectual games with them, which in their own way is very disturbing, using his comic ways, which, I think, make horror films a Nightmare on Elm Street just as they are today. Script writers are extremely clever, making Krueger comic and scary. Unlike Jason Vorhis, who says nothing and doesn’t know how to really scare his victims, this film is about as good as Freddie’s, and I would recommend it to everyone. humor and the way "Do not sleep!" ".
