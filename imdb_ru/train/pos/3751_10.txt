I know that you already participated in film festivals (or at least I think you have, I just make it up), but I think it should get the “best animated short film” in everyone. Bravo. I can't wait for the full movie. I understand that you may not hear this often enough because of the strange nature of your animations, but you will hear it now and accept it as truth. Glory, my friend. Ok, now I'm just trying to get ten lines of text ... Although I still mean it. And here comes another "FOOTWEAR!", And I still can not stop here. This is very annoying, and at the same time I have nothing to do. In fact, I’ll probably watch all your films in another spasmodic Jason Steele Marathon. I have a lot of them. <br /> <br /> -R
