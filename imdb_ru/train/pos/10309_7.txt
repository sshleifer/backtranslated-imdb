Now either you like Mr. Kerry’s humor, or you don’t. I, I and Irina had spectators who came out in droves and, on the other hand, encouraged and fell in puddles of fun. Bruce Almighty is a little more popular, but you have been warned. <br /> <br /> If you're not sure, watch the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when I saw the movie. If you do not see how the dog lowers the seat after using the toilet, then do not worry about the film. <br /> <br /> Kerry, a reporter stuck in a rut that illuminates "light news" scolds God, when it seems that his whole life goes hand in hand. God accepts the challenge and asks Kerry if he can do better. Kerry gets the opportunity to use all of God's forces, increasing the breasts of her friend (Jennifer Aniston), increasing her reputation and answering all the prayers with disposable computer commands. <br /> <br /> This is not a tall movie or even this unforgettable one, but it is very well made for very limited purposes, Kerry’s fans laugh almost continuously, and even any religious merriment is likely to be harmless to everyone except the most God's troops and opponents. -God squads. <br /> <br /> At a more thoughtful level, the film encourages us to reflect on Kerry’s own career — stuck in his comedy typography; he generally could not make an impression as a serious actor, even after winning two golden globes. His most accomplished "straightforward" role, "Man on the Moon," is less well known than his comedic fuss - or The Truman Show (in which the Academy collected three nominations, bypassing Kerry).
