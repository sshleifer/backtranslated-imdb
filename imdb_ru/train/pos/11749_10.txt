Finally, we get the show where we see acting talent! Episode One was superb! The script gave us a little more than usual, yes, it was still: "I am not your father - I am your father, and yet you cheated on me!" to us, what it would be like if - as many television series do. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera also gave us a little more than usual, there were no boring shots with repetitive angles for several hours, but there were no unnecessary “shots inside the pictures or manual camera shots” to add. the art region gave us what we needed to see, as well as some beautiful landscape paintings! <br /> <br /> Nothing was overly dramatized or melodramatic, they were real people in a real place dealing with real situations, there was nothing dramatic and absolutely relevant in the play. It was a relief when I was able to see a real acting game, and it is so nice to show our country how talented our actors can be when they are given a real script, a real opportunity! Thanks to Tony Tils, Sam Miller, Channel 10 and all the cast and crew - great job !! Please continue what you are doing; your efforts are greatly appreciated and do not go unnoticed!
