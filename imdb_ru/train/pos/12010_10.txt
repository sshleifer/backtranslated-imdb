Warning: soft spoilers. <br /> <br /> The story of Joseph Smith stands out as an amazing, even touching, episode from American history and the history of world religions. This film tells about the events in the life of Joseph Smith, whom the Mormons worship as the prophet of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on earth. So far I have seen the film twice in the first month of its public display. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith is shown to be the first to be the youngest of the trio of brothers (Alvin, Hyrum and Joseph), who, at a very young age, need surgery. The operation, carried out without our modern comforts, was bloody and complex. The scene helped show the cohesion of the Smith family and the connections between the brothers and between Joseph and his parents. <br /> <br /> Joseph’s religious confusion and subsequent prayers that led to what the Mormons call the First Vision were interestingly depicted, Jesus’s face is never shown, but you see the unmistakable nail marks in His hands. The refusal of religious leaders and many members of his small New York community is at least slightly sweetened by Joseph's marriage with Emma. <br /> <br /> This film does not give a clear picture of the events in the history of the Mormon Church, but only jumps from scene to scene. This is not a criticism - just a note about style. <br /> <br /> The practice of rejuvenation and shading is shown, and it is especially dramatic and touching when Joseph preaches a sermon on the love of the Savior with a scar on his face. from a recent attack. <br /> <br /> The film masterfully portrays at the same time the joy and growth of Mormonism as a children's church, and at the same time an ever-increasing opposition that extends to the heights of local governments. <br /> The film shows many scenes from the life of Joseph, including several wonderful moments telling about his relationship with Emma. An attempt was made to show the depth and complexity of Joseph's life, including his cruel love for his wife, his endless love for children, his wit, his courage in the face of dirty and dangerous opposition, his religious feelings and his compassion. <br /> <br /> When Joseph and Hyrum travel to Carthage, never to return home alive, most of the characters in the film whose lives touched Joseph are shown along the way, helping to reinforce what was already seen, but preparing the final scene, to be more powerful. <br /> <br /> At the end, the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum is depicted, and the audience is left to think about the events that they have just witnessed. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the film, I assumed that it was created by the Church to introduce non-members to Joseph Smith. I no longer think so, although I hope the film can do it. As an insider, I discovered that the film is a celebration of Joseph, and he perfectly emphasizes the good that we already know about him. I am curious to see how outsiders will watch the film - whether they will simply perceive it as a propaganda, epic story of an American religious person or something else. <br /> <br /> The film is perfectly filmed, suitable for family viewing, moving and, I hope, something good for everyone. It is interesting to think about the events depicted in these United States of America in the light of many aspects of our culture - including freedom of religious expression and respect (in general) for the law - we, modern people, take for granted.
