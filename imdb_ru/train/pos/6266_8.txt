This picture is very much appreciated for me, as it represents an extremely pleasant and amusing parody of the invaders-aliens who captured the city and many of its people. <br /> <br /> The city and the players are divided into categories. 1950s style and the whole film has a deliberately tasteless and kitschy feeling to it. Some scenes are funny, like the birth of an alien creature. <br /> <br /> All the actors give full-blooded and serious performances, which makes the film even funnier, and the special effects and “Aliens” at least seem I intentionally add to the third level of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Such films often deserve a cult: <br /> <br /> 8/10.
