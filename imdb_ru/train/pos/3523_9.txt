A whimsical and brilliant combination of talents between director Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as secretary trying to save his boss from the electric chair, tracking down the mysterious "ghostly" woman, and Franchot Ton as a madman and murderous sculptor. In addition, there are several fascinating small roles played by Elisha Cook Jr. as a drummer with drugs, as well as other characters that make up part of the plot. If you are used to seeing Raines in more useful roles, she is allowed to go overboard, especially in her scenes with Cook. Franchot Ton also plays someone completely different, and although this is not a convincing role, it acts phenomenally. While the plot is far-fetched, the film has a real atmosphere and it is very interesting.
