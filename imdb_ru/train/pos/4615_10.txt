I think people underestimate this incredible film. People see him as a typical horror film, which is designed to scare us and make it impossible for us to sleep. What if he tried to do this, he deservedly got 1/10, but I watched this film with several friends, and we found it very interesting, and although it was a good film, after all, he has Stephanie Beaton. That's why I think he deserves 10/10 for pure movie entertainment. <br /> <br /> A general view of this film is that it has a bad game, a simple scenario for 10 years. the old can produce, and it cannot be taken seriously, and people rate it low because of this. But I see it as a very interesting masterpiece ... which has an amusingly funny script that is made by even more interesting actors, and although not very serious, it is very interesting.
