My daughter, her friends and I have watched this movie literally dozens of times. I bought it twice, and some little girlfriends hid with it. Subsequently, I rented it so many times. Just never getting old !!! At Blockbuster it is not even listed, and I tried to buy, find, rent it for more than 5 years. Without a doubt, it was and is my favorite childhood movie of my daughter ... it has everything! We laughed, we cried, we discussed real life and how difficult it is for some children in the world. There was nothing fake about this movie. We are connected with every second and every line of Bill! Thank you very much for restoring our faith in human nature. Sincerely, Schellin and Kaylin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, and !!! :-) August / August Update '07: <br /> <br /> Who are we to judge whether a rich woman falls in love with a poor man; or a person who has love decides to raise a child who is not his own. It may not be mine or your life. This is not only believable, it happens every day. Thank God! Supports my belief in human nature !!! celebrate !!!!
