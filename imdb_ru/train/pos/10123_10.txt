Shinjuku Triad Society: Chinese mafia wars are unlikely to spread in the West outside film festivals. What for? Can your censors watch a movie where police will rape men and women suspected to make them talk (and the victims will like it) or see an old woman snatch an eye from the skull? These are just a few shocks that viewers expect this story about ultraviolet police and gangsters. This makes Clockwork Orange, which has been banned in the UK for years, similar to the Disney cartoon. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie? YES This is a fantastic and necessary viewing for fans of Asian cinema. The shocking moments show what happens in the world of these characters. If you like it, make sure you catch Dead or Alive, which is very similar (except for the crazy ending in DOA, of course). It’s great for Japan that they have a talent like Miike working along with Takeshi Kitano. The best chance to see this film outside of Takashi Miike's retrospectives at the film festival is on DVD. If I don’t save you, try searching the Hong Kong version on the Internet, as I’m sure it will appear in this country.
