I must admit, I did not expect much from watching this film in my Japanese film lesson, but this film really amazed me. The director copes with the title of his film, really depicting a picture of madness. I think that the fact that this film is silent adds a resemblance to madness, helping the viewer to feel the inner world of the characters, and not the world beyond. This film only added to my feelings about dumb foreign films against American ones, in which foreign films work much more to train your mind and make you think, rather than striving for a fluffy film always with a happy ending, using little imagination.
