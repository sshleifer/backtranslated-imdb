Do not expect the image of "truth." However, the reports of these veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan require careful consideration. <br /> <br /> The main strength of the film lies in the fact that it vividly represents the words and military wounds of these vets and their post-war struggle to restore a certain degree of normality and functionality of their life. <br /> <br /> My main criticism of the film is twofold: it is one-sided, and he advocates anti-war activism, but no more than that, to correct the serious flaws in military and veteran programs, helping those who we suffered and We have suffered from the trauma of war. This is NOT the fatal flaws of the film. <br /> <br /> I, as a veteran, know that the terrible consequences of war are real, and these young men and women speak very well of this. These veterinarians vividly describe the physical and mental pain and anguish that most veterans experience and which ordinary people should understand, because the horrors of ALL wars are so traumatic and troubling.
