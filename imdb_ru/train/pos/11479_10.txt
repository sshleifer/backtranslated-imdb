This film was excellent, a bit scary, but excellent. For those of you who have heard about Columbine and know the story, this gives you an idea of ​​what and why these children did what they did. Deep down you know what people think about it, but you never understand how bad it is, and this film makes you aware. This is seriously that good. It also makes you think twice before making fun of someone that is accurate. I read a book about the Colombian massacre, and it made me think, this film makes me worry and scares me to death. On the other hand, this is similar to how to kill someone for serial killers. I recently received a threat, and I threw it away without thinking about it, but after this film, I think you should take everything seriously. Some people are crazy and you never know who they really are, so take it seriously and do not underestimate someone.
