This film is all about style, atmosphere and action. True, I did not believe all the events of the plot, but it did not matter - an amazing game, unexpected plot twists and a wonderful atmosphere sucked me and dragged me along, and I had a great time. Kenneth Branagh is not only a great actor, but also a master of accents, and he proves it once again with an impeccable Georgian accent. He is surrounded by such great talent in supporting roles (Robert Downey Jr., Embeth Davidtz from Schindler's List and The Fallen, Tom Berenguer, Daryl Hannah and Robert Duval) that I was simply amazed. I recently bought a copy of this film, and I'm not tired of watching it. Just one of the best thrillers of the year. If you ignored this film (and there is a possibility that you have it), then I suggest you check it out.
