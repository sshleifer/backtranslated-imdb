It's sad, this movie is top, it should be, at least in the top 250 movies here. It is still the best fighter ever created. Today's action films are poorly made. Actors and directors do not know how to do this by battling and tricks properly. only a few can’t do it mostly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan. The tricks are so clever and wild, I don’t think we will ever see something like that. The start in which Chan and his team descend the hill car race through the city is simply amazing. The ultimate fighting tricks are for me the best fighting tricks ever filmed in movies. The final trick, sliding along a pole breaking through glass, Jackie was badly hurt.
