This is an amazing horror anthology Amicus, with 3 great stories and fantastic performances! Only the latest story is disappointing. All the characters are awesome, and the movie is pretty scary and tense, plus Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are just awesome at that! She is very underestimated, and my favorite story should be the third “Sweets To The Sweet”, plus all the characters are very cute. Some of this is predictable, and the last story was incredibly disappointing and quite frank! This is an amazing anthology of horrors Amicus, with 3 great stories and fantastic performances, only the last one is disappointing!, I say she must see! <br /> <br /> 1st Story. This is an amazing story, with a lot of suspense, and Dominic the killer is really creepy, and he acted very well! It was an ideal way to start with a story, and for the most part it is unpredictable, plus the end of a double turn is shocking and rather creepy! Grade A <br /> <br /> 2nd story. ("Waxworks"). Everywhere it is a solid story, with wonderful performances, but the final is quite predictable, but still terrible, and quite intense, Peter Cushing did an amazing job, and I could not believe how young Joss Ackland was. I really enjoyed this story! Score B <br /> <br /> 3rd story (“Sweets for sweets”). This is the best story here, as it is very creepy and unpredictable in everything, it also has a good twist! Christopher Lee did an amazing job, and Chloe Franks did an excellent job as a young daughter, plus the final is pretty shocking! I don't want to spoil it for you, but this is one of the best horrors I have seen! Score A + <br /> <br /> 4th story (“Cloak”). This is a terrible story that is really weak and unfunny. John Pertwy annoyed me, but the final surprised me a bit, and Ingrid Pitt was gorgeous, as always, but she was just boring and done many times, plus where was the creativity ??. Score D <br /> <br /> The direction is excellent!. Peter Duffell does an excellent job with this job: amazing camera work, great views, adding an eerie atmosphere and keeping the film at a very fast pace! <br /> <br /> The acting game is awesome! John Bryans is great here as a narrator, he had wonderful lines, I just wanted him to have more screen time. John Bennett is very good, like Det., And was quite intense, he was especially good at the end! I really liked him. Denholm Elliott is superb, since Charles, he was vulnerable, showed fear, was very pleasant, and I liked his facial expressions, he rocked! Joanna Dunham is amazingly gorgeous! She did an excellent job with her wife's work, she also had excellent chemistry with Denholm Elliott! Tom Adams is incredibly creepy, like Dominic, he looked terrible and did a great job! Peter Cushing, as always, is amazing and amazing, he is pleasant, concentrated, charming and, as always, had a lot of activities! (Cushing Rules !!). Joss Ackland, as always, is fantastic, and looked so young here, I barely recognized him, his accent was not so strong, and played a different role, I liked it! (Ackland Rules). Wolfe Morris is creepy here and did what he was supposed to do well. Christopher Lee, as always, is amazing and amazing, he is incredibly tense, very focused, and, as always, with such a magnificent tense expression on his face, he was especially amazing at the end! (Lee rules !!). Chloe Franks is adorable as a daughter, she is somewhat creepy and gave one of the best children's performances I have ever seen! I loved her. Neary Doner Porter is beautiful and superb as a babysitter, I really liked her! John Pertwee annoyed me here, and was rather mild, and quite unfunny, he also had no chemistry with Ingrid Pitt! Ingrid Pitt is beautiful, and she does her usual thing as a vampire and does it well! <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors do well. In general, you must see! **** out of 5
