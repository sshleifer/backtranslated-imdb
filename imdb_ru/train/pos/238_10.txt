You can only imagine a better movie than this <br /> <br /> Hey, before you do me a “Chick Flick”. I am very big, strong and courageous, macho, who thinks that it was one of the best films of the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The game was great, and the story was wonderful. This is an excellent medicine for the heart and soul. The acting could not be better, nor the film the best cast. <br /> <br /> I have known for a long time that Mercedes Ruehl, along with Holly Hunter, Joan Plowight, Dame Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek, Judi Dench is one of the greatest actresses ever to appear in the movie. And, of course, Cloris Lichman (also in this film), in my opinion, can actually surpass them all in a huge amount of her talent and various roles in which she appeared over the years ... Anyway, it was Amazing cast. This film was like a book that you can’t add up, and when you get to the last page, you want more ... more. I can not understand why this film on IMDb is estimated at only 3.9 points. <br /> <br /> This rating is absolutely amazing for me. Or perhaps not. Perhaps, in fact, I understand this very well, and this makes me very sad. I am very sad that such films as “American Beauty”, “Leaving Las Vegas”, “Sexual Beast” and “Fight Club”, the ratings are rapidly growing in popularity when they, at least, according to viewers, should get a "R" rating ... R, which is for "Garbage." Hey, well, I understand that there are many different stories in this world for different audiences, but this is a sad comment when it seems that this is a wonderful, powerful .. extraordinary, directorial, acting and written film seems to have been watched, <br /> <br /> It obviously was on The Oscar awards ceremony ... How sad. And how predictable. I want to say that if you want to see a powerful, happy, sad, beautiful story? look ... it is desirable to have this film ...
