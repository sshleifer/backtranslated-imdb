Arrrrrggghhhhhh, some people take life too seriously! Watch this movie the way it is, sit back, relax and chuckle. The film does not take itself seriously, so we should not. If you like James Belushi, you will love this movie. If he is not your cup of tea - skip it. <br /> <br /> I like James Belushi, so I liked this movie. So simple, isn't it? :-)
