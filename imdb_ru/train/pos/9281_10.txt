I don’t know how and from where Iranian directors get inspiration in creating such a plot. In fact, this is a very simple plot that many directors can come up with - but they may not be able to project it on the film, as Jafar Panahi did. <br /> <br /> The film resembles a rotating 2 of the world at the same time, one connected with another - a football match and the battle of the sexes, taking place outside the walls of the stadium. <br /> <br /> This gives you the feeling that you are in a movie and you’re one of the characters, and while watching a movie, it’s as if you’d also like to watch a football game. You will feel exactly the same excitement and feeling as those female actors in the film. It captures in such a way that you want to see the end, you want to know the verdict, you can not wait to see what will happen to the girls. <br /> <br /> I like intermittent conversations between a smoking girl and one of the servicemen. It's like Venus against Mars, it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and in the struggle of women for equal rights and opportunities, especially in a patriarchal society like Iran. <br /> <br /> This is Jafar Panahi’s second film that I saw (the first one is “Crimson Gold”), and I look forward to seeing a few more. <br /> <br /> I am already fascinated by Iranian films, and this film is a must-see!
