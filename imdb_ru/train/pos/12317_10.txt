A masterpiece of comedy, a masterpiece of horror, a masterpiece of romance, if you can say something negative about the "Ghost Stories from China", special effects may look outdated compared to modern technologies. The film has a simple premise: a poor debt collector must remain in a secluded place trying to collect a debt. Of course, it is also frequently visited. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this film, I did not expect this to be one of the most touching love stories I have ever seen; this is without losing the comedy of the farce that will have you in the seams. Unlike some films about Asian cinema, “The History of Chinese Ghosts” is not so difficult for those who do not understand Chinese culture. In fact, he plays on the eternal, uncultured themes of the paranormal and romantic. <br /> <br /> Think of the Evil Dead 2 if they had thrown a beautiful love story into the mix. This film is in fact, despite the fact that many people overlook it. This is absolutely one of the best I've ever seen. His ability to combine the best aspects of a multitude of genres and cross cultural boundaries in order to reach out to humanity everywhere is nothing short of fiction. Highly recommended, 10/10.
