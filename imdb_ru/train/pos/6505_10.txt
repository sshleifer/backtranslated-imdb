Theo Robertson commented that the WAW inadequately covered the conditions after World War I, which led to the growth of Hitler and World War II. <br /> <br /> Perhaps he missed the first one and a quarter of an HOUR of volume 8? The covers of this period, and together with the earlier volumes in the series, clearly show the existing conditions, I feel. My friend grew up in Germany during this period, even joined Hitler Youth, and his experience was very similar to the one mentioned in WAW. <br /> <br /> This documentary is REAL much higher than the documentaries of the channel “History”. I believe that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> The ONLY error, and it is small, I have with WAW, is this: the numbers are not included, many times. For example, if you are talking about Lend-Lease, how much military material was leased? How many to Russia, how many to Britain? How many merchant ships sank submarines and when? How many ships did the German or Japanese fleet have in all in 1941? What type were they? How many troops? How many troops did the allies have, all over the country? Many rooms could make many viewers fall asleep, but I would prefer MORE! And, of course, I always want to see more military analysis. How, WHY, did Patton and Clark not capture the German army that was in Cassini after they surrounded it, instead of going from Monty to Rome and allowing it to escape? I don’t think you can begin to understand the war until you see some of these “total war” video clips, such as the Dresden bombings. It's like trying to understand Auschwitz, etc., before you see the clips of the death camps: you just can't wrap it around you - it's too unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Unknown at that time and Of course, without films there were the most glaring cruelties and inhumanity of the Japanese, including cannibalism (read “Flyboys”) and some live vivisections of medical prisoners “experiments” without any anesthesia! <br /> <br /> Dave
