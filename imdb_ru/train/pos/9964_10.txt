Just take it. The DVD is cheap and easy to find, its length is now standard, and you have been without it for a long time. (When the home video started, at least there were three versions with missing parts ...) Everything you read is true. There is no protection and no life without it. The color is magnificent, it is pleasant to look at it, and the production indicators are quite good for the children's Saturday epos. But no question .. the whole of Santa against Satan's Angle is so disgusting that it made the film a hit at that time and cult-popular when home video really began. How good / bad / weird is it? I saw TRAILER only in childhood and recalled THIS for almost 30 years ... including Murray because of the high voice ... I told my older sister, and she called me a liar and could not believe that it could be made a film in which Santa vs. Satan ... Add to this things like Santa, asking for the blessings of the Virgin Mary before going on Christmas Eve, children who want to catch him and make him a Slave ... and an international baby sweat shop .. and this is probably , it looks like a lot of nightmares that children had in the 60s. Like the others here, I watch this every festive season. (My version is the “Theater of the Mysteries of Science 3000”). But any old way you choose it, the film is an insane masterpiece, and it is absolutely necessary (by the way, along with Brianiac ...). I will never stop laughing. Better, I think, then Santa Claus conquers the Martians. In part, this can make you cringe or just scare you. (How do you know how many parents go to cocktails on Christmas Eve? "If you are bored, just go down and play the piano." DANGER ...) bored, anxious, funny, childish, weird .. hey, what else do you want?
