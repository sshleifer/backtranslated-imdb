This is a very funny, and sometimes rather creepy, anthology, which, if it is lacking a little in the section of the writers, more than compensates for the shortcomings in acting, location work and general abundance. The best episodes of this are the first with Denholm Elliott playing the horror writer who is haunted by a character from his novel in the works (a perfect example of how the actors pull it out from just a pedestrian); the third is with Christopher Lee, frightened by his own daughter, and the last episode with the late great John Pertwee as a pompous star of a horror film, who gets more than just a new role in his latest project. The dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is sparkling and inspiring, and both are clearly enjoying the opportunity to truly unleash it! Cushing is usually good in the weakest segment, which is certainly not helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman he is obsessed with at the local wax museum is not at all “beautiful,” as we are told that she is sure of it! We needed someone shockingly beautiful, and instead we were given a woman with a snail's jaw. Minor carping in the direction of this film, and this is a wonderful country house setting that you can catch when you can.
