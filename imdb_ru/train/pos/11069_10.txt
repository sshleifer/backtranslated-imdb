“Ah, Richie made another gangster movie with Statham,” thought the average fan, waiting for the next “tug / lock”; expecting perhaps a couple of time shifts, but not too hard for “me and the guys” to swallow after a few beers. <br /> <br /> Oh, pay attention, you really need to watch this movie. No cups of tea, no additional dietary count from the counter, no shouting “keep up the good work” when you look in the fridge - watch a movie! Do not laugh, except for those whom you can force yourself due to significant violence (and if it floats on your boat, so be it), but with a sharp clear direction, excellent dialogue and excellent performances. <br /> <br /> My favorite is Big Pussy from soprano, always a reliable hood.
