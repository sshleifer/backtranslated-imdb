The big problem is where to start, as this film needs your attention in the next two hours, and you better not miss a few minutes to get a coke, because there is a danger that you cannot follow. But well, there is a pause button. Bruce Willis must go to the time machine to find any antivirus for the virus that caused animals to rule the world in 1996. Thanks to some mistakes, he first appeared in 1990, then in World War I and how it all looked like, for example, Terry Gilliam thought up what should be one of the smartest scenarios ever. This ex-man Monty Phyton knows exactly how to tell ingenious SF-stories, and his choice of actors could not be better; some Schwarzenegger wants to be. This is a movie that you can watch again and again, because the script is so strange and complex (and yet you can follow) that each viewing presents you with other surprises. One of my big favorites.
