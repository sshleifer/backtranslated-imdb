This film has it all: action, fights, dances, riding a bull, music, beautiful girls. This film is a genuine look at Central America. Believe me, I was there in 1980. A lot of oil money, a lot of women and a lot of honky. It is a pity that they all left. The film is, in fact, just another boy meets a girl, a boy loses a girl, a boy returns a girl, but he is bought by actors and music. There is absolutely no film with better music than this film, and this includes American Graffiti. This is a film that I watch again and again and do not get tired of it. Every time I watch this, I am young again, and it is time to go out. The only reason I gave him only 9 points is that you cannot rate the film as zero, I do not think you should score one point 10.
