This is about the same league as the Black Cat, although I would give 9, not 9+. This is really praise for a film that is so underestimated that it is awesome! <br /> <br /> “Invisible Ray” is partly horror, partly drama and, of course, partly fantasy. For a film made in 1936, the sci-fi elements were well ahead of their time. A mixture of horror, drama and science fiction is the perfect combination, while the actions of Lugosi and Karloff could not be better. <br /> <br /> Directed by Lambert Heilliere captures the many elements that James Weil did so often. I say this movie is creepy and well filmed. The gargoyle scene outside Lugosi’s room is a perfect example of mood. This is a special moment in the film, which is so sadly lacking in modern films of this genre. <br /> <br /> As in the case of the “Black Cat” and “The Island of Lost Souls”, I cannot understand why this is so. The film has not yet been released on DVD. If we consider that some of the garbage that has already been transferred to DVD, looks much more mysterious. <br /> <br /> In any case, watch this movie if you have the opportunity. When it is released on DVD, quickly capture it and place it in an honorable place in your DVD library.
