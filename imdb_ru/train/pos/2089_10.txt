“Good Earth” is a great movie that you no longer hear about. There are many great disasters and events, but this is also not a passionate love story. All this happens in a little over two hours, which is not enough by today's standards. Special effects and costumes are very good for that period of time. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised Louise Reiner won an Oscar for such a restrictive role. She basically has only three emotions: submissive, hungry and heartbroken. <br /> <br /> The performances of Asian and Asian-American actors are amazing. <br /> <br />
