This film has great stars in their early years: Ingor Stevens never looked more beautiful; Yul Brynner was very convincing Jean LaFitt, in conflict with his piracy and wishing to maintain neutrality with the United States. Charlton Heston did a pretty good job, like Andrew Jackson, but some moments were a bit unnatural. This is a really good click for students to explore this part of our history, and it shows that all happy endings do NOT include lovers meeting each other - sometimes a happier ending is that they leave and find partners of similar origin, understand them better. in the long run. I have seen him every year at least twice in 16 years; and although this is not the best movie I've ever seen, I love it every time!
