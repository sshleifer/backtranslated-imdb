I liked this movie, and I am one of the elderly who should not enjoy it, or it seems so. No, this film is not deep - who cares? Such films never happen. But oddly enough, this is the message. This is what each of us has the potential to be who we want to be. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is great in this movie. I always thought she had some resemblance on her face with Katherine Hepburn. So, it's great to see Hepburn and Posey making films about librarians (“Hepburn” - “Desk set”). All librarians, especially those who have a sense of humor, should see Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I put this movie on eight. This is by no means an excellent film by cinematic standards, although there are good shots in this. But it is incredibly charming and entertaining.
