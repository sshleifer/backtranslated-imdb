I have no doubt that Victor McLaglen won his best actor Oscar for this film thanks to a tripartite split between the Mutiny on the main roles of Clark Gable, Charles Lawton and Franchott Ton, who were all in the same race. But “Informer” is still a good film, because John Ford would not have received his first best director Oscar, if it had not been. There was no split in his award. <br /> <br /> The film and the story of Liam O'Flaherty, on which it is based, tells about the poor simpleton of a man named Hypo Nolan, who was once a member of the Irish Republican Army. , He was kicked out because of some stupid stunt that he pulled out and wants to return. He has reached the last penny and, if he cannot return, he wants enough for passage to America. For information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named Frankie McFillip, played by Wallace Ford, there is a twenty pound reward. At the moment of weakness, he goes to the Black and Tan police and reports on McFillip. <br /> <br /> The IRA is very keen to find out who gave McFillip, and they are sure that it was McLaglen. He has no mind to truly hide his tracks. He makes a lot of effort to attract another man named Peter Mulligan, played by Donald Meek. He also picks up the coat hanger played by JM Kerrigan. <br /> <br /> The whole Informe action takes place in Dublin in 1922 from six in the evening until the early morning hours. If necessary, it is removed in the dark and in the shadows, which makes it possibly the first noir-thriller. If this were done after World War II, the Informer would be classified as a great classic noir, like Odd Man Out or The Third Man, with whom it is very similar. <br /> <br /> John Ford knew this world perfectly. He took some time during the uprising and was in Ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the IRA. Until now, his real name was Sean O'Firnan. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster plays IRA Commandant Dana Gallagher. In the book, Gallagher is a tougher and meaner man than Foster. I guess John Ford wanted him, as a sympathetic character, to give cinema fans an interest. He makes it clear that Foster should eliminate the informant, because Blacks and Tens will grab him, extract a little more from him and put the entire organization at risk. <br /> <br /> The IRA court scene is the highlight of the film. When Foster asks Donald Mick if he recognizes the authority of their court, Mick cannot say no. Justice and the order of the king do not run here. This clearly illustrates that moment, despite the occupation by the army and the police, the British really lose control of the population. <br /> <br /> Of course, Informer has a rather grim story concerning John Ford, but much less than you expect. Even though McLaughlan spends his money on drunken fun, the IRA is constantly in the shadows, watching him and counting every farthing. <br /> <br /> Informer is a story well told about Ireland in a dark and gloomy time.
