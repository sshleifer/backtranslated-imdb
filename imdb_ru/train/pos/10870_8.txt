Personally, I find the movie pretty good. He describes the real situation with the triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer how the triads are organized. <br /> <br /> In addition, he shows viewers how the Hong Kong police are in control of the triad situation and why the police are not just giving their all and destroy the triads. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is quite brutal due to gangster methods of murder and torture. However, the film remains true to the real world, so the violence on the screen is only a reflection of what is really happening. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to any Triad / Mafia movie fan. Another good model is the Dragon Squad. There are more guns in this film than in this one, since there are more knives in this film than guns (in fact, I donâ€™t remember seeing one gun).
