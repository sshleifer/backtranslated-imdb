Many people like this film, and many people like it, but it seems that this is all for the wrong reasons. Scarface should be loved and to love, but not the way it was or is. <br /> <br /> Many people say that acting was excessive, but who better to play an excessive character than Al Pacino. To say that Pacino outplayed here would be an understatement. And yet he does it so well, he just so well takes the inner devil out of you. His character Tony Montana was not such a good guy, but his lust for power simply brought his sickness of greed to a new level; inhuman level. Of course, sometimes Pacino seems a bit caricature and surreal, but this does not seem to me to be mandatory. The cast did an excellent job. Michelle Pfeiffer was not quite at her best, but she definitely matched the role she played. On the other hand, Stephen Bower was at his best, yet he is Steven Bower. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was good and, like Michelle Pfeiffer, very well suited for her role. Robert Loggia. I always liked to watch, just to see him scream. Except Pacino, they were not outstanding or unforgettable performances. It seems that everyone just fits their roles while being there. They did not fit perfectly, but were convincing enough. <br /> <br /> Brian De Palma did an excellent job with the film. Whenever an actor is able to become more than life, thanks to his work, one should pay tribute to the director, and I will certainly give it to De Palme. Brian De Palma, although not respected, is in my opinion a very versatile director. He knows how to direct films according to their genres, but sometimes this did not work out well. Here it is really so, it is a gangster film in all respects, but few are much better than this one, because of De Palma. <br /> <br /> Scripture was great, it was just pure Oliver Stone. When I saw the credits at the end of this film and saw that Oliver Stone wrote this, I was not surprised. This is evidence for him though. I always thought of him as a great writer, and he proves it to me once again from Scarface. No one knows how to write a surrealistic reality for a film other than Oliver Stone. <br /> <br /> The music was good, but not so good. This, of course, is not my favorite from Giorgio Moroder. The music was too 80s for me, but it didn't annoy me. The cinematography was good, not surprising, but really, who cares about a film like this one. <br /> <br /> It may have been one of the most influential films of the last 25 years, but, as mentioned earlier, for the wrong reasons. People should understand that the character Tony Montana is not a hero, he is a monster. He does not inspire in any way. He is greedy, bloodthirsty, uneducated and consuming himself. Nevertheless, he is a role model for many people, because he is to some extent a rebel, but probably most of all because he is a deluded gangster. A vigil would be like Mother Tereasu near Scarface. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this film is that it shows that Tony Montanas is not a real problem. If we or people in power would like to close people like him, we could do it, but we do not. In an oddly perverted way, it is a necessity of our society. He is the one whom you could blame for everything, and were better at how you do it. Tony Montana of this world - scapegoats of our society. This in no way justifies people like him. Instead, it’s rather a reminder that we don’t have to justify or allow ourselves to do bad things just because we approach or think we’re approaching compared to a gangster or drug dealer. I like this film because it’s more than a film about corruption, it’s a film that makes you wonder in a strange way.
