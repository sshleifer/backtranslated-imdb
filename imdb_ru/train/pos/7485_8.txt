I heard some not so good things about this film and probably saw a low mark here on IMDb, and that is why I avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV, and since I didnâ€™t have anything better ... and, as it turned out, it would be hard for me to find anything better. Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and touching film, actually one of the best I've seen lately. I was surprised at how this affected me. It's hard to explain, but during the movie, your feelings about the characters and your perception of what's going on change, and this is quite an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare in movies or in any other media. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie. No matter what you heard about it.
