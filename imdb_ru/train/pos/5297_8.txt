Went to watch this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. The place was quite crowded and we all laughed so hard that it was easy to miss the queues. I knew it looked like it would be nice, but it was much funnier than I thought. I liked Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they seemed really strange, like ordinary people, if that makes sense. I'm sick of movies in which teenagers are like people who love cookies, such as "athlete", "geek" or "fan" ... etc. Both characters were unique, but still very human and quite normal to relate to them. I will recommend this movie to all my friends and look forward to releasing it on DVD. Watch this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life! I plan to see it again in the theater, and I donâ€™t go to watch things more than once.
