This low-budget digital video has strengths in the right places - writing and acting. In addition, digital photography is the best of all. In low light conditions, the characteristic tone of the video prevails, but, surprisingly, it competes with film in brightness, clarity and saturation in brightly lit situations. This is the best film made at the grassroots level, with a quick dialogue about the Midnight Cowboy about how the vagrants do everything they can to survive in San Francisco.
