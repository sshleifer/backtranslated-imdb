Do you like to solve riddles? Do you like complicated narratives? It is for you. A brilliant, smart film by Francis Leclerc (the son of the legendary French Canadian subscriber Felix Leclerc). Bright photo and clever editing is Leclerc's word, which is greatly helped by Roy Dupuis, who plays the role of praise in the main role. <br /> <br /> The story of Alexander Turner, a veterinarian in his 40s who had just woken up from a coma after being cut off by someone unknown. It is difficult for a tour operator to remember who hit him when he was finishing the suffering of a deer on the road. Throughout the struggle, he has strange behavior, and it seems that something has captured him. <br /> <br /> Not a creepy, but very mysterious and well-played film. I have a hypothesis about ending (I think the Indian was the cause of the accident), but this end was open to any explanation. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it 9.5 / 10
