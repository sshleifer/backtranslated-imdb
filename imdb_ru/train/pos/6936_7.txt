Winchester 73 receives credit from many critics for returning western after World War II. Director Anthony Mann should get a big mark for his excellent leadership. Jimmy Stewart does a great job, but I think that Steven McNally and John McIntyre are stealing a movie featuring two bad guys playing high-stakes poker, in which the coveted 73 Winchester goes to the winner. This is a good scenario with several stories happening simultaneously. Look at the first appearance of Rock Hudson in the role of Young Bull. Thank God, in a few years we would start allowing Indians to play themselves in Western films. The film is in black and white and was filmed in Tucson, Arizona. I would not classify Winchester 73 as a stagecoach, noon, or Shane, but he received a recommendation from me above average. <br /> <br />
