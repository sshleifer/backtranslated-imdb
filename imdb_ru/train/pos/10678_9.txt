One of the comedies of the 1970s. Also has the best brand melody of any comedy show. The story of three people living in the same apartment with the owners of George and Mildred. Comedy rests on a mix of people. A man and two women. Richard O'Sullivan is woozy by Paula Wilcox. His game was soft and not mocking, so this show was so successful. <br /> <br /> Scripts and stars always gave the best performances, and Richardâ€™s frustrated love life was demonstrated with casual charm. The final headlines contained visual jokes that went unnoticed in the early 1970s, but concerned the living conditions of flat shareholders.
