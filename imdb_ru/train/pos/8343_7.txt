Australian Fred Shepisi (“Cry in the Dark”) directs this comedy / novel, which is fun, relaxing and unfolds in the spring. You will laugh while watching this movie. Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking) - Auto mechanic, Ed Walters, with a high IQ, who is promoted with the help of Albert Einstein, Walter Mattau (Grumpy Old Men) and his scientific friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell them by their preppie shoes. Meg Ryan ("Insomnia in Seattle, you received a letter") - Catherine Boyd, Einstein's niece, who is a competent, but not very confident mathematician. Perhaps this is because she is surrounded by all this genius. She thinks that if she marries someone with a high I.Q. her children will have a high I.Q. how good, but she doesn't know what she wants. Between the cute smile of Tim Robbins and the wit of Meg is a refreshing movie. I love sweet stories. People of all ages should enjoy this film. Catherine is engaged to a jerk James Moreland, who works with animals, but is very sultry. This is love at first sight, between a mechanic and a mathematician. Witty lines and subliminal lines! Cinematography is good. Princeton, NJ, is beautiful in spring. With the immense help of all these brilliant people, Kathryn falls in love with Ed, not knowing that he is an auto mechanic. <br /> <br /> Favorite scenes: Ed passes a multiple-choice test in front of a crowd with the help of Einstein, Nathan, Kurt and Boris. Ed and Einstein ride a motorcycle. Nathan, Kurt and Boris let all the animals studied free! <br /> <br /> Favorite quotes: Albert Einstein: “Do not let the brain interfere with your heart.” Ed Walters: “When was the last time he said wow?” Catherine Boyd: "Well, I'm sure I don't know." This is a refreshing movie, I recommend it. I have a record, and every time I watch it again.
