Wow. What a wonderful movie. The script is almost perfect, it seems that this is the only film written by Minglun Wei, I hope he has more stories in it. <br /> <br /> The acting is sublime. Zhou’s rejection of Doggie was awesome — a very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a delight — very believable, like a weary old traditionalist. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very effective, directing, but not overwhelming. <br /> <br /> If more such films were made in Hollywood or Hong Kong, it would be a friendly, well-written, well-managed, almost perfect gem.
