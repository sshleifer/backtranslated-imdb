Ang Lee clearly loves to act in films, to catch actions, characters, and hoof conditions as they appear. Embracing the random endgame of the US Civil War through the random actions of a young militia without form or masculinity, this is the ideal approach. The film turns out to be about the formation of personalities, maturity, and relationships. Lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of the Middle South in the form of a silent character, experiencing discord, as a hardy parent. <br /> <br /> The screenplay by James Shamus is probably the standard medium for this film; next to him there are a number of well-arranged performances that carry him superbly. One name Jeffrey Wright can carry this film for me. He is great here, but in a slow role: instead, we are considered very good (if not exposing) performances by a large, often recognizable ensemble. <br /> <br /> Noble, optimistic film. For example, watch if you do not like a tougher, more bitter-sweet Cold Mountain or "Claim". 7/10
