This film has an excellent pace, you never have to wait for a lively laugh, which lasts more than a minute, and much more happens than the original premise of the film. Everywhere in it there is mockery of the traditional genre, which this parodies. Do not let anyone tell you that they are trying to get a cheap laugh, just using obscenity - of course, this is enough, but it’s all contextual, not free. I liked this movie, and it cost me only £ 2.99 on a DVD, so in terms of entertainment value, it was the best movie I’ve seen this year.
