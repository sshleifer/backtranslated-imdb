Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors, and I was worried that he was filming a children's film because I would not want him to leave his films that I loved: “Visitor Q”, “Goza”, “ From "," Ichi-killer "and the Black Society Trilogy. Recently, he seems to be exploring new territory, and I think he is doing well. However, it was his first film in which I saw him go in that direction, so I was nervous. Of course, I bought it without seeing it, and was glad I did. <br /> <br /> Great Yokai War is the perfect kids movie and adults will love it too. The whole film reminded me a lot of the films that I loved as a child: “Endless Story”, “Labyrinth”, “Return to Oz”, etc. I liked these films because they did not treat children as if they were stupid, and this is also not, there is a dark motive of morals, but it is also as stupid as any child’s film. Personally, I did not bother CGI and prosthetics. I feel that they fit well and I don’t think the children will notice. <br /> <br /> If you're a Takashi Miike fan, then you might not like this one. But I suggest giving him a chance. This proves Miike is as diverse and talented as I suspected. In addition, he continues to make his subscription films about Miike outside of these, which is very encouraging. <br /> <br /> For those who are not familiar with Takashi Miike and want something light or dramatic, like this one, I suggest other films of Miike: “Zebraman”, “Happiness of the Katakuri”, “Sabu” and “People of Birds in China. " <br /> <br /> Good work, Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars
