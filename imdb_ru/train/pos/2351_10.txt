First of all, I want to clarify that the inability of the average user to appreciate the imagination is terrible. What makes this show so unique is the hyperreality it creates. You don't need to know why Ned can bring people back from the dead or why it can only be for a minute. Where the miracle of children's whimsical fairy tales has disappeared, much like the “wrinkle in time”. <br /> <br /> I say it is refreshingly original, because it is the polar opposite of the masses of simple television, which leaves no room for fantasy or surprise. <br /> <br /> It's nice to add a bit of screen to the television experience. <br /> <br /> Hyper reality is my favorite aspect of the show. The scene of the 1950s, innocent and rare characters, as well as the scenery and physical environment, which should not be perceived as pure reality. <br /> <br /> This show masks the painful nature of death, while others take it, While other television shows were interesting, they occupied the back of this series. It really restored the sense of curiosity, imagination and surprise to television. <br /> <br /> Pushing Daisies quickly got to the top of my list.
