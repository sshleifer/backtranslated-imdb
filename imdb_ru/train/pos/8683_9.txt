"Death Lends A Hand" is one of the key early episodes of "Columbo", which helped define the show for the next thirty years. This is the first of four performances by Robert Culp (three of which were killers), playing about the same role in each show. <br /> <br /> In this case, Culp plays Brimmer, the head of a large private detective company, who asked to find out if his wife was not started by the rich newspaper magnate Mr. Kennicut. Despite the fact that this is so, Brimmer decides not to tell Kennicutu in the hope that he will be able to blackmail his wife in exchange for pieces of information about her husband's business partners. She reacts poorly to this assumption, and this is followed by a controversy that quickly becomes violent when Brimmer slaps her face. As he wears a big ring, the punch knocks her down and kills her. <br /> <br /> There are some really priceless moments in this episode. One of my favorite scenes is when Colombo pretends to read his palms, although in reality it is a trick to find out the shape and size of Brimmer’s ring, not recognizing that he knows that the killer was wearing the ring. Colombo, being a Colombo, he reveals what he really knows when it is the right moment to turn the screws slightly. Therefore, initially it is stupid to play the role of a rather simple person who is worried about “a life preserver moving over the hillock of the moon” or some equally ridiculous talker reading a palm tree. <br /> <br /> Another great scene is when Brimmer tries to offer Colombo a job for his firm, effectively bribing him so that he no longer pries his nose. Again, Colombo does not disclose that he knows what is happening, he pretends that it is a great honor and inspiration for this job offer. <br /> <br /> And there is another case where Colombo tells Kennicutu in front of Brimmer that he wants the killer to hear their conversation. He wants to hint to Brimmer that he is against him, without direct accusation, so he rather cruelly (but understandably in the circumstances) decides to play Brimmer in mind games to scare him to panic and do something stupid. Which, of course, he does! All this time, the grieving Kennicut does not know the subtext of this conversation. It is only near the end that Colombo explains everything to Kennicutu (not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> I will not disclose how Colombo finally nails the right-handed killer, but let's just say that there is a potato in it. .. <br /> <br /> A really very good episode, perhaps the best of the first episode. If you like it, then you will also like the “Double Exposure”, in which Robert Culp is also involved.
