I did not expect the highest level of filmmaking with director Joel Schumacher, so I was surprised that TIGERLAND was not a waste of time. <br /> <br /> In the technique it is often derived from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN with shaky camera work, grainy frames, the film sometimes works as if it misses an asterisk - all these methods that Spailberg used to make his film seem more realistic but in the end he was more distracting than anything else. <br /> <br /> But unlike SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the emotional component was not so weak, because the characters in this film seemed more like real people, and the story is less contrived, not so wrapped in an American flag (Speilberg gets' F "in subtlety). <br /> <br /> Next to the first section of Kubrick's All-Metal Jacket, this is the most realistic training camp I've ever seen in a film, and I think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> This is not a very good movie, but also not a bad one.
