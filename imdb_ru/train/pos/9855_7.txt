This is my first CG animated movie I've ever seen. Usually watching other animated films made me reluctant to see them. No ice age. I wanted to see him at that moment when I saw a trailer with Scrat, a cheerful saber-toothed squirrel. <br /> <br /> Ice Age was occasionally a fun and generally fun movie to watch. This story is basically an animated version of The Three Men and a Child, which has a story of 20,000 years. The visual effects were great. Just beautiful. It's one thing to create a compelling animation, it's quite another to create visually exciting things, and it's nice to look at the Ice Age with its stylized visual effects. Blue Sky Studios is a company worth paying attention to in the future.
