Tiempo de Valientes fits tightly into the action movie genre, but goes beyond its roots due to the excellent choice of actors, the stunning connection between its leading roles and outstanding photography. Diego Peretti acts in the role of Dr. Silverstein, a psychiatrist assigned to ride a shotgun with Detective Diaz (Luis Luka), charged with investigating the murder of two juvenile hoods who seem to have been involved in the arms smuggling plot. Diaz was suspended from work, but he is the best person for this job and should receive professional mental health care for recovery. Soon, Silverstein and Diaz are drawn into a conspiracy involving the intelligence community of Argentina and some uranium, and the film separates them at a crucial moment, which allows Silvershtein to develop some of his impressive cohesion skills. Peretti and Luka are great together and remind me of the on-screen command Terence Hill and Bad Spencer, although Peretti is not as classically beautiful as Hill. It is noteworthy that even after almost two hours Tiempo de Valientes does not get tired of the greeting, and, indeed, screenwriter-director Damian Sifron sets up a potential sequel in the charming code of the film. In general, a wonderful and very entertaining comedy that does not condone the low common denominator and does not offend your intellect.
