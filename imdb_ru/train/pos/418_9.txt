This is an enthusiastic western rip, and I have watched it many times, and it has fun on every level. However, if you are following truthful facts about legends such as Hiccock, Cody and Calamity Jane, look elsewhere, as John Ford suggested that this is the west when truth becomes a legend, print a legend. The story moves at an incredible speed, and between Gary Cooper and Gene Arthur, two very prominent stars who help to shoot this film, there is an excellent dialogue. Keen eyes among you may just notice Gabby Hayes as an Indian scout, there is also a very young Anthony Quinn, debuting as a Cayenne warrior, he actually married one of Demilleâ€™s daughters in real life. In fact, his character Quinn, who informs Cooper about the Custer massacre, which he immediately recalled, the final was well done, and when credits roll, it connects the American West with American history. So please take the time to view this classic western.
