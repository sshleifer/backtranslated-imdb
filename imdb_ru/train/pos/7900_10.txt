I admit, when I first watched the Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, I did not think it would be very memorable in all respects. But now, after viewing it for the seventh time, I admit that he has grown very much on me. The characters of Sissy, Miss Jelly and the Countess have become very cute. And the romance between sissy and jelly seems very sweet. Although the plot is very weak, I think that satirical humor more than compensates for this. Then there is a terrific soundtrack that features an extremely talented K.D. Lang (who reminds me a little of Patsy Kline) is at his best. I can not remember a single film that “grew on me” after an unfavorable first impression, the same as “The Cowgirl”.
