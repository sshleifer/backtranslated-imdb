The film was not so wonderful. The book is better. But the film wasn't so bad either. It was interesting at least. The plot was tense enough to make me watch, although I would not say that I was actually interested in the film itself. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato, Jr. are both great to keep you on the lookout :) They have some pretty scenes that should be romantic. In general, I would give the film 7 or 8. It was not bad, just a little lacked the plot.
