I really like this movie ... when I started watching it, I thought I would soon get bored, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a great movie, and I saw it several times. The characters are believable, and I must say that I fell in love with Brian Austin Green again (for the first time Beverly Hills 90210). I would recommend this film if you are a fan of it, but I agree with another comment made earlier that the final is disappointing. I would really like it to be a little different! It doesnâ€™t matter a good exciting story.
