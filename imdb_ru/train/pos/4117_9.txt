“Dô desu ka den” is the first color film by Master Akira Kurosawa, and surprisingly this is not about samurai, ronin, warlords or battlefields. He is in a very poor community in slums in Tokyo, where residents are homeless drinkers, beggars, tramps, abused women, losers. I do not know the reason why Kurosawa chose this tragic theme and environment to deliver colors, but in reality these are very sad stories, some of which are heartbreaking. I personally like the touching story of a boy and his father, who dream of building their own home; the story of a backward boy who believes that he is piloting a train; the story of a man who brings up five children, as if they were their sons and daughters; and the story of a young woman humiliated by her stepfather. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Dodessadden ?? About Kaminho da Vida "(" Dodedeskaden ?? The Way of Life ")
