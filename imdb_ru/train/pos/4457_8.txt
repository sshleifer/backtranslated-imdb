Yes, this is one of the great musical films in which I grew up with such great artists as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the petite and glorious voice of Catherine Grayson. Music and dancing are superb. I understand that Frank took lessons from Kelly; and there Kelly is dancing with Jerry Mouse, who is unique to that time. Betty Garrett plays a waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She is one of the most underrated stars in Hollywood. I saw it again on A & E TV, as well as on old VCRs. Never get tired of these old musicals. What happened to Hollywood?
