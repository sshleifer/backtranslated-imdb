At the time of writing the article "Halloween" by John Carpenter is approaching the 30th anniversary. Since then, he has spawned 7 sequels, a remake, a whole bunch of imitations, and every year on Halloween, when they make these lists of the “Top 10 worst films”, he is always there. This is quite surprising for the film, which was filmed with a budget of about 300,000 dollars and which featured an almost unknown cast of young and talented actors. I could go on and on, but the main question here is: how is the film held today? And all I can say is fantastic! <br /> <br /> Pros: a simple but creepy initial sequence of credits that really sets the mood. Unforgettable and goosebumps produced by director / co-author John Carpenter and Alan Hovart. Excellent cinematography. A stellar guide from Carpenter, who maintains a high level of expectation, takes some great shots and tries not to show too much of his villain. Good performances from the then unknown composition. Good sense of humour. Michael Myers is one scary, angry guy. A lot of creepy moments that will remain with you. The pace is slow, but steady and never drags on. Unlike most other fraudulent films, this film is more about tension and horror than blood and a lot of bodies. <br /> <br /> Cons: Perhaps now is not as scary as it was then. Many of the dead ends really stand out. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: I want to start this section by saying that this is not my favorite movie in the series. I know that this is not a popular opinion, but this is really what I feel. Despite this, it is a really important film that continues to cover new generations of movie lovers. And just because it was redone for a new generation does not mean that it will be forgotten. No way, no how. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
