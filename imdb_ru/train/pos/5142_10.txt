It's easy to make really general comments about a movie like this. The fact that this is one of the few remaining Japanese films of this era makes people say that he "started Japanese cinema" and "does not look like everything the West has ever done." The last of these two comments is particularly false, since Kinugasa himself admitted that he had washed Caligari more than once. But the style had to imitate, and this does not detract from the meaning of this film. Here we have experimental themes and compositions built on already created visual styles, opening the doors to truly brilliant layering of narratives and realities. For this purpose, the madhouse is an ideal place, and the authors knew about it. This is a landmark film, and you need to make every effort to track it. <br /> <br /> 5 of 5 - Basic
