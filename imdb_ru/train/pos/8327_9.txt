It was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews, as noted elsewhere in IMDb), but he made a great matchmaker. He gathered two very good people who were played by the two best actors. Auxiliary cast (Lu Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Jean Sachs, Stephen Fry, etc.) Everyone clicked on the screen and made it an excellent viewing experience. The fact that he drove to get around seems to contradict all these images and posters about how he rode a bicycle to get around. And whether he wore socks in the same scene ... reportedly the professor never wore socks! (Two new entries for the IMDB section.) With the exception of historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies, it was a great movie to watch with a great cast. I give him 8!
