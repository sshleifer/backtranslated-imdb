This film is one of the most provocative films I've ever seen about Jesus. He does not seek to tell the whole story, but only to portray the interpretive expression of the last day of Jesus Christ. It is very witty, playful and seriously devoted to the elements of the Jewish tradition and the modern interpretation of Scripture. Judas is much more common than other images, not the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine, but a grossly erroneous person, Jesus Chris Sara Saradenaâ€™s terribly deluded in his zeal, playful and serious, faithful and faithful - very human, although divine. The final dialogue has been thought out to the smallest detail and serves as a kind of conversation that two powerful people can have when they have just committed a crime. I would watch this movie again and recommend it to others.
