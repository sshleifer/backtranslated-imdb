This is a terrible mess and quite convincing. Corbin Bernson very well manages this film with its elegant image of psychos-obsessed, eponymous practitioner. Linda Hoffman plays her cheating wife, and she is very easy on the eyes - unfortunately for her, a little “date” with a guy from the pool brings severe punishment as a good doctor knows best - a shame for that beautiful smile! The last half hour of the film focuses on how the character of Bernson lost it completely, and the center of attention was a young actress named Virginia Keane. An exceptionally talented performer, she has attracted widespread attention since the removal of braces. Good legs too!
