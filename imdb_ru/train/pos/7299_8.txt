A bad cast, a horrible script full of holes, a hot blonde is eaten alive, An evil scientist has a terrible mustache, one person takes a platoon of a trained shooter and comes out victorious, terrible special effects, they solve the problem by hitting the monster with their head ... Terrific. The only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the murders. Haha Good frozen fun filled with predictable turns and ludicrous lining. I really liked this movie, but before you watch it, make sure you laugh. I recommend this movie to people who can watch the movie and not take it so seriously. I cannot, in my right mind, think that this film was made for people to take it seriously. However, if you can watch it, sit back and just enjoy it, I really think you can enjoy this movie the way it was supposed to be. Very simple. So take popcorn and a couple of beers and have fun with friends and this movie. It brought joy to my life.
