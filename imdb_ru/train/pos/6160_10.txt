SPOILER WARNING !!!! <br /> <br /> I just looked at the expanded version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Even though I liked the extended version, I would like them to leave the original version on DVD. <br /> <br /> Portabello road could be shortened to its original length. It was too long and took the movie along. Although the dance is great, itâ€™s better to leave it on a DVD as a remote scene. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great movie. My 5 year old liked it. And it is wonderful that the films that I enjoyed as a child are being passed on to a new generation. This and Mary Poppins are added to my collection. <br /> <br /> As I remembered! <br /> <br /> *** of **** <br /> <br />
