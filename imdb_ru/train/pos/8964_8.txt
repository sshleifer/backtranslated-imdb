By a happy coincidence, in the same year when Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made Alfred Hitchcock's dizziness masterpiece, they also made this light comedy. Perhaps the two actors needed to do this after experiencing the brunt of the Hitchcock movie. In any case, this is an excellent companion for "Vertigo", as he again explores a very unlikely, but powerful novel. In fact, the film can be viewed as the other side of Vertigo with a happy ending. Here again Novak undergoes transformation, in Vertigo she, in fact, plays two women, and here she is “transformed” from a witch into a mortal. Stewart again bewitched and tormented for a while by his love for her. Unlike Vertigo, they come together in the Book of the Bell and the Candle, the perfect antidote to the hitcock movie. Again, the dynamic of love and attraction is viewed, but in a completely different way. The cast is awesome. Lemmon is merry as Novak and Elsa Lancaster's warlock, playing the classic role of aunt. Ernie Kovacs, a cult alcoholic writer, and, of course, Ermuna Gingold, who plays Novak's opponent, are all great. The scene with Stuart drinking potion is the best comedy. Anyone who has seen Dizziness or even if you have not seen should see this unforgettable light comedy.
