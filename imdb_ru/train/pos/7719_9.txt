If you like Star Wars / Trek, see where all their ideas and cinematic devices come from. These are my best 2 favorite films of all time: the otherworldly futuristic and psycho-thriller. The intensity of the root material (Shakespeare's “Storm”) is not overshadowed by a flick with a stroke (a la, later, Lucas). And just because it was made in 1956, do not think that you can "see the strings" holding the flying saucer. This was the first film where you could not. The miracle that was made on an A-Cinema scale, the economics and tastes of the time were largely opposed to this. Wilcox’s previous “hit” was “Lassie Come Home”. Until I looked at him, I assumed that “Fred Wilcox” was the pseudonym of a director who already or later became famous, but at that time did not want to be associated with science fiction, which was strictly the “B” genre. then it was either a VERY far-sighted production, or a very random "mistake" on the part of those who finance Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There are large-scale matte with live action, almost microscopically inserted, which Lucas used extensively. There are intelligent machines that go beyond the stereotypical "user interface"; “Computers” as they began to be portrayed much less futuristic in later works. Star Trek's Transporter has hardly changed visually due to Roddenberry 10 years later. And if Trek / Wars Technoabble turns you off, scientific FP links are not exaggerated and accurate even today. “Ship” set is comprehensive, brilliantly realistic, as good as everything you have seen since then, and more convincing than everything that “Track” has done for a television or film. We did not spend there as much time as I would like. <br /> <br /> If you ever wondered how movies get into space so wisely, watching FP will explain all this. This is definitely not “Wagontrain to the Stars”.
