This film probably had a budget of $ 750, and yet managed to beat Titanic. I rented it that day when my mom crashed, and that was the only thing that cheered me to the limit! this should be related to the “Assult of the Killer Bimbos”. Things worth paying attention to: 1. The situation with the Chinese woman leading to the blowjob is killed (do not worry, I do not spoil any surprises because it is so predictable) 5. The guy who considers it necessary to howl. 6. A mentally ill person who plays the convincing work of a madman with his eyes out of manner. 7. The hour chase at the end with the participation of a teacher and a priest. 8. A woman writes graffiti on the bathroom wall. 9. Finally, last but not least, wonderful special effects - especially the blow on the tit that made ... heaven help me ... crack. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> <br />
