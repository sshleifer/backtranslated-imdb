About thirty years ago, the author Numa Sadoul published an interview for the entire length of the book with the Belgian comic artist Georges Remy (better known as Herge, the creator of Tintin). This film is catching up with Sadul today, when he recalls an interview, and we listen to tapes (Gerge died in 1983) and see old photos and footage of the person himself. Some parts of the interview were not published in the book at the request of Gerge, and now we know that they related to his separation from his wife after he had an affair with one of his employees (who will become his second wife after years). It is interesting that the film does not solve the problem very well - the transition of Tintin books from early right-wing and imperialist books (Tintin in the Congo, Tintin in the lands of the Soviets) to rather anti-imperialist books only a few years later Blue Lotus. In general, I came out of this film, learning a little more about Herge and seeing him a little more unsightly than when I go to the theater.
