I like this movie. When a guy who plundered gold worth $ 40 million dies, his cellmate is used as a "bait" to bring them to the high-tech partner of a crazy killer (using a control device implanted in the jaw without his knowledge). This is an action spy movie with enough comic scenes to keep it light. It reminded me of the enemy of the state. Well acted and quite a good plot.
