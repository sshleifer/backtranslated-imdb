Summary: This is a common affair at Loach Casino in Tangier. The casino closes and prepares for a big deal the next day. The host Lush and some of the staff leave for the night, leaving behind modesty. Suddenly, a squad of armed gangsters storming the casino, shooting wildly. Unknown Modesty, they have already killed Loach and are now looking for money hidden in the vault. But none of those present and still alive at the casino knows the code for opening the vault. The vault itself is heavily mined with explosives, so the attackers cannot blow up the door as planned. Suddenly, Modesty is face to face with the leader of the gangsters Miklos in the game of roulette with the danger of life. <br /> <br /> Comments: This review was written without any connection to other published media about Modesty Blaise, as I did not see or read any of this. The first thing I would like to do is that it is a bit misclassified. First of all, I thought it was a thriller with a battle of minds between Modesty and Miklos as the main plot. Of course, there are some bursts of action, but they are not really an integral or important part of the story. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, the main plot and the main stage, filled with tension, is a game between Modesty and Miklos. This is an innovative and intriguing way to uncover a character’s background, and much of the story takes place outside the casino much earlier. Someone said that it was almost like a pilot for a series, and it feels like you can use it as such. But I felt that it was a better way to introduce a character than many others. I didn’t give up on inaction, instead I liked this game, the story is much more than a simple action movie. <br /> <br /> I think that the two main stars, Alexander Staden and Nikolai Coaster-Waldau, did very well. The stud portrays Modesty especially well and truly carries this confident and talented character. <br /> <br /> 7/10
