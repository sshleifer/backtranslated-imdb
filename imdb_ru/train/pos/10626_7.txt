This is a decent little click made in Michigan about a guy who is haunted by his past, with his stepfather (Gunnar Hansen), and who grew up not so well adapted. In fact, he is absolutely crazy, but tries not to be too obvious. He also has a retinue, his own little demon and an angel who accompanies him. The demon never says a word, but in fact, should not, and he is Max Shrek — creepy. Let's just say that the angel is spinning its wheels, because Eric is busy making him feel better, for example, “freeing” people who, in his opinion, need it, mostly beautiful young women. This is a decent image of insanity, and at some point you can sort out what is happening, but overall, I watched it from beginning to end, focusing very much on the film, because it definitely interested me, It is a bit lacking in some areas, but nothing on which I could really put my hand. Worthy effort and worth seeing if you love serial killers.
