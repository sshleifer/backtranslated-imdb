This show was fabulous. It was confusing and well written, and all the characters there were pleasant, but they were terribly cute. Even Jonathan Cake was a friendly guy. Since our radio waves are filled with crap such as American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it was nice to see a drama that didn't look like a TV show. It was always interesting to see how each character will be associated with the following circumstance. It's really annoying that we finally get a show that makes you think a bit and throw it away because of some mysterious number that most of us donâ€™t even pay attention to. Some of us are not sheep. This show will be missed, perhaps not by many people, but by some rather loyal fans.
