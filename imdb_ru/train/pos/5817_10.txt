If you want to remember MJ, this is a good place to start. This film features sweet melodies, MJ like a robot, and a crazy, tangled plot. I remember a lot of evenings when I distributed this wonderful film in college and thought about the amazing impressions of those who decided to cover this ridiculous piece. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of singing. A lot of dancing. During the dance a lot of singing. MJ kills, as you would expect when it comes to that. But that's not all in this film. There is clay. There are fat children (clay). There is an anthropomorphic rabbit, with which Michael Jackson must fight dances (obviously, clay too). There is also Joe Sands (not clay). <br /> <br /> RIP - we love you, Michael! This is a sad day for all of us.
