Writer / director Henry Brommel has done a wonderful job with his Panic film since 2000, which includes his choice of actors: William H. Macy, Tracy Ullman, John Ritter, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland, Barbara Bain David Dorfman. Brommel played Ullman and Ritter in completely ridiculous roles, and non-standard cast - a welcome change compared to what we usually see. <br /> <br /> “Panic” is the story of hired killer Alex (Macy) who actually works for his father (Sutherland). He covers his real profession by doing work by mail; Apparently, he and his wife (Ulman) and their son Sammy (Dorfman) are a typical suburban family. Dissatisfied with his life, Alex turns for help to a psychiatrist (Ritter), telling about this only to his mother (Bane). In the waiting room, he meets a young woman (Campbell), to which he is immediately attracted, which further complicates his situation. His mother breaks his promise and tells his father about a psychiatrist. When Alex receives his next assignment, he discovers that he must kill his psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> This is a deep story about a gentle, kind man turned into a killer by a monster of a father and mother. knowledge that kills to please his father, but also cannot withstand him and leave. His rage is so deep that he lost his emotional attachment to almost everything and everyone except his son - and finally, his son woke him after almost life-long repression. When it comes time for the Panic to move, it happens quickly. <br /> <br /> “Panic” does not look like panic at all. In fact, it moves very slowly. But he is moving slowly not because he is poorly made - deliberate sluggishness, reflecting Alex’s own psyche, slowly emerging from the fog. Deciding on Sarah, Campbell's character, and seeing his trail, his psychiatrist as a living, breathing person, Alex begins to make a connection between what he does and what he is, and how they do not. jive. And the difference between the two can lead to the loss of another psyche, Sammy. <br /> <br /> William Macy gives another brilliant idea, like a loving father, a distant husband and a cold killer, a child of two years old monsters who never cared about their feelings or desires, a man who finally realizes what he needs go to the plate or repeat the cycle. <br /> <br /> This is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater. He is too mature, too small, too thin, too motivated and too good.
