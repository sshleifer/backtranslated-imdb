In Iran, women are not allowed to football games. Officially, this is because they must be spared the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. But, of course, we are talking about sexism. Women are lower human beings. <br /> <br /> Some brave girls oppose this and try to get to the stadium using various tricks. The soldiers will catch them and keep them in a certain cage until the police come and take them away. <br /> <br /> Despite the insane situation, this is a film with great humor. It is also nice to see how people always find different ways to fight oppression. You will be touched at the same time with lots of laughter. Good job director Jafar Panahi. This is largely a heroic comedy.
