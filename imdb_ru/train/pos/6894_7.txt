Men can enslave on Lollo if they want (or her lollo - she gave her name in French jargon), but the ladies have an even more delicious piece in the divine Gerard Philippe, who is not only beautiful, but can act. Do not hold back if there are no subtitles in your version, because in this simple, exciting story of love and war, in which everything is fair, they are not needed. All you need to know is that at the beginning of the film Lollobrigida reads Philip's palm and tells him that he will marry the daughter of the king. After this, the story becomes completely clear from the Gallic gestures, running, jumping and playing with swords. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, the evidence of history and the crude jocularity of the tone become somewhat tedious, and it annoys that the French seem to consider themselves too superior to Hollywood to even worry about trying to believ his exciting tricks. And, of course, not speaking French, misses episodic tricks, such as: Virtuous girl: I have to tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Seducer: Dear, where did you get that I was interested in this thing?
