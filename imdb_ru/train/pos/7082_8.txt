First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take most of his films, you will see that the characters have such moments when they are the same. His character in this film is far beyond everyone until now ... and is considered. The story begins in the (not so) future, when a person is sent back in time to find the source of the virus that destroyed most of humanity from the face of the earth. The story seems to go towards SF, but I think it is closer to the drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. About it. Films tend to be faster and slower in some moments and evolve closer to the end than to the beginning, but when you see this film, you will understand that this constant rhythm of history and facts that are not accelerated or slowed down. This is the same speed that flows smoothly and fairly well. But this does not mean that the ending will not pull the nerves, because it is pretty good. As for the direction, it is prefect. Movies as such are easily destroyed in a bad direction, but this one has become much better. So if you are preparing to watch a science fiction film or some action, you will miss it. There should be more such films.
