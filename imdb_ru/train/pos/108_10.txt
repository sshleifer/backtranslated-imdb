“Europe” (or, as is well known, “Centropa”) is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen. The combination of shades of gray and color photography is almost perfect ... a real feast for the eyes. The painting was a contender for the 1991 Golden Palm in Cannes. The award went to Burton Finck (Coen brothers); The film is stylistically very similar to Zentropa. Here is an exercise in class: rent both films and become a judge for yourself.
