“The Infamous Betty Page” talks about a woman who always wanted to become an actress, but instead became one of the most famous girls in American history. Betty Page performed by Gretchen Mol was one of the first sex icons in America. The type in which Betty Page participated involved nudity and slavery, which led to an investigation in the US Senate in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> After leaving the film, I could only think about how far we had come. pornography terms since 1950. Now you can surf the Internet and find the most disturbing and shocking pictures that have ever been taken, and that the footage surveyed on the “Betty's famous page” seems almost childish and innocent. When Betty Page was in the film, in most videos, including chains, there were no naked people, but today we have sick pictures in which we see women having sex with animals. I believe that the envelope may have been pressed too far since 1950, because looking at this film from the point of view of modern pornography, it was very tasteful. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I was very impressed with the “The Infamous Betty Page”, I discovered that the film is very well made and interesting. The trailer makes you believe that this is a film, and represents a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in America. Gretchen Mole looks just like Betty Page, and plays very well. I also thought that since the film was shot in black and white, the film seemed realistic because viewers believed they were watching a film created in the late 1950s. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the film was the running time, it seemed there were several scenes that were cut out and seemed a bit shorter than they should be. I looked at this, and it seems that since it was shown at the Toronto Film Festival, it was 10 minutes. In addition, the final was rather boring, and I expected some more to appear on the screen, or maybe some paragraphs would appear to tell viewers more about Betty Page's life, which ended the film. These are only two of my complaints about the film, except that the direction was solid, the acting was great, especially Gretchen, and the script was good. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron, director of American Psycho, one of my favorite films, director and screenwriter of The Infamous Betty Page. I feel that Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create an environment and create great movies based on characters, because, like Psycho, Betty Page is a study of characters, and it is beautiful. Harron easily captures the 40s and 50s, as well as all the characters. She is a very talented director, and I hope that she will be here for many years. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: “The infamous Betty Page” definitely deserves attention. This is a very interesting story that shows how America, as well as the world, came from the point of view of pornography. The film also provides the great game Gretchen Maul, which literally nails the role of Betty Page on the head. And complete this with a talented director who was able to capture the look of a previous era, and you have a good movie in your hand. Unfortunately, this film is likely to fail, as not many, except people who grew up in this era, will show interest in the film, but I think it is worth checking out. <br /> <br /> The final MovieManMenzel rating for "The Notorious Bettie" Page "is 8/10. This is an interesting character study about one of the most famous girls and sex icons in American history.
