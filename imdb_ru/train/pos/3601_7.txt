Michelle Rodriguez is a defining actress who can be a charge for other actresses. She has the courage to put herself on the role of a rarely encountered tough girl at the very beginning of her career (and carry it out), which is a feat that must be recognized. Although her later films put her in the same role, this film was created for her strength. <br /> <br /> Her hero is a romantic student / fighter / lover trying to overcome his frustrated existence in projects, overdid it a bit in the film ... but not a girlfriend. This aspect of this film is not very original, but the story deepens when the hot relationship that this girl has to deal with begins to boil, and her primal anger takes over. <br /> <br /> I don’t know I didn’t see the actress taking such an aggressive stance in making films, and I’m glad she gets this original Hollywood twist. This film got 7 from me because of the average story of ghetto youth, but there is such a wonderful actress in it who plays a rare role in the film with a minimum budget. Great job.
