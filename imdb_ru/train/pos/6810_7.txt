After reading the book, I stumbled upon this DVD at Wal-Mart for $ 3 and thought, of course, what the hell ... I took the DVD and watched it last night. When I started watching this, I checked the lead time, and it was about 90 minutes. I thought: well, cool ... It seemed that he ran quite slowly, knowing the story and how much it was. By the time I got to the actual killings, I thought, “How much time is left?” Checked. "One minute ?! What the hell ?! I felt incredibly deceived, thinking that the film had progressed only through a third of the story. <br /> <br /> But then I happily noticed that the scene selection menu on the DVD included part 1 and part 2. I still have an hour and a half left! Then I sat very happily and enjoyed the second half of the film, even more than the first. <br /> <br /> I admit that I did not see the original 1967 film (despite my sincere desire), I have however read the novel and felt that it was a rather downward film for a two-part miniseries, i.e. I think that Perry's role was completely wrong, and a few minor inconsistencies jumped out at me, but still very well done. The first half dragged on a bit, and the second half is much more exciting. I think they should have proportioned the film more, as Capote did in his book: 1/3 before the murder, 1/3 after and 1/3 after the arrest of the murderers. Instead, the film makes it more than 1/2 before the murder, 1/4 after and 1/4 after the arrest of the killers. Again, this makes the second half more exciting, but at the same time less attractive, while the first half is delayed ... <br /> <br /> Now I look back and realize that I just did the same the mistake is to make things slow down, so I shut up. Go watch the movie and decide yourself! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
