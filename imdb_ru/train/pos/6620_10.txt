If the answer to this question is yes, then you should like this great movie. I just saw it a couple of hours ago here in Paris (where the film takes place), and I still feel a huge injury that I received in my eyes ... What a visual shock! I have never seen such a beautiful black and white photo and such a dramatic change in the way animated films are made. I firmly believe that before and after Renaissance there will be the same thing that we saw in Pixar films or in Akira and GhostInTheShell games. This is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated films, and I hope that this French initiative (a small unknown French studio with a few young people who had a dream called Renaissance ...) will receive the success and recognition it deserves. Vive la France!
