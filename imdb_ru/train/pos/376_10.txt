Spielberg's first dramatic film won't let you down. This is a beautifully made film with no flaws about the life of an African American woman. It also proves that not all films in which African-American ethnicity is the center of history should be led by African-American directors. <br /> <br /> What I like about this film is Spielberg’s ability to film this very realistically, even though it’s based on the book. In addition, Danny Glover was great in the role of Mr.. And usually he is just himself in most of his films. But in this he completely forks, and this time becomes someone else. But resistance to the whole film comes from Whoopi Goldberg. She's great, how they sat down. You will never forget these characters when you see this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I heard that his musical version will also be a film, and all I can say is: I hope it is as good as this one, because this film cannot be missed.
