Whether this film is propaganda or not (I firmly believe that it is not), it really shows the power of the media. The importance of this documentary is not to show how good Chavez is. This is truly a demonstration of how the Bolivarians saw how this happened, Chavez, how it happened. Although the support of the film may seem wrong and biased, I think that the point of view shown in the film is completely legitimate. The people of Venezuela, through the Venezuelan private media corporation, saw only one side of the coup, the neoliberal side. This film shows us how the Bolivarians saw it. Call it propaganda, I say it is a call for condemnation on your part.
