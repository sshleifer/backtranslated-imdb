Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE paints a picture that is hard to forget. Al Pacino plays a terrific role in the role of Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee who becomes an influential player in the world of drugs, as he ruthlessly controls his own kingdom of crimes in Florida. This gangster click is rude, brutal, loud, rude, unpleasant and should hold the record, saying the word "f - k" more often. Almost three hours, and yes, it can become repulsive. Solid hearty constitution keeps you in its place, delighting for the demise of the ruthless criminal lord. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar play among the interesting characters. Pacino is one of the greatest in its generation. He manages to translate into reality his character, which leaves a strong impression. It will not be a film for everyone, because you will not think that you have gone from a catastrophe. Is it powerful enough for you? Crime does not pay long!
