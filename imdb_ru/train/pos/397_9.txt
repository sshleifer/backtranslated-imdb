I have to admit that Cui Hark is one of a kind, you cannot beat a person with a strong cinema presence. The Chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to the audience, the director tried to bring back the classic fantasy stories about Mount Tsu, and this is what he demonstrated. <br /> <br /> The new Legend of Tsu really improved from this in 1983. From this new millennium update, we could see the vision of Tsui Hark Zu Mountains. Spectacular visual design, stunning action-fantasy epic performed perfectly. Kept me glued the whole picture. A great cast with a great cast. It's a really fun movie to watch, but isn't it too weird? <br /> <br /> Now the disadvantage is that people will probably get confused in his broad storyline, shortened to a 95-minute film. The plot may not have a great relationship between the characters, but by watching the movie, you will better understand the characters themselves. Some may complain that there is not too much physical combat, except that characters with a supernatural ability to defeat enemies, spirits fighting from hand to hand will not make sense at all. <br /> <br /> I appreciated this beautiful stylish picture. He may have a fine story, but, hey, look at Tsui Hark's Time & Tide, we also got entangled in the story, but it was really something stylish and amazing. Cui Hark always attracts something else in the HK Movie. The American audience may encounter some difficulties while watching this film, because it is not the Crouching Tiger, “The Hidden Dragon”, it is a completely new genre. Although it may not be a masterpiece, its special effects are indeed better than the Storm Riders. It's really worth checking out.
