A fake documentary about a couple of Canadian producers Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek) trying to make their first film in the late 1970s. “Hollywood North” is a comic story about their struggle to put everything together, despite a number of controversial topics. <br /> <br /> “Hollywood North” is a film very similar to the film “This Is Spinal Tap” (1984). so good. Namely, although it is exaggerated in a certain sense, it is very close to the truth, and the truth consists of “backstage” facts that are very different from the public face of the industry. Making a film is not easy, and it must be especially difficult in Canada in the late 1970s. In the films involved dozens, if not hundreds of people. Many have incompatible desires, motives and personalities. Particularly important are the financiers and talent on the screen, as if he either falls out or becomes unreliable at any stage while the film is in production, this can jeopardize the whole process, either require large-scale shooting, or abandon the film as a whole. <Br /> <br /> It is therefore not surprising that Hollywood North focuses on such a relationship. The result is a great movie that is both cheerful and tragic. The script is flawless while the performances are top notch. This is a must see for any beginning director and anyone who is seriously interested in the craft of filmmaking. It should also be something more than just entertainment for any viewer with a little intelligence and a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 from me.
