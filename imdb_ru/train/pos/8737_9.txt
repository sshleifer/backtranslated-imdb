Critically, people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good movie, but I liked Bug's Life more. I can't remember the Pixar animation, except for two Toy Story films that I laughed so hard about. The animation is clean, the story is original and does not preach. Voice acting is what makes this film. Dave Fowley is a serious ant who often gets in trouble. Hopper is an excellent feature of Kevin Spaceyâ€™s always wonderful, as is Haydn Panettiere as Dot. Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn also support me, and I can go on and on. The script is fantastic, so funny, and sometimes even touching. It lacks Antz's social posts, but what we have is impeccable fun. 9/10. Bethany Cox
