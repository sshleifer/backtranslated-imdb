I would like to comment on the series as a great effort. The storyline, although it required a few improvements, was pretty good, especially in season 1. However, season 2 became a stranger show and lost the original charm of DA. In the first season, the storyline was more interesting: the light side of life in Jam Pony, while the serious plot with the manticore pursued series X. I was looking forward to the new seasons, in fact, I was still. I hope that the guys from FOX and the film crew of DA understand that many people are still waiting for the return of the DA. Even after 2 years of canceling it, DA can succeed if it works properly, and I think a name like James Cameron should accept this challenge.
