I have always been keen on watching Hong Kong movies, but they all fell short of my expectations ... so far! BURNING PARADISE does not contain the flat humor that most HK films have, nor the background storyline that was dragged into the film. The story is not complicated, but there are never scenes that simply fill up some kind of “intellectual” space (the only truly intelligent martial arts film I've seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but since Hollywood is involved in the film, it’s not real film for HK for me). There are some incredible battle scenes in this film, from the first one (which is one of the coolest ones I've ever seen, but so short) to the latest main scenes! But note that a lot of blood also flows (people are cut in half, beheaded, etc.). The production is pretty good, and the special effects show that the writer's imagination can be realized even if some shots have to be quite technical (note: a piece of paper that he throws and sticks into the wall!). Yes, this is not Tsui Hark or John Woo, who made my favorite Hong Kong film, this is Ringo Lam! And I’m sure what the hell I'm going to check out more from this director! Ace.
