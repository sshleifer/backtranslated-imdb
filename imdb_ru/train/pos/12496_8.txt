For years, we watched all the horror films that go, from boring Hollywood rehearsals like Saw 2 to horrible indie releases that are totally unmatched ... we suffer from all the bad movies hoping to find small jewels, such as "Dark Remains". <br /> <br /> We managed to watch this film at Shriekfest 2005. The audience liked it, and I believe that in the end it received an award for the best film. <br /> <br /> Although he may not have the budget or the star power of studio films, he deals a serious blow in the eerie atmosphere and horror category. Acting and cinema at the highest level, but this is the direction that makes this film worthy of attention. The plot and characters develop at the right pace to create a fantastic panic. <br /> <br /> Editing and visual effects are also top notch. And although many horror films do not manage to use music to their advantage, the rating of “Dark remains” only enhances their eeriness. <br /> <br /> I know that the film was shown at several festivals, but no one was next to me, so I can't wait to hear when it finally comes out on DVD. Believe me, even if you are tired of the current state of horror films, try this one ... you will not regret it!
