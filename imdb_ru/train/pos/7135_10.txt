It should be one of the most beautiful, touching, thought-provoking films. This is a good family entertainment, and at the same time makes you think about the related problems. Every time I see "the ghost of Zack riding a bike through a puddle at the end, I can't help it from tears." John Tay's play is so touching, and it's a shame that he is no longer with us. forgot. Outstanding movie. Full ratings.
