IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexander Borges) are partners in the company along with ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but they are the first to sign a contract with the professional killer ANISIO to kill ESTEVÃO (the plot, at least in the beginning, does not) explain very well why ). The guy does it, and after receiving the money, he begins to blackmail two partners, appearing in their company and saying that he wants to work there (as a manager or something like that?). At the same time, he meets MARINA (Mariana Simenes), the daughter of ESTEVÃO, and begins dating her! <br /> <br /> In such a story, where crime, corruption, betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand, no one is innocent and cannot be a victim, an exception is MARINA, who is the only person who does not know this, what is happening and not betrayed anyone ?? <br /> <br /> This film sarcastically depicts the sad and cruel reality that exists in a large metropolis such as São Paulo, where crime is present every day. We can feel the irony, but also the veracity in such characters as ANISIO (brilliantly played by Paulo Miklos), who blackmails the guys who paid him without a doubt, and even flirts with the daughter of the guy he killed! Does he really have to be a monster to do something like that, but, of course, I know there are people like him in Brazil or anywhere else ?? <br /> <br /> This is a very good film, cruel, but truthful, about a sad reality ?? The acting is great and the soundtrack too.
