Robert Wolle teaches a film lesson at New York University in Manhattan, New York. <br /> <br /> He talks about the mistakes of history and truths that are no longer known. I would like to see a lot more of this show. It is very interesting. Mr. Wool uses examples and “show and tell” to convey his thoughts. He explained that the person who actually traveled on Paul Revere's Midnight trip was not Paul Revere! Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used the name Revere because it sounded better. <br /> <br /> I have watched Robert Vulem for many years, starting from the moment when he was acting in a comedy version, and all the way through Arly $$ on HBO. He is a good actor and a good comedian, but he is a great teacher! I highly recommend you watch the episode of this show. It is worth your time.
