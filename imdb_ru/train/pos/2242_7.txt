It is felt that partly because of the conscious need to include in the plot the usual love story to make the film more attractive to the public of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the funny, funny characteristics of top-class bureaucrats who manage the foreign affairs ministry â€” the British are anchored as soon as the British can disgrace themselves. But after that, the film loses its usual farcical plot. Terry-Thomas is watchable as always, but great talent in the cast (Peter Sellers and others) is largely wasted. <br /> <br /> An exciting but not great movie.
