I instantly fell in love with "Pushing Daisies." This show manages to bring a smile on my face thanks to the great story-telling, witty dialogue and great game. But this is not all: it also keeps you to the end. The main idea of ​​the show - the return of people to life with one touch, the termination of the status of the undead second - is interesting and still may appear in later seasons. But occasional killings, a unique kind of show and a very experienced storyteller complement this experience. But “Pushing Daisies” is more than parts of it. He has a certain charm that I really enjoy, and I look forward to entering the world of Ned and Chuck in the second season.
