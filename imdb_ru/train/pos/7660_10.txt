This film is nothing more than a dark, sandy masterpiece. I can be biased, since the era of apartheid is an area I have always strived for. But I would say that he is on a par with “Cry for Freedom” and “Cry for Your Beloved Country”. Unfortunately, a few days ago I did not even hear about this film. Inside is one of the most underrated films of all time, probably because it was a small film company that I had never heard of before. Eric Stolz, one of my favorite actors anyway, is believable and dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays his vile role well. Do not look for humor in this film, it is not. It is real, wild and sandy to the last, and for sensitive ones, I would say, bring a box with tissues. But such great films make you wonder: why are you often not heard of the greatest films?
