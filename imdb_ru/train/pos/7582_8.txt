Shintarô Katsu, best known for Zatôichi films, is again filmed in this third and final film in Kenji Misumi (mostly known as The Lone Wolf and Cub), directed by the Ganzo Razor saga of The Great, the battle of the ninja, the rape of "ghosts" and the disclosure of shadow events in the treasure trove of the shogun. The “plot” of Hanzo was kinda outdated and repetitive. What was once new in the first film was no longer there. Fortunately, this film was better than the second due to a lot of humor. I'm just glad that they decided to stop on one trilogy (I look at YOU, Lucas) <br /> <br /> My rating: B <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: just trailers for all 3 films of Hanzo the Razor <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aoi Nakajima releases both boobs, Mako Midori just left one
