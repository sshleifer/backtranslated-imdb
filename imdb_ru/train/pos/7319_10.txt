Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood in childhood. He removes his problems with his older sister, whom he kills at the beginning of the film. This is just the beginning of things from Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasant plays a doctor who has studied Myers for years. He knows that there is something else in him, something mysterious evil. This evil will not be contained and cannot be stopped. <br /> <br /> After escaping from the institution, Myers tracks down his younger sister. If he kills her, there may be an end to the trouble of this misunderstood boy. But he seems to have problems finishing his sister, as others get in the way. He manages to pull them out, still looking for the girl he needs. <br /> <br /> There were many horror films in which teens were smashed into pieces by a masked killer or a horrible killer. But this one started everything, sort of. If you think about it, most of those horror films that we all remember are films in which Freddy Krueger or Jason chase half-naked girls. Well, if it were not for Halloween, these characters would not have pursued our dreams when we were children. <br /> <br /> Halloween director John Carpenter got a lot from the horror films of the 50s. and combined everything he knew into one movie that damn scared many people back in the late 70s. This film strengthened him as a director to watch, and also began his career with Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl, pursued by a killer in a mask. <br /> <br /> This movie may seem cliché today, but then there wasn’t much. It was copied and ripped, but Halloween will always remain the most typical teen horror movie. It still gives you a chill while listening to Carpenter’s exhilarating music, while we see another victim that dark Michael Myers is pursuing.
