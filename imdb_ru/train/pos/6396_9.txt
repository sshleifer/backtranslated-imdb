Do you think it was hard for you? You should check out this movie. Karl Brashear is the embodiment of courage and determination. What this man had to go through in order to become a sea diver should be a source of inspiration for all of us. And significantly, having seen this film, I found out that the film shown was not even half! Cuba Gooding Jr. does some of her best work to date as Brashear. De Niro, as usual, is as good as the southern redneck that trains him. George Tillman only in his second leading role (after "Soul Food") made a qualitative leap as a director. If you want to be inspired, you definitely need to check it out.
