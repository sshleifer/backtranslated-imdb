THE WAY TO PERFORMATION can be summed up on the account of Thomas Newman. It's intrusive and beautiful, but you know that this music is similar to Newman's other work, and while listening to the soundtrack, you remember SCENT OF A WOMAN, MEETING JOE BLACK and SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, which you remember about other films as History unfolds on the screen. When the Sullivans tour America, trying to escape from the psychotic assassin you think of GETAWAY, the Irish gangsters are MILLER'S CROSSING, while the subtext of guilt and ransom can be summed up with the gang epic of Coppola and Leone. Although I’ve seen it all before, I feel that it shouldn’t be taken as serious criticism of the Sam Mendes film, which I repeat, intrusive and beautiful, and the only flaws that work against it are a very slow opening in twenty minutes and I was a little confused, like the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed. But if you stop to think about how much sentimental confusion Spielberg could arrange with a story that revolves around his father and his twelve-year-old son who is fighting for his life, you can't help but think of being an excellent director Mendez. <br /> <br /> ROAD TO PERDITION - a film in which the entire cast demonstrates flawless performance. I have never been interested in Tom Hanks, but he is as good here as in any leading role, perhaps better. Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent, but I never believed that I watched the legend of the American screen with a false accent - the newman plays because of his subtle body language, his character is torn from guilt, but Newman never milks it or goes beyond. Despite the fact that Newman, who gives the best performance in the film, never left alone the new actor playing the British, Craig and Low, he was also very remembered as an American gangster, and although Low would still have a long career in As a lead actor, everyone wonders how Daniel Craig could develop as a character actor if he did not decide to become James Bond, a role that heralds the end of his acting career.
