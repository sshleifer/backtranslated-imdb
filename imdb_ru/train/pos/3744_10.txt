Perhaps this is the best short drama I've ever seen. The game is gorgeous, especially Amanda Burton, whose character turns from scary to sweet to exciting to sad, and then to some ... She copes with the balancing of Rachels / Karl's feelings and plays the pain of the one who lost the child, it is so believable it's more like a real story than a drama. The other actors, of course, are also great, as is usually the case in British TV / film. The end, which I am not going to play, is fantastic, mainly because you don’t have it ... (you’ll understand what I mean by seeing it). It is worth it to buy it and see. and again and again, and if you are not touched by this, you are one cold person.
