“Bloody Castle” (aka “Devil Lover's Creek”, “Altar of Blood”, “Ivanna” - the best, but least exploited film, sounding in movies, etc.) - this is a very traditional Gothic romance film. This means that it has big creepy castles, an obstinate young woman, a mysterious elderly man, hints of horror and supernatural, as well as elements of romance in the modern sense of the genre. It also means that this is a very deliberate pace, and that the film will work best for horrors that are big fans of understatement. If you like movies such as Robert Wise's Ghosts (1963), but you have a taste for the Spanish and Italian horrors of the late 1960s / early 1970s, you might also like Bloody Castle. <br /> <br /> Baron Janos Dalmar (Carlos Quini) lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional, unspecified European village. The locals are afraid of him, because the legend says that whenever he sleeps with a woman, she soon turns out to be dead - it is unanimous that he puts his ferocious dogs on them. This is quite problematic, because the Baron has a very healthy appetite for women. At the beginning of the film, another woman was dead and disfigured. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dr. Ivanna Rakovski (Erna Schürer) appeared in the center of the village with a request to take her to the baron. Dalmar Castle She is not one of those hired by the Baron for her chemistry experience. Of course, no one wants to go near the castle. Finally, Ivanna finds a shady man (who becomes even more doubtful) to take her. Once there, a strange woman who lives in the castle, Olga (Christiana Galloni), rejects Ivanna and says that she should not be there because she is a woman. Baron Dalmar hesitates if she should stay. In the end, it remains, but reluctantly. Baron hired her to try to reverse the effects of severe burns from which the baron’s brother Igor suffers. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Baron’s brother seems to be just a piece of decaying flesh in a vat of freakish, blackish liquid. And besides, Ivanna has strange, hallucinatory dreams. What happens in the castle? Is the baron responsible for the crimes? Is he mad? <br /> <br /> I wanted to love Bloody Castle more than me. As I mentioned, the film is very thoughtful at its pace, and most of it is very understated. I can go either way on stuff like this. I don't care about Ghosts (yes, I'm in a very small minority there), but I'm a big fan of the European horror of the 1960s and 1970s. One of my favorite directors is Mario Bava. I also love the work of Dario Argento from that period. But sometimes the Bloody Castle sometimes moved too slowly for me. There are large chunks that make up the scenes of a not very exciting conversation, alternating with scenes when Ivanna walks slowly through the corridors of the castle. <br /> <br /> But the atmosphere of the film is decent. Director Jose Luis Merino managed more than tolerable sets and locations, and Emanuele Di Cola shot them well. Nevertheless, Blood Castle feels relatively low-cost, and in the end it is a film produced by Roger Corman (which usually means low-budget, although often surprisingly high-quality “fast”). So, although they hint at the pomp of Bava colors and the complex scenery of the scenery, everything is much more minimalist. Of course, it does not help that the Retromedia imprint I observed looks like a 30-year-old photograph that has remained in the sun for too long. It looks blurry and compromised by contrast. <br /> <br /> However, Merino and Di Cola sometimes create fantastic visual effects. For example, a scene in which Ivanna walks along a dark corridor, shot from an exaggerated angle, and where an important element of the plot unfolds only through shadows on the wall. There are also a couple of pictures of Ingmar Bergmansky, where the actors gracefully block themselves to imply complex relationships, besides the fact that they are just visually attractive and look deep into the frame. <br /> <br /> The performances are pretty good, and women - especially Schürer - are very attractive. Merino uses this fact, adding a decent amount of nudity. Schürer continued to make a series of films that were as much soft corn porn, as they were other genres, with English titles such as Sex Life in Prison for Women (1974), Naked and Lustful (1974), Strip Nude for Your Killer (1975 ) and "Erotic feats of the sexual seducer" (1977). Bloody castle is much more tamed, but in addition to naked bodies, there are still light scenes involving rape and slavery, and, of course, scenes mixing sex and death. <br /> <br /> Although the main attraction here is probably a story that is very slowly burning novel like anything else. Elements of horror, elements of mystery and a somewhat unexpected twist at the end are bonuses, but in the end, the Bloody Castle is a love story where a couple overcomes various difficulties and antagonisms (often with physical threats or harm) to be together,
