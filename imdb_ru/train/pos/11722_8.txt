To be honest, I watched this movie only because of my needs. I mean, I could not get women at my age (I was 9 or 10 years old), so I thought that watching Elviraâ€™s splitting was an integral part of sex. <br /> <br /> I ended up having a great time with this cult classic about horror comedies, Halloween parties, sassy humor and some kind of sexual evil shown by Elvira. <br /> <br /> They just no longer make films like this ... This feeling of amateur effort mixed with the style of the host of a late-night talk show host. <br /> <br /> The truth is that he spawned many admirers thanks to his humor and ability to speak Cassandra. <br /> <br /> This is a classic that reminds me of the good days of the USA Up All Night.
