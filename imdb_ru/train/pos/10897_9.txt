What would you expect from a movie called "Surviving Christmas" and presented as "holiday fun", something like Gandhi or an English patient? There are a lot of things in this movie that I like, it's funny, very well shot and perfectly written. I came to the film as a Kaplan / Elfort fan, but when I read the plot, it was doubtful, it sounded ridiculous. But the film does not occur like that, because Affleck (as Drew Latham) plays his role perfectly, one minute is an adult, like a child, and the next is a mature man who understands that he got everything in life except that he really wants. In fact, we see how Latham grows up in this film, when he faces the problems of those whom he envies, and realizes that their life is not so good, he sees that his own life is not so bad. <br /> <br /> This movie has fewer weak or wacky scenes than many other comedies I've seen. Comedy is much more complicated than any other type of drama, it either works or not, and very few comedy writers understand it every time. I especially liked the dramatic scene where the family starts reading fragments written by Latham. Tom Valko (James Gandolfini) and comments by Brian Valko (Josh Zuckerman) are enjoyable. This is the dilemma of the greedy Tom Valko, who is forced to bite his tongue, wear silly hats or sing under the Christmas tree to earn a prize fund that will ensure good promotion of the film. <br /> <br /> Addition of Alicia's daughter (Christina Applegate) adds a delightful romantic corner to the story, and why not to a Christmas movie? Of course, trite and far-fetched; He is rich and beautiful, she is beautiful and lonely, and therefore she and Afflekt inevitably fall together in the snow and find themselves face to face. Big! One thing I would have liked is more to use holiday music to enhance the atmosphere, but I can't complain. I got what I wanted.
