I was surprised at how exciting this film was. The performances were very good, especially in the role of Rea as a merciful detective. <br /> <br /> Despite the small budget, the lack of effects or bright camera work, Citizen X somehow manages to surpass most of these large Hollywood films simply. Telling. . Story. <br /> <br /> True stories tend to end with a whimper, not a blow, and this is how it is, but other than that, this is a highly recommended detective yarn.
