I saw a special preview of this today. I have to inform you that I am not a big fan of either Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I really had no expectations. In the end, I got a little pleasure from it. <br /> <br /> “Dan in real life” is a story about a widower with three daughters who is going to spend a weekend with his family. While in the bookstore, he meets the woman of his dreams, only to find out that she is his brother's friend. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty well made - the soundtrack, the cinematography and the acting are all top-notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem with this was mainly that there seemed to be no character development, mainly with the character of Dane Cook. We never really intend to look closely at the relationship between the characters of Dane and Steve, and I felt that this might help a little in demonstrating Dan’s inner conflict over the love of Dane's girlfriend. In addition, Dan in "Real Life", of course, is a solid, sweet film - definitely a good break from all horror films and action movies that we received this year.
