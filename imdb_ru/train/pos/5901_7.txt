This is a rehash of many recent films, only there are fewer stars, less complexity and a more vague sensation. Abhay and Hrithik (played by Fardeen Khan and Ashea Deolom, respectively) meet at a friend's wedding, where their own marriage (unnoticed by them) begins their process of organization. Soon, two strangers are married and sent on a honeymoon, where they meet other couples, making movements similar to them. When they spend time together, they reveal their secrets, break hearts and / or repair them and love to flourish. <br /> <br /> If you saw Honeymoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishq, then you saw this movie. The plot twists are the same, in all two and a half hours of the film there is not a single unexpected element. Everything is predictable. I enjoyed it only because I saw Darling (also starring as the main characters Deol and Khan) at the beginning of the day and enjoyed their chemistry in this, so I said “why not” when my sister suggested that we remove “Only that got married. " <br /> <br /> Look: because Kirron Hur plays one of the main roles and is her favorite person in this. <br /> <br /> Skip this: because all of this rubbish about the doubles fest is enough for you! <br /> <br /> C +
