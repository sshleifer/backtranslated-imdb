Just kidding about weight loss; well, you can lose weight, you never know. Anyway, what can I say, I love this movie. This is the same sense of youth and innocence that can be found in films such as “Stand Me” and “Goonies”. Jake's wardrobe illustrates the beauty of the simple things of life and how often we miss them. The film reminds us of how it is to see the world through the eyes of children and all the magic, mystery and horror that they feel. Jake's wardrobe is a fairy tale, entirely human in its compassion, with which anyone who has had a childhood can have a relationship and fall in love. Watch it with friends; watch it with your loved ones; building a fort is not necessary.
