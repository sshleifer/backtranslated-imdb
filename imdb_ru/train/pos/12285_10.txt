A brilliant adaptation of the novel, thanks to which the relatives of the President of Chile, Salvador Allende, became famous. Surrounded by a large estate that emerged from the ruins, transformed into abuse and exploitation of disgrace, luxury estates in the interests of the upstart Esteban Trub and his undeserved family, brilliant Danish director Bille Augustus recreates in the micro which at that time would be a process leading to the greatest disgrace his stories about a hardened Chilean nation, and the main character of which would be Augusto Pinochet (Stefanâ€™s inevitability of him is unavoidable: recall, for example, this image of a dark-eyed senator who makes him wink at neral, that he began to build the palace). <br /> <br /> Billy August is visited by an exceptional cast in Jeremy's convex irons, whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty, a hard lesson that life always makes us almost make us change. In Esteban, the law of resonance is fully applied, with great wisdom, Solomon describes in these words: "That freckles are the same punishment as you." <br /> <br /> Unforgettable Glenn Close, playing in the splint, Stephen's spoiled sister, whose sin, driven by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love, was the wife of his fierce snow brother. Meryl Streep is also brilliant, a woman whose name came to him like Clara's glove. Possessing telekinetic abilities, cognitive and mediumistic, this seasoned woman, devoted to her stupid conservative husband, is an indicator of character and self-control that we desire for ourselves and for all people. <br /> <br /> Each character is a portrait of virtuosity (like Blanca, worthy of the rebel leader Pedro Segundo, unhappy ...) or a portrait of humiliation, like Stephen Jr., bastard Senator, which serves as a tool for the return of the boomerang. <br /> <br /> The film moves the entrails, we recreated some facts that should never be repeated, but which are still absurd (the case of Colombia is a sad example), and another reminder that, despite everything, life is beautiful because Always people like Isabel Allende perpetuate only Bill August.
