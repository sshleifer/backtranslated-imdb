When I was the chair of our college's coffee house, one of our work was to check out groups and films for student activities. One of the best things that appeared in 1972 was Groove Tube. The initial premise was that it was shown far from Broadway in cinemas, where television monitors were placed throughout the audience, so everyone had a great place. The premise was that the parodies would change on a regular basis - just like on a Saturday night live, keeping the thing fresh. They decided to turn it into a film for general distribution. <br /> <br /> I guess the developers said it was the first time Chevy Chase was doing a movie. Watching him run naked, although the forest was howling. As in many previous reviews, before this existed, there was a Saturday night. I highly recommend this view. I told my 13-year-old son about Coco's clown - he can't wait to get a copy!
