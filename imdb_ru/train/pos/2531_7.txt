A really good horror movie featuring the greatest, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Dr. Janos Ruch (Karloff) is on an expedition to Africa, trying to find an ancient meteorite. Having found it, Ruh is poisoned by its radiation. Everything he touches dies, and the dark side of Rukh makes him a selfish killer. His friend, Dr. Felix Benet (Lugosi) finds a limited remedy for this problem and at the same time understands that radiation can be used for the benefit of humanity in the treatment of diseases. Two villains will fight for the possibility of radiation. Pretty good special effects. Other cast members include Francis Drake, Frank Lawton, Beula Bondi and Frank Reicher.
