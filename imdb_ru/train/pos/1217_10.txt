I was worried that my daughter might be wrong. I think the “Dark Heart” character is a bit rude, and I don’t like how he turns into a “evil” frog, fox, boy? I was wrong, this film was made for my child, not for me. She "understands this" when she passed (under?) My head. Of course, I do not "understand." This is not one of the NEW children's films that adults will also like. This is right for the young, and the team knew what they were doing. There is no political junk ether. There is no magic key that will save the world from ourselves, no one has the right to surplus, and everyone is not always happy. And as an added benefit, no one dies! ?? russwill
