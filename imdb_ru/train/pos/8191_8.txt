Impossible planet and Satan's Pit together make up the two best episodes of the second season of the “new” Doctor Who. Having said this, it should be obvious that most of the story basically takes the plot of Quatermass and Yama (1967) into outer space, with a story of the universe intertwined with the story of the Beast 666. These episodes cement the emotional connection between Rose and the Doctor, while at the same time emphasizing Rose's growing confidence, claiming that she is not exactly equal, but still a successful partner with our beloved Time Lord. Also noteworthy is the elegant script of Matt Jones, which reduces the occasional excessive dependence on one-liners for the Doctor, and the performance of the entire cast, in particular, the magnificent Shaun Parks as the acting captain Zacharia Cross Flaine.
