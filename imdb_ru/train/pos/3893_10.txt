What more could you want? He is a history lesson, a foreign language teacher, a representative of the NRA and an ambassador to Burundi, dressed in a beautiful silk dress and heels. I laughed so much that I left a puddle. His troubles related to puberty, transvestism, public school and written in several languages, made the absolute best routine practice I have ever seen. I think about it now, after years, when I see a cake (tea with a cake or death) and hear something translated into French (a mouse under the table, a cat on a chair and a monkey on a branch. I like his version of what Jerry Dorsey I could call him before he settled on Englebert Humperdinka. I really hope to see a lot more from this great guy. He has something to teach us and a great way to tell it. Thanks for your time.
