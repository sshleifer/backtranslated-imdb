My very favorite character in the movies, but in almost all of them, the character Zorro has a bit of cloth as a mask, and if the villain cannot tell who is under this cloth, then they are stupid. <br /> <br /> But in “The Battle Legion of Zorro” by Reed Hadley (TV series 1939), the mask fills his entire face, turning him into a real mystery about who Zorro really is. <br /> <br /> But still Zorro I think that Anthony Hopkins in the movie “Mask of Zorro” (1998) is one of the best characters in the movies, and I think this is relevant. <br /> <br /> My interest in films is huge, but I really like the series of the 30s / 40s .... <br /> <br /> Bond2a
