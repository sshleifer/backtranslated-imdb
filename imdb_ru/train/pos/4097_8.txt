Youth, sexuality and French countryside are one of the most unique films you will ever see. If you see that it is not so difficult, given how difficult it is to find copies of it (a combination of scarcity and censorship). A trifle is boring in the middle, but in general you cannot call yourself a fan of a fancy movie until you watch this movie at least once.
