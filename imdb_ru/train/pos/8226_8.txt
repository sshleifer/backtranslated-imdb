We are talking about a low-budget film, and it is clear that there are some flaws (no spoilers: one sudden explosives expert and one pointless alcoholic); But in general, the story interests you, most of the characters are cute and there are some original situations. <br /> <br /> I really like movies that surprise some people who don't want to believe, and then twist and turn the plot ... I welcome it on this. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, also try watching the film “Nueve Reinas” (“Nine Queens”) from Argentina.
