Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by the film Samuel Fuller, contains a startling discovery that creates a double complication. Subway rider Candy (Susan Peters) comes across pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark dipped in cool Sinatra shades) She doesn't know what a valuable microfilm carries; McCoy is unaware of deceiving him. Both do not know that they are being watched by two federal agents. Thus, the neck sets in motion a degree of knowledge. Candy is watched twice (Skip and the police) and therefore doubly naive; Skip, a self-confident petty thief, knows nothing; he is being pursued by federal agents; the feds, all knowing, are ultimately helpless. They cannot stop the “transfer” of state secrets or the spread of communism.
