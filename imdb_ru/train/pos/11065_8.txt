This comedy with great pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail. There were many films of this genre with more famous actors trying to achieve this elusive mix that didnâ€™t come close to the depth and agility of it. This is, of course, because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances of Regger Rogers and Ally Chidy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters quickly captures your interest and emotions and holds them throughout the film. At first, the action seems rather mediocre and mediocre, but gradually you realize that these two rather miserable, damaged people are desperate and reluctant to try to heal themselves, although reluctantly, from each other. Rogers's heart-rending expressions of numb pain and Sheedy's angry flashes are so eloquent that everyone feels them like watching them. You will take care of these two cute, but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed, because it is doubtful, and everything hangs on a minor emotional thread. We hope that the audience will see more Regers and Ellie Sheedy, as this film proves their merit as very experienced actors, beyond any doubt.
