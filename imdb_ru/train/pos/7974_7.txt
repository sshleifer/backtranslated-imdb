I discovered that this film is an ordinary French slap in America. Too often, the camera focuses on fat people, on careless homes and in remote rural areas. While the narrative seems to sympathize with and admire the people of a small town who are presented to the viewer, cinematography exploits and humiliates them. Undoubtedly, in Glencoe and neat organized houses you could see thin people, but Malle decided to show us the worst thing that could be seen there. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that some American directors will go to France to show their worst elements to the American public. I can assure you, as a frequent guest in France, that all is not well there. Foreign immigrants do not easily assimilate, creating serious social inequality. But Americans do not seek to expose the French for their prejudice towards their countrymen and the envy of the United States, so we are unlikely to see films on this subject.
