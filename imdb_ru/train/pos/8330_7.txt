What a delicious romp ?? a very well-made film, possessing such charm and feeling of good mood, which many romantic comedies lack. Einstein brilliantly played Walter Mattau, and Catherine Meg Ryan is unforgettable ?? better than i saw her in those movies with tom hanks ?? as a young mathematician struggles to be recognized. <br /> <br /> You don’t need to be a young woman to understand Catherine’s struggle and immediately feel sympathy for her, and being a young man, it’s easy to understand what must have passed through Ed’s mind (Tim Robbins) in search of his real love There is a universal attraction in these emotions, even if I.Q. Keep it all light, fun and beautifully tied. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not hard, but if you look, there are some subtexts. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist, but he was a great spiritualist; his statements, such as something like: “If this is not impossible, then why do it?” suggest that he believes in achieving higher goals that are impossible to understand. In this film, there are questions about what an accident really is ?? for example, does the intervention of Albert and his foolish assistants matter in pushing Catherine away from the stiff upper lip that James didn’t like (Stephen Fry, who gives life to this cardboard character, and you can't help but feel his lack of feelings). What kind of interference is happening in our life, what we do not see, and it looks like an accident? <br /> <br /> And, of course, we would like to think in real life, despite the fact that we often watch people we know that Edwards and I get that Catherine and James should learn how to defrost ice water in their veins. How nice to know that this can work in an innocent (and disturbing, exclusively Caucasian) Eisenhower era country.
