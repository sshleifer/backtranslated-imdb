Things to come is a historical film. Along with Metropolis (1927), he serves as one of the first great fantastic performances. It is also one of the first films about the end of the world. It's amazing how the filmmakers predict the beginning of World War II during the year, and even, if subtly, the year when it ends in the real world. But then the film departs from reality, depicting a world devastated by war (only a substitute for poisonous gas for nuclear weapons, which, of course, was not in 1936). <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film is an incredible spectacle, making revolutionary use of models and matte paintings - later it will become the main subject of the science fiction genre. It is sad that after “Things ahead” science fiction is identified with cheap bi-movies, a stereotype that will not break until 2001: “Space Odyssey” more than 30 years later. If they were sticking to the quality of the effects in this film, everything would be different in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey and some of his colleagues played several roles in this film, which had a good effect. Massey plays the excellent role of "Doctor Who" as a pilot from a developed (in 1970) civilization, which is trying to conquer the population of a devastated country, ruled by an ingenuous warlord (a very effective performance by Ralph Richardson). Ultimately, the storyline covers 100 years. But this is a big problem with this film - in fact, there is no single storyline. <br /> <br /> It’s possible that in such an episodic film, in some sense reminiscent of intolerance, it’s hard to have an ordinary plot, but I felt that more could have been done from the material, and although the visual effects in the last third of the picture are really stunning and the cost of admission costs ... the plot does not exist, and the film itself suddenly ends just like now. getting interesting. Maybe the producers were thinking about another future sci-fi innovation: a sequel? <br /> <br /> “What is ahead” is a film that every serious science fiction fan should watch at least once. However, unlike Metropolis, it may not have multiple views.
