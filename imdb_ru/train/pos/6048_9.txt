What a cool piece of British cinema! It's time. And a comedy about the separation of the parties! <br /> <br /> Anyone who seeks a little freedom from his reckless youth, this road film will prove its worth. <br /> <br /> This is a mixture between both I and the Easy Rider. The film goes at a good pace and does not allow you to drift too long ... Sometimes there are thoughtful moments, but I think they are quite justified and add to the characters, who are portrayed as actors. I was a little concerned about the character of Phil Daniels from the very beginning, but fortunately he was won halfway through one of the funniest scenes in the entire movie! annoying some people around me. Oh well. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend it. It will become cult British comedy. Worth a visit.
