Sydney Lumet, although one of the oldest active directors, still got the game! A few years ago, he shot "To recognize me guilty," proof of all that Vin Diesel can really act if he has the opportunity and the right director. If he retired after this film (a real masterpiece in my eyes), no one could blame him. But he is still strong, his next film is already announced in 2009. <br /> <br /> But let's stay with this movie right here. The cast list is incredible, their performance is top notch. The small nuances in their actions, the “real” dialogue and / or the situations that develop throughout the film are simply amazing. The (temporal) film structure that keeps your fingers all the time, mixing time lines so easily that editing seems natural / flawless. This story is intensifying, although even in a “normal” temporary structure, it would be at least a good film (drama / thriller). I can only highly recommend it, the rest is up to you! : ABOUT)
