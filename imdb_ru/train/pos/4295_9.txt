Alain Shabbat claims that this film is his original idea, but the theme of reluctant lovers who finally collect it is the same old, if not older than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Shabbat is “vieux garcon”, happily alone and not wanting any member of the opposite sex to violate his life. He has a problem, 5 sisters and a matriarchal mother - G7 - who decide that he should be married. Enter the delightful, charming Charlotte of Gainsburg and what should be a simple plan. Charlotte must impersonate Shabbat’s girlfriend, and then simply do not appear on their wedding day. No more talking about marriage from the G7. Of course, the best laid out plans have a habit of spinning out of control. <br /> <br /> Lafon, as a mother, and Osterman, as a strong brother of Gainsburg, have very strong supporting roles. <br /> There are several fantastic scenes, as Charlotte must first enchant and then rebel against the family. French farce with English.
