Bellocchio calls it mainly a political film, describing the revolutionary movement in Italy, but it looks more like a metaphor than a reality. Well, almost everything in the movie seems to be a metaphor. Revolutionaries, about whom we see and about which we learn very little, can also be mafia. Down with the old and the new. <br /> <br /> Pope Andrea, a psychoanalyst, seems to be in favor of the usual traditional bourgeois values ​​- morally sincere, calm, clean and tidy, carefully ritualized. <Br /> <br /> Julia, a revolutionary's girlfriend, seems to be representing something that can happen to someone who is in great need of support, but who is unable to mobilize the kind of dedication that such an obligation requires. (I guess here.) Andrea, a teenage boy, seems to be the only guy in the film who in a sense is not an upatc. He respects his father, but also disobedient. He loves Julia, or, as we assume, although he is not old enough to learn how to optimally manage his reflexes, but he leaves her to appear at school and pass the final exams. His course between these controversial lifestyles can be described as “media”. He is a man between them who knows the significance of gradualness, who can remain calm while those around him scream. <br /> <br /> Most of this is summed up during the oral part of its finals when asked to translate and comment on an excerpt from Antigone, in which the traditional power of the gods is contrasted with the concept of secularism and free will. <br /> <br /> This leads us - by no means to the fact that I am aware of - Maruska Detmars. She recalls a caricature of New York several years ago. Two hippos neck and neck in a river looking at a gazelle drinking from the shore, and one hippo says to another: "I hate it." She is a good actress. (Let me get this out of the way.) But just like everyone else in the film. She carries with her in her speech and manner the rich luster of frank madness. And all this, too, from the actress, and not from the director's help. Detmars is not crazy, as Catherine Deneuve lost her mind in "Disgust." The walls do not turn into rubber and grow hands. Instead, we see it lively - sometimes TOO very busy. And she shocks us when her mood changes dramatically and becomes threatening to how a thunderstorm threatens. <br /> <br /> The critic called her sultry, but probably this is not the word he was looking for. She is strikingly beautiful with her fluffy brown hair, wide white ready-made smile, impulsive giggles. And her eyes are similar to the eyes in the pictures on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs. Sexy parts are pretty erotic, not because one of them is obvious, but because we have learned familiar characters. (It is more interesting to spy on a couple of newlyweds next door than to joke on the skin.) In fact, there is not much sex. There is only one scene simulated communication, but the director allows her to play what seems to be in real time. At least in real time for an eighteen-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> The young man who plays Andrea is also fine, which is necessary, because the film is almost entirely dependent on him and Julia. They have to carry it, and they do. If it were not for their performances, I’m not sure that it would be as interesting or amazing as the film. It could easily be turned into a rather slow, boring novel. <br /> <br /> It was worth it.
