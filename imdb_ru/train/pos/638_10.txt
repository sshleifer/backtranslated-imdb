For those who might think that this show is not for them, please try. Network television has degenerated into shows that are clones of clones or reality shows with the participation of some often unreal people. This show is a return to family-oriented television, where the main focus is on learning some life lessons, learning what real friends and family are, and maybe even learning a little about our national pastime. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most attractive young actors in the entertainment business today, and he played well as a young, slightly naive newcomer to the fictional New York Empires (great name!). Dean Kane, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms complete the cast, and they are all exceptional. This show deserves a chance to gain popularity. We hope that he will remain for several seasons, and we will be able to watch Pete Young (Sumpter's character) learn and grow.
