Orson Welles manages to kick me in the ass with every picture I see. The Lady of Shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces: “Magnificent Ambersons”, “Touch of Evil”, “Trial” and “Chime at Midnight”. The plot can sometimes be confusing, and sometimes it seems that it is moving, maybe a little too quickly (it was edited for about an hour when the test views were going badly). It does not matter, however. You cannot watch Wells films and concentrate too much on the plot. Its direction determines what a great direction is. Almost any scene from this film can sustain any other scene he has shot. Check out the courtroom scene. Usually these are such scandalous scenes that I hate them. For example, try reading Wells' own speech at the end of "Enforcement." In The Lady of Shanghai, just pay attention to the level of detail in the courtroom. Watch out for the jury who always sneezes and interrupts the process. Or just take a look at the lighting in this scene. I know that these are just Venetian blinds, and that they were constantly used in films about noirs and crime films of that era, but Wells gives it beauty. The dialogue is also wonderful. Wells had a skill, a skill that no one else had to make a crime film containing examples of the greatest poetry. Whether he spoke to Shakespeare or spat out hard-boiled strings, he could stir the soul. 10/10
