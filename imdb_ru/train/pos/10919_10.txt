Five Deadly Venoms is not as bloody and violent as Story Of Ricky or Super Ninjas, but it presents some of the best hand-to-hand combat sequences in the history of Hong Kong cinema. Director Chang Cech creates what many consider his masterpiece. This film marked the beginning of the career of five men who play poisons. Meng Lo plays another bad ass. He would continue to be in the Super Ninja. Kuo Chui, who is Philip Kwok, will go to Ricky's The Hard Boiled Story. Any chop fan can do this. But I still think it's not as good as the Super Ninja (also made by Chang Che). But all the cuts are good, and this is one of the best.
