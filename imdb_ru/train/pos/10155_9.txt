I just can not understand the negative comments about this film. Yes, this is a typical novel "meets a girl," but it is made with such talent and brilliance that time just flies by. Henstridge (talk about winning the lottery for the gene pool!) As attractive and attractive as before (who says that the golden age of cinema is dead?), And Vartan keeps it. <br /> <br /> There are two leads between boiling chemistry; the movie is the most lively when they share the stage - a lot! This is done so well that you find that you want them to come together ... <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to negative comments - if you feel a little bluish, watch this movie, you will feel much better . If you are already happy, then you will be euphoric. <br /> <br /> (PS: I'm 33 years old, a man from the UK, I'm a hopeless romantic, still looking for my princess ...)
