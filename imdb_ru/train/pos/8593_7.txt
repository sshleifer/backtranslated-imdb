Sentinel has a kind of mill and clich√© jogging, waiting / secret, but raised with some good play and a tight career. For the most part, these stories have gone through as many permutations as we can endure, so all that remains for us is how good the game is, how smart the setting and bad guys are, how well the main plot is thought out, etc., etc. so that Sentinel does a solid job, given its content. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland both maintain some good screen bravado and attitude. Eva Longoria (seeing her on the screen for the first time) brings some satisfactory support. The whole story in this story is incredibly improbable, but it deserves a little attention. Worth seeing if you like the genre.
