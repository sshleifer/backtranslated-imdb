This film shows the nations on the hottest 2 days in Austria. It shows people who humiliate other nations and cruel to other nations. This shows the inability of people to communicate or talk with others. <br /> <br /> At the show I visited, people left in the middle because they could no longer watch the movie. And it is right. Because the film is not so easy to watch. He has a very depressing message, and there is not a minute of mercy in the film. This is a very cruel film, not for every taste. You can not talk about the conditions of pleasure from this film. It squeezes your throat and never lets go, and in the end you just feel the breath because of its intensity. <br /> <br /> I cannot “recommend” or “not recommend” this film. You must make your own opinion based on what I said earlier. Just remember that this is not an ordinary film, and it is not for every taste.
