What does Cry Freedom look like? It’s just a wonderful and unique experience of creating South Africa and how black people in this country were crushed by white people. The story’s main character is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), editor-in-chief of the Daily Dispatch in South Africa. Woods writes several articles where he critically talks about the views of Steve Biko (Denzel Washington). Soon Woods meets with Biko, and he changes his views on him, and he also begins to understand what the authorities are doing with blacks in South Africa (right from above, even from the police chief). When Biko dies in police custody, Woods decides that he needs to write a book about him and whatever he publishes. But Woods must escape from his country to publish this book, and he must also put his family in second place so that the world can know the truth. <br /> <br /> Attenborough has managed to make a good film about people, with the main message that black and white are the same, because we are all human. The story takes us to South Africa, and this (film) is a great way for the whole world to know what happened on this earth, and I am disappointed that only 3200 people rated this film. This is a film from which we can all learn something. Although it is a bit long, this story cannot be presented in a more concise form, because the director wanted to show us how difficult it is for Woods to publish this book after Biko’s death. <br /> <br /> The excellent relationship between Woods and Biko was also shown, just like the families of these two people and all the problems they face. But sometimes sacrifices must be made (Biko's death) so that the truth can be revealed (Woods book).
