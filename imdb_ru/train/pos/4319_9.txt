The second time I watched this movie, I like it even more than the first time. He is full of nuances and perceptions of life as fairly mundane and often frightening, but what raises this film to a height rarely realized is his focus on small episodes in our life, which we usually offer only the shortest range of attention. Here the film revolves in the celebration of these incidents, the meeting of the driver of the tow truck and the client, the runner will hear the cry of the child from the bushes. The dialogue, acting, casting and directing are excellent. No two in four, no great revelations. What I really observed was how true the characters were for their basic natures and how their lives improved when they were celebrated. Kudos to all who are involved in this, we need more Grand Canyons in our lives. 9 out of 10
