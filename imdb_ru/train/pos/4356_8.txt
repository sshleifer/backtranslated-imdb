The Case of My People was a surprise. We had no idea what to expect. The film, directed by Raymond DeFelitt and based on the film adaptation of one of his stars, Paul Raiser, turned out to be a good time in the movies. Although the film is predictable, and we know what the outcome will be, this is a journey of discovery where Ben recognizes his father, perhaps for the first time in his life, Ben sees his father as he really is and not the Mythical figure on his mind. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be the vehicle for his star, Peter Falk, and he runs off with the film, as expected. Mr. Falk, one of the sweetest actors who worked in the cinema in this era and in past years, is an actor of this level, you have to reckon with him. Like Sam Kleinman, Ben's distant father, he is a man who was clearly misunderstood not only by Ben, but it seems that the whole family and his wife are forty-seven years old. <br /> <br /> When Muriel the Matriarch of the clan Kleinman runs away, everyone panics, because this woman, who was a strong family figure, is vital to keep everyone together. Not knowing where she went, Sam appears in Ben's house in confusion, suddenly feeling abandoned by the woman he married and who has been faithful for all these years. <br /> <br /> Ben, the youngest son, takes his father to go looking for a house he wants to buy so that he can take his family from Manhattan to the village. The trip gives Ben a reason to communicate with his father in ways he had never known, because the old man always projected the alienated figure to his younger son. Along the way, father and son understand how much they love each other and how wrongly the old man understood his children. Sam's love for Muriel covers many years when they know each other; they seem inseparable. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is great in the film. He makes a great Sam Kleinman, a man who suddenly realizes that his life will soon change for the worse. Mr. Falk shines like an old man, and in his interpretation of a man whose world is crumbling under him, there is never a false movement. <br /> <br /> Not being a fan of Paul Ryzer, we have to admit it, like Ben Kleinman, he's right. Ben and his father will find out how much they both have in common and their love for Muriel, a mother who sacrificed her life to save her family. Olympia Dukakis is visible only at the end of the film. She makes a good contribution as a runaway mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel with great style .. <br /> <br /> The film has a beautiful appearance thanks to the cinema of Dan Gillham and the excellent musical score of Stephen Argil. Ultimately, the film demonstrates the tremendous team effort between its director Mr. DeFelitta and Paul Reiser, who wrote it for the screen. <br /> <br /> Although this film is clearly intended for an older audience, anyone should like it.
