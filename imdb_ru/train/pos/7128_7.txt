This is perhaps the best performance of John Tou, where he successfully gets rid of any traits of his inspector Morse and brings the perfect adaptation of Tom from the pages of the book to the TV screen. It is a well-made play that maintains its family atmosphere, despite some very mature themes, such as the beginning of World War II and physical abuse of a child. <br /> <br /> However, this is the relationship between Tom and Tom. young Willie, who is the heart and soul of this story. It is very touching and wonderful to see how this connection between the young boy evacuated from London and the grumpy old man with whom he stayed develops - a real grandfather / grandson. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this story was not made with a large budget with a more well-established director, as it belongs on the big screen, and is not shown once or twice every ten years on Sunday afternoon. With the right guidance, John Ottep will be awarded worldwide and awarded many awards for his brilliant performance in this film. A great actor and a magnificent role that should be read more than it was at that time.
