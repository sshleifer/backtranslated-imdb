I caught some of this concert on public television and knew that I needed it. The guys give everyone at Royal Albert a great, often exciting presentation, complete in all respects. Pure, too - without a synthesizer, without smoke lasers and strobe lights, without a grand entrance (and a surprised, serious and grateful audience, all of whom left their bottles with rockets at home). <br /> <br /> If you're a Cream fan (or if you've only heard of them); if you are a blues fan; if you're a rock and roll fan; You will not be disappointed when you watch and listen to this DVD. You also never lose this DVD because you never lend it. (This DVD justifies selfishness! Tell them to get your own!) This is too good and too reproducible; You will want to keep it within easy reach.
