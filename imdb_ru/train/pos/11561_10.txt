This heart comedy confronts several strange characters. Especially, of course, the two main characters. Jack Lemmon plays Felix, a hypochondriac whose wife lost him because she could no longer tolerate his attacks on cleaning and cooking. Therefore, he tries to commit suicide, but every attempt fails. Walter Mattau plays Oscar, his friend, an untidy, unreliable sports reporter who lives divorced with his ex-wife in a bachelor apartment. He offers his poor friend Felix a new home in his apartment. And troubles soon begin, because two such opposite characters cannot live long together. Felix turns Oscar's erratic flat into a clean show flat. He cleans and cooks all the time. After a short time, Oscar feels a mania of persecution ... Deleted in a theatrical manner and perfectly removed. First of all, Jack Lemmon's game is wonderful. He is the perfect clown. He makes us laugh, but tragicomic. Look for a wonderful scene when both men invite their two neighbors for dinner, because Oscar has to touch something softer than a bowling ball. While he is preparing drinks, Felix sits with two young ladies in the living room. To get out of this awkward situation, he starts talking about the weather. A minute later, he changes the subject and talks about his ex-wife and children. Suddenly, he begins to cry, and when Oscar returns with drinks, three crying people appear in the living room. The film is full of such funny and at the same time touching scenes. Intellectual, entertaining comedy with a big heart. 10 out of 10!
