I accidentally got this title with Grindhouse Vol. 1 collection of pure Euro-trash films. But this film has a good mark of approval and should deserve a better program than what it is. Foolish is not ... satisfaction is! Watching this movie, I could not help thinking ... why Sergio Martino did not make this movie? It has its signature on all of this and is accentuated by Edvage Fenech (alas, not as well known as she should be, but she got a good cameo in Hostel II). Double and triple crosses are the basis and glue this film from beginning to end, when Lee Van Cleef exudes coolness under pressure from the first second. Did this guy have to go to Italy to finally reach his potential, or did the studio system miss this guy? In addition to Lee’s more recognizable films, viewers should try it on themselves and see how Sergio Leone would reduce his epic “Once Upon a Time in America” to half the time (and 1/4 of the budget) is what it could be . So refreshing, it should be taken during the day at home and do it for the morning sofa
