After reading the book of Diamond, I was a little disappointed in the series, but in general it is quite informative. Reading the other comments, it’s nice to know that the “cultural warriors” are working hard, seeing “attacks” on the “Western civilization” under each carpet. <br /> <br /> Does diamond preach a little? Of course. Like many scientists, he considers his theory the most important in history. He uses the phrase “weapons, germs and steel,” apparently at every opportunity during the series. We get it in about the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Is the diamond a bit simplified (in series)? Of course. The part about the Spaniards in South America is especially funny: it tells a very long and complicated story about “smallpox, swords and horses”, which covers the entire conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the essence remains in force - these things really contributed (but not completely determine) the reasons for the success of the Spaniard against established cultures. <br /> <br /> Does he * preach * against * Western civilization in any way? Nope Not a word. Not until my ear. All he says is that luck played a big role in determining which cultures developed faster, * not * that luck is the only reason. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you are looking for something that confirms your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all the factors that influence the success or failure of a society, this series presents a useful interpretation of historical data.
