I haven't watched the movie yet, but I can't wait to see it! It seems very interesting and inspiring. It was one of the most interesting trailers I have ever seen: the questions posed by him really stopped me and made me think, a unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for the “battle inside” ... thank God someone hit a different corner boxing thing. This movie looks so fresh and smart. And the actor is really hot. I especially liked the short clip with the actor from the Rocky movies, really smart. I thought that the chosen topic - overcoming adversity and childhood trauma - is eternal, and, as is known to God, many need it. Come on.
