Lars von Trier never lags behind in testing new methods. Some of them are very original, while others are best forgotten. <br /> <br /> He portrays post-war Germany as a horrible train journey. With so many cities in ruins, Leo Kessler, a young American of German descent, feels obliged to help with their restoration. This is not an easy task, as he quickly learns. <br /> <br /> His uncle finds him a job as a night guide on the Zentrop railway line. His job is to meet the needs of passengers. When shoes are polished, chalk is applied to the soles. A terrible argument follows when the passenger's shoes were not chalked, despite the fact that they were polished. There are many hints of German fanaticism about adhering to such silly details. <br /> <br /> Railway travel is like an allegory, representing a person’s procession through life with all its trials and tribulations. In one episode, Leo rushes through the rear carriages to discover them, filled with half-starved bodies that seem to have just escaped from Auschwitz. These images, however terrible they are, are fleeting, as in a dream, each with its terrible impact, but in no way connected. <br /> <br /> At the station called Urmitz, Leo jumps out of the train with a torn bomb. According to many outsiders, he connects the bomb with the bottom of the carriage. He returns to his cabin and connects to the clock of time. Later he jumps from the train (at high speed) and lies in the cool grass on the bank of the river. Looking at the stars above, he decides that his job is to build, not destroy. Subsequently, when he sees a train approaching a giant bridge, he runs at a breakneck pace to take the train and stop the clock. If you want to analyze the situation, this is an absolutely impossible task. Pretty funny actually. This can only happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> It is strange when someone remembers such small details as a row of cups hanging from hooks and rumbling from rocking the train. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film is widely recognized, I prefer the later films of Lars von Trier (“Break the Waves” and “Idiots”). The bomb scene described above really pushed me away. Maybe I'm a realist.
