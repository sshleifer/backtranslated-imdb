In each country where the film industry works, there is some sane (and maybe insane) artist who makes films that you can fully understand only when you are part of this country. I think Hundstage is such a film. <br /> <br /> You see the lowest level of Austrian society, dirty, excited, strange, hateful. But they still have enough money so that they can afford tuned cars and big houses. And they definitely do a lot of weird things here that may seem “normal” to them because they have been doing it all their lives. From a normal human point of view, you can now easily follow the film, feel disgust or admiration and watch the beautiful art films of Austria. <br /> <br /> But if you live here and know the people you see in the Hundstage characters as a tumor of society. A society that is becoming increasingly insane from day to day, creates its own rules, which no one can understand, fails the social system from the inside. And you SEE people. Sit in the park, stand on the opposite corner of the street, stand in line on the same line. Maybe you meet them at the bar or at the disco, which you can visit. Perhaps you even work with them at work or they live near your home. You start to hate them, not knowing exactly why. You will try to leave, but you cannot. Maybe you end up like them. But it seems “normal” to you, because you have been doing it all your life ... <br /> <br /> Life is not so bright, although Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. There are wonderful people there ... but some are ugly too. There are many hardworking people who are trying their best ... but there are those who ride on the back of others and destroy everything that the people of Austria have so far created. <br /> <br /> Very pessimistic movie.
