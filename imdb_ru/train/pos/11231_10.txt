I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier, it's a great fan series, and I can't wait to see more, I just started watching this show last week, and I just miss it. I have already recommended it to other people to view, as it is worth seeing. I already watched each episode many times and am waiting to see more episodes coming out. I rated it ten, but I think it deserves a 12 loll. My compliments to the staff of Star Trek's Hidden Borders on excellent work. If you like Star Trek, I highly recommend watching this Star Trek fan-fiction movie. The details associated with this series of films are excellent, especially the ships and planets used in it.
