Any child old enough to sit in front of the screen will be absolutely fascinated by beautifully drawn images and wonderful music in this soulful and humorous correspondence of the Grimms tale. They will sing “Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo” even before they can formulate a complete sentence, and will continue to sing it until the end of their days. This is a classic for all children, especially for those who are young at heart.
