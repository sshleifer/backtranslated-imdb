The power of Gangwon Province is the second feature film directed by Hon Sang-Soo, and obviously much of what he began in his previous films returns in this film, including numerous related narratives (in this case two) and stories about problems or worries. relationships, as well as a powerful dosage of irony. <br /> <br /> One thing that has clearly diminished from his previous work is the flights of fantasy, including elements of surrealism. However, this film also contains one surreal moment that contrasts with a rather realistic image. These two stories tell of a young woman who goes on a trip to Gangwon Province with her friends, but it turns out that she is attracted to a stranger, the second about a man who also goes on a trip to Gangwon Province with her friend and struggles with her relationship. grief <br /> <br /> Again, Hong demonstrates a deep understanding of the irony and flaws of human nature, and yet I don’t think he is completely sympathetic when it comes to his characters, attracting enough compassion to compensate for the criticism he attracts with his irony. I think I loved Hong movies, because they just feel so real, especially complex and controversial characters. It cannot be said that every person is a hypocrite or suffers from embarrassed feelings, but rather that these characters, which he and the actors represent, feel completely developed and believable. <br /> <br /> This is not a fast moving movie. There is a lot of time, and, as in the previous film, things do not always connect immediately, so patience pays off in an amazing way. It seems that in the film there is not a single element that would not be intentionally placed in the film, and this made me become a little aware of various seemingly additional characters when they are drawn into the mix as the film progresses. <Br /> <br /> “Power” is an excellent film that manages to bring a level of personal emotion, regret, longing for history, which underlines the irony and fallacy of human decision making. This is a rather difficult balance, and it is surprising how Hong managed to cope with it twice in a row. The technical values ​​of production have become much better, since the first film and the manual have become steady and clear. This film does not have the same emotional effect as the first, but it wins a lot in its confident study, and sophistication really helps to reinforce a common vision. Great viewing for lovers of art cinema. 8/10.
