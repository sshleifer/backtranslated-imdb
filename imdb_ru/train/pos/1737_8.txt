I love old Burt Reynolds films. They are funnier and better than all the rest of the films combined. They might as well stop making films after Cannonball Run 2, but I think how could they know that there would be no better ones? Man, this movie is good. Burt Reynolds has to dress like a chicken and ride a lot on a race car, and the luxurious Loni Anderson is at hand, he looks very hot in the eighties. Bert and Loni, those were the days! I used to have this magazine in which Loni Anderson advertised a vacuum cleaner. I'm sure I loved this ad! In addition, there is one part in the film where the audience at the racetrack is upset about what Stroker Ace (Burtie R.) is doing, and this shows that one guy in the audience leans and puts his finger in the ass to show his disappointment! I laughed so hard that I almost died in the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then you never watch another movie again, because I'm telling you right now: there is no point.
