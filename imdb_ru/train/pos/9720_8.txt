“How to lose friends and alienate people” is a great movie. A fun movie from start to finish. Great artist. Enjoyed it. Thumbs up! <br /> <br /> Performances: Jason is awesome. He is a pleasure to watch him from beginning to end. Jeff Bridges is superb as a boss. He is a legend. Megan Fox looks amazingly hot and shows good performance but dude, she’s such a hot person! Anderson is amazing. She doesn't look old at all, still hot. Kristan Dunst looks great and does a pretty good job. Others are also very good. <br /> <br /> “How to lose friends and alienate people” is a great artist. Do not miss this movie!
