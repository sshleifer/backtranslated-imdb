Surprise nominee for the best animated race of the year at the Oscars. This is an Irish film by heart, but he was produced by Belgium and Brazil, I think the animators work in all three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films of late. The character design is a bit like the French Persepolis animated film a couple of years ago, with very simple characters with thick black outlines. This film is not in black and white. Oh no. What makes this film great is the use of color, just one of the most outrageous and astounding uses of color I've ever seen. The overall design of the pictures is also much more geometric, with characters that are mostly rectangles or ovals. Most of the film can be spent playing while searching for a circle - the main aspect of visual design is the circle in the center of the image. All of these geometric designs have a goal â€” a story about a young boy who studies the artist who works on illuminated manuscripts (The Book of Kells is a real lit Bible; the art of the film is based on the drawings in it). The story of the film is not particularly deep, but it's a pretty good fairy tale. Brendan is a young boy in Kells, a city surrounded by huge walls built by his uncle to keep out the Vikings. Brother Aiden, new to Kells, inspires Brendan to do the artwork. He also inspires him to do things like leave Kells and explore the nearby forest where the nymph lives. Bruno Coulais gives a fantastic result, almost as good as the one he did for Coraline, which I consider the best of the year.
