This pleasant little noir boasts the best actor and many memorable scenes. A big distraction is the complete disregard of real accents. The Spanish characters in the film were played by a Frenchman (Boyer), a Belgian (Franz), a Greek (Paksinu) and a Hungarian (Lorre)! And to top it all, Bacall must be an English aristocrat! Despite all this absurdity, all the performances are very good, especially with Paksin and Lorre. But the scene in which Boyer, Paksinu and Lorre meet and speak with completely different accents is a real cry! And I think, seeing how they were alone, that they should have spoken Spanish anyway! It seems rather strange that the Warner brothers could not find a Spanish-speaking actor in Los Angeles! Of course, in Hollywood the policy of “any old accent will work” was often used - my other favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) as Mata Hari (Dutch), who falls in love with a Russian soldier played by a Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Perhaps they should have received Novarro for the “Secret Agent” - he would have been great in the role of Boyer, or at least in the role of Fransen (which would have saved a lot on the dismal makeup budget).
