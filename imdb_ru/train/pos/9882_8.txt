Currently, the new METOO schedule is at 4 pm on weekdays, right after "Maverick" and right before "Wild, Wild West" (followed by "Star Trek"). <br /> <br /> I don’t know if I have ever actually seen this episode when it was originally, but I’m really fascinated by it. Unusual, unusual, surrealistic stories taking place in the mythical West. View of the "naked city" westerns. <br /> <br /> And the guest stars are: Dan Durya, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevi, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (as a cunning Mexican), young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry Jr. (as a colorful Mexican) , Martha Heyer, Margaret Chapman, even Ann Robinson (“War of the Worlds”), Gloria Talbott (“I married a monster from space”) <br /> <br /> This went on for EIGHT SEASONS, more than 200 episodes, with January 1959 to December 1965. <br /> <br /> Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as the footprint boss Gil Favor, the most passionless person who ever lived, with a samurai code of honor and just the right balance between rigidity and openness. I would vote for him for the president any day. (PS He had a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) <br /> <br /> And young Clint Eastwood is astounding with his impulsive right hand "Rowdy" Yeats, Also, in As a veteran of Western acting music and a figure of country music (the immortal One-Eyed, One-Horned, Flying Purple People-Eater), Pete Nolan is an experienced intelligence officer, Sheb Vuli. And Paul Brynegar makes the weirdest chef character out of everyone you could ask for, like "The Grove." <br /> <br /> There is also a great song performed by the immortal Frankie Lane. (Between this and the theme of “Maverick,” Western-style songs are in my head all day long.) <br /> <br /> I look forward to each episode; I collect the whole set. A good time (not to mention talking) is always guaranteed, as everyone is waiting to find out if the boys will cope with their difficulties before advertising. <br /> <br /> Rollin ', rollin', Rollin '...
