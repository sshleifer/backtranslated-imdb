Winchester '73 was a film that relocated Mann from b-films to the big leagues, saving James Stewart's hectic post-war career in the process, casting him as a conflicted hero (although, since he inherited the project from Fritz Lang, Lang may be worthy of praise for that ). Both men will go to much darker places - Mann with a surprisingly dark Diabolical Doorway, which remained on the shelves of MGM, until the success of the Broken Arrow convinced them to release it ?? but the film about the man who hunts for his own brother, since the rifle with the title is passed from person to person along the path before it ends in one of the favorite directorial shooting on the mountainside, is still stronger than meat than you expect from the studio . Excellent dialogue, impressive cast? Dan Durya, Will Gier, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntyre, Jay S. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them ?? and Mann's outstanding visual sense raises the bar with this.
