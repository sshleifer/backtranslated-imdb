Takashi Miikeâ€™s invasion of children's territory almost immediately conquered me, because he showed courage and courage when working with elements of fantasy. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. As a child, I thought that in most fairy tales there is something ominous; Terrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic stories are a bit more scary (and more disturbing) than they appear at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetypal story of a child in an amazing search from a preschool class. He emphasizes real fears of a world filled with endless dangerous missions. Westerners love to play down the seriousness of bedtime stories written specifically for children. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes to the joke of history, but he also shows signs of restraint. But Miike, self-mastered, is still unfamiliar with most filmmakers. I thought it was a great movie. Highly recommended.
