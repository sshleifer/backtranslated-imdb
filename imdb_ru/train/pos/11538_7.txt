Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) has just been thrown by his wife because he is one of the most annoying, neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his way out, but he just can't make it work, so he goes to his friends house. Oscar Madison (Walter Mattau) also recently divorced and lives in bachelor heaven. Smoking, gambling, hitting chickens, eating out and never cleaning is paradise for him. Well, with suicide attempts, Oscar decides to let Felix approach. At first, this match made in heaven, Felix prepares and cleans and helps Oscar pay his alimony on time, but soon Oscar defends the interests of women and Felix (who is likely to be gay in today's world) is not ready to move on. They invite a couple of British birds and find Felix so tender that soon they and Felix cry and chat about his family life, leaving Oscar denied. That's all, he explodes and throws him out, but Felix is ​​not as helpless as it seems, and he soon gains the upper hand. My favorite quote is: “You leave me a little note on my pillow. I told you 158 times that I can't put small notes on my pillow. ” We are all made from cornflakes. F.W. "It took me three hours to realize that FU was Felix Ungar!" Based on the play of Neil Simon (who also wrote the script), it has a certain theatrical feel to him. Set both repartee and appearance to feel pretty gaming (for better or worse). Lemmon and Mathau have great comedy chemistry, and they appeared in the films Grumpier Old Men and Out to Sea, repeating the same picky / sloppy roles, but under different names (I’m sure to avoid royalties). <br /> <This movie is similar to strawberries in chocolate. The chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, the strawberries are sour, juicy and bright red (unless you get these nasty greenish ones). These are almost polar opposites, but together the contrasts emphasize each other and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
