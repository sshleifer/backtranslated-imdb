I caught this film in 1990 on video by chance and not knowing what I was for. Many horror fans may have missed it, thinking that it was a typical prison film, and those who received it didn’t like it, because it wasn’t what they wanted to see. The factors listed above are probably the reasons for his low score, but just ignore it and confuse you if you are a fan of the genre. <br /> <br /> He has strengths in all departments, from the script and the atmosphere to the action and the prison itself. <br /> <br /> Absolute diamond, a film that I still shoot on video. Check this.
