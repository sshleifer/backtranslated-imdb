I really liked this film and the audience with whom I saw it in Los Angeles. After the film, many people cried and said how much the film had influenced them. I understand why it was such a huge success in his homeland, in Sweden. The film is masterfully shot, and each character is beautifully drawn, so by the end you really know these people and care about them. The music is very natural, and the main song in the film is quite heartbreaking, but inspiring. I definitely recommend this film for everyone, even for those who usually donâ€™t watch movies with subtitles. Definitely deserves an Oscar Nomination because of the deep themes of the film, reflected without complaints in the community of a small town with ordinary people. This is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows the potential of the human spirit. MUST SEE!
