Oh my gosh, I live in Kentucky, and when Mellis Joan Hart came to Louisville, she went straight through my neighborhood and waved to me, I was dirty rich, so she wanted to look at my neighborhood, oh, and I love being rich whatever it is, she came to Derby returning to my interest in the show ...... this show makes you want to point the finger at something and make it disappear, I mean, it's so creative, and I I like it, I would like to be on this show ... .... this show is just awesome, I mean, who ever thought of this show, I I just want to kiss them, I mean, I get better when I'm sick, and I'm happy, when I'm angry, I mean if someone tells me that they don't like it, I will tell you something
