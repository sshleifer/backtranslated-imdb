Although most Americans know little about their work, apart from Star Wars, Alec Guinness created an amazing job - especially in the 1940s and 1950s - from dramas to fancy comedies. I especially like his comedies, because they are so well made and seem so natural and real on the screen - they are very different from the usual fare from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> As they say, this was the film that sparked my interest in these films. The plot was so bizarre and cute that it was unlikely that the film would have been made anywhere other than Ealing studio, which especially loved such “small” films like this one. <br /> <br /> Guinness is a little nerd scientist working for a textile company. He wants to experiment to create an indestructible synthetic fabric, although he does not work for the company as a researcher, but for the cleaning work! Thus, he has a tendency to penetrate laboratories (either during the day, if no one suspects, or at night) and try his hand at the invention. Repeatedly he was caught (for example, after he blew up the laboratory) and was given a shoe, until one day he really did not succeed! Then, despite the importance of discovery, he launches a completely unexpected chain of events - and here the most interesting begins. <br /> <br /> The film is a wonderful satire that makes fun of industry, trade unions, government, and people in general.
