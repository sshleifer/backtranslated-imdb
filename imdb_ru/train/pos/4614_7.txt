This movie is funny! This is exactly what I like about this Guilty Pleasure piece. It is easy to condemn this film for not including Pat Priest and Butt Patrick, the original Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year and do the math. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick have long outgrown their parts! Time does it with young stars. Yvonne De Carlo, who highly valued her role as Lily, pushed the “Big 6-0” (although she still looked good and had the perfect “Lily”). <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Yvonne De Carlo didn't give much of it. Nevertheless, it was nice to see Fred Gwynn and Al Lewis in the roles that made them so famous! For two seasons, when THE MUNSTERS were in prime time, it was Gwynn / Lewis’s chemistry that made the show so successful. The rest of the actors supported the actors, not to mention the fact that they were not needed. They were! The television series would not have survived as long as without them. Given the choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (original Eddie), the choice was too easy. Yvonne De Carlo was a better choice than Joan Marshall. <br /> <br /> Although this film does not fit the original series, it is still good and is one of the best "reunite" television events. who tortured boobs in the late 1970s - early 1980s. <br /> <br /> '
