This is a classic. Beautiful shot and shot. Reveals the district of Paris, which is alive and full of comedy and tragedy. Although the Hotel du Nord and the hotel itself still exist, it is not as cheerful (in the original sense of the word) and as joyous as it once was. The film makes one dream of the past, which was lost, with a sigh and bitter sweetness.
