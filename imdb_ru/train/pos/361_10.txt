As I said above, four stars is simply not enough. This is one of the best films I've ever seen in my nearly 17 years of life. For people who really do not like or do not understand this, you should not appreciate art, otherwise you may have a small amount of attention. <br /> <br /> Even if I did not see all of his films yet, I would have to say that this is Spielberg at his peak. It is very sad to see such great films as “Colored Purple” not appear too often, because I think we all desperately need first-class entertainment films in these difficult times. <br /> <Such films are more than just films; these are works of art that need more value. <br /> <br /> The idea that he was nominated for 11 Oscars (even the best picture of the year) and did not receive a single trophy is a sign of how blind and dull Hollywood sometimes happens. Spielberg was not even nominated for the best director!
