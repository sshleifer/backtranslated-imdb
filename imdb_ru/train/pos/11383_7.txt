This is a wonderful musical with a timeless score of one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a pleasant "Parisian" atmosphere, which gives the film a lot of charm, but in terms of history ... well, in fact, it is not there. Or, at least, not very well developed. The actor is also not so smooth from Caron. But I liked some of the dialogues, I liked the scene on the Seine, I liked the character played by the Levant, the colors; and dancing, of course, is great. <br /> <br /> A 7.5 - 8 seems to me on the verge.
