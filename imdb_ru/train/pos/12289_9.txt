First of all, I would like to note that I did not read the book, so I had no chance to give up on this aspect. The main disadvantage that I discovered were historical details: a few cars, trains, clothes, etc. I think that at that time they did not belong. <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> On the technical side of the film, everything is in order, there is nothing to brag about. But the game, I think, was awesome. I have no experience in acting, but I can not believe how people can consider it terrible! They may have only seen two films (ever), and the other must have been very good indeed! <br /> <br /> I especially liked Jeremy Irons, and I really understood his character, the man who crawled along the social scale. with very hard work, then he fights with those who robbed him of his lifeâ€™s work, only he was so carried away by this battle that he did not understand that the reason was no longer on his side, and as a result he became a beaten, disappointed man. Irons made it so believable that I sympathized with the character, despite his cruelty. <br /> <br /> After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also wonderful as the romantic young woman her boyfriend is embroiling in revolutionary ideals (Banderas) He had an underdeveloped part, I think), and Glenn Close was also very good. Meryl Streep had average performance, it was not bad, just not at the level of other actors. Beware of Miguel Guilherme, a great Portuguese actor, among so many stars. <br /> <br /> Unlike today's films, only interpretations are important here, only people, but at the same time it is not pretentious. The film also worried, trying to be an intellectual. I really liked the best proof, I write a review 7 years later.
