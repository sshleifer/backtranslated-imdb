If you liked Roman Polanski's “Repulsion”, you should probably check out the Tenant, as this is a similar concept, just from Polanski, who entered the game and plays the schizophrenic fool. This is actually one of my favorite films — the second after Rosemary the Kid, of course — and this is a direct journey into a mental disorder of a person who moves to a former apartment of a suicide victim. The rest of the inhabitants of the building are all clumsy and persistent in holding back the noise level — even the slightest “fuss” becomes a big deal, and Polanski, who plays major roles, is becoming more and more paranoid and more and more inferior to his crazy hallucinations, because the film bears . It got to the point that he dresses and behaves like a former tenant, and you realize that it is only a matter of time when he decides to repeat her fatal leap from the window ... The film is a little slow and inept for some time, but if you Ever seen a film by Roman Polanski, you should know that it will end in an explosion, and this film will not disappoint. It is also better if you do not question the subtleties of the package and simply perceive it as a descent into insanity, because sometimes it is rather strange surreal. Polanski is very good as a timid, irresponsible inhabitant who somehow attracts the always famous Isabelle Adjani. We also see him running into a drag, which is both alarming and fun! Damn, he makes for one ugly chick! Thus, fans of Polanski, who can look through his thirty-year pedophilia charges, should enjoy The Tenant as a fascinating psychological trip ...
