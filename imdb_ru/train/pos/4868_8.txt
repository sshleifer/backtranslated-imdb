I gave this film 8 out of 10, having reserved 10 for, for example, Amadeus, and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire more recently. This film is close to Slums, but it is difficult to judge about such a film without understanding the Balkan life, mentality and soul that Kusturica presents skillfully. To understand this, you really need to be one of the Balkans. This is an amazing film, much better and more modern than his previous films, which are boring at this time, I think Kusturica is moving forward with this film. I like humor (Balkan humor), photography is art itself, every scene is artistic to the limit. The plot is probably a fairy tale, do not remember it now, but do not forget to read my daughter, who is sleeping, a similar story.
