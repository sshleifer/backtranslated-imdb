This is a slow story. Inaction. No crazy waiting. No hard surprises. If you cannot watch a film about two people who just talk and walk, about a story that develops slowly to the very end, and about a love affair, do not waste your time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are in a dialogue, masterfully telling stories, thinking and finding true love in the fabric of life, then this is your film. However, I recommend that you watch this film when you are most alert, because the tempo, the music and the overall tone of the film can put you in a vague mood. This is really fantastic. I really mean it. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy annoyed from time to time with their behavior, but, fortunately, the chemistry between them makes the game very natural, warm and gentle. They act and feel each other from the very beginning, making you feel like an intruder. <br /> <br /> Their conversations contain excellent comments on many issues that will cause reflection and conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters, but I might underestimate their intelligence. However, this did not spoil the film. <br /> <br /> The general story is very simple, which, I think, gives the film charm and, ultimately, strength. <br /> <br /> ESSENCE OF THE IMAGE is slow. The dialogue is fascinating. The story is built softly, systematically and meaningfully. Build before the finals brings satisfaction and ultimately benefits.
