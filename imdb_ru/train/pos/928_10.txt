I watched as many TV shows as I could on TV, but, unfortunately, I started work that made me work in the evenings. I managed to catch some recordings of this, at least ... and, of course, bought the recently released DVD of the full series. After watching the DVD, you can see that the animation was a little more rough at first, but after the pilot finished, they smoothed a fair amount of flaws. Voices are well suited for characters, and the spelling is excellent. It is quite refreshing to see the animation return to its roots, re-introducing adult themes. The fact is that with the way society came in the last century, you need to be a little more outspoken by today's standards in order to be recognized as an adult show. The characters have very realistic personalities, and they find themselves in situations parallel to those we often encounter in real life. This is your typical comedy series in this respect, but humor is more like what you expect from late night television, such as a talk show scene or Saturday Night Live ... back when SNL was really funny. Good job, dreamworks. You may need to work with one of the more liberal networks to continue this series ... and also improve product marketing for this series to help cover its high cost. This is not easy to do for the cartoon of a mature nature. Hmm ...
