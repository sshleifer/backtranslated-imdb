A great film showing the miserable lives of two crazy old women. They could not live together or apart. Muttering constantly, sometimes at the same time, they hash and re-hash the past; continuing and continuing about what might be. At times I laughed, but mostly I was surprised at how sad and abandoned these two women were. Watch this.
