When I first heard about the title, I thought of The Simpsons, like many other reviewers, but when I saw the cast, I was absolutely stunned that so many great character actors would really be in it! First, we have Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction), who plays the title character McBain. He was rescued from a Vietnam prison camp by some of his buddies, one of whom is Santos (Chick Venner, Yankee), who shares the $ 100 DOLLAR BILL with McBain (Vietnamese soldiers are clearly loaded with cash) and tells him that he can do him a favor if he gets into trouble. <br /> <br /> Then, 18 years later, Santos and his sister Cristina (Maria Conchita Alonso, Running Man, Predator 2) join the rebels. in Colombia, trying to get rid of his evil dictator El Presidente (Victor Argo, taxi driver, King of New York), and when Santos fails the mission, Christina turns to McBain for help. <br /> <br /> Then McBain asks his good friends from Vietnam to help him. First of all, this is a cool black guy, Eastland, played by Steve James from American Ninja, who also starred in James Glikenhouse’s previous film “The Destroyer”, where the real name of the fighter was also Eastland, a coincidence? I think no. There are also many other references to The Fighter, among which the most noticeable is that McBain himself wears the mask of a welder when Christina sees him for the first time when he is working on welding work over the bridge! <br /> <br /> Other guys from the Vietnamese Package: a rich guy who can afford all kinds of equipment for the team, Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recall, Starship Troopers), and there is also a Dalton document ( played by Jay Patterson, who doesn't look like the guy IMDb refers to, and I haven't seen him in other films, so who knows), and last but not least, this is a policeman, Jill He has enough of his unsatisfactory work, his played by Thomas G. Waits, which some of us may recall from Warriors and Things. <br /> <br /> And in other important roles, we find Luis Guzmán (“Boogie Nights” (Carlito's Way) - a small drug dealer who cannot find a decent job. In addition, there is Dick Boccelli, like a drug lord, who hangs up the Macbain gang in the crane on the roof, almost exactly the same as he hung over John Eastland’s meat grinder in the exterminator film! Now I haven’t seen Glickkenhaus's “Shakedown / Blue Jean Cop”, but I’m almost ready to put a $ 100 dollar bill that Bokchelli also hangs in this film! <br /> <br /> Well, back to the plot of this film ... they are sent to Colombia and save the day, hurray! But in any case, who cares about the plot, the actors are great, and the action films are very well done, and you will never be bored watching this movie! It is strongly recommended to all action fans!
