I saw this movie in Sky Cinema not long ago ... I must admit, it was a really good western with two celebrities. On the one hand, there is Charlton Heston, playing the notorious and retired lawyer Samuel Burgadet, On the other hand ... The late James Coburn, playing the villainous Zack Provo ... eager to get revenge on Burgade, no matter how much it costs! Most of the actors played it really well .. Especially James Coburn, whom I find that he was really evil in this film .. But that's how it was. <br /> <br /> Christopher Mitchum, who Iâ€™ve seen everywhere in other films ... Playing Hal Brickman ... I felt that his character was stupid, but he manages to get himself back together with Burgada to destroy the squad of Provo! <br /> <br /> In general, it was a great movie .. Very nice to watch .. Excellent account of the late Jerry Goldsmith .. <br /> <br /> A wonderful example of a Western person ..! 8 out of 10.
