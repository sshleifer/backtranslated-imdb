This is a really good and enjoyable movie that the whole family can enjoy. We are talking about two dogs and a cat that are being led away for some time to live with someone else, but the animals do not understand, and they run away and are looking for a family themselves. The cat's name is Sassy, ​​and she lives up to her name. Chance is the youngest dog who knows a lot about life inside the pound. Shadow is an older and wiser dog that senses things. Put these three together in an adventure, and it makes the time happy and fun. No special effects of mouth movement occur, so it’s not stupid at all. This is the best talking animal film I've ever seen. This is a really good movie for families.
