This movie is one of my favorites. This is a genre blend with comedy / horror / romance ingredients. Some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards. This minor flaw is easily ignored. There are so many interesting things in this story. The romantic relationship between the two protagonists is so beautiful that it hurts. The visual effects are beautiful too. The action is excellent, which is not surprising, it comes from Hong Kong, the birthplace of the best militants in the world. Humor sometimes seems a little silly, but in a good way. Somehow this film is able to balance different moods and continues to be good. Absolutely recommended.
