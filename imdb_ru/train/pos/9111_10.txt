"Captain de Abril" is very good. The story is not a documentary about the revolution of 1974 in Portugal. But it gives us an idea of ​​how it was. Fiction is not of great interest, but it does not spoil the film. Captain Salgeira Maya’s heroic actions are not an exaggeration, and the film is also a tribute to his actions. Captain Salgueiro Maya remains one of the greatest heroes of the revolution on April 25th. <br /> <br /> All the actors are very good, and even the smallest roles are perfectly performed. Lisbon looks more beautiful than ever. Do not miss! I really liked this movie.
