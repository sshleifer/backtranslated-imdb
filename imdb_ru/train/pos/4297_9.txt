From time to time, the director creates a unique group of people and lets you see what makes us human. Lawrence Casden did it again. I always felt that Big Cill was the anthem of his age, and he managed to do it again in the Grand Canyon. From time to time we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life, and very often we destroy it. This is a film about people who have the courage to choose and experience life thanks to this choice. Comparing small and large events that allow us to see how trivial most things we worry about is really ingenious. I watched this film several times and I am constantly amazed at how deep emotions pervade this film. Danny Glover and Kevin Klein play their roles with great affection, and Sver Martins as a film performer is invaluable. Thanks again Mr. Casden
