I read a lot of negative reviews about this film and finally got a chance to see it on DVD. Honestly, I really do not know what the problem is with him. <br /> <br /> This is a worthy mysterious thriller, shown from different points of view, from an eccentric cast, often attributed to potential murderers / suspects, including the late King, porn, John Holmes. Please read the plot synopsis to find out the exact details of the plot of the film - I want to contribute to the review, not the synopsis. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have gone so far as to give this film the lowest rating due to violence, but I really don’t see it. MANY modern films were worse off - “Rescue Private Ryan” was ultimately more brutal than this film, which often relies on supposed blood stains, than on real brutal murders (the murders depicted in this film were made, after all, from lead pipes). <br /> <br /> I was delighted with both halves of the film - the first showing of John Holmes as a hopeless addict, hungry for money, and the second half showed his side as a minor conspirator in a meaningless bloodbath. The film is an excellent acting game, although Dylan MacDemorant looks more than inappropriate in his biker style and goat character of the bad guy. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was also awesome - a fantastic mix of 70s Rock and Blues and an incomprehensible pop that spreads for several hours in all the right places, like night boogie-woogie.
