I just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of famous black artists ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, which was white), Thomas "Fats" Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson Stepin Fetchit ( despite this) Louis Armstrong and the girls from the choir came out of the famous "Cotton Club" in Harlem. True ... there are stereotypes, but it was so ... and these cartoons were conceived as entertainment for adults in your local cinema before the main role. <br /> <br /> Harmann & Ising cartoons were more “attractive” and more upscale (after all ... we are talking about MGM) than standard animations made in Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox RKO or humble Colombia. Even very early Mickey Mouse Disney had a lot of humor before Uncle Walt scrubbed him out before he started playing Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Disney had cartoons with caricatures of black artists ... for example, the 1937s Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe". But we must remember that these films are part of a certain time and place. After 50 years ... the clips of The Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park will also be carefully studied, analyzed ... and even convicted by future viewers.
