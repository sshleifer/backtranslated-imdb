This is one of those iconic films that should be shown in the context of time. Darkness in Tallinn was lifted in 1993. It was a period of chaos, confusion and unrest, not only for ordinary people in Estonia, but also for countless citizens. other former nations that were part of the mighty Soviet empire. In such a tense situation, a young country was born named Estonia. It is known that the newly created governments face problems with teething, Estonia also faced many problems, as some corrupt officials manipulated the state's mechanism to fill their dirty pockets using their selfish means. This is one of the main themes of this film. Darkness in Tallinn looks like an Estonian film, but it was shot by a Finnish director Ilka JÃ¤rvilaturi. He tried his best to instill as many doses of Estonian humor as possible. That is why it can be called a comedy film with political overtones. Since ordinary people are involved in this film, we can say that this film means good against evil. This is not a new concept, as it is easily available in most religious books of different faiths. The darkness in Tallinn shows us how corrupt people can also overthrow ordinary governments. Beautiful movie that can be watched on a sunny day.
