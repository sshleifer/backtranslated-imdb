The essence of the story is simple: an elderly man, living alone in the forest, accidentally encounters the murder of a small child and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred. Although there are very few dialogues in the film, the visual narration told by only one eye of the camera made the film quite attractive. The setting of the gray forest conveys a feeling of loneliness that complements the calmness of the characters themselves. We can also sense helplessness in the old man’s inability to convince the police of the murder, which is similar to the inability of a child with a silencer to tell his own story. <br /> <br /> The real horror lies in feelings of hopelessness, helplessness and irrationality. This film successfully examines these elements only through visual effects, rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and blood that other bad horror films use when the narration is weak. <br /> <br /> Cleverly, the story unfolds at a slow pace to increase the tension by a few creepy and striking moments. The ending is also unexpected and believable. Resembling Japanese horror films such as The Ring and Dark Water, or English horror films such as The Lady in Black and The Innocent, this film provides viewers with a feeling of a real horror atmosphere. I recommend trying this movie to anyone who is chilling to the bone. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you haven’t seen the films I just mentioned, you might want to give them. attempt also.
