Fay Grim is a real example of what I call a complete puzzle movie. It has all the parts of the action, the direction, the storyline and the entertainment value. They all fit together, and when this is done, a masterpiece of Fay Grim is created. <br /> <br /> This film is about a single mother, Fay Grim, who is trying to raise her son so that he does not grow up to become her father, who ran away from the law and went missing. Soon the CIA contacts Fay in a desperate effort to find 8 magazines for her husband, Henry. These magazines were filled with confessions of his long-standing past at the CIA and his involvement in countries and their government actions. Fei goes in search of these magazines, in exchange for the release of her brother from prison, and goes in pursuit of a cat and mouse throughout Europe to find these magazines and learn about the hidden secrets of the past of their husbands, which she never knew. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey was already an actress who I liked after I watched her at Ohio in Ohio and Best in Show. She brought liveliness to these two of her comedic roles, but Fay Grim was very different from the other two films. Posey made me believe what was happening on the screen, I felt for her, I was rooting for her, and I wanted to know more. She grabs you while she is on the screen, and when she is off, you can't stop thinking about what is happening to her. <br /> <br /> I have not seen other previous works by writer / director Hal Hartley, but I believe that I will watch some of his earlier films if they are half worse than Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> If you decide to make a smart choice of a movie the next time you decide to rent a movie or buy a DVD, I strongly recommend that you choose Fei Grim. If you have common sense about how a movie should be, you will love this movie.
