WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS is, in my opinion, a very touching and heartbreaking drama about the consequences of anorexia or bulimia. Every time Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) was vomited, I wanted to vomit. It is difficult to explain why. If you ask me, they should have been more willing to cooperate. Nevertheless, I really liked to see how they do something together, and parents give lectures. Before I finish, I would like to say: "If you ask me WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS, it really shows you how anorexia or bulimia can affect a person's body." Now in conclusion, I recommend this film to everyone not see it. Tears and a good time are waiting for you, so the next time he appears on TV, talk to a friend and watch him.
