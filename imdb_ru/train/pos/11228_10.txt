It is short and to the point. Writing the story used for Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. Act across the map, but the main characters over the years seem to have worked to improve their skills. It is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will end in mid-May 2007. <br /> <br /> I will not rephrase what has already been said about sets and graphics. Considering that these are all volunteers, without profit, this is pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> If it was evaluated as a professional production, I would have to give 5 for a good story, but terrible sets. However, as a fan production, I have to give him an excellent rating, with the exception of a few other efforts, this is a separate league. As for volume, I do not think it was matched. Congratulations to the cast and crew with the efforts that many admire.
