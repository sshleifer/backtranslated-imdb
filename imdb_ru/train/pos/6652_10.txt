I saw the film and really could not stop my tears. The tragedy is that in India there are no leaders after freedom who dare to give credit to their own children when they do not behave properly. In the current generation, politicians bring their children to politics, without measuring their caliber and skills. Gandhi dialogue "What kind of society do we want to create / create with such people (about Harilal)?" Einstein was right when he spoke about Gandhi that â€œafter 50 years, one can hardly believe that such a person with the body, soul and mind of Gandhi) ever lived on this earth. I sincerely want to thank Anil Kapoor, Feroz-Khan and all the film actors / actresses for this wonderful film about a great man and relationship with his son. All father and son should watch this movie once and take several lessons for both roles.
