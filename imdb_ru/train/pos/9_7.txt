The working-class romantic drama from director Martin Ritt is as incredible as they are, but there are moments of pleasure, mainly due to the charisma of the stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both awesome). She is a widow who can not move on, she is illiterate and the inventor of the cabinets - you probably guess the rest. Adaptation of Pat Union Borker's novel "Union Street" (a more appropriate title!) So unconstrained that it borders on politeness, and film editing is a mess, but it is still pleasant; pink fantasy. There is no confidence in serious problems (even the angle of illiteracy is just a tool for the plot of the subsequent love story) and there are no real fireworks, although the characters are intentionally a little colorless, and the role of the characters is softened to an interesting degree. The final is pure fluff - and it will be difficult for cynics to swallow them - although these two characters deserve a happy ending, and the picture will not really be satisfactory. *** from ****
