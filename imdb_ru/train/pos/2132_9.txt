The cast really makes this pleasant surprise a pleasant surprise that has surpassed the usual type of Hollywood love affair / comedy about Shutbol: man-woman-argument-all-time-but-wind-love. <br /> <br /> I usually don’t go to movies of this type and this tedious storyline, but this one was refreshing, fun to watch and oozes with charm. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play each other well and make a very beautiful pair. The cast is outstanding - from always cute Felix Bressar to the villain Joseph Schildkraut. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in my career. He takes the film and turns it into a completely different mood for a while, when something dramatic happens to him. This “twist” is another reason why this film is superior to others of its kind. <br /> <br /> Once again, when a film has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds. This is a great example of this. In this film, this is romance, comedy and drama, and it is well done. I'll take it for messing up “You got mail” any day. No comparison
