Many of these other viewers complain that the storyline has already been undertaken. This may be so, but adding a narrator and Dr.Suess as a landscape makes this show a must-see. With adult innuendo throughout the series and a light touch of childhood on the set, the show reminds and invigorates. The research part of the show is not what attracts viewers. The crooked plot and love lines scattered throughout this seeming paradise is what makes the loyal viewers come back for more. This is a success that ABC should never let go of. Bravo ABC. LOST was getting older, a way to liven up prime time. 9 episodes before the screenwriters strike, left the audience to want more.
