I heard about Eddie Izzard, but I never saw him in action. I knew that he was a transvestite, and when I saw that he was on HBO one evening last summer, I put it on, not knowing how my husband would react. Well, he blew us away. He's better than Robin Williams has ever been. He completely controls the audience; when he performs "Englebert is dead - no, he is not," the routine, the public does not know what to think by the end. “God as James Mason” is also an inspired touch, and his version of the Spanish Inquisition Python, performed by the Anglican Church, “Cake or Death?” Is priceless. After that, we watched TV shows for several months to see him again, and we were lucky to record it the next time he appeared. If you have the opportunity to see this show, cancel everything and tape it, you will not be disappointed.
