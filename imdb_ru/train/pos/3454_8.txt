First of all, I'm not a Justin Timberlake fan who is obsessed with making him look good, in fact I'm not even a big Justin fan, but I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I’m working on a video store, and when I saw this film with its huge line-up, which I hadn’t even heard of, I had to see what it was about. I didn’t find that Justin was behaving so badly, it was the worst in the group, but this is quite an impressive group, Cary Elvis and Dylan McDermott - these are two names that didn’t even get on the first list of credits. This story is simple, a journalist reveals corrupt police officers, but I found it well done. L L Cool J's character was clearly controversial, but I honestly did not know what he would do in the end. Morgan Freeman, as always, the wise figure of a mentor, he copes so well, and no matter how much I love Kevin Spacey, he was like there. His character did not have much essence, but this is Kevin Spacey, he cannot be mistaken. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I thought that Dylan McDermott showed himself to be a murderous police officer. Truly believable and truly characteristic, he scared me a couple of times. <br /> <br /> I really expected that, to be honest, there would be a lot of fun. Terrible flashy phrases, unwarranted sequences of actions and the like, but it was surprisingly well done, and I did not find anything like that. Each shooting had its own point of view, it was not cliché, rather solid. <br /> <br /> Overall, a terrific cast, a decent story that interested me, and enough action to make me jump. I don’t know why it didn’t appear in cinemas, it was better than some rubbish that I saw on the big screen. I would say it's worth a look.
