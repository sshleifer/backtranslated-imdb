This is an amazing 1936 film. Although the first hour is not very interesting (for the modern viewer), the stylish vision of 2036, which comes after the words, compensates for this. However, do not plan that you will be able to understand the entire dialogue - the sound quality and accents (this is American - but the American “1930s”) make it difficult. A 100-year-old look at the fictional American city called Everytown. It covers the period from 1936, when war is on the horizon, until 2036, when technology is rapidly developing and creating its own problems. <br /> <br /> The first hour is a bit slow - although it's hard to say which audience would have thought then. Events, expectations and visual effects are quite modest in modern conditions. However, when it comes to the future, it's just fun to watch. It is hard to surpass the large scenery and sci-fi retro style. <br /> <br /> If you do not have good listening abilities, this film is difficult to listen to. I think I understood only 80% of the dialogue. He can use hidden subtitles. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of science fiction, this is one of the classic genres that is worth seeing (at least after the first hour). For the average viewer, wait until the version with captions appears, and then watch it if you are satisfied with films from this period.
