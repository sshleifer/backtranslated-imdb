I read a little about Che before watching this movie, and you want to know something, he was a real hero for people, because he wanted to see equality for everyone and hated what oppressive forces did to his people like everyone else Hispanics in general! Now I do not know about the others, but for me he did the right thing, wanting socialism so that everyone should pay their fair share. However, a powerful elite was clearly not going to go for it. Thus, instead of understanding what Che Hever wanted, they were forced to kill him, trying to suppress the revolution. It did not work, as there were too many of his other followers, who took only what he had stopped. A good example of this - Castro continued his leadership in Cuba. As I understand it, and, as Che said before his death: “If you kill me, that's fine. But you only kill a person, you NEVER kill the cause! ”I could not say it better than myself. <br /> <br /> But ... In any case .... that is why I give this film 7 out of 10.
