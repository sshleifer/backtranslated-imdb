The movie "Torrent" was the first and the last for Greta Garbo. It was her first American film at MGM, the only US studio she ever worked for. It was also the last time someone billed credit because her lead man was her Ricardo Cortes. <br /> <br /> At the heart of Torrent lies the work of the famous Spanish writer Vicente Blasco Ibanes Entre Naranjos. This applies to a pair of unmatched lovers, Garbo and Cortes, who cannot quite get together, mainly due to the machinations of the mother of Cortez, Martha Mattox. <br /> <br /> Mattox is an evil woman who has certain ideas about who her son should marry. Remember that this is Spain, and such contractual marriages were even appropriate in those times. Mattox thinks of Gertrude Olmsted as a daughter-in-law, she is the offspring of Mac Swain, a man who became rich in breeding pigs. Swain provides a few moments of comic relief with his tender care for the pigs before they turn into big old pigs that need to be cut. <br /> <br /> Blasco Ibanes had previous novels The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and Blood and Sand, previously shot with Rudolf Valentino in the lead role. It might have been interesting if Valentino had done it with Garbo, but he could have been outside of filming when it was done. In any case, one of Valentino's imitators, Ricardo Cortes, plays the main role. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons Valentino may not have wanted this film is because the main character is clearly Garbo, unlike the other two previously mentioned works. When Cortez commits suicide, she does what Mattox and her “advisor” banker Tully Marshall tell her, she leaves Spain and goes to France, where she becomes a great opera star. And there leads a rather scandalous life. <br /> <br /> When she returns to Spain and tries to rekindle things, Mattox is even more indignant. She has a political career for her son. Cortez is currently running for the Spanish Parliament, which, oddly enough, is called Cortes. <br /> <br /> The name refers to the flood and the destruction of the dam, causing all kinds of destruction in the countryside. In fact, Cortez stands torrent in a rowboat, trying to save Garbo from evil. When they get together, they lead a frankly frank discussion, cruelty comes from Garbo. <br /> <br /> Special effects here, primitive, although they seem now, are quite remarkable for their time. They are very similar to the shots used in Fox’s 20th-century film “The Rain Has Come”, released in 1939 and won an Oscar for special effects. Unfortunately for Torrent, this happened a year before Oscar debuted. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to finish anything, so you’ll have to watch a movie to see if Cortez and Garbo get together at the end. Garbo rightfully received enthusiastic reviews of her work, and in an era when exaggerated gestures were the norm in a silent game on the screen, she was surprisingly thin in her role. So she will remain for the rest of her career, she will have a wonderful face for close-ups. <br /> <br /> Although Greta Garbo will do a much better job than Torrent, this film is still a worthy debut for her. American big screen and very well withstand today's audience.
