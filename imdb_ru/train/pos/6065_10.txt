This film is terrible - in the sense of "so bad, it's good." <br /> <br /> The storyline is rephrased from many other films of this kind that I won't even describe it. This is an image of a sword / witchcraft, where the child hopes to understand how important he is in this world, he has a “nomadic” adventurer, an evil mate / sorcerer, a princess, a hairy creature .... br /> <br /> The first time I saw this film was very harsh in winter. I don't know why I decided to keep watching it for another five minutes before switching the channel, but when I caught the Gulfax site, I decided to stay and watch it to the end. <br /> <br /> Gulfax is a white fluffy creature, similar to Chewbacca, but not so useful or interesting to see. He looks like someone glued a bunch of white carpet and made the actor put it on. There are scenes where the actor cannot move inside or almost falls. Although he is not so much in the film, several scenes are worth it! See how he tries to talk to Bo Swenson, bringing the Solo-Chewbacca comparison to an even higher level! <br /> <br /> I actually bought this film just because of this character, and he still has somewhere! <br /> <br /> Gulfax may look like shit, but he made this movie !!! The only reason I never saw the sequel, or even looked for it, was because of his absence! Perhaps in the event of the release of the final film, the final trilogy, "Gulfax" will make a very expected return!
