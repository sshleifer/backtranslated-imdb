The woman gave birth to a boy to this world and was left alone. They were both alone, because the boy had a gift and a curse in one package - he was able to pull the sword out of his hand. The reason for this "gift" has always been a wound on his wrist - the wound of the most deadly weapon inside his body. First, he kills his constantly drunk stepfather, who every time hurts his mom. Then he grows up and decides to find his real father. It's as easy as all the time for a superhero - he achieves justice ... but society decides that this justice is not needed and dangerous, which is really correct, because in Hollywood films the hero does not try to kill anyone - Sasha (he is the main character, which is played by Artyom Tkachenko) kills if a person who, in his opinion, deserves death, but receives guilt from the authorities and runs away. In such an escape from the authorities and the mafia, he meets a girl (played by Chulpan Khamatova) and falls in love with her. Everything else needs to be watched ... not told. Know that this film is more about feelings and emotions, but not about actions. This film is full of the pain of the main character, full of him and his vision of life.
