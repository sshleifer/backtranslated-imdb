What makes us move — or at least the fact that, in my opinion, the author wanted us to glue us together at an early stage — is our desire to find out if Martenot did the dirty work. Without much damage, of course, there is a red herring and a twist. But then we discover that this is a story about Martino’s imperfection and his difficulties in overcoming it. When there is a revelation, we begin to sympathize and pity him, because as history progresses, we begin to think that he is a sick, perverted pedophile, whom we are prone to keep in mind. One of the things he has to cope with is the remote gap that he and his wife have, although they live on the same roof. These problems, of course, are given their outcome in the shocking finale of the film. <br /> <br /> This film requires your patience, and he definitely felt the anxiety of adolescents sitting in the back. They were obviously damn good, because they are not addicted to films about "central location." Although there is little travel when we get to the forest and the beach. And we understand that Gallien is not as smart as we think he is. <br /> <br /> Inquisitor 5/5
