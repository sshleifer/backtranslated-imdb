Using a special telescope, Dr. Janos Ruch (Boris Karloff) successfully proves that many years ago a meteorite landed in Africa containing an unknown but extremely powerful element. Dr. Benet (Bela Lugosi) forms an expedition led by Rukh to find the element. Suddenly, Ruch discovered “Radium X”, even more powerful than radium, and very radioactive, and Karloff becomes infected and can kill anyone just by touching them. Sparks really fly between Lugosi and Karloff in this classic science fiction film in the era after World War II. Directed by Hiller used several permanent sets from the series “FLASH GORDON”, which were filmed at the same time, and also inserted several videos of electric cars from Frankenstein. "Universal" kept the public in the dark about the special effects that are used in this great classic film. Karloff and Lugosi were at their best, and they both loved working together and would enjoy future generations.
