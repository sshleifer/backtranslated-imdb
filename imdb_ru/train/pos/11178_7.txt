Small spoiler <br /> <br /> The underrated little shocker of Stephen King. He’s not perfect, no matter what, even if Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby’s sluggish speeches were better, there would still be inept elements of mystical history that need to be fought. The old burial ground of Mikmak, the incurably sick sister of Rachel, and Jacob-Marley - Victor Pascoe never unite into something connected, and in places the film seems confused and overcrowded. But few horror films are really perfect, and the fact that this may be lacking in other areas compensates for his willingness to shock. “Pet Sematary” may be one of the most violent horror films of late, with his murderous zombie child and the insanely insensitive image of Zelda. It is politically wrong, it is tasteless, it is free - and yet it makes us wriggle out of disgust in ways that “safer” horror films can never. Add to this one of the best performances of Fred Gwynn and the witty leadership of Mary Lambert, and you will have a very satisfying scary movie - even with the end of hockey. Highly recommended for fans of the genre. 7.5 out of 10.
