The Scorpion Tail case is a very stylish hyallo, directed by Sergio Martino, who seems to be a hyallo master, second only to Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this fabulous devil, a rather complicated, but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining mysterious murder. It also makes sense at the end, a big plus, because this is not always the case for these giallo, as they tend to increase confidence with their endless red herrings and final decisions. Here, the less you know about the plot, the better. <br /> <br /> The pure giallo trademarks are represented here: beautiful cinematography, catchy music, gorgeous girls (Anita Strindberg is a goddess), brutal murders, black-skinned killers and outright sex scenes are just a few. <br /> <br /> In most cases this is decent, Gorgon Hilton is usually courteous, and others succeed. Martino directs a confident hand, holds things tight and atmospheric with some stunning scenery. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of hyallo, this is a must see. If you like well-written and intense thrillers in general, this is highly recommended.
