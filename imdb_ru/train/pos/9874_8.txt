In this 1943 film, Judy Garland is not yet considered to be ready for a big time by a man who loves her - Van Heflin. This film was certainly a big change for Mr. Heflin, especially after he supported Oscar last year in the movie "Johnny Eager." <br /> <br /> Wasnâ€™t Spring Byington too old to become a widowed mother of 5 children with four of them looking like their grandchildren? <br /> <br /> Singing and dancing are simply amazingly staged, but the way the flowering romance between Heflin and Garland was depicted left much to be desired. It was a Gigi-like one, where a young girl was eventually swept from her feet by a charmer.
