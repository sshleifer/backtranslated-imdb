The magnetism emitted by Elvira, which attracts her legions of loyal fans, has an original quality. With her long, well elastic figure, big bust, harmless mischievous attitude and lexicon with a griffon bag from the valley slang of my generation, the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and a person deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is obvious that the character Elvira has certain archetypal elements that help make the character more than the sum of her banal one-liners and large breasts. Based on how the children of the city react to her, she represents a deep young fantasy for an experienced woman who can connect with them at their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic anguish, boyish sexual attraction and desire for carefree fun. It symbolizes the undeveloped ideal of femininity, honed for boys, and the source of strength for urban girls. Other adults have problems with it for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film cannot pass by more restrained ingredients. The end result is that, although Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak the showcase is for her talents. Almost everything is adapted for adolescent thinking, and although it is a simple comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy this nonsense. Fortunately, I have this ability, and I found the film to be charming. <br /> <br /> Best quote: Bob Redding: How is your head? Elvira: I had no complaints.
