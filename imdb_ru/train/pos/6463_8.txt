This is one of those films that you constantly think about when you wake up the next morning. It will give you that warm, indistinct feeling and leave you with a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Of course, we are fed typical stereotypical characters and stories, but it really helps: to entertain. <Br /> <br /> Being in Sweden and living in the USA for a long time, we have a funny reaction. “A dead husband will kill him,” “She (Gabriella) will die, and then there will be a heartbreaking finale, exceeding life.” We know how it all works, in the end everything comes together. And it did. The characters were somewhat simple, they were so thoughtful that you didn’t think about it, nothing was left for your own imagination. The closest one will probably be Siv, she forces you to ask yourself if she really was in love with Daniel, but that's all. <br /> <br /> But the film is beautiful, made in the countryside of Norrland, the music is just awesome and the characters are attractive. Michael Nyquist is truly a genius with his crazy unique look, and Frida Hallberg is charming and accessible. Maybe too cute. <br /> <br /> But most of all this film makes you feel, and this is the most important thing. You cry, laugh, hate and identify yourself. I don't know about you guys, but this happens less often.
