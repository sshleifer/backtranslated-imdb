I think this is a great version, I came here earlier to help me find which version I should use, and I went to Jane Eyre in 1983 and read the comment from user comments and then helped me get this version. I do not regret choosing this version, just like you. I tried to look at all the other versions, and none of them fit this. There is nothing like a book, and TRUST FOR ME, if you are reading a book, you want something that will fit it. When you are looking for something real and moving after reading a book, it is difficult, because you want something that will fit this. I would say that God personally led me to this version. This indicates true love for people. I would say that God's love is stronger. If there is something better, I would like to see it. but so far there is no such!
