A horror film is being shot, and things are not going very well. It's about the killer in the mask. The director shoots the killer in front of the actors and the crew. He goes crazy and kills two people. He killed himself, and the film never ends. Twelve years later, a bunch of filmmakers decide to try to finish, but there is a curse. People who are trying to finish it themselves are killed. Students ignore this. Guess what will happen next? <br /> <br /> The plot is an old hat, but it's not bad ... for what it is (low budget slasher). This is well done with a young and rather talented young cast. No one is great, but no one is terrible. It also avoids the obligatory (and unnecessary) female nude scenes. He moves fast, the blood is good and bloody, and the script does not offend your mind. In addition, Molly Ringwald plays this harsh faded actress. <br /> <br /> No good shocks, but not bad. I give him 7.
