I went to Wal-Mart and found this movie on DVD, and had no idea if I made a bad purchase or a good one. This is a later result of my viewing of the entire movie from beginning to end. Michelle Rodríquez (Diana Guzman), "BloodRayne", '05, performed well, and her appearance is beautiful, sexy and at the same time is a true exploration of the art of how acting is actually performed. Diana did not like her home life, and especially her own father for abusing her mother. She decides to undergo boxing training at a local Brooklyn gym and is not well received by male boxers. There is a lot of disagreement between her classmates and the guys in her school. In the women's room a lot of action and links to the personal details of the guys. If you love boxing and see how hot sexy girl does wonders in the ring and knocks guys on their “You Know What,” this movie is for you.
