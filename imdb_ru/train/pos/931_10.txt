I like all versions of this story, but this one is my favorite. George S. Scott gives depth to the character of Scrooge, which others do not. The film shows more about why it becomes so bitter. Changes to Scrooge appear gradually when he encounters various ghosts and incidents that they show him. <br /> <br /> In this film, the best Tiny Tim. He is the right age, not the one who is played by almost a teenager, as in other films. Anthony Walters still has all or most of his milk teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner is wonderful, like Bob Kratchit. He is such a versatile actor. He portrays a man who clearly loves his family. He plays the role with dignity, not as a stupid man shrinking under Scroogeâ€™s thumb, but as a man who gracefully puts up with it because he has a family to provide. Suzanne York and other actors do an excellent job of reviving the characters. Edward Woodward is the best ghost of the Christmas present I've ever seen. Most often he is played as a cheerful Santa Claus character. In this, he shows anger at Scrooge's relationship and really forces Scrooge to reconsider. <br /> <br /> Costumes and scenery really enliven Dickens London. Great movie.
