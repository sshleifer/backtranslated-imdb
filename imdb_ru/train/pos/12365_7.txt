I am surprised that no one has yet mentioned that there are two versions of this film. The lion's share of the footage is identical in both cases, but here they differ: in one version (the version I most often saw on broadcast television) the group of clergymen guarding the gates consists of the Brotherhood of Defenders. a (fictional) splinter group of priests and brothers “excommunicated” by the Church. In another version, which I saw only once on TV, the clergy who guard the gates are depicted as priests of the official Church, that is, the archdiocese of New York (or, possibly, Brooklyn). In addition, in the previous version, in most of the relevant scenes, clergymen are referred to as “brothers” (and in some scenes you can see where the lips say “Father”, but the dubbed sound says “Brother” is this.) I believe everyone is called the "father." In any case, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less partial re-shooting of the other, with all the scenes of the Fellowship of Defender, re-shot as scenes “Archdiocese”, or vice versa (the view reminds me of Raymond Berr's clippings “Godzilla.”). I’ve filmed both versions on television, so no, I don’t imagine it. Can anyone shed some light on the history of these two versions of the film?
