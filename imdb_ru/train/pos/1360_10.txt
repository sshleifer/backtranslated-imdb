This is one of the most favorite films of all times. Parker Posey's character is too enthralling, and the librarianâ€™s motive will not be lost to anyone who has ever worked in the world of books and books. <br /> <br /> If you are a student of a library, RENT THIS. Then buy a poster and hang it on the wall. Soundtrack is also highly recommended. I showed this film to more library friends than anyone else - they all fell in love with it.
