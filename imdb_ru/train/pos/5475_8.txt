Finally, the uncut version of the Baby Face surfaces and from which source? Library of Congress. Recovered four minutes, fragments here and there, make the film much better. Now we know that Baby Face was a pimp from his old man when she was at least fourteen years old. Another reason - her behavior and cold, prudent appearance. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwick is truly amazing in the role of Lily Powers (note the nickname), a role that only required the right amount of sexuality. covered with power, cunning and revenge, but with a touch of virgin excuse, when it is required, it is very difficult to portray convincingly. Barbara Stenvik conveys the necessary nuances to show that, although she sleeps on her way to the top (literally), she still has a kind heart - pay attention to how she treats those few who have been kind to her. as Chico (amazing actress Teresa Harris) and the old philosopher. And although she uses her sexuality to make herself men who are rich and powerful, the same men try to use her for their carnal desires without the intention to maintain permanent connections until they fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> Lily Powers at first does not understand that it is difficult to ride on emotions, that it is easy to lose control. One possible outcome is death. To fasten a wagon to a star, of course, materialism can lead it to a destination where nothing exists except the ephemeral, and this is a cold, solitary place. <br /> <br /> A few words should be said about the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, whose will to power is emphasized in the “Little Face” by an elderly philosopher who became friends with Lilly when she is still deceiving her old man. "Baby Face" was released the same year that Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Although it is unlikely that the half-literate Hitler understood a lot about Nietzsche, he considered himself a N-th degree Nietzschean and advertised him along with his other verbal statements. “Children's Face” serves as an indictment of the popular interpretation of the concept of Nietzsche’s will to power, especially in the final scenes. <br /> <br /> Although "You have the cutest little baby face." By the way, as a theme for “Baby Face”, the “St. Louis Blues” WC Handy is even more expressive and applicable to the melody, played throughout the entire film, especially in cases where the camera should move away from what was otherwise would be frankly sexy. The "St. Louis Blues" is also used wisely towards the end, as Lily begins to see beyond materialism to eternal values. Chico sings a raw, obscene version of "St. Louis Blues" when Lily, now disagreeing with the lyrics, orders her to stop. <br /> <br /> Restored version of "Children's Face" makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude to sex as a power than in many new Hollywood releases. Be sure to watch this gem from the distant past and enjoy.
