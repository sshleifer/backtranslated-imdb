In the afternoon, we brought the kids to the movies and saw Neil Guyman "Star dust", and all I can say is "Wow!". <br /> <br /> Rarely something stuns me, but this is perhaps the greatest fantasy movie. I've ever seen, maybe even the best movie of any kind, and Neil Gaiman is to blame for everything. <br /> <br /> Of course, I could be absorbed in a wonderful dialogue that was smart, smooth and smooth. characters are absolutely believable. <br /> <br /> I could talk about entertainment for a few days, Charlie Cox is perfect in the role of Tristan, Claire Danes is great in the role of Ivane, and Robert Dee Nero almost steals the film in the role of Deep in the film. Closed pirate captain Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Pure joy, caused by humor, who managed to laugh funny, laugh at us cleverly enough, so that the first Shrek looked like a sitcom of the 80s and perfectly fit into the rest of the movie would make this movie gorgeous. <br /> <br /> The effects were almost perfect, it wasn't LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza, but where they were used, they were exactly what was required, not too much to distract you from the film itself and perfectly fit into the story. <br /> <br /> Then is this a story? What can I say. How often do you come across a story containing all the components of a classic fairy formula that doesn’t just turn into another cheap fake princess of the bride. He manages to be familiar and comfortable, but at the same time completely new and refreshing. <br /> <br /> Any of these things would make this film good, all together they make it great, but they are pale compared to the rich charming world that these elements combine to make it good. Once again, Neil Guyman did this, he thrust another dagger into my heart, creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and charming that I would do almost everything to live in it, and only briefly looked at it. I didn’t want this to end, I wanted to be dragged through the maelstrom into the land of Stormhold and personally meet Tristan and Ivain, travel through its fields and valleys, stroll through its markets and meet its people, dangerous and friendly and stay there forever. It feels like I notice that when I read something from Guyman, Sandstone, American Gods, Coralines, it all makes me deeply sad, when I finish reading them because it's over, I couldn't see anything else in the worlds created by him, which seemed much more alive and alive than the one in which I was forced to live and watch the "Star Dust", were no different. <br /> <br /> In the end, I’m sure that Neil’s letter and this movie will not have the same effect for everyone, but believe me when I say that you won’t regret the time or time spent watching this movie. , it is easily included in the top five films that I have ever seen, and I can guarantee that anyone with a soul at least will like it.
