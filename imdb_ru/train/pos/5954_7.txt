I feel a mixture of mixing and varying degrees of personal taste in reactions to this film. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes. Even martial arts are stereotypes. Everything is good, of course, not everything is perfectly done. However, I feel that one important point in this film is lost sight of ... the cultural significance of its location. The film takes place in Pensacola, Florida, and he is not trying to avoid it. This is a bold step in the world of cinema today and a rare treat for fans of indie films. And indeed, this may not be the last. Pensacola is world famous as a naval city, a city of aviation, a city of lumber, and sometimes even a hotbed of political disputes. Rarely is it viewed as a growing city of cinema. But now everything is changing. More film companies are coming to shoot. And more and more locals in Pensacolia are discovering the power of cinema. This film is part of the growing trend of Indian films based in Pensacola, and many others are on the way. Pensacola makes a noise in the global cinematic community, and gradually the world is increasingly notice. Watch and listen, world. The Pensacans are coming. Like a virus.
