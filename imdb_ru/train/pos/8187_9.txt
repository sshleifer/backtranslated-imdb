Someone wonders that the Ood is strangely similar to the “Great Cthulhu” of the year H.P. Lovecraft? hmmm? <br /> <br /> An excellent pair of episodes (not related to Billie Piper, as most seem to do!) in Impossible Planet and Satan's Pit. <br /> <br /> Also a reference to “Legion” I also recall what was used in “Who before” and also “Satan” in various novels after the exorcist era ... <br /> <br /> Magnificent episodes with the unknown, using elements of fear and faith. A new team for those "who work wonders for television." <br /> <br /> This certainly creates new fears and feelings “hiding behind the couch,” which have not been for many, many years in this sequel to the excellent BBC series. (Sorry, this is confirmed by the BBC that Billie Piper is leaving - perhaps not forever - after the end of the series 2): O (((
