While others comment that this video is only an edited version of the two shows: “Fire in Space” and “Living Legend”, if you watch the original shows, you will find that the dialogue from this video publication has been edited. I found this video version much better because the scenes and lines were added to it. I would say if you want to see the show in the original version, watch the video version on VHS. They have more to offer to the fan than the original episodes offered on DVD now. Another good video is “The Conquest of the Earth,” in which there were more scenes from the 1980s Galaxy than the broadcasts themselves. Overall, I rate it as 10, because it gives you more pleasure than what the networks wanted to show in the time interval they gave to manufacturers.
