Late hit this show - I think it was the 3rd and last episode when I watched it for the first time - and was shocked by the social commentary that had not been on American television since All in the Family. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised, CBS would even launch it first. <br /> <br /> This simply means that the last time CBS had a “set” - if you understand what I mean - returned to the day “Everything is in the family.” The most controversial decision is they are ready to decide today how much eye makeup to put on Katie Couric <br /> <br /> If you want to make a bunch of people really, really crazy. - Let him discover the truth about himself. And if you want them to be ready to pull the strings, make calls and remove the work of art - let them discover this truth by hearing their own words spoken from their own mouths. <br /> <br /> People from Aardman have always been way ahead of the curve. And this show is no different. Somehow, he made his way under the CBS “corporate / social / political / censorship radar” to include it in the schedule (perhaps the “big medal” never watched it before it finally went on the air?), But once a good the “middle level” merica heard and saw itself as herself - well, you can argue with the farm that the message or the messenger will not last long. <br /> <br /> Now, if only “skipped episodes” can find their way to Usenet or a bit torrent ;-) <br /> <br /> Thanks, BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
