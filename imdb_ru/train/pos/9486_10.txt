Finally a thriller that skips car chases, explosions and other effects. The film combines a simple plot (the assassination of the French president) with excellent experience. He examines the behavior of men with the authorities and explains why we submit to almost every order (even murder) that will be given to us. <br /> <br /> In addition, he shows us how special services can manipulate the course of history and how difficult they can be managed. The best thing about this film is that there is no classic “Hollywood end” that can be easily predicted.
