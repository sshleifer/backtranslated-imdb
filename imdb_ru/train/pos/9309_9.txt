My God, where do I begin? This is not the best movie I've ever seen. camera angles are excellent, but, in my opinion, the game was the best. why the screenwriters of this film do not write big budget films, I will never understand. other cast. it is great. this is Ted Rayme's best movie there for sure. I know that some of you probably think: “No, he has nothing better,” but you are not mistaken. raptor island is a work of art. I hope that he should have had the best film of the year instead of this crappy film Crash without a group of names and predators. I believe that this film is truly the most wonderful thing ever.
