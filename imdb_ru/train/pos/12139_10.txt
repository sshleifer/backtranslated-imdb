This film, despite the fact that he is over 70 years old, is still a very touching and strong film. Bette Davis, like the depraved vicious waitress Cockney Mildred, is absolutely believable. Watching her performance is still mesmerizing. She makes the viewer completely despise her and pity her at the same time. The performance of Leslie Howard as a weak, obsessed Philip Carey is not as strong, but I don’t understand how any actor could stand up to the performance of Miss Davis. She chews landscapes in every scene she is in, completely turning over the show. This is a film that captured her fame, and she deserved an Oscar award, but lost. It was shocking for this day, that with themes about unmarried pregnancy, multiple sexual partners and the vicious language of Mildred, so this is somewhat outdated, but still a great movie. Just seeing the scene where Mildred tells Philip that she REALLY thinks about him (“You fucking dirty pig ...”) is still one of the greatest actors I've ever seen in a movie.
