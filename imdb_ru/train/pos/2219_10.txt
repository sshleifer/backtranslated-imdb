This film was a fascinating look at Creole culture and society, about which few people know. Two of my own children are the products of a paternal grandmother, whose father was a member of the Gens de Couleur Libre, and a black woman whose parents were former slaves. He married outside and against his culture and was cut off from his entire family, with the exception of one sister, who regretted the plight of her brothers; raising 8 children during the Great Depression of 1929; provide family food whenever she could. Of course, she secretly helped this family, fearing for her former intercourse. My daughter was fascinated by the film. We made it part of our library.
