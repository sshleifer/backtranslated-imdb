The busy Phillips staged both comedy and drama in one performance. Erica Christensen was good, but Bisi stole the show. It was a pleasant touch to the movie "Smokers", in which starred "Busy", and it was not so great. If Busy does not receive any nomination for this film, it will be a disaster. Forget Mona Lisa's smile, see Home Room.
