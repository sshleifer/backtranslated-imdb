Saw it as many times as he could before he left the stage. A delightful and interesting movie with some of my favorite stars. I only wish I could find it again! Of course, would buy / view if I could. Please, someone, return it. Fred McMurray was wonderful as a patriot during World War II, and his leading ladies, Joan Leslie and especially June Haver, were beautiful and charming. It was a musical, but also romantic, funny and intelligent. It was my favorite movie with June Haver, although I always liked her. Her dazzling smile illuminated the screen, and her beauty and talent was the merit of any film. The cast honors their individual roles. Well balanced and carefree movie; It is a pity that we liked it more!
