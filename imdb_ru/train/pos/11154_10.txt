In my opinion, this is one of the greatest films ever made in America, and he deserves every award he received and ranks among the top 100 AFIs (although he is shamefully too low on the top 250 IMDB list, only on # 183 as. Of this letter). If you like acting of the highest class (Voight and Hoffman is an excellent coincidence), well-drawn characteristics and inventive direction, editing and cinematography, you will love it as much as I do. Schlesinger paints a bright, always authentic picture of the scene of New York in the late 1960s, and many victims struggle to defeat personal demons and survive amid the immorality, poverty and hopelessness of 42nd Street in New York. <br /> <br /> The filmmaking methods used here brilliantly reflect the feeling of the underground cinematic movement (and the city) and are nothing short of dazzling. I saw a lot of ideas (including high-speed editing, processing off-screen memories, drug / travel episodes, and a cartoon face that appeared during the murder scene to convey fear and fear) stolen by other directors. br /> <br /> Relations between Joe and Ratso are treated in such a way that they can be considered as an unusually strong friendship or the presence of homosexual relationships. I think that the director coped with this subtle way in order not to cope with the censorship of time, but to concentrate his strength on the importance of a strong human connection in life, whether sexual or not. <br /> MIDNIGHT COUBA is a bold, touching film with a scale, influence and importance that has not lost a single impact in recent years, so if you havenâ€™t seen it yet, you really miss the true American classic. I recommend this movie to everyone. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10 out of 10.
