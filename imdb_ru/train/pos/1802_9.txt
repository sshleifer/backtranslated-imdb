Well, I saw this movie as a kid and really loved it. My parents never bought the film for me, but I think I will go and buy it now. I am a lover of up to 2000 animated films. Anyway, on the real review. <br /> <br /> What I liked: there was a real image of heaven and hell, one of the few that I saw in the animated films. Character development existed! In this film, it is easy to classify characters (i.e. Charlie is a selfish fool, Itch is cynical, but believes that Charlie, Carrif, is obviously a ruthless villain, etc.). I also liked King Gator's song. I always loved loud, annoying, bright guys. This song may have been random, but it was so much fun. Finally, the details of the animation were beautiful. You could say that Charlie was rude and all that, and the background was beautiful. <br /> <br /> What I didn’t like: the actual image of the sky: the way Charlie reacted to it, “no surprises,” made it really seem very boring. He denied a place in heaven, and in the end he must return to him anyway. I remember a few lines of certain songs, such as "... you can't keep a good dog alone," "... let's make music forever" and "... welcome to death," but I can't remember most of of them. Honestly, the songs were not so memorable. Angel Whippet: It is annoying, and that is the neck! AAA! <br /> <br /> WHAT PARENTS CAN NOT LIKE: during the movie some very scary (depending on the viewer) images of Hell are shown. Carface is pretty menacing. Beer is also implied, but not really DUBBED beer. Gambling is a key element in the film. The good guy is dying. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: I LOVE this film, even if sometimes it is a little forgotten. The scariest kids animations are always my favorites. It was created at a time when producers and writers were not afraid from time to time to frighten children. Currently, it would probably be rated PG. Children under the age of 8 (or children with minor disorders) should not watch this. Besides this, I give it a 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
