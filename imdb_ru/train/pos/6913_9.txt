As an actor in a public theater who works hard at this, but does not take acting skills too seriously, I am always surprised by those who regard him as great art. This film mercilessly turns the "acting craft", at the same time uttering many good laughter. <br /> <br /> On the set of the film, the actor playing in the style of Ham, like a dictator. When a dictator dies of a heart attack from too much drinking and eating, the actor is abducted and forced to play "part of the life" of the neo-Nazi secret service head. He plays the handle, makes the dictator's girlfriend fall in love with him and vice versa, and beautifully turns the tables on his captors. <br /> <br /> A lot of great reasons, a lot of good work, some unknown support actors, especially the home staff and two members of the palace guard, and funny little cameos abound. Sammy Davis Jr. clarifies himself, Jonathan Winters plays the half-working American businessman with something else, and Raul Julia, Sonya Braga and, above all, Richard Dreyfus are exceptional. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid film, but there are many beautiful places (in Brazil), a humorous script and good actors who do their job and look as if they really have fun and they donâ€™t experience the usual existential anxiety That is only a game action!
