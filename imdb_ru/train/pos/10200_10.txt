Everything I hear about how poorly done the animation is. This may not be what everyone expects, but look at it this way. Do you expect perfection in hell? I believe that the animation was made dry and sandy on purpose. It was great to see the transformation of her character in this film, given that he is likely to be as close to live action as we ever get. I hope to continue very soon. If we want live action, I think we might be better off with Chastity or Purgatori. I donâ€™t think that Lady Death will be well transported to the movies. But be that as it may, I personally think that all the skeptics in this film are DEAD. No pun intended.
