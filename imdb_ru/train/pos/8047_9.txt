I accidentally stumbled upon this film, and I really liked it. The character Timothy Basfield does not have redemptive qualities, and at some point Basfield and the star Meloni look at women passing by ... Taking Meloni at a parade is different from Basfield's. Janel Maloney is awesome ... She is very similar to Tea Leone, but the main difference here is that Janel really can ACT. Some very nice things in this movie, and they deserve your attention when they are on cable.
