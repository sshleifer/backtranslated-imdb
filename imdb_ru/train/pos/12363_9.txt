This Roman-Italian remake of the 1946 film with the same name in 1946 is uplifting early and does not allow us to go on the air. The story of a high school student (Federico Pitsalis) who cannot take her eyes off of a mysteriously beautiful young woman (she is played by the Dutch phenomenon Marushka Detmers), who lives next door to a school. One day he follows her, and his perseverance pays off. There is only one problem: she is engaged to a sketchy character (Riccardo de Torrebrun), who may or may not commit a heinous crime, and if he repents, he will probably be released by hitting his wrist. In addition, the young woman is a little “funny in the head,” and this is confirmed when we discover that she has met the father of the boy, who is a psychiatrist. Julia's emotional instability equals only her stunning sexual desires. Hot, hot, hot, from the very beginning, with beautiful heroes and amazing game from Detmers, which plays us like a yo-yo (as she does a boy) from scene to scene, with enough waiting so that we could not guess before even after - end. Available in versions R and X (!).
