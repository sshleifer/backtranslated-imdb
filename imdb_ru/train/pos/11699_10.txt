I have seen this film a dozen times, and itâ€™s awesome. But the only thing connected with this is that at the beginning there was too much talk about who is meeting with whom. I think it would be interesting to do a remake of this. But on the official website, they said that they would not redo it, because many people were saved by watching it. What happened to Patty Dunning now? She is a pretty good actress. She starred in several other films in the 70s and 80s, but we haven't heard anything about her since. I know for sure about Tom Rachford, who plays Jerry, works in bookkeeping at RD Films. But in general, I have to say that the series itself is similar to Left Behind, which has left the old school.
