Wrestlemania 14 is not often perceived as one of the great Wrestlemania, but I personally would put it in the top 5, if not in the top 3. There are so many wonderful things in it, and it really means the birth of the Relationship Era, which was the best era of WWE, in my opinion. At KBC, the heart of a lion, and the fact that he threw Austin the way he did it, was a pure class on his part. He has one of the hottest crowds you have ever seen, and JR and The King in their best ad! <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> 15 ?? Team battle royal hands-free popularity for returning LO I am not a fan of the royal battle, and this is another medium. It is very predictable, even when you see it for the first time, it is obvious that LO will win. Looking at Sunny for about 8 minutes definitely helps. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Light Heavyweight Championship <br /> <br /> Taka Michinoku | C | Vs Aguila. <br /> <br /> Taka suddenly appears with her entrance. Fast, high flying and very exciting. If these two had more time, they would surely tear off the roof with their belongings. Taka wins with the Michino rider. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> European Championships WWF. <br /> <br /> Triple H | C | Against Owen Hart Stinging, Chin is handcuffed to Slaughter. Good popularity for Owen, mixed reaction to travel. Indeed, a very underrated match, which is considered one of my favorites for Wrestlemania. They are very well mixed, and Owen can go with anyone. Thrips wins, with Chin's intervention. <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed tag. Mark Mero and Sable against Goldust and the Moon. The definition of pop music for Sable, unheard of for that time, for a woman. The sable actually looks hot, and the crowd just eats it! Constant Sable is chanting and they erupt almost every time she enters the ring. Not bad for a mixed tag, he had an entertaining trick, and he had a good time. Sable's team wins when Sable gets into technical knockout. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Championship. Ken Shamrock vs Rock | C |. Before I consider the match, I would like to point out that Rock demonstrated his great potential by interviewing Jennifer Flowers before his match. Good popularity for Shamrock, great heat for The Rock. Too disappointingly short, and I thought the final was pretty stupid, although Shamrock's pranks were amazing, and the crowd went crazy about it. Rock retains title when Ref cancels the decision. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Match on the wastebasket for the WWF Team Championship <br /> <br /> Catcus Jack & Terry Funk Vs New Age Outlaws. Outlaws are not so complete as they should have been at this time. The crowd is actually somewhat dead for this, but I thought that it had some great hardcore beats, with some sick-looking bumps. Cactus and Terry win titles. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs. Kane. Big ovation for the Undertaker. Much better than Wrestlemania 20, and for a big man against a big man it was really good. It was a huge fight when the Undertaker was sneaking through the table nauseous bump. WWE was smart, making Kane look strong even after losing. After two strokes of the tombstone, Tucker finally removes him from the third. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Special guest Enforcer "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Against Steve Austin. Great heat for Tyson. Crowd really likes Austin, definitely one of the biggest pops I've heard. Mixed reaction, for HBK. This is a really special contest, one of the greatest main events in reenderation in history, which you can tell when J.R is even choking. KBC gives him everything that should have been his last match, and Austin was rarely better. The hostility and electricity in the crowd are just awesome, and it's as exciting as it turns out. Austin wins with stunning, with Tyson joining 3:16, knocking out Michaels. Austin's holiday victory, it's a wonder to behold, from one of the loudest crowds you will ever see, King said they were going crazy. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the greatest truly. Wrestlemania has everything you want, and the Attitude era has truly begun. This is very special to me, because it was the first Wrestlemania I ever saw, back in '98. “The era of Austin has begun!” <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 / 10
