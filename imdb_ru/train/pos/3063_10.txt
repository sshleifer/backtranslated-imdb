The first time the director (Bromell) gathered a small but powerful cast to look at the middle-aged world, the middle-class hired killer and his fight with the relationship with his father. This film in less than 90 minutes represents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature. David Dorfman, 6-year-old son of William H. Macy, is the most refreshing little actor I've ever seen. Macy is gorgeous in the part that seems to him to be written like a tortured sole, trying its best to break the reins of his father and his business. It's always nice to see Donald Sutherland, and here he is wonderful, like Macy's callous father. The alternative soundtrack of the films is worth it to hear the director explain how he chose the cast, the space and made the film. The main two-channel Dolby sound is suitable for this movie and is well recorded. Cinematography creates a mood along with a very subtle background music. Any movie lover or observer of human nature will like it, especially if he is a fan of contradictions.
