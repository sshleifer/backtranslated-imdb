Let me first say that this show was top notch when John Ritter was there. After his death, the show stopped a little, but the producers did not abandon the show, adding James Garner and David Spade to the regular line-up from 2003 to 2005. <br /> <br /> Show centers around the Hennessy Paul family (John Ritter, may he rest in peace), his wife Kate (Katie Sagal), their daughter Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson) and their son Rory (Martin Spangers). When Ritter was on the show, I screamed with laughter (and proud to admit it), but now that he is gone, I will only laugh a little at the occasional hearty laugh. I am very glad that I got into a trance of this show after Ritter’s untimely death, because he made EPS with Ritter much better. <br /> <br /> Ritter’s character is so well played and well rounded that you can't help but love him. He always leads the girls about dating, but he really wants them to be happy. This is great fun for a guy who hates a guy. <br /> <br /> Katie Sagal is also gorgeous, and she is also a pretty character. After Ritter's death, her character provides such good influence and power not only for her children, but I believe that Sagal influenced the life of Quoco, Davidson and Spangers, because she and Ritter have been friends for a long time. <br /> <br /> Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco, was to be the funniest person on the show. She is the best blonde: gorgeous, slow, dull, but she is an intelligent man. She is not at ease with the innocent humor of the "blonde" and how vain she is. <br /> <br /> Amy Davidson can get a little annoying, like Kerry, but that’s her character’s goal. The only mistake of the show is that the show never gives Kerry anything to rejoice about. She always pursues Bridget, and her character feels as if she is simply thrown there. <br /> <br /> Martin Spangers, like the lonely son of Hennessy, goes into hysterics, and when Ritter is on the show, he’s mostly comic material. After the death of Ritter, there are several storylines in the series for Rory. <br /> <br /> David Spade and James Garner are just a laugh, with a random side story for S.J., Spade's character. Garner plays Kate's father as a little background information. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give this show an excellent overview, because this is a great show in which a tragic event occurred that caused damage. You'll like it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 - spy
