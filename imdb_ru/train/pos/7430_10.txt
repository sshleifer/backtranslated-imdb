Personally, I really liked this film, and he especially touched me. The two main actors give us such great performances that in the end it’s really heartbreaking to find out what finally happened to their characters. <br /> <br /> Alchemy between Barbra Streisand and Chris Christofferson is a wonderful song, just great as it is. <br /> <br /> This is why I was not surprised to learn that he received 5 Golden Globe awards (the most awarded film on Golden Globes), an Oscar and even a Grammy. This film is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone. An excellent film that was often criticized (perhaps because Streisand dared to get involved in him, of course, as a “co-director”). Her skill is the greatest, and it will surely please you!
