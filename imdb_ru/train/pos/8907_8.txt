I saw this movie at midnight on demand that night, not knowing what to expect. I heard about this movie, but I never really thought about it. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was impressed by what I saw. In some places I was really excited, and I definitely remember jumping a few times in my place. <br /> <br /> Blob looked scary. Now I look in the jar of jelly and wonder if it will snap into my hand. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen was really good as Steve Andrews, the main character of the film. In the beginning I also liked the old man. <br /> <br /> For the horror movie of the 50s, this was very well done, even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
