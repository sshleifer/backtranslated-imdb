This is the first film I saw about John Singleton, and he is a pretty good director. The film begins with a group of newbies and shows what happens to several of them. Omar Epps plays a star on the track with a partial scholarship and struggles with his work. He is friends with Ice Cube and meets with Tyra Banks. Christy Swanson is a rich girl who is raped and made friends with Jennifer Connelly, who is a lesbian, and not sure which way to go Michael Rapaport - a child from Idaho who meets with a group of neo-Nazis, and their leader is Cole Hauser. These are the three main characters, and Lawrence Fishburne is a professor of political science who is trying to help them. This is a great film, and unfortunately, the studio had to make several cuts to the film.
