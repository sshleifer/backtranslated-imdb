This entire film is worth seeing only at the last great moment - this is the best ending of any movie I've ever seen. Perfect, beautiful, funny, just great. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me that this film is amazing, even though there is a deep meaning in France. I loved it - it's a great love story. And I liked the way the Algerians were woven, and, by the way, the music during the final titles is excellent. I want a CD!
