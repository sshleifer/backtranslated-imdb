The only other review of this film as of this date really destroys the stars and the film itself. I usually like to read user comments to give me an idea of ​​what to expect from a movie that I know little about. Unfortunately, when there are not so many comments for a certain fragment, because when there is only one review, and it unjustifiably breaks the film and the actors, you do not understand what to expect. I read the review before watching this headline, and I don’t know where all the poison for this movie and stars came from. Douglas and Blondel were very talented and attractive people who usually did, even when the material was not the best. I found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable. This is not one of the great classic stories of all time, but enjoyable and fun entertainment — much more than you can hope for in most new movies. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.
