I am not an ordinary commentator on this site, but, seeing how underestimated this film is, I try to write a few comments and comments on this subject. I had fun watching this movie, perhaps because Cat is all I would like to be, I'm not going to publish spoilers or show stories, but there are things that really seem amazing to me, the way it manipulates people, it's just divinely. this is a very undervalued film, I have no arguments here, I usually go to enjoy, and then I talk a little about it when you go to the cinema to have fun, and I really enjoyed 1h53 when I was in a dark room. one must see again and again, until the delight is extinguished. let's not be so critical of this. Thank you for reading.
