Zombi 3 has an interesting story in the making. First, this is the sequel to the Fulchi hit Zombie 2, and Zombie 2 itself is, of course, a marketing ploy to make people think that this is the sequel to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, also known as Zombie. Confused enough? In fact, none of the films have anything to do with each other, but who cares when they make money. I assume that Fulci himself didn’t care about production about halfway through Zombi 3 when he decided to leave. Bruno Mattei was invited on board to help the film complement additional scenes to extend the running time. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 storyline is your typical zombie fare. Scientists are developing a serum on an island in the Philippines, terrorists stealing it, releasing the plague, and zombies rage. Scientists want to create an antidote, while the military intends to mow down all without prejudice. There are also brief inserts of a Radio DJ sermon on how we relate to the planet. <br /> <br /> In general, I really liked this movie. I have heard horrible things, but I find the dull dialogue rather enjoyable. The film seems to be an attempt to raise awareness about environmental pollution, about the corrupt armed forces, about the Man playing God, etc. I have a feeling that at some point it was a serious film, but it deviated in a strange direction, supposedly, when Mattei came on board. <br /> <br /> In addition to ripping off other zombie movies, this was very much like Romero's Mad Men novels. You hear DJ Radio tell the good news: "When you see people in white suits and gas masks, run to them for help." It is, of course, played with images of people in whites shooting zombies. Later they directly steal the scene from the Mad Men, in which one of the ordinary, unpolluted people is killed by mistake. <br /> <br /> In this film, the blood factor is pretty good, and hordes of zombies around every corner. How cool is that? Let me count the paths 1. Birth of a Zombie 2. Flying Zombie Head 3. Birds of a Zombie. 4. Zombies without legs, floating in the pool. My favorite zombie was a maniac with a machete at the gas station. He had a bad ass, and he almost destroyed the whole building, trying to kill the girl. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote ?? When a sergeant insists on cremation of a zombie, scientists ask: “Do you think that when the ashes are in the air, it will fall to the ground and pollute everything?” To which Sargent boldly replies: “Now you are talking about science fiction.” He also goes on to mention “Science Fiction” told by scientists, even at the end when everyone dies. <br /> <br /> Additional information: Gallery, Trailers and Interviews, especially the one with Matthew, where he insists that he sent 40% of the scenes, but I cannot remember which of them or any other important details. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: a must-see for fans of zombies and Fulci. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Molly Selaski www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
