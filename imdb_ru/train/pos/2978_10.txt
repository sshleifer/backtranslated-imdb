BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. This is an original film featuring the creators of South Park Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two idlers who create a sport on their way that becomes a national sensation. Most of the jokes are really funny, but the funniest parts of the film are when players try to “freak out” other members of the opposing team. There are no rules about what is not allowed, so naturally, they do the craziest things. One of the drawbacks of this film is that the tempo is too fast, and after watching for about half an hour I found myself asking, “Wow, has it already ended?” The other funny part of the film was about how Joe and Doug constantly harass Skvik, who is a deluded little guy. BASEketball is a comedic classic with very quoted lines, which is very fun to watch!
