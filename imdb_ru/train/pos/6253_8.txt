This movie is great. As has often been heard, this is indeed very realistic, and sometimes cruel, but unlike some other people, I clearly do not think that this depresses, negatives or destroys Austria as a proto-fascist society. On the contrary: although there are really very heavy scenes in HUNDSTAGE, and some characters can be called very bad people, at the same time you are watching love, beauty and humor in the Ulrich Seidles film. And this is exactly what makes HUNDSTAGE different for me from other films that are trying to show the life of “ordinary people” in an intense, realistic way; their turmoil, their desires, their dark sides: Zeidl clearly never tries to prove that the life of working class people is rubbish! In my opinion, viewers who come to this conclusion seem very afraid to admit that almost no one lives as “pure” and “normal” as we would like other people to believe. And that each life has its dark and often oppressive sides. The most beautiful scene: an old Viennese man, watching his old girlfriend dance “the eastern way,” as he calls it. I think that everyone who finds this scene ugly lacks a sense of beauty, and they have to ask themselves what it is, this is a proto-fascist: characters from HUNDSTAGE or spectators who are turned off by the body of a 70-year-old woman dancing with all her charms for her lover
