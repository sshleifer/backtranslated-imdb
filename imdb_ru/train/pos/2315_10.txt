There is so much value in this film that itâ€™s hard to know where to start with praise. Let me begin by expressing my admiration for the perfect image of Reese Witherspoon. The fact that her performance stands out in an excellent composition is really praise. Robert Mulligan rarely disappoints those of us who admired his work. Each frame of "Man on the Moon" indicates the creation of the film in the best possible way.
