The comment of the man who said that Pat Robertson is evil, and his program is evil, has nothing to do with what evil and righteousness are. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days people will call good evil, and evil good! He does not even know that he fulfilled the biblical prophecy! If you do not know God and refuse to know him now, do not worry. He still loves you, but when you finally kneel before Him, and you do, it will be too late for you. God does not send anyone to hell, not even you! You will go there by your own decision, and your eruption determines it! May God have mercy on you and give you the experience of the Damascus road. Club 700 and the ministry of Pat Robertson is one of the reasons why I'm still here. On the verge of alcoholism, adultery and probably death, God stretched out his hand through the TV screen and used Pat Robertson to do it, and thank God for what He did! You have the right to say what you said, but you do not have the right to swear in your own words. Lord, have mercy on you.
