My son was 7 years old when he watched this film, he is now on a Russian fishing vessel and said that the film that impressed him most of all and which has remained in his memory all these 39 years is the film Legend of the Boy and the Eagle. He asked if I could get it for him. I am sure that he has a lot in his head, because he has only 3 hours of daylight, and he spent 3 months on this ship, and he will have 3 more months before the expiration of his contract. Since we have Indian blood, he connects to this film. He will be 47 years old on January 27, and I would like to receive this film for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years, and, as we all know, this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me get this movie? Thanks in advance to Dolly Krut-Soto, Deerfield Beach, Florida
