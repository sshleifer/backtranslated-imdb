Lloyd Bridges, like Mike Nelson and his boat, were the stars of this series. What was so good for me when I looked, it was a real feeling of being submerged. The show demonstrates young energy for exploration under water, which is contagious. <br /> <br /> The show was informative and showed the audience what scuba diving was from someone who was an unsurpassed professional, Mike Nelson. There were great shows, and the program always seemed well prepared. Of course, the drama in the scripts sometimes falls into the same notes in more than 1 episode, but each show is not inferior to any other show released in this era, in the childhood of American television.
