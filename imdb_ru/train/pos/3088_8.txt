Unfortunately for myself - I came across this show at the end of his life. I just caught a few episodes (about three) before it was canceled by ABC. I loved the characters and the storyline - but most of all the great actors! I was a fan of Sex and the City, so I saw two recognizable characters (Bridget Moynahan - Todd - Smith Jared), as well as Jay Hernandez (“Carlito Way: Rise to Power”) and Erica Christensen . I like to watch young actors get their due, and I felt that this show would advance their careers further. I hope that at least it will be released again on DVD, and maybe WB will pick it up for the second season? In the meantime, I am looking at it from the very beginning on the ABC website.
