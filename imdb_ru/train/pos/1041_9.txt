Watching the Rhine began as a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman, who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still associated with Nazi Germany by the notorious non-aggression pact signed in August 1939. because Hellman was simply repeating the line of the Communist Party, the line did not change until a couple of months later. In fact, Lilian was ahead of her time by several months. <br /> <br /> From April 1941 to February 1942, the play “Watch on the Rhine” consisted of 378 performances, and five players came from Broadway to repeat their roles. the butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest son, Lucille Watson as the family matriarch and, most importantly, the villain George Koulouris and Paul Lucas. <br /> <br /> Lucas won the prize in 1943, winning Oscar, Golden Globe, and New York film critics for the best actor. Perhaps if the Tony Prize existed, he would have won too. Oscar becomes even more remarkable if you remember who he ran into: Humphrey Bogart in “Casablanca”, Gary Cooper in “For Whom the Bell Tolls”, Mickey Rooney in “The Human Comedy” and Walter Pijon in “Madame Curie”. Each of his competitors had a more cinematic title than he had. Usually Lukas is nominated from the list of candidates for the Academy to overtake the field. <br /> <br /> Jack Warner knew that this is why Madi-Christians did not repeat her Broadway role, and the role of Lucas’s wife was given to Betty Davis. Davis did not take part because it was a particularly spectacular role for her, but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with her. For the same reason, she played "The Man Who Came in for Dinner," a much easier piece than this one. <br /> <br /> Davis is the daughter of the late American Supreme Court judge who married a German citizen in the days of Weimar. After many years of lazing around the European continent, Davis Lucas and their three children come to America, which has not yet entered the European war. They are greeted by Lucille Watson, who is naturally excited to finally meet her grandchildren. <br /> <br /> Other guests are flying into this ointment, Davis' girlfriends from the bygone days, Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband, who is also from Europe, is a Romanian diplomat and aristocrat George Koulouris. Kuluris is a wasteland and a waster, and he feels the possibility of double communication when he suspects Lucas's anti-fascist background. <br /> <br /> His suspicions are quite true, so the family became the vagabond they became. Lucas fought on the Republican side in Spain and was wounded there. Since then, his health has not changed. His family loyally supports him in making any decision. These decisions affect all other cast members. <br /> <br /> A little more was added to the Broadway play, including some cute fascist creatures - Dashil Hammett, who was the main character of Lillian Hellman. Koulouris, playing cards at the German embassy, ​​was the creation of Hammett with such disgusting characters as Henry Danielle, Kurt Kach, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Calser and Rudolf Anders. <br /> <br /> Koururis is truly one of the most disgusting characters ever brought to display as an account without a runman's account. He was a metaphor for his own country, which gladly accepted the Nazis, and then equally rejected them, without losing a step after Stalingrad. <br /> <br /> Lucille Watson became the best supporting actress in 1943, but lost to Katina Paksino. For whom the bell tolls. Dashil Hammett was nominated for the best adapted scenario, and the film itself lost in the category “Best Picture” to another anti-fascist classics of Casablanca. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that in those specific times it was a thing set at a certain time, “Watch On The Rhine” still contains a stern anti-fascist message that repeats endlessly.
