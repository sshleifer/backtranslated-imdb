James Dickey is a great descriptive author. When someone reads Liberation, it is instantly transferred to the lush thickets of the deep south. When someone watches the movie version of the book of John Boorman, he understands how accurately he caught the essence of the book. The camera is descriptive, like a narration. The characters are fully implemented, and the images are fantastic. I first saw this film in 1992, after finishing my first year in college. I was at a stage when I watched films that were released within a few years after my birth in 1973. Among them were Patton, Papillon and All People of the President; great movies, all of them. This one was an easy band class. It says a lot.
