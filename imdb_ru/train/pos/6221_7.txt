If this film were made a little better, it would have been there with the best of Aster and Rogers. In fact, this is a good film, but too long with a tedious plot, that is, Randolph Scott, who plays the role of sister Rogers, performed by Harriet Hilliard (this is Ozzy Nelson's wife for you, baby boomers). <br /> <br /> Aster and Scott are two naval men. Scott first meets Hilliard when she looks like a stereotypical librarian, and later, after Ginger Rogers asked her friend (blond but unmistakable Lucille Ball) to charm her. Meanwhile, Astaire is trying to find where he and his old dance partner have stopped. The result is wonderful dance numbers in which Aster and Rogers act as a team, as well as separately: “I put all my eggs in one basket”, “Let yourself go” and “I would rather lead the group”. Hilliard is sweet, but a little sluggish, like an ordinary Jane, who has become a glamorous girl, although she sings her two songs well: “But where are you?” And “Leave me alone, Satan” - one poster didn’t care about this song, but I love the name . Rodgers is vigorous, and the young Aster is a dynamo. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, “Let's Face the Music and Dance” appears, one of the most painfully beautiful songs ever written and, of course, one of the most brilliantly performed by Rogers and Aster. In it, they embody the glamor and fantasy of the 30s. It really needs to be appreciated and watched again and again.
