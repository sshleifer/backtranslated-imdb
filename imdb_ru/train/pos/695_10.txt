This movie attracts you and makes you keep your eyes on the screen. The writer / director is great with narrative parts and using creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives that all add to the spectacular capture he will have on you. Insomniac's Nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other film you've seen. Is it a dream or a reality? This indie will force you to discuss the turns going through the conscious and the subconscious. It has an eerie feeling with dark interpretations of illusions. Dominic Monaghan really became insomnia. He is a great actor who is also not hard on the eyes! He really poured his whole being into this role. From the storyline to how it was filmed, makes this indie one of my favorites. I recommend it very much and looking forward to see more from this innovative, creative author / director / filmmaker !!!
