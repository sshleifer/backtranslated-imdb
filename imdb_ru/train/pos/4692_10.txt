Although Johnny Dangeril is critically offended, this is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. This is a movie that needs to be watched carefully; Some funny bits are made in passing and do not attract the usual attention. For example, watch Michael Keaton using price guns at the pet store ... as well as the years of documentary style that appear at the beginning of the scenes. This is one of those rare films where humor unexpectedly amazes you, although you know that this is a comedy. Amy Heckerling, director, is very perceptive here - if you liked her more famous films (Fast Times in Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Vacation, etc). Piscopo, Peter Boyle) is superb. Highly recommended.
