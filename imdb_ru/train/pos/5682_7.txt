No, this is not Alice, not a fairy tale of my friends! This fable "Wonderland" is based on a true story of the terrible bloody murders in Wonderland that took place in the 1980s in California. The center of this bloodshed was none other than Johnny Wade himself. Yes, John Holmes! Papa Ding-dong used other shotguns than his notorious 13-inch dairy machine. In addition to being a legendary film actor for adults, Holmes was also a hardcore addict who supported various Hollywood addicts. Val Kilmer was sometimes as majestic as Holmes, but this time the character of Holmes did not reach the end. In the film, who is who supports the players: Josh Lucas and Dylan McDermott as Hollywood riffraffs, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow as women in Holmesâ€™s life, and Eric Bogosyan as a threatening entrepreneur from Tinsltown. These characters play a direct or indirect role in the Wonderland killing. From this support group, it was Josh Lucas who was most fierce and impressive, like the ardent Ron Launius. Lucas is gradually turning into a major Hollywood player with such charismatic turns in "Beautiful Mind" and "Sweet Home, Alabama." Directed by James Cox, sometimes turned out to be a hoax, showing a huge number of over-extended scenes, like the famous Holmes organ. Holmes was ultimately acquitted of the Wonderland killings. He died of complications from the AIDS virus. "Wonderland" will make you think about what really happened on that bloody night, and whether Holmes really laid out his weapon. Unfortunately! Wrong Holmes movie! Good! That's enough, before I am "in prison," I mean punishment. Bye Holmes! *** Average
