William Wyler had to direct this adaptation of Moss Hart’s Broadway play with music / recruiting posters, but his own military commitments intervened, and it went to the most unlikely helmsman: George Cukor. The "female director" probably touched on many such documentary episodes of the Air Corps training, and he endowed him with more shock than the normally accepted genre, especially in wartime. Of course, the monstrous (and completely white, with the exception of one unpaid Sino-American rookie) group of newbies is nicer and more useful than in real life, and conversations about the house, mother, wife and child become quite thick, but this is effective propaganda and, undoubtedly, stirring. Noteworthy are also the militant male actors, some of whom have not appeared for many years: Lone McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Button (in dragging, as sister Andrews), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb and Don Taylor. Also for a very early look at Judy Holliday, who doesn’t show up in the film for an hour and a half, but has some nice little episodes, like O'Brien's excited wife from Brooklyn. It is a pity that his rights are confused, and the only imprint anyone knows is 16 mm; obviously, after the Twentieth Century Fox released it (with great success), the rights returned to the army, and if there is a good 35 mm imprint, it is probably somewhere in the depths of the Pentagon. This is insincere and banal in some places, but it also vividly reflects the severity of military training and the horrors of war, and he deserves to be seen more widely.
