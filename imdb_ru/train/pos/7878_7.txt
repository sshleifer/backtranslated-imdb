As the story of my family tells, my father, Milton Raskin, played the piano for a group of Dorsey. After Sinatra joined the group, my father practiced with him for hours on end. Then, at some point, my dad told Sinatra that he was in fact very good to be associated with such a small group (group), and that he should risk it himself. By that time, Sinatra had enough credit “under his belt” to do it! Dorsey never forgave my father, and the rest, as they say, is history. <br /> <br /> I have several photographs and recordings on this subject, like Berkeley University in California. <br /> <br /> I have seen almost every Sinatra film more times than I’d like to say, and his films never get old. Thank you frank
