I was lucky to see this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> “Sizhao” or “Shower” is a low-budget film worth $ 200,000 about his father and his two sons. My father has a traditional sauna somewhere in a traditional Chinese village, where locals, mostly elderly men, come to relax and go swimming. The father has sons: the “backward” son, who lives with him, and the son, who lives in a large modern city and comes to visit him. For this son, the traditional village, the bathhouse and his “backward” brother seem strange and annoying, but this changes as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> Although the story may seem silly or cliché, it is not. With really great performances, especially with the father and the “backward” son (sorry, I don't know their names) and with a great story, the film was touching and funny at the same time. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see this movie do it. This is a great alternative to mainstream Hollywood cinema. <br /> <br />
