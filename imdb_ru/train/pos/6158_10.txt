What can I say about such a fairy tale? This fairy tale has been following me since my early childhood, evoking fond memories in my heart. Characters take you to so many quaint places, making you want more of each scene. For example, there were so many different flavors of knowledge on the market. I liked the exotic dancers who accompanied the steel drums. <br /> <br /> Storyline was wonderful. I wanted so much that Landsbury decided to leave premature children, and that she also stayed with Mr. Brown, and find the second half of the spell, so that people who have no armor could win the war. <br /> <br /> I am still a child inside, and this film is like to my inner child like no other. This film is my favorite film of all times. I hope that all children will be able to see this classic and will be swept away, and transferred to another time.
