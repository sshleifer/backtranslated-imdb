The Ancient Sailor is truly a classic work, as the original poem was / is. The context / situation with the old sailor himself is good, understandable and without pretense. The artwork accompanying the reading of the poem ideally corresponds to the time / period of the setting and the work itself, bringing the audience into a period with still, but still moving accompaniment, using excellent strategies of motionless movement, only well conquered producers of the era before MTV works. (MTV brought to television and video a static movement that permeates, often irrelevant, transitions from topic to topic without moving forward and without a clear relationship to the topic or storyline.) The voice, intonation and vitality of the Redgrave reading bring to life a touching poem with all its fear, strife and pain. In addition, the smooth movement of the video emphasizes the frequency and episodic monotony (in this case, a positive mood under the theme of the story itself) of the authorâ€™s performance of a sad and terrible tale of an ancient sailor. This is necessary for any love for classical poetry, for the sea, for a fairy tale that almost sounds true, and for a story that has had a lasting impact on our world and culture. Who does not understand the meaning of the word "albatross"? or the concept of "water, water everywhere, not a drop for drinking"? Really good experience. Thank you, Mr. DaSilva, for bringing this to life for us, so that you will never be forgotten.
