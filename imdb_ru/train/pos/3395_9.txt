This is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very strange in the way men and women watch the same movie. I spoke to many people about the film, and almost every guy loved him and said that he was great, although most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only film I know about that has such polarized views on the basis of sex. Perhaps many women are just less tolerant of disgusting or depressing plots - but whatever the reason, I always found this difference amazing. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation, led by Charlton Heston. This is happening in the near future, and the head of the huge international corporation Soylent was killed. When the film unfolds, you quickly realize that this is a terrible and extremely unfair future for American society. The rich live in magnificent apartments with security and all the pleasures that can be bought for money (including “furniture” - a euphemism for paid mistresses who come with the apartment). At the same time, the masses are poor, unemployed and in many cases live in abandoned cars or in the corridors of apartments. Due to overpopulation and smog, heavy losses and the future looks really awful! <br /> <br /> Why the rich man died, and the terrible truth with which he could not live, I really should NOT discuss - it can spoil the film for you. Nevertheless, the film has an excellent plot and acting, and it is very exciting to watch. In addition, he shows Edward J. Robinson in his final screen presentation as Heston's brutal assistant. Although not for easy repression or disgust, it is an excellent science fiction film, allegorical and deep.
