What a delightful movie. The characters were not only alive, but also alive, reflecting the real daily life and strife in the family. Each character introduces a unique personality into the story that viewers can easily associate with someone they know in their family or with close friends. <br /> <br /> In the plot there is a realistic flow that the viewer can assimilate and be part of the drama, laughter and tears as the plot of the film evolves. The script captures well the general emotions, actions, and reactions of the characters to conflicts, opinions, and determination. <br /> <br /> Not an epic film, but a very good film that can be watched with loved ones, A lot of those who know nods and “aaaa” moments to share and enjoy.
