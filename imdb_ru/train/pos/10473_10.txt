I was in a bad mood when I first saw this movie. For some reason, he touched all my levels, family tensions, loneliness and the desire of someone to share his life with you. It didn't hurt that with someone you could share your life with was such a beautiful girl like Claire (Cindy Preston). I also bought a soundtrack for this movie (very hard to get). I liked it very much and I hope that it will sometime be released on DV
