A couple of days ago, I realized that the creators of this film added a word game to its name. This film is not about the “riding giants”, but mainly about people who are sports giants, COMBINING giants to change the accent. <br /> <br /> As a teenager, I lived a block from Klin, one of the most difficult and best bodysurfing spots in the world. I surfed from 15 to 18 feet, traveled and fought 10 and 12-foot waves many times. That is why I am delighted with the surfers in this film. The idea that Jeff Clark, apparently, an ordinary mortal, could get away with on a Maverick trip for more than ten years, I can’t do. The first rule of safety of any aquatics: "Never surf, dive, swim on your own." He went to where there would be no sane people, and he lived to tell about it. I would not go there if the water was 75 degrees and all the sharks were gone. <br /> <br /> In the world of warm water: the first blow of a wave in the Jaw always makes the skin tingle throughout my body. These are not just terrible waves, they are waves of uncontrolled intestinal evacuation. When we see that Laird Hamilton is not only going through waves of 40–60 feet (I can hardly dial these numbers), but I actually work with people like a fun day in Rincon, I’m just amazed. In riders with large waves, dedication and purposefulness are comparable to what anyone in the world has. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. I gave him 9 instead of 10 just because I neglect the mention of the fact that there are great riders on the big waves in the world, except for the Hamilton / Kalama crew, and I think they deserve a mention. Splicing in Ken Bradshaw on a log cabin and 10 it!
