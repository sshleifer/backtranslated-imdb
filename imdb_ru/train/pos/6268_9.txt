Carter Wong plays a noble hero in search of a healing book that forces him to seek the ultimate revenge! In this film, the pace is good, and there are many fight scenes for the film to continue. Flying guillotines look evil, and the main villain without any problems uses them. Although the story is not strong, the action is fun and attracts you to the very end (which I felt could be a continuation). <br /> <br /> Campi and gloomily, this is a great kung fu school !!
