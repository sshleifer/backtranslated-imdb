So, this is a bit borrowed from “This is a wonderful life,” but it was 44 years before this film, so why not a new attempt. Belushi is 35 years old. He did not get his Wheaties, his coffee, and lost his job. A capper is when, in his own words, a “big blue piece of shit” car breaks down at the end of the day. He heads for an empty bar to call in tow. While waiting, the bartender (Kane) recognized him as a child who lost the city baseball championship 20 years ago. It makes him wonder what life would be like if he won the game. He finds out when, unbeknownst to him, Kane delivers a motion potion in a glass that gives him the mansion, prom queen (Rousseau) as his wife, and makes him president of the company of sporting goods from which he was canned. Later, Kane reveals himself as responsible for this change, but Belushi is not entirely on board. He never fully adapts, and in the development of the plot, which does not kill the film, but still strange, he tries to lead his wife (Hamilton) out of his real life, which is now married to someone else. A good step is that they do not spend too much time on it, since they mainly tear out the "Ghost" when Belushi constantly tells Hamilton only what she can know. This also introduces the hockey drama element, as its two lovers in the shadow, the new wife Rousseau and his unbalanced lover Cox. But the keys to the film - a somewhat long start and a fun ending. Also a good job from a large and recognizable cast, as Belushi is very cute, VERY attractive ladies, and Kane plays the role of the main character at ease. It is strange that this was the second film of Belushi in 1990, telling about how he got an alternative lifestyle, which was found in Care of Business. Both films are the same, though similar, but laugh. So check it out for a funny what-if study.
