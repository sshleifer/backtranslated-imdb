A remake of Tiana is no good. I just click on his documentary about the remake to see how Wei Wei, the original actress in the classic movie of 1948, said a few words to the team. We are going to meet Wei Wei this Sunday (28/3/2010) after Xiao Chen Ji Chun was shown in the Hong Kong film Archiev. Wei Wei is almost 90 years old, she is silver, her cameo in Hong Kong films always surprises her fans. This year at the Hong Kong Film Festival, a special program is dedicated to Fei Moo, the director of this grand film, and Wei Wei, still shot from the film, can be seen in Hong Kong. My son, who turns 21 this year, is surprised that Wei Wei was so beautiful then.
