Call me a teenager, but I really think this is a great series. If you have not had the opportunity to experience several episodes from the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely watch this one. Perhaps more convincing than the caretaker Voyager, who launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, the adventures of Archer are completely different, but strangely familiar ... The music is also catchy. No true fan of science fiction can do without watching at least one Star Trek episode - and these contributions live up to expectations.
