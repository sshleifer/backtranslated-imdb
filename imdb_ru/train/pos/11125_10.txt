What can you say about a show of this magnitude? The Soprano Clan literally redefined television as we know it. He broke all the rules and set new standards for the quality of television. Everything is flawless, the script, the direction, and for me, first of all, acting. Watching this show, you will understand that you understand that these characters are NOT real. The game makes you think that this is a real Tony Soprano or any other character. This show is also very versatile. Some people do not watch the show, because it is violence, it is not only violence, it is a matter of business, family and many deeper things that depend on what you, as a fan, see. I do not like it when people refer to the show, the show about the mafia. For me, this is a family show. Family, which from generation to generation is separated from the crowd. In general, this is a masterpiece of the show. This is what television should be. Right here. Challenging characters from amazing acting, gorgeous storylines from brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients? A show that defines excellence and dares to be different.
