Soprano was probably the last best show on the air in the 90s. sad that it's all over, it was the best show on HBO, if not on television, not everything was written for you throughout what you had to think, it was great. The cast was superb. Tony (James Gandolfini) - a great actor and played his character well, like everyone else. Each character had flaws, which made them so real and allowed viewers to communicate with them, and this is one of the reasons why it lasted so long. The last episode was good, I'm not sure how this can be understood at the end of the game. Many think that Tony did not die, but Meadow entered and sat down with them, and the darkening was just for the unknown. Tony will have to stand trial and figure it out, I hope he is not dead, that's how I feel ... Long live the soprano and Tony Soprano .......
