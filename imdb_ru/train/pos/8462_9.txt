I just recently acquired a collection of one of this amazing series, and even after just watching three episodes, I'm still mesmerized by the sleek animation style and slow, but thoughtful story-telling actions. I'm still a fan ..... with some difficulty. <br /> <br /> Although this article in the Gundam saga is very cool and has what it was in the previous episodes, it is a stylish satirical way of telling about the injustices of war and not giving up the need to have control or power over everything (sounds familiar? ), I have to say that this one becomes too soft and dramatic to continue explaining the lives of the main characters and their ongoing needs to ache in the stomach about everything that is happening and what they need to do to prevent the OZ group from succeeding in their plans (especially the character for them nor Wufei ... I mean he whines more than an American character in a soap opera. A consultant?, I mean, that could always be worse. It could be like in a recent release, SEED ..... .eeeewwww, let's talk about the soft drama .... I will talk about this later.
