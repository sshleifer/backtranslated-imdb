I sat down to watch Midnight Cowboy, thinking it would be another overrated film from the 60s / 70s. Some of my favorite films belong to the 70s, in the same spirit as “Midnight Cowboy” (“Taxi Driver”, “Vile Streets”, “Panic in the Park of Needles”, etc.), But there are many many overpriced well, which has won a strong reputation among critics for innovation - unfortunately, the vast majority of them can not stand today. I feel like this about the "Easy Ryder". (Although he is also one of my favorites.) <br /> <br /> I did not expect much from the Midnight Cowboy, but I got a lot back. It is a touching story, well done and well told with the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman, like Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo, gives one of his best results - sometimes he is a little funny (when he says he sounds like a cartoon character - perhaps because of his connection with Lenny / The Simpsons), but Hoffman is completely convincing , Half of the film's budget went to his salary, as he only became a major star in Hollywood. Opposite him, John Voight is depicted with a second account in the role of Joe Buck, the “cowboy” who goes north to the Big Apple in the hope of becoming a male prostitute. Soon his naive ways bring him trouble, and he teams up with a crippled scammer named Ratso, who offers to become Joe’s “manager” for a certain percentage of the profits. <br /> <br /> The film is quite long in two hours, but never seems very long. Some films may have a tendency to pull, especially some of the films that were made in the 70s, because (as was said in "Light Riders, Raging Bulls"), directors were movie stars in the 1970s, and sometimes they got too fascinated by their material, too long studying characters / scenes / etc. it does not matter. Almost the only scene that, in my opinion, was too long and unnecessary, was a drug party - because of this, the film seems to be extremely outdated (similar to the Odyssey of Drugs in Light Racer) and really hurts its progress, because He's not needed. /> <br /> Besides, Midnight Cowboy is an almost immaculate film. I was pleasantly surprised. It has its drawbacks (flashbacks are a bit sticky and never used as they could, for example), and some scenes are a bit uncomfortable (for example, a gay movie theater sequence), but if you can handle its content “Midnight Cowboy” - truly magnificent motion picture, uncompromising study of life on the streets in the late 60s - early 70s. This is a depressing film, yes, and by today's standards it may seem a bit outdated and difficult from a liberal point of view, “life is terrible, etc.” ... but I still love it, and especially the extremely touching end will stay with me for a very long time. . <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. One of the best movies of the 70s. (Technically, it was released at the end of 1969, but I still attribute it to the category of films from the 1970s. He also won an Oscar for Best Film, becoming the first and only X-rated film to do it. Later, he was reevaluated at R appeals.) <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5
