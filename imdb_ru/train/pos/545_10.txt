The sequels almost never match the original. This is definitely confirmed in this case. However, if you are a big fan of the original, then be sure to give it a watch. Although there is not enough camera work, the character of Brian Krausa is annoying, and the plot of the click is much funnier than the first one, and this is what I find interesting in this. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie with the same efficiency as in the first movie. Frankly, it's a little different. Instead of sitting in his cabin and writing scripts, Stanley leaves for Hollywood, trying to manage the project of his dream, “Lake Hut”. This film looks different, but it's still great to see Stanley in action. <br /> <br /> I give him 6 out of 10.
