Police Story is one of the classic Jackie Chan films that helped shape the Hong Kong cinema. This is a masterpiece that no action movie fan should miss. From the outset, it is obvious that the Jackie Chan stunt team literally risked their lives to make this film. And action, and tricks are extremely realistic and innovative. Even today, no film has surpassed the police story in dangerous stunts. Many people were hospitalized in police history, including Jackie Chan. The fights are not as exceptional as the stunts, but the fights in this film helped to change and define the use of Jackie Chan props. Throughout the film, Chen uses a strange object to stop the attackers, and constantly throws the attackers through the thick glass. The action seems real, because the stuntmen give the film everything they can give, and Jackie Chanâ€™s coordination is outstanding. <br /> <br /> The remaining aspects of the film are not without flaws, but they will not disappoint any fan action. Chen not only plays a believable risk by accepting a policeman, but also demonstrates the powerful changes his character passes through when he falls into increasing despair. The plot is powerful, but the modern viewer can sometimes find it tedious. While comedy delivers a lot of laughter, it does not always distract the audience from inaction. However, during the period in which this was done, the driving aspects of the plot are interesting. The film also scattered many interesting and well-played characters. <br /> <br /> In general, police history is undoubtedly one of the best action films ever created. And even in Hollywood, the influence of this one film cannot be ignored.
