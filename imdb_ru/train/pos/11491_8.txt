Unborn is a completely different movie. James Karen and Brooke Adams in the film, and they performed quite well. This movie is solid and it supports you. Although I think you should be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot. There is one short non-nude sex scene that could be left out, and for some people this scene may disappoint someone like me who enters the film and thinks the material is destroying a good movie, but that's all . There is a scene where the character of Adams is going crazy and killing a cat, but you can say that this is not real. The music is very different, but very good. “Unborn”, in my opinion, is a very creepy, unpredictable and rather strange film! I recommend this movie to all horror fans!
