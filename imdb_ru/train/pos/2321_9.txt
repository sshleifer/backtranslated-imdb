Here is a love story that I love to watch. And basically this is for two reasons. First, it is concentrated by young people, very young people. People who are still in adolescence and experience love for the first time, or at least think so. We were all there in our lives, and “The Man on the Moon” is a magnificent reflection of our memories, perhaps adding some more details and strengthening them even more than any of us. The second reason is that it is a love triangle. And I believe that in adolescence this is the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe that the heroes can really fall in love or are just so new to love that they just firmly believe in it, and after a tragedy or so, will believe it for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br /> In the film “Man on the Moon” there are many talented names. It starred Sam Waterston, a truly versatile actor who can play not only in this film, but also hard district attorneys, as well as strict, but caring and wise fathers. There are also Tess Harper, Jason London and the young, young Reese Witherspoon. You look at a young talented actress when she is fourteen years old, and you think that in ten years she will receive an Oscar. All the cast members shoot great performances, and thanks to the dialogue of the exciting script they turn into real people in real situations. As if all this really happened. This is the film that I would like to see more often. Love story or not. I would like to see films that make everything look real and are not fake or unbelievable in any way.
