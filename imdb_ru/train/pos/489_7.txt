Going home after the film, I sang the familiar waltz music under which Natalia and Alexander danced. I heard it before - where? Ah, from Kubrick's "Cup with eyes closed" (track 2), I realized as soon as I approached the door. This is Waltz No. 2 from the Jazz Suite No. 2, written by Dmitry Shostakovich, performed by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Yes, I went and took the soundtrack from the Tower. What a pleasure! The score of Alexander Doschad was stunning - there are fifteen tracks, in addition to two tracks of a delightful waltz. Not often in our day we get a soundtrack completely dedicated to a comprehensive film. Reminds me of the favorite scores of Maurice Jarre, Ennio Morricone (in the initial notes of track 6 there are traces of “Nuovo cinema Paradiso”), Georges Delaire and John Barry. There are subtle nuances of sounds and notes from strings, Celeste, piano and harp. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and John Turturro presented a pair of credible performances. The love story, their close relationship is very similar to Alexander and Natalia - his childish, but painful inner world, and her generous and bold understanding of him - the relationship with both of them in private. Directed by Marlin Horris from Lineia Antonia (Best Foreign Language Film, Oscar Prize 1996 from the Netherlands) gave us a quietly sensitive film - not without disturbing human conflicts, intrigues, obsessive ideas, family aspirations, love and respect. The front theme is a mind game and the mathematical logic of chess. Below him may be a slight recklessness of the dramatic series of the late 1920s. Cinematography reflects the serene beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy, not far from the Swiss border. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the soundtrack if you don’t want to go to the movies. The literary score of Alexander Despla "The protection of Luzhin" is completed.
