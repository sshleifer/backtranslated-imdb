Great voices, lots of adventures and intelligent dialogue make this film very good. Adding “character” to the three leading animals gives the story much more depth and meaning, especially the relationship between the older guy Shadow and the young hellish raiser Chance. Earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive, which is beautifully done. Sally Field is cute in everything, but in this film she really shines like a proud Sassi cat. A great contrast between the cat and dog’s views on life, and just the right amount of spirit and warm reflections to make the plot and resolution excellent. There are even inspiring points and beautiful mountain landscapes. Definitely perfect for an evening alone or with children. Hats off to Disney.
