I saw this movie last night, waiting for when it will be released in Canada (so far only in a limited release). It was worth the wait, and then a bit. I am a very energetic reader Margaret Lawrence and was thrilled to see this novel turning into a film. In fact, I liked the film more than the novel. I liked that Bram Shipley's character was a little less harsh, and that between Agariya and Bram seemed to have more of a love story that made the scenes at the end of Bramâ€™s life much more exciting. The loss seemed stronger. Hagar was no more cute in the movie than in the book, but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in this role. She was thoroughly Hagar. Christina Horn was great, and I have many more wonderful things to come. Her scenes with Cole Hauser were electric. I could go on and on, a total of 9 * out of 10. Fantastic and can not wait until it is released on DVD, a must for my collection!
