Erendir is a film from Mexico that is rarely spoken of. The film exists only in a low quality VHS format. It is a pity that this film was not released on DVD. The Erendir is stunning and gorgeous thanks to its magically realistic images. “Erendir” is based on the story from the novel “100 Years of Solitude”. Erendir constantly dreams and accidentally burns his grandmother’s house. Her wicked grandmother, played by Irene Pappas, forces her into prostitution in order to pay for the damage. The whole city gets a piece of Hendir, so to speak. Although the theme sounds harsh, the film does not exploit sexuality. It is made in a mature artistic manner. The film also has amazing costumes. Some of the most surrealistic aspects of the film that stand out most are the origami birds that turn into real birds, and golden orange with a diamond in the center. Hendir is an amazing film that even manages to add humor. This is definitely a film that deserves a special DVD release. As they say in Spanish: “Es muy muy bien !!! Excellente!
