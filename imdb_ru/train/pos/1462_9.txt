In this documentary, we meet Roger, the wealthy manager of a factory in China that makes beads and other trinkets that are sold and sold at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Roger claims that the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it provides, but the interviews with four of them tell a completely different story. The gloomy life of the girls contrasts sharply with the bizarre excesses of Mardi Gras. Director David Redmon should be commended for taking excellent and rare footage from everyday life on the territory of a Chinese factory complex, and also for taking a telling interview with the head of an American company that imports and sells beads. The film is convincingly told and clearly serves its purpose as a window into what lies behind the omnipresent “Made in China” labels.
