I watched McCoy's reunion and was glad to see Richard Crenna, Kathleen Nolan, and Tony Martinez !!! It was wonderful to see them now, because I always watched the show grow, so when they said on TV that there would be a reunion, I was so excited !!!! The only thing that I could not understand was why Lydia Reid (Hussey McCoy) and Michael Winckelmann (little Luke) were not there. I know that Walter Brennan is dead. So I sat down at my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site, so if there is anyone who can tell me what ever happened to Lydia Reid (Hassi McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke, I I would be grateful !! I was looking for everyone and I was not lucky. The only thing I could know about Michael Winckelmann was that he was to be born in 1946. This show had value and morality, and each show gave a lesson. The whole cast was incredible, the only thing that is better than learning about them is to meet them. this is not possible if there is someone who can help, please do it !!! Thanks, Glenda
