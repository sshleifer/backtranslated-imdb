I have never commented on the movie before. I watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. I read the comments that this film stays with you. It does. It's been almost 24 hours, and I'm still completely amazed. This film made me think about myself. How can I compare myself with a character like Ben, who is completely selfless? I like this movie. I love movies that make me wonder and wonder to the end. I feel mainly two emotions, happiness and sadness. Amazing movie “Feel good” and very sad. I wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but in the end, they were forever. If you have not seen this movie, take it and see. Just make sure you have no distractions. You will want to see every nuance on this picture. One for my library.
