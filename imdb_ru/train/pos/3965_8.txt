The film as a entertainment is very good, and Jimmy Stewart is great in the role of Chip Hardstey with the well-played roles of Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, shot by legendary director Mervyn Leroy, was constantly checked, and the approval script, as well as every aspect of the film, right down to clothing, was carefully watched and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover. Not that Edgar Hoover had anything to be proud of. His management bureau from 1924 until his death was one of the best investigative services in the world. But by 1959, Hoover had already begun to worry that he would be ousted, and had already started collecting dossiers on influential people to make sure and protect his small kingdom. And he was determined to make sure that not a single movie showed a single wart around the bureau. The films show only the continuing successes and dismal consequences of the setbacks and the role of the bureau in the witch hunt in the early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but with the tongue firmly in the cheek.
