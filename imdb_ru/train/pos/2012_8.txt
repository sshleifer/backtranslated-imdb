This is one of my favorites. Great music and some funny pieces. Every time I laugh at Millie, the maid, pretending to be a debutan, holding her elegant jacket during a chat, and mindlessly polishing furniture while she talks. I just can never do without her French accent, because they are trying to pass her off as the daughter of a boss. <br /> <br /> Seeing a teenager Mel Torme and quite young singing Frank Sinatra is such a pleasure. My mother saw Frank Sinatra at the theater around the same time that the film was released. She said that they could not remove the "bobby soxers" between the films (in those days you did not have to go between shows). This film shows how attractive and attractive young Frank was and allows him to appreciate his early talent. And Victor Borge gets a little from his routine, which is a bonus. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with a simple, simple storyline. Very nice.
