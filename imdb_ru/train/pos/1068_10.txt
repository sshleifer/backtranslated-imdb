I think Dark Angel is great! The first season was excellent, and he had a good storyline. With Max (Jessica Alba) as an escaped X-5, creating a manticore trying to adapt to normal life, but still “saving the world”. And the hunt for a manticore throughout the season, which gives the show extra spice. <br /> <br /> The second season suddenly became a bit strange compared to the first. The plot seems to have disappeared, and the series lost a bit of its charm, mainly due to the appearance of all the strange "creatures." Don't get me wrong, the second season is good, but with a lot of manticore. Nevertheless, they managed to return to a new promising story in the final episodes of season 2, in which I hoped to see more. <br /> <br /> So I really would like them to start doing new episodes. And with James Cameron, this can't go wrong. In conclusion, I would say that this is a great series, but I still hope for the third season!
