I love this show! <br /> <br /> Every time I watch an episode, I repeat this line and remind myself how good this show is. I'm a big fan of science fiction, and this show has reason to be the most important science (fantastic?) Show in the history of film / television. There are so many theories about the universe in this show that I could start a religion. It's amazing, season after season, the show is getting better and better. <br /> <br /> I have been a MacGyver fan since I was 5 (now 19), and I find it so ironic that my 2 favorite TV shows about the all-time star Richard Dean Anderson. It is also interesting that each character is almost opposite to the other. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the Stargate movie, I immediately liked it and I considered it one of my favorite science fiction films, and then I heard a television show would start, I was very excited but did not have time, until the fifth season is over. <br /> <br /> Although I am disappointed to learn that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to make a trilogy of films, the studio chose the series instead. <br /> <br /> I would say that everything worked out. Maybe even better. <br /> <br /> This is a terrific show, and I hope it never dies. Atlantis, here we are!
