We do not encounter films about the relationship between brother and sister in Indian cinema or in any other language or language. This relationship has several aspects that have not been used in films or novels. As a rule, the sister is depicted as a heap, which can be used for redemption at the climax. In this film, this subject is viewed in a completely different light. <br /> <br /> It is inspired by George Eliotâ€™s novel Mill on a Thread. The brother is very prosaic, everything is in order, the blue-eyed boy, usually a good son and his mother's favorite. Sister romantic, wild and causing unwritten rules of society. Despite this, brother-sister's love is a winner. <br /> <br /> This film is about the love of two brothers and sisters, separated in childhood, and the rebirth of the same feeling when they meet years later. It is also the desire of the submissive brother to reunite with her sister, who chose a wild character to challenge the world. <br /> <br /> Although the film and the novel are separated by three centuries from each other in two distant countries, yet the feelings are the same and still true.
