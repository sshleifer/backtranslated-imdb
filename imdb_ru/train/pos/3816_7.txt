“Secret Sunshine” reminded me of “Delight” (1991) with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is the best movie. It depicts super-religious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city, as well as the experience of the main character interacting with them as a result of a terrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of Milyang (“Secret Lights” in Chinese) from Seoul with her young son. She chose Miljana because her late husband (who died in a car accident) was born there, and she feels that she needs to start a new life in a new place. She does not respond very well to the overtures of local Christian fanatics, one of whose members is trying to convince her to come to their church and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially non-religious and shrugs off these people as politely as she can. In fact, she brushes off almost everyone in Milana from the very beginning, but some of them persistently try to invade her world, and the consequences are often ridiculous. To say more is to give up the film, but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role (Jong Do-Yong) is enormous. After reading that she received the award for the best female role in Cannes in 2007, I expected her to get a decent job. But Miss Chung is charming, and it is impossible to look away from her when she is on the screen. The film is something like the painful work of Evelyn Vo-Esquire, showing how Fate may feel insane as strange as it is inevitable.
