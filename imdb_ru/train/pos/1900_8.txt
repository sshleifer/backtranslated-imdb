The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role in his too short career in the 1981 film “Arthur”. It was a funny funny and alternating touching story that gives rise to warm smiles, loud laughter in the stomach and occasional tears if you are in a good mood. Moore was nominated for the Best Oscar Award for the role of Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who “drives cars, plays tennis, caresses women, but has a weekend and he is his own boss.” Arthur is destined to inherit $ 750 million when he marries a girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry), who is the spoiled daughter of a secret gangster. Things get bad when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) a waitress / actress from Queens who steals ties for her father's birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the funniest performances in 50 years. The late Sir John Gilgud won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his impeccable move, like the ordinary butler of Arthur and the best friend of Hobson, whose outward contempt for Arthur's behavior embraces more of his father's feelings. There are other funny contributions from Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Father Susan and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's insane grandmother. The film was shot with keen attention to the comedy for the first time by a director named Steve Gordon, who, unfortunately, died the following year. A few years later there was also an unforgettable sequel, but this instant classic should not be missed.
