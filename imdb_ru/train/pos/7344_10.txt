In my opinion, this is a good example of a film that could have been much better if it was short 10 years ago. I doubt that it will benefit from modern technologies, but it would have looked much better if it had been at least 90 minutes, and not 70. <br /> <br /> The artists and animators did a great job. In my opinion, this film boasts the best background pattern and one of the best character designs. The animation is very smooth and realistic. Throughout the film, you believe in the world that you see, so everyone did a great job. He also boasts one of the sexiest female animated characters, if not the sexiest, easily overwhelmingly typical anime girls. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are a couple of bad moments in this film that will make it not so attractive at the moment. Firstly, the plot and performance are comparable to modern adventure films and are really old-fashioned by modern standards. Secondly, due to the length of time it will greatly benefit from an additional 20 minutes of conversations. Finally, the situation at the moment is not so popular. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a great alternative to another story about Barbarian Konan, but not a novel.
