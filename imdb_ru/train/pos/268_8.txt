I loved Dedi Pfeiffer (is it properly written?) To Sybil. Long time did not see her and forgot how much I missed her. I thought she did a great job at this. The cast was pretty good too. In some angles, the daughter even looked like a young Nicole Kidman. The kidnapper was rather creepy, and the story, as a rule, had some good turns. The young guy was a beauty. I thought my husband definitely had something to do with it. <br /> <br /> I just received the Life Films for Christmas and I love these films. Kept my interest, and I will watch it again when they re-launch it. Can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this? You can leave a message on the board or send me a personal letter if you want. Thank you in advance. Aboutagirly.
