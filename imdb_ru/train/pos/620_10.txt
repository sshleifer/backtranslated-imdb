The wonderful story of Stardust is written by Neil Gaiman (by MirrorMask), and this is a really good story. I think that it will suit any maze, princess-bride or fan of the 10th Kingdom, and yet it is absolutely unique and stands on its own. And I feel that the screen version of this story has a much better ending than what was presented in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. I will not spoil it for you. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and a slave of fairies held by a witch in the realm of fairies. The story begins in the city near the wall, which separates the magical world from the world of people. When a shooting star appears, Tristan promises to find her for a girl whom he is madly passionate about. He does not know that the star took the form of a girl in a fairy-tale world and that there are others after her. Three elderly witches who want to use their heart to become young again, and several quarreling princes. <br /> <br /> This is a really good story. It has humor, magic and beautiful surreal scenes and visual effects. This is fascinating, and I feel that children and adults of all ages can watch him. This is just magical. This is a real classic tale, the likes of which I have not seen in the movies since the 1980s.
