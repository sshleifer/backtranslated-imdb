Any story consists of a premise, characters and conflict. Characters preparing their own plays promise triumph, and the belligerent character readily gives in to it. The premise of Ardha Sathya is summarized in the poem of the same name by Dilip Chitre. The line is: “ek palde mein napunsaktha, doosre palde mein paurush, aur teek tarazu kaante par, ardh satya?”. A rough translation - “The subtle balance of good and evil (which can usually be seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts) has impotence on one plate and valor on the other. Is the needle in the center a half-truth? > <br /> The poem is read halfway through the Smiths Patil Om Puri movie in a restaurant. This has a profound effect on the protagonist and lays the groundwork for most subsequent events. At the end of the film, Om Puri finds himself in the exact same situation that is so well described in the poem. <br /> <br /> The film does its best to make one by one verse. However, Chitre's words are too strong, and at best, the film corresponds to the poem in all aspects. <br /> <br />
