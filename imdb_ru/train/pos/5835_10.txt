Stan and Ollie become SAPSA ON THE SEA when their wayward little boat is driven by an evil killer. <br /> <br /> Boys are wonderful in this function, which begins with one of their most fun decorations - the Horn Factory, Laurel and Hardy, always a few steps from the rest of Creation, live in a world where ice radios and goats - the rule, not the exception. With its short duration, the film is more stylish with their classic short stories, which explains its episodic nature. <br /> <br /> Only the Boys get the title on the screen, but the film’s characters recognize other familiar faces: James Finlayson appears. As a psychiatrist, Richard Kramer fully pays tribute to his role as a bad guy, sweet Mary Gordon plays the “Boys” puzzled neighbor. This is Charlie Hall, who serves the desk of an apartment building and is a silent comic Ben Turpin, depicting the most unusual plumber. <br /> <br /> One of the screenwriters of the film is the silent comedian Harry Langdon. <br /> <br /> Stan & Ollie, however, is the center of attention. Watching Hardy go crazy with the sound of a horn or, for example, Laurel’s antics with bananas reminds the viewer why these guys remain absolute cinematic giants.
