as well as the original. Almost achieves greatness thanks to Kundiffâ€™s remarkable hearing for music and dialogue. Skewers from the important swagger of hip-hop posers. The band "Niggaz with Hats" (NWH) is every rap group you have ever heard, and it is absolutely self-periodic. The wardrobe is incredible. Buy an OOP soundtrack if you can.
