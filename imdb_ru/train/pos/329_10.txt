Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or any Greek mythological story in this regard), in my opinion, this is the best of all. Almost corresponds to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions, such as the absence of Scylla and Charybdis and the fact that the Evmey bastard recognizes Odysseus disguised in his hut not a Hollywood bi-flick with a sword and sandal. Despite the fact that the dialogues and subtitles are entirely in Italian, if someone is familiar with the storyline, he can still reflect on what is happening and what the actors are saying (assuming you have a good Odyssey text) . at hand). At least I did, and it inspired me so much to learn Italian to appreciate the film even more.
