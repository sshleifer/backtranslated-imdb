First, I will give my rating for the series as a whole; ******* 7 out of ten stars. I took three for the descent from the mountain, from which this series suffered after the departure of John Amos. Do not misunderstand me, later there were heavy episodes, but only after Esther Roll left for the season and returned. <br /> <br /> In February 1974, the premiere of a truly excellent sit-coma (with dramatic overtones) CBS. At first it was television, a show about an African-American family living in the Chicago projects in the 1970s. Created by Norman Lear as a by-product of Mod, he once again struck the audience rightly. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a comedy of situations after this show, which directly referred to the struggle of urban families. (Well, in 1994 there was Fox Central's South, but it was not updated.) had to do any father. his family and his children went the wrong way in life. <br /> <br /> Esther Roll was a wonderful, senseless maternal figure who was on the same page as her husband when it came to raising their children. <br /> <br /> Ralph Carter as Michael is a young but very intelligent young man for his age, but stuck in a school system that does not meet his academic needs. The name of his character coincides with the name of the founder of the series Mike Evans, whose name was Lionel Jefferson in the movie "Jeffersons". (Mike Evans passed away in December 2006). <br /> <br /> Telma is a young girl of 16-17 years old who has to face the dangers of being a young woman on the streets of the ghetto. Jimmy Walker as JJ Evans Jr. is a typical young man with a clever and intelligent character who does not take life seriously enough. <br /> <br /> Simply put, all my favorite episodes with John Amos, with the exception of Penny. The plot lines of Gordon / Janet Jackson. <br /> <br /> After the death of James Evans, the show lost its stability and the audience left. Esther Roll left for a whole year, not wanting to play second fiddle with JJ Dyno-mite's clever man! <br /> <br /> She returned the following season, having received a guarantee that the writer would align everything. Florida neighbor Wilona Woods was a divorced woman who eventually adopted the beaten little girl Penny Gordon (played by 10-year-old Janet Jackson). Penny's violent mother was played by Toti Fields, Kim Fields's mother. <br /> <br /> In August 1979 the show came to an end, and everyone left the projects for the sake of a better life. JJ artist sold the idea of ​​a comic book company, Michael went to live on campus in college. <br /> <br /> Wilona and Penny, Thelma’s husband and Keith + Florida football player moved to the same building in the upper part of Chicago. Not the most realistic final, but by then it didn't matter.
