A matter of life and death, what can you really say in order to properly pay tribute to the genius and beauty of this film. The visual imagination of Powell and Pressburger knows no boundaries, each frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions. Switching between the bold colors of the "real world" and the bright black and white skies is ingenious, showing us visually how brighter life is. The final court scene is also fantastic, as the judge and the jury walk down the stairs to heaven to try Peter (David Niven )’s operation. <br /> <br /> All the performances are in place (Roger Livesey is outstanding), and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful, there was never a more romantic movie than this one (if I hadn’t 'I've seen it). The question of life and death is all about the power of love and how important life is. And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to watch the movie alone, the way he lights up Kim Hunter’s face, makes it even more beautiful, what a genius he can do simple things like playing table tennis, exciting. And the sound design is also flawless; how sound is muted at vital points was a decision that was ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> This is a real classic that can restore any man’s faith in movies. of my favorites for all time, that's why I put this movie on 10/10, in one word - Beautiful.
