The drama spell, created by William Mastrosimon based on his stage performance, in which Farra Fawcett plays Marjorie, who attacked her car with the rapist Joe (James Rousseau). She manages to escape, but the police tell her that they can do nothing. However, she understands that Joe has received her wallet and knows where she lives. When her housemates Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) leave for work, Joe visits her to finish what he started. After Joe humiliates and humiliates her in various ways, she gets a chance to strike back and imprison him. Well knowing that she is in a different situation, “his word is against yours,” and that technically no rape happened, she is not going to settle down on him until he admits Pat and Terry to their intentions. <br /> <br /> The film ultimately comes down to a confrontation between two opponents. As this happens, Marjorie demonstrates such ruthlessness that one has to wonder if she has become as upset as her sworn enemy. Fawcett does enough laudable work, while Rousseau is truly excellent as a lecherous creep who does his best to manipulate the situation. Since for most of the time of the film, only two characters are present on the screen, the film is intimate, suggesting that it will work even better on the stage. Director Robert M. Young does not shy away from the ugly and more exploitative elements of the situation; the film sometimes becomes uncomfortable to watch. And by the time Marjorie comes out on top, things change enough, so it’s not so easy to get her to go for blood, and hopefully Pat will help her understand the reason. <br /> <br /> “Limbs”, I felt, was a pretty good film that at least maintained interest and a fairly high level of intensity. Woodard and Scarwid are well supported (Scarwid has a wonderful moment when Terry shows himself a rape victim , and the pace is constant. Of course, the dialogue is not always very sharp, but the material is irresistible at every step. 8/10
