A very nice action game with an intertwined story that doesn't really suck. Interestingly enough, to deserve observation, and not skip past, to get to the good parts of Jenna Jameson and Asia Carrere, too, help revive it. Jenna in this sweater and in these glasses is amazing! It is worth picking up just to see her!
