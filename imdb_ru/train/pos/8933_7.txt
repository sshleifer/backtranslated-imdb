Claire Denis has repeatedly demonstrated that the film does not need to tell a story, that it is enough to create an experience that will allow the viewer to take the ingredients and make of them what they will. <br /> <br /> Allegedly, the idea within the framework of the most non-linear film is an elderly person living on the French-Swiss border, a person committed to his dogs, who still has a lover, but whose hearty status is increasingly threatening his life. He has a son with a small family who rarely meets with him, but when he discovers that he needs a heart transplant, he chooses a trip to Tahiti through Japan to get a heart transplant on the black market and revive a long-lost relationship with his son he formed Tahitian a woman many years ago. <br /> <br /> In this story outline, Denis uses his camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the vastness of nature, the interaction of a man with people. against animals, etc. In most cases, the “film” does not make sense, but this is because we try too hard to connect all the points set out before us in beautiful pictures. Life seems to be like this: we look, we see, we observe, we integrate, we process and we make out of it what we will. <br /> <br /> Using this form of filmmaking (in many ways, as she did in the strangely beautiful “Beau Travail”) Claire Denis has developed a proprietary technique. Regardless of whether the viewer finds the finished product, it largely depends on our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information. This is an interesting and fascinating film, but many viewers will consider it too long to talk about very little. Perhaps viewing again will change this. Grady harp
