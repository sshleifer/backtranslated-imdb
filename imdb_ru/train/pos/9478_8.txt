This is a good little movie with a good story that plays the most important role in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> This is a rather intriguing dramatic story in which romance is also present. The story is told slowly, but it is too good to create. The characters are nice and beautifully depicted by his actors. I am usually not a big fan of Asian acting style, but the acting in this film was simply good. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is different in its approach and style from films of other genres in the West. In a sense, this film is already more advanced due to its approach than Western films shot in the same era. <br /> <br /> I only wish his visual style would be a little better. For the film, which is considered a kind of feature film, this film definitely lacks good looking episodes. It was obviously a fairly cheap film, and it was made fairly general. Not that it was bad, it just prevented this film from being really great and elevating itself above the genre. <br /> <br /> But, well, well, this film is about a well-designed story and characters that are in it. In this regard, this film will certainly not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
