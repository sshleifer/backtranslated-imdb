I am a parent of a child with special needs, and I really liked the movie! It was loving, warm and fun. I have long learned to see humor in things. I especially thought it was nice that all the other characters were worried about Frankie and who would take care of him after the death of his grandmother. I was on the focal point of the film with other parents and siblings of children with special needs before the film was edited. Everyone liked the movie, and he really inspired great discussions. We talked about how our children make us laugh, and we also talked about how we worry about them. The writer talked about how she works with children with autism and other children with special needs as a volunteer for several years. She based the character on a real person. Our family is endowed with a sense of humor, which helped us through very difficult times. I give the film with two fingers up!
