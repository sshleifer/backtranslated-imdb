The intelligence of the plot is almost like fluff. But the advantage here is the classic rejection of the boy and girl, to which we are accustomed to the “Gay Divorce”, and the “Cylinder” is now absent. Instead of the typical casual acquaintance, the dancing duet is the former lovers of Baker Baker and Sherry Martin, who are in love with their dance days. <br /> <br /> Of course, being a musical of the 30s, there are problems misunderstood romance, cool courtship and a slight annoyance of sabotaged listening with bicarbonate soda cost Ginger something special. And then, according to the great tradition of exhaustion of finances, there is nothing better for the best Hollywood artists than to arrange a show. <br /> <br /> Delightful numbers from Irving Berlin are scattered throughout the show. Top caps and evening dresses are kept until the very end, which remains a refreshing change. Fred and Ginger are going to enchant the world again ... and enchant the fleet. Everything and everyone is just nice again. <br /> <br /> Pure classic nonsense at its best. But with Aster and Rogers, we just know that he has to work. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.25 / 10
