Maybe some people consider this a slow movie. However, it is this “slow burning” that allows him to deeply influence the viewer. Like this wonderful first scene: first, we can hear voices; then we are allowed to see the characters; finally, the camera is slowly turning back and to the side, and we see another character, a young man who is just sitting there, obviously not even listening to the conversation or, at least, not caring much. The fact that this young man will play a leading role demonstrates the film's strategy: to allow the character to develop and be determined by his environment, but not marking points more than necessary. People come and go, flow and go out of his life. Although most of the film follows him (and most of the minor characters are visible only when they are next to him, determined in accordance with the relationships he supports), we tend to believe that we are objective, therefore a subtle touch of the director.
