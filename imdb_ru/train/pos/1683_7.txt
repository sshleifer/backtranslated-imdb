I saw this movie because it was the second movie on the disc where the Nasty “Blood Rites” video clip was previously banned. Since the Blood Rites were absolutely terrible, I really did not expect much from this film; but in fact, it seems that filmmaker Andy Milligan surpassed himself this time, since Seeds of Sin headed blood rites in style and stands as a more than adequate piece of sexual exploitation of sick sixties. The plot is actually very similar to Blood Rites, since we focus on the dysfunctional family unit and, of course; an inheritance is at stake. The film was shot in black and white, and its appearance reminded me a lot of the classic “The Curious Dr Humpp”. There is almost no blood on the walls, and the director seems to want to focus on sex, through which incest and hate themes percolate. The acting is usually trashy, but at some point most women look naked and, despite their bad reputation, director Andy Milligan actually seems to be following this, since many episodes of this film are actually quite beautiful. The plot is thin paper, and most of the film is filler; but the music is striking, and the director also does an amazingly good job with the sex scenes themselves, since most of them are somewhat erotic. Overall, this is not a very good film; but he is likely to be liked by worshipers and will receive much higher recommendations than better-known and lower-quality "blood rites."
