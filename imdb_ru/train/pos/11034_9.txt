Eric Valette is obviously a talented director, like the two guys who wrote the script. That's why Mal√©fique is a great movie made in just a few bucks, but also with a lot of imagination. Well, I'm exaggerating a bit, but nonetheless, I'm sincere. So if you like dark, bloody movies, go and see this one. It is really worth it.
