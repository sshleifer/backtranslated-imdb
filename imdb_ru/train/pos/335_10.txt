I tried to learn about this series for ages! Thanks, IMDb! I saw it in childhood and never could get it out of my head. Of course, when I was 6 years old, I was particularly struck by the episode with the Cyclops, which was absolutely frightening (I said so much about this that my older brother made me a cyclops from a plastic figure of a caveman, which I am still) I remember it was an atmosphere that was unusual from the very beginning - mysterious, strict and extremely authentic. When I read the original many years later, I experienced the same feeling. It is very difficult to capture - and probably impossible in Hollywood. Every Odyssey I have seen since then has been a huge disappointment. The characters of this series seemed to be real, real people - ancient Greek people, and not Hollywood stars in costumes. This is a real masterpiece! But - Why is it no more known? And why is it not available on VHS or DVD? I just wanted to be able to see it again!
