Of course, it was a remake of the film of the 70s, but it was attended by the expectations and action of the current film, say, Breakdown. He flees, desperately trying to be with his hospitalized wife, the police the least worried. The chases were very good, the part with him cornered at the bus stop to rest was well done, the end of the film was a great climber. Is it better than Bullitt, a boring movie with something, chasing a muscle car that was filmed badly? Character Vigo knew what he needed to do to escape from Johnny Low, few films had night vision effects, CB radio - well, I forgot the name of the film, the guy 76'Caddy's upsed, toys with the guy he upset. The ending is great, you canâ€™t say whether he is faking suicide or not, very good, whether he did it or not.
