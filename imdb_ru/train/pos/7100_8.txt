I saw his film in Dallas, Texas, when it was released in 1986. I remember how they distributed prizes for coming to see the movie. After watching the movie, I understand why. The film was not bad and was not great. The problem with this film was that he was trying to tell a side story. They created a new story, new characters, and tried to wrap it around Sagi Masters. My biggest complaint is that the plot tells about the second wave of the Robotics Masters attacking Earth. They even used the same scenes from Master Saga, but with a different dialogue. In childhood I loved the movie. But, unfortunately, I did not see it as an adult and I can not give a better overview. Looking back, I was disappointed, but now I would like to watch a movie and review my position on it. With this, please, will anyone release this film for the whole world to judge? I love Robotech and can't wait for The Shadows Chronicles.
