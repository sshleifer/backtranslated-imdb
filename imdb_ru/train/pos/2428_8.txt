As an old white housewife, I can still appreciate that Lawrence Fishburne is one of our best actors. Anyone who appreciates his work, as in Deep Cover, can enjoy watching the actor's incredible acting range. Since I think this is his directorial debut, this may be even more interesting. All acting skills are pretty good. If you can’t take the lowly worlds of Lower Manhattan or the reality of criminal life (not glorified action films), then this film will not please you This is Mr. Fishburn’s usual contribution to an incredibly delicate relationship. I would really like Larry and Anthony Hopkins to meet in a movie once.
