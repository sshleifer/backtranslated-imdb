Hell, I've watched this movie at least 4 times already, and I'm still not bored watching it. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are so good and along with the music, which is absolutely awesome and perfectly suited for this film for me is simply stunning. <br /> <br /> IMHO is pretty bad IMHO, but the whole picture with black and white sensations and absolutely sterile interiors was just ... just the perfect genius combination for such a film. The whole feeling about feeling is indescribable, the plot is so good. <br /> <br /> However, there were some minor flaws in the film, for example, for example. sometimes I thought the movie was too “slow”, but I don’t mean the stage roles, I loved them very much. <br /> <br /> A very complex story also distracts me very often, for example, when it is located in an underground bunker-like device in the form of a digicorp, where all their data is stored, and has this conversation with a guy down there ... but be only me: D And the end could somehow be shown more emphatically, they should have made the part “Returning True Memory” a little longer and “louder”, but again, without all these flaws, the film would be so good that I would never stopped watching him again and again ...,
