I would even say that some shades of Hitchcock ... this is clearly better than MMM, that some, if not most Woody fans, consider guilty pleasure. By the way, did you know that Annie Hall was first conceived as a murder mystery? Anyway, Woody recovers some relevance in a comedy film with this. The plot twists are nice and tight. I will say that in the first 20 minutes or so, some of the actors are too hasty in presenting their roles, but remain in place. Scarlett Johansson played a role well in the role of Diane Keaton, and between her and the much older Woody, there was never a bad moment. No one could have imagined a better actor for the role of Peter Lyman than Jackman.
