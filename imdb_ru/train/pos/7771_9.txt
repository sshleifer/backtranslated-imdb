The absolute sum of the works of this crafty Dane Douglas Sirk (nee Detlef Zirk), written in the wind, attracts our close attention in all tasteless frames. From its fairly well-known introductory sequence, with leaves blowing into the baronial foyer of a mansion in Texas, and the wind sweeping calendar pages into memory, the film compresses in its 99 minutes the whole family intrigue that was supposed to fuel such later fakes for small screens: Dallas , Dynasty and Falcon-Comb for many years. <br /> <br /> The combination of wealth and dysfunction is a topic that Americans find in our dollar-based society irresistible. Brother and Sister Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are the spoiled, concerned heirs of Hadley, of oil fate; Buddy Rock Hudson and the new bride, Lauren Bacall, are sane outsiders trying to keep the lid on the boiling pot. (It is rumored that this story was based on Libby Holmann's marriage with Reynolds tobacco money.) As always, losers get everything they need to chew on - and the best features that can be spat out (Malone in his Oscar play is like a drunk nymphomaniac with Jones for Hudson, makes blow up a whole firework of them). Hudson, while good, cannot compete with all these excessive emotions; Bacall begins strong, but becomes recessive, just the convenience of the plot. Regardless of; Sirk with a series of scenes shot in extravagant tones gives a vivid lesson on how to turn an astounded melodrama into a lush consumer paradise of the late 50s in America. No one has ever done it better.
