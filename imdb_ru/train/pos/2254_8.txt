Fox’s epic tale of America’s greatest innovative efforts comes to DVD with some really outstanding Extras. BRIGHAM YOUNG ("Frontiersman" was added for the European release) telling the story of a great pioneer leader who, under inspiration, led members of the Mormon faith (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847 after mobs killed their prophet / leader, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price), was presented on screen in 1940, just as America was about to enter World War II. It was the bold move of Fox leader Darryl F. Zanuka, and it was a breath of fresh air for the Mormons, as this was the first attempt by the film to show its faith on the screen. Fox, now working with James D'Arc, curator of the superb film archive at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, translated this film into DVD in an outstanding release. Mr. D'Arc, who several years ago did a doctoral dissertation on the film, provided one of the deepest tracks with commentaries ever made for a DVD. He separates fact from fiction and allows listeners to understand why these films were so highly valued by church leaders, even though the film contains adornments to the truth. One of the fun pieces of information concerns Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the main role. Many years after the film, he married a woman of the last centuries and eventually accepted faith in the LDS. You can learn a lot from D'Arc's knowledge, and it's great that this is part of a DVD! The CD features over 100 photographs from the Fox & BYU archive, as well as footage from the incredible premiere at seven theaters in Salt Lake City. Thanks to FOX for another outstanding DVD - and thanks to James D'Arc for your wonderful comment!
