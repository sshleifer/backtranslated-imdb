Shakespeare said that we are actors put on the big stage. But when this stage is Israel, the work that we interpret is multiplied by ten, and all the actions we do are full of rigid style. Dan Katzir manages to make an impressive portrait of a part of life in Tel Aviv, but, in addition, Katzir manages to penetrate the heart of the Israeli people, and these people, far from being just outstanding personalities, tell us whole-heartedly, the Katzir film allows Israel to escape from the dark informative the realm in which they live, and this wonderful country is born into the world like a magnificent bird that is born from its ashes. This is very good for me, because the reality of the State of Israel, which Europeans know only from informative diaries or newspapers, looks like an intimate and completely human reality, the reality of millions of people who are looking for its place, exploring the entire state, the whole culture with the sole purpose of feeling part of it. Katsir creates an absolutely wonderful documentary, and he demonstrates that when a person shoots with passion, the deepest feelings are projected with force, and these feelings penetrate our hearts. Thank you, Dan, for opening our eyes and giving us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries in the world.
