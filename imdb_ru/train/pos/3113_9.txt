Bourne's ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role in history), the newest spy in the block, completes his search for his identity, as he also seeks to complete the latest CIA program "Blackbriar" to make super killers like himself. <br /> <br /> I was so excited about it that I watched its predecessors yesterday and today. Identity was as brilliant as I recall, and Excellence remains a weak (but still pleasant) link in the chain for the weakest plot and, apart from the car chase, which the race of this film easily pursues, a slight lack of action and suspense. <br /> <br /> Woooo, the Ultimatum is not waiting! Even when you know that Bourne will avoid power (and these films show that the police are inept), it’s still great to see how he does it. It's amazing to think that two guys with guns and mopeds can create 10 times more uncertainty than what giant robots did for $ 150 million in Transformers. <br /> <br /> Chat with Paul Greengrass, who has this unique style of shooting stedicam as a documentary, although he shoots characters that are quite unusual in places like the CIA headquarters, where no one is within 10 Miles will not be allowed to use the camcorder. He seems to have listened to my various complaints about “Excellence”, since the action in the Ultimatum is nothing but awe-inspiring, when the various tools used as weapons are a candlestick, a hardcover book (I will never look they also) and electric fan (do not ask). The music also helped create more tension, and there was hardly a moment not to bite. <br /> <br /> The game is good, and the evolution of Julia Stiles’s character “Nicky” has put her situation in a new very responsive light. Damon plays his subscription role with restraint, but with competence (which sounds insignificant, but actually it looks like Matt Damon can evade the CIA, and Interpol is something), but there are visible moments of sharpness, as he is still trying to find his humanity . His desire for real life may become boring, and almost worked for Supremacy, but it works better in Ultimatum (the best scenario). <br /> <br /> I remember the scene in The Golden Eye (Pierce Brosnan's only good movie about Bond) in which the character of Shaun Bean asks James if martinis ever drown out the cries of all the people he killed. Born regrets all the people he killed and considers (or, at least, made me think) about the meaning of action without a goal, life without meaning, and how the government turned people into resources. Although resources that know Krav Maga and know how to make weapons from anything. <br /> <br /> Sidenote: I was always worried that, despite the fact that the CIA and Interpol and the police hunt almost everywhere, wherever they are, he is pursuing the CIA. The fact that Born never thought that he would undertake even the slightest attempts to hide his features or to forge some new passports. Sunglasses maybe? <br /> <br /> If you have momentum and love action movies, then Bourne Ultimatum is for you. Damn, this is probably the best fighter to be released this year. Of course, you would be a fool to see this without first looking at others. It seems to be drawing to an end, but I almost feel like not to notice it. This is the first film “3” this summer, which at least corresponds to, if not surpasses, the original, and that says something. <br /> <br /> A-
