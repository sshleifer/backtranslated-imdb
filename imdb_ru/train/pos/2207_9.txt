Not a bad word to say about this film indeed. Initially, it did not impress me, but it quickly grew on me. I like it a lot, and I think it is a shame that many people cannot see in the past the fact that it was banned in some territories, including mine. The film in the department of shock, blood and atmosphere. The score is a wonderful device for delivering unknowns. It only seems fair that Chris Young has become one of the best composers in the business. The acting in this film is somewhat high standard, if in some places it is a little wooden, and the effect is very real and sandy. All this is high praise for a good directorial film in my book. In some reviews, I noted that the film gained a serious reputation after shooting the famous killer "POV." And I ask: WHAT ISN'T THAT? This is a classic snapshot, causing fear to any good fan of the genre and allowing the killer’s identity to be kept secret. The only thing that keeps this film from getting top marks in my book is that the unexpected twist (uncovered by the killer) is not handled with more caution, I mean, it happens rather quickly, although great views make it almost trustworthy. Besides the fact that PRANKS is a great movie (although I prefer the original title), it’s a shame that so many people confuse it as just cheap stuff. It's more than that, but few know what seems to have been lost in the haze of the early 80's slasher. What a shame .... These are really good movie people! Believe me!
