Exposing the trend of “demon-meetings-clergy” in the late 60s - early 70s, which most noticeably included the triptych “Baby Rosemary”, “Exorcist” and “Omen”, “Guardian” Also, this is just as good ( although the most forgotten of the whole lot). In a sense, he combines the best elements of these films and throws into the line of the “Lessee” of Polanski (which was released the same year) for good measure.

Waking up with a loud noise over her apartment, she soon discovers that the dumb priest and she are the only inhabitants in the building left without a news report. From there, director Michael Winner (“Death Wish”) triggers this supernatural thriller, and the devilish jubilation causes the hallucinogenic torture that it inflicts on its heroine. With the support of a brilliant cast, subtle storyline and excellent make-up from Dick Smith (“The Exorcist”), “The Sentinel” is a really creepy horror movie.
