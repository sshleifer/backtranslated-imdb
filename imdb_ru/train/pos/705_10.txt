I stumbled upon the Nightmare of Insomnia when I was looking for unusual independent films, and am glad to say that it did NOT disappoint. This crazy trip for half an hour made me think, and the finale was excellent - one of those moments of NOOOOO that really stays with you. I showed it to many people, and everyone seems to agree hands down. The little ghostly girl was very talented, and I think her performance stole the show. She the hell dropped out of me, I can say so much. Nanavati did a great job connecting this short circuit. All the pieces just fell into place, and you can say that she is a great writer from what she did with this script. SO well written. This is undoubtedly the strongest part of the film. The direction was great and the acting was enjoyable, but the most important factor here is the strength of the script. Good job for this girl, I can't wait to see more!
