This is one of my favorites, along with Marietta Hartley and Robert Lansing's Sandy episodes, as well as Agnes Moorehead and Tiny Cosmonauts. <br /> <br /> This is an important example since mid-1961. about the long cold war in which the US was then dragged. The broken urban scene, the meager dialogue of almost starving characters, their worn out uniform and minimal action “speak” about everything: the absurdity of the ongoing conflict that threatens to destroy human life, modern civilization and all that is pleasant and redemptive about it. <br /> <br /> This is a “fable” because it was made at the time when events occurred in other words, for example, the second Berlin crisis (spring 1961) and the subsequent Cuban missile crisis (October 1962) , it would actually be a rational representation of one of the major cities in the United States, destroyed and replete with several unfortunate survivors. I also see it as a “fable” because it is not only a cautionary story, but also because it is the most redemptive of all our popular myths: this is the story of any vi, formed in an incredible situation and involving two extremely mismatched lovers.
