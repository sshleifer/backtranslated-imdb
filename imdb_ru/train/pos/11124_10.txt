SOPRANOS (1999-2007) <br /> <br /> Number 1 is a television show of all time. <br /> <br /> Everyone thought it was nonsense that would not pass by the pilot episode. The soprano has become a cultural phenomenon and is universally recognized as one of the greatest television shows of all time. <br /> <br /> James Gandolfini plays the mysterious crime boss of New Jersey Tony Soprano, accompanied by a star train. Edie Falco is gorgeous as an anxious, loving middle-class mother; Tony Sirico is amazing as a superstitious, gray-haired concilier who is often very funny. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the series was often criticized for the negative stereotype about Italians and Americans as a mob, and to some extent this is undeniable, I see so many positive moments in the series. Image of strong family values, friendship, love and compassion; Could this be on the rude gangster tv show? Yes. In addition, other acute problems are discussed, such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs, etc. This is not a petty, boring show about tough guys and violence. It has a lot more. Many of the problems that we see on the show are very real. <br /> <br /> The writing, which was largely magnificent, so successfully touched on current problems and managed to immerse them in the lives of the characters, which makes it all the more interesting. <br /> <br /> Credit must go to David Chase, who created the superb television treasure, and to James Gandolfini, to imagine the most complex and mysterious character of television. <br /> <br /> Simply exceptional. <br /> <br /> 10/10
