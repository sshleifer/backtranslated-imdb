I was probably one of the few Australians who did not watch tennis when this series came out. I have to say that when William McInnes first appeared, I think this is one crappy actor! But when the series continued, it lowered its performance, and I totally loved it. He was such a rotten guy, but he made me laugh. I watched the show to see Hugo Spears (Heart and Bones, Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). It was interesting to watch Spiers playing a nice, calm person, and even more interesting to watch how the muscles of Tom Long are muscular! Sigh ... Seriously, the performance of Long was a complete shock and really brilliant. He stole the show. Martin Saks was good and in a small role, and the leading actress played a spectacular role. I would recommend this program if you like stories with a twist and observation of how Tom Long walks without a shirt ...
