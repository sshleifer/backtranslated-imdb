The documentary begins in 1986 in New York, where black and Spanish transvestites hold balls. That's where they dress the way they like, put their things in front of an audience, and vote for them. We meet many members and see how they all stick together and support each other. As one person says to another: “You have three blows on you — you are black, gay and a transvestite.” These are people who (unfortunately) are not accepted in society - only at the ball. There they can be anyone and anyone and be accepted. Then the film ends after three years (1989), and you see how things have changed (unfortunately, for some). <br /> <br /> Sounds depressing, but it is not. Most of the respondents are actually very funny and get a lot of humor in their situations. They know their position in society well and perceive it with humor - just as they should. We find that they all live in “houses” run by different “mothers”, and all help each other. The sense of community in this film is amazing. <br /> <br /> When this film was released in 1990, it was controversial and was a great success. It won the Best Documentary Awards at numerous festivals - but it was never even nominated for an Academy Award. Their cause was "Black and Latin American transvestites are not Academy material." Fascinating right? Homophobia and racism all together. <br /> <br /> It is evident that today it is still a great film - and the historical part. It's just not the case anymore - New York, which they show, no longer exists. The balls still hold, but not in the spirit that we see here. In addition, resistance has become more “accepted” in society (for better or for worse). And I heard the houses disappeared too. This is a little sad. I would like to know where these characters are now - I know that two died of AIDS, but I have no idea about the others. And what happened to that 13 year old and 15 year old shown? <br /> <br /> However, this is a one-of-a-kind documentary - fascinating, fun and exciting. Must see all the way! Specified 10. Where is the DVD?
