Although this film is somewhat filled with eighties cheese, I have room for it in my DVD rack, and I don't know why. I think I like it, because the moral of this story is: "Television is rubbish, so turn it off, go and get a life." For those of you who decide to listen to the message, you should try to read the book, itâ€™s not at all like a movie. To destroy it for you at the end of the story, mortally wounded Richards eventually crashed into the plane into the network building, killing himself, all inside and closing the network at the same time. I read it many years ago, but today it would be difficult not to compare it to 9/11.
