I never knew who was Robert Woole before I saw it. But seeing this, I realized how funny he is. This is a feature of HBO, it teaches "American history" to cinema students in New York, and this person is just phenomenal. He mocked almost every key historical event that happened not only in the United States, but also in some other parts of the world. This documentary / comedy was a great satire that made me think about whether or not what I accept as an infallible true story is true. <br /> <br /> I liked how Mr. Woole managed to mix useful information with great comedy and learned much more exciting. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in history and wants to wonder what his / her beliefs are.
