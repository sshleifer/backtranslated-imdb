Beautiful Danish actress Sonia Richter steals this film from under everyone's nose, a considerable feat, given the amazing actions surrounding her. <br /> <br /> Richter plays Anna, a non-working, independent person, a somewhat neurotic (and possibly suicidal) actress who does a desperate job looking after a wheelchair-bound, dumb, aged father named Valentin actor Fritz Helmut, who died at 77 shortly after this film was shot). <br /> Alert spoiler <br /> <br /> Valentine refuses to answer anyone - until he confronts the gifted Anna, whose bizarre and harmful manner returns the poor old battered devil back from his death sentence. <br /> <br /> Writer / director / actor Eric Clausen made a strong film about the difficulties that the heavy son of a businessman (JÃ¶rgen, played by Clausen) loves his father, who never accepted him. The film sags to an end, but Clausen has several important things that can be said about euthanasia, the nature and value of love and care, and how one person, the irrepressible Anna, can change the course of human life. Highly recommended. Speech by Sony Richter in itself is worth the cost of admission.
