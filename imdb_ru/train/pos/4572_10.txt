As a person who has lived with a brain injury for more than forty years, I find this film inspiring. If someone with a serious case of CP, like Kristi Brown, can do so much, then there is no reason why I could not fulfill my own dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker both perform amazingly. <br /> <br />
