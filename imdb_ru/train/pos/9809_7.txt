Randolph Scott goes to Albuquerque to get a job with his uncle. However, on the way there, the scene is delayed - even if they do not carry a cash drawer. However, the nice lady on board is hiding $ 10,000 for her and her brother's work ... and the robbers seem to know this. <br /> <br /> One day in the city of Scott goes to his uncle about work. However, he soon learns that this uncle is a jerk - a typical bad guy from Westerns. You know, a rich guy who wants to become even richer, deceiving, stealing and threatening, until he owns everything. And it just so happened that this jerk was behind the robbery. Scott demands that his uncle return the money, and then Scott enters into business with a nice lady and her brother. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, this is NOT the end of problems - just the beginning. Intrigues of different types arise again and again to try to crush the resistance of the uncle. One trick is to attract a pretty girl to make friends with Scott and his partners. She is reckless, and it looks bad for Scott - until he finds out why she came to the city. <br /> <br /> Unlike most of the more recent Randolph Scott films, Scott looks a bit more stubborn in this film. Too often in his films, he is the last one who offers violence, but in this film he quickly offers lynching (cheating the law, let's have some fun), and later he quickly threatens his uncle. How amazing to see him so hot - although in most of the others he is the very old Scott you expect. <br /> <br /> As for the film, there is nothing unusual about it. Gabby Hayes plays an ordinary character, Scott is a hero, a villain cannot be argued and eventually destroyed, and Scott gets a girl. Despite this very typical plot, it all works out very well and as a result is worth the time spent. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are two strange scenes in the movie. First, at the end of the film, there is a fistfight between Scott and Uncle Aide No. 1, Lon Cheney, Jr. In it, Cheney smokes during the fight - something I had never seen before, and I admired how he could puff away, how he got hit in the ass. Secondly, take the load of this impetuous cart with a whip - now THIS was one impossible feat!
