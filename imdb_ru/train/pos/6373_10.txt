Atlantis was much better than I expected. In a sense, it was a better story than in other films aimed at a higher age. Although this film from time to time demanded such attention. It was a great movie for all ages. I noticed that some of the younger audience were expecting a comedy, but got an adventure. I think everyone is tired of the endless parade of extreme parodies. Many of these children have not seen anything but a parody. After a short time, everyone seemed to be watching Atlantis very closely.
