De Groot is a very good movie. A great story comes from a novel by Tim Krabbe, who also adapted this story for the screen. Some really first-class actors are not only Van Huet, but especially Marcel Hensem, who mostly worked on television before his performance with Axel van de Graaff. The film seems to be a thriller, and creates a great mood. Then we begin to learn about Egon Vagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story unfolds gradually in a very convincing inverse structure that adds to the more romantic aspect and dramaturgy of the film. In the end, it all ends with an emotional ending that captures the audience by the throat. Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to watch this movie. Be sure to take a look, especially if you like 'Spoorloos' (original adaptation of The Vanishing screen).
