Saw this click on ENCW for the last time for the third or fourth time. I liked it so much that I ordered a DVD. This is truly outstanding and, of course, the first of the Mann-Stewart pair. More here than regular porridge, though not as powerful as The Searchers. There is a lot of obvious symbolism about achieving masculinity, but basically this is the game of Stuart, his partner Millard Mitchell, Shelley Winters and Waco Johnny Dean - Dana Durya. Steve Miller (not the Joker) is interesting because a handsome man would be a hero who is interested in Lola but too yellow. Like Stuart in The Man Who Killed Freedom, he is practically forced to put on an apron and serve coffee to his enemies. Caffeine-free without a doubt. Tony Curtis from the Bronx cavalry and Rock Hudson behave like no other Indian I saw on the screen with interesting cameos. <br /> <br /> The special speeches of John McIntyre as a too lucky card merchant / gun dealer who hangs on a very low-quality western version of the American cafe Rick. No one wants to spend the night there. Jay C. Flippens for the kiss from Lola (Winters) and some nice scenes with Stuart before he gets to the Bend of the River and the Far Country. Will Gere in the role of Wyatt Earp and the Indian chief who takes Walter Brennan's teeth from him in the Red River are pleasant observations. This is the Western style that only Stuart could do, and not Wayne and Scott. It is a shot, I repeat. :-)
