Sudden exposure is usually seen as Eastwood's artistic failure at the time of his career, when he established himself as a director. The reason is not really in the film itself, but in its relation to vigilance, which it seems to support. In some places, it actually owes Death to Desire more than the original Dirty Harry film. Some may argue if this is the case - after all, this is a film about wine, justice and retribution. For me, in the end, this is more sympathy than sympathy. However, taking into account all these arguments, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the sudden impact is a very well-made film. Forget "Go ahead, punk, make my scene of the day", this is symbolic, but not original. But take a look at the aerial views of San Francisco and zoom in on the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are pretty impressive. Or take a look at the brilliant scene where Sondra Locke’s character visits his mentally ill sister in the hospital. Eastwood makes extensive use of face mapping. In general, “Sudden Impact” is a very visual film that really shows how mature Eastwood is the director. And if I remember correctly, it was actually the first time Eastwood put that on the screen, although in an action movie of debatable ideology. In addition, I think this is the first well-made film shot by Eastwood. Although Eastwood has a great talent as a director, drama has always been his weak point (see “Listen to Misty for me,” “Breeze,” etc.). The space of the story leads to the fact that the visual elements are well integrated into the film and do not distract attention from the story. The only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog.
