One of the most heartbreaking foreign films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A young girl is an amazing talent. Star performances of her (Doggie), the old man (the king of the masks) and Liang (Live Boddhisattva). <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) The terrible attitude towards children, especially women, is a matter of concern. <Br /> <br /> I really liked the music. The original Chinese dialogue reinforces the emotional intensity of the performances and plot. <br /> <br /> This MUST SEE is a pleasant family film, although not for the youngest children. The DVD release would have been rated even higher if the soundtrack were transferred to DVD better, and the broadcast included a widescreen version.
