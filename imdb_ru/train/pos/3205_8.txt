I saw it in the theater, and I immediately thought that it was good enough to have on video. Anyway, I'm a big fan of sci-fi action movies. <br /> <br /> Without telling a single story, you should see if you like Sci-Fi without thinking. The story is basic, and the plot is very good. It is worth spending time looking at it! <br /> <br /> Maybe they will make a sequel? :) <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
