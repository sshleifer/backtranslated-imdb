With the Twelve Monkeys, you need to pay attention, but if you do, you will probably find a lot of value. I know what I did. The story is interesting and dedicated to time travel. The virus killed many people back in 1997, and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) went in 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990, he was arrested and placed in a psychiatric hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goynes (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets the psychiatrist Dr. Catherine Reilly (Madeleine Stowe), who does not believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from a mental hospital, when he is chained and locked in a room, and reappears in 1996, Catherine begins to believe Cole’s tales. br /> <br /> The film is constantly playing with time. Cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, is picked up in the future and “they” send someone. For Cole, this someone appears a few seconds after the phone call. Things like this happen throughout the entire movie, and therefore you have to keep attention. You might ask a few questions, but since you cannot have the answer yourself, it’s better to agree with the film. <br /> <br /> The Twelve Monkeys work like science fiction, with some gorgeous images and a dark atmosphere. and it works like a thriller. You are never sure what will happen next, and it will help the film. Perhaps there are some flaws in this story, but since this is a fictional thing, such as time travel, you should accept what the film tells us and just try to enjoy. It was the easy part for me.
