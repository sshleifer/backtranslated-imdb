I was very entertained by the film. It was my favorite 1976 movie. Being brought up in the 70s, I was so in love with the image and behavior of Chris Christofferson, of course, I am not a film critic, but for the era of time, I think it was very good. I really like the combination of Streisand and Christopherson. I thought they worked very well together. I have seen the movie many times and still love them both as Esther and John Norman. I am a very big fan of Chris and I see him at a concert when I can. What a talented singer, songwriter, not to mention an actor. I have seen him in many films, but I still remember that the star was born.
