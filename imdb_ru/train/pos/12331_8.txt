Being the man who lists The Night of the Living Dead at number three in her five most-loved films of all time and at the same time loves this parody of a student film, I feel I must protect this film from previously published sharp reviews. This short, but sweet opus was always liked by the crowd at marathons of horror films and fiction, where those present love the genre, but they also know that zombie films should not be taken too seriously. This film is a tribute to the original, not an insult. It must be funny, and many others whom I have heard, sing and applaud, agree with me that it works. Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD more than 50 times. Follow the cameo director as news reporter Jeff Drexel, and also if you have the chance to catch his parody of Aliens, Baton.
