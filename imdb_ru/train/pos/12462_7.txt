Noni Hazlehurst’s tour-of-force performance (which earned her an AFI award), at least on a par with her efforts in FRAN three years later. Colin Friels is also good, and for those interested, Alice Garner appears as Noni's child, and Michael Caton (best known as LOCK) is a bearded artist. (It is also interesting that Hazlhurst is currently leading the “BEST HOUSES AND GARDENS” lifestyle program, and “Caton” - the leading programs of the type of property, including “HOT PROPERTY”, “HOT AUCTION”, etc.) perhaps the best Australian actress in the early and mid 1980s. Rating: 79/100.
