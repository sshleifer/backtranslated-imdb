I will not go into the details of the plot of this film, since other reviewers have considered almost the same thing. <br /> <br /> Just wanted to say that I really liked the movie. The production of Peter Falk is reason enough to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> The short film “The Trip” with Falk and Paul Reiser in upstate New York in the fall is the scene for most of the action in the film. . <br /> <br /> Very well written for an adult target audience. A lot of realistic humor and well-played drama make the film feel that it can be your own family. <br /> <br /> I can’t say enough about this movie, except that it’s damn shameful that a great movie like this doesn’t get any more exposure, while the other trashy ones are there. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Falk again with a big lead role, and he does most of that. This proves that his famous friend, writer and director John Casavettes was right that he played Falk in many of his innovative films from the 60s and 70s.
