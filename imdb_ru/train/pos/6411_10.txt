This is one of the best war movies ever. And this is great because it focuses on values. This is an interesting story about people, which includes a desire for honor, loyalty, love and determination. <br /> <br /> Gooding and DeNiro excel in leading roles. It is nice to see that the racism of the Master of the Leader develops towards respect and love thanks to the determination, aspiration and, yes, the sense of honor of Karl Brashir. The name indicates the source of their connection. I never noticed, until the last time I looked, how brilliantly I portrayed Karl Lumbly, father of Karl, Mac Brashire. In a sense, the film’s cornerstone is that Karl’s memory of his father helps him move through difficult times. <br /> <br /> I am selective about which films I buy. This is one of those rare ones that I want on my shelf. I am sure in the future it will be seen many times.
