This film is beautifully decorated! There are no flaws. Not in the design of the set, lighting, sound, plot. The scenario is an invitation to a challenging game in which participants perform a simple mission. <br /> <br /> Paxton plays the best in his roles. His manners, infections, used in the tones of his voice, are not in doubt. Every shot is carefully made! Surprises appear one after another when the film reaches its first hour. This may not be the best picture of the year, but it is a gem that was very polished. This is not for the simple mind.
