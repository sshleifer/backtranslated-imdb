Vanilla Sky was a very well thought out film. Rather, “Abre Los Ojos” was well thought out. I watched this movie late in the evening, excited about what was going to happen. I was not disappointed. By the end of the film I was amazed. I could not get it out of my head. The whole idea of ​​it just blew me away. The ending was more unexpected than Shyamalan could ever The storyline was also something that kept me through. Cast, superb. It was a great movie. You can watch this film again and again and always find something new. I saw it four or five times, and I always find something new. This is a movie to interest you forever.
