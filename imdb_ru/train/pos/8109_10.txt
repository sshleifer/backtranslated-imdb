The story of HG Wells about what was to happen was turned into a film in 1935. A very well-made sci-fi tale about the war that lasts for decades. Excellent cast: Raymond Massey (arsenic and old lace) Sir Cedric Hardwick (ghost of Frankenstein) Ralph Richardson (temporary bandits) and Margaret Scott. First glances at helicopters, holograms, rocket ship and futuristic cities. This film is ahead of its time. Directed by William Cameron Menzies (invaders from Mars) very much, like the earlier film "Metropolis" (1927), but avoid the so-called sequel, which was made in 1979. This film has nothing to do with the original. People like Jules Verne had their own vision of the future. His classic fantastic movie. 10 out of 10
