Warning: contains spoiler. Corny plot and in many cases a terrible play of actors. Fontaine is great, but some others, especially Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are very wooden. She lies in bed, dying from arsenic poisoning, with every hair in place. And yet the film is so juicy and so tense. More true to the book than most films of its era. Using Joan Fontaine as a poisoner (and an adulteress who was just as shocking at the time â€” I'm not kidding, kids) was a masterstroke. She is just her ordinary Joan Fonteyni. As the assassin assumed, she dies, falling "with her feet on the floor into an empty space."
