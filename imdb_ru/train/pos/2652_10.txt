Why nowadays more directors can not create horror films, such as "Shine"? It's easy to answer: modern directors are not Stanley Kubrick. In this film, Kubrick proved once and for all that he is truly one of the greatest directors and authors of all time. <br /> <br /> So the plot is pretty simple. A man named Jack Torrance (brilliantly played by Jack Nicholson) and his family move to a large secluded hotel to look after him during the off-season. The kicker is that the previous hotel keeper brutally killed his wife and two girls. What follows can be easily summarized by the title of the film, but you have to watch it in order to understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is the first film in a long time that seemed “scary” to me. ” This is something seriously confusing, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the chilling factor is amazing music. Music was a major part of Kubrick’s films (2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple), and it certainly does not disappoint with this. The score sets the tone completely, and this film will not be the same without it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to comment on the legendary game of Nicholson. Jack is terribly convincing like a crazy killer. In fact, just his eyes stole several scenes of this film. This is a first-class game to see to be believed. <br /> <br /> There will never be a horror movie that perfectly matches this. REST IN PEACE. Stanley.
