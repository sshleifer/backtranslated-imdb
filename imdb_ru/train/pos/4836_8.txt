I saw the film a few days ago on a videotape, and although it was difficult for me to swallow it all at once (because of its length and history), I really liked it. I was impressed first with the script and then with the implementation of this script. The film will give you a ride, but this is not an easy, joyful ride; it passes through time and various political regimes and shows their influence on the lives of ordinary people. What I loved was the inner logic that the film followed; logic, which, like the logic in life, was at times rather illogical and confusing, but in the end, when I thought about it, all the events and turns made sense. However, it makes no sense to try to retell the story, since it has spread over more than 50 years. I also liked the character of Alexei Nikita Mikhalkov and the way he played it, as some critics saw, with restless dedication. What I didn’t like about this is that, I think, he later played characters that remind me of Alexei in films like “Cruel Romance” (“Cruel Romance”, which I really love) and to some extent in “Insulted and Wounded” (“Humiliated and Insulted”). Sibiriad shows, I think, what a great director Andrei Konchalovsky was before going to Hollywood and making such unforgettable films as Tango and Cash and less forgotten, for example, Runaway Train. I would prefer them "Hen Ryaba" ...
