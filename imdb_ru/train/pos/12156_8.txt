Some of the basic details of this story, very, very poorly, are based on real events of the era in which this happened. The story combines some of the details of the famous work of Leopold and Loeb and a little about Aimee Semple Macpherson. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the prosecution of two mothers (Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds) when they leave the courtroom. The mob seems to be most eager to injure them, since their sons have just been convicted of a heinous crime. One person in the crowd seems to be chopping Winters' hand as they head towards the waiting car. <br /> <br /> Shortly after arriving home, they begin threatening telephone calls, so Reynolds invites them to move to the West. Coast together and open a dance school. The dance school is a success, and they cater to incredibly nasty parents who think their child is the next Shirley Temple. One of the parents of these spoiled children is a multimillionaire who is very smitten with Reynolds and they start dating. Life seems very good. But when threatening telephone calls begin again, Winters responds with a shutdown — behaves as if he is approaching a psychotic break and goes farther and farther into religion — almost constantly listening to sister Alma on the radio. Again and again, you see Winters on the brink, and this ultimately leads to very bad things! I will not say more, because it can spoil this tense and interesting film. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this film is in many ways similar to the horror films of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford of the 1960s, such as “What Happened” to Baby Jane? , "Straight Jacket" and "Nanny". While none of them are absolutely intellectual fare, at the level of kitsch they are extremely interesting and fun. The letter is very good, and at the end there are several good turns that make it all very exciting. Winters is gorgeous as a frail and insane lady, and Reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39-year-old girls I've ever seen - plus she can really, really dance. <br /> <br /> My only concern for all of this is that some may find Winters' hyper-religiosity in the film somewhat tasteless - like a cheap attack on Christianity. At first, I felt that way, but when you meet Sister Alma, she seems sincere and doesn’t scoff, so I took Winters’s religious zeal as just a sign of insanity — which I suppose is all that was supposed to be. /> <br /> By the way, this film is packed with Whoever Kills Aunt Roo, another horror film from 1971, Shelley Winters. Both are very fun ... and very cool!
