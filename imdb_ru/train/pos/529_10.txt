This is one of the most underrated gems ever created by Hollywood. - A young British as-fighter of World War II, whose plane is about to crash, has radio contact with a young American woman who comforts a brave pilot, knowing that in a few minutes he will die. For some reason, a person who, undoubtedly, must be dead, moves away from the wreckage and eventually finds out that he had to report to heaven. When a courier is sent to ask a pilot to accompany him to paradise, the person refuses and demands that his “day in court” discuss his case. The man claims that his position has changed in the last moments of his mortal life, that he fell in love and therefore became another person who deserved a chance to live on. <br /> <br /> “Heavenly Yard” is cinematic enjoyment! “Announcement of a jury of colleagues” is a specific event. The story, no matter how fantastic it sounds, is fascinating and will keep you captive for almost 2 hours of playing time. The final scene is simply beautiful and will require “Kleenex treatment” for most viewers. This movie is in my personal favorite top ten, and I recommend it!
