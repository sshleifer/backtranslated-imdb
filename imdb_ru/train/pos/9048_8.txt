I resisted watching this movie, and I understand why it was not a great success in cinemas. The October Sky looks and looks so familiar. And this. All plot tricks and emotions have been explored earlier in other films - and perhaps even better. But, despite his acquaintance and resistance to all the formulas of Hollywood, this film wins and is pleasant at every turn. <br /> <br /> A satellite is an inspiration for the journey of the heart, mind and soul. Just as the heroes of Stephen Sondheim’s musical “MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG” stood on the roof of their apartment, hoping that this would launch their new generation (“What do you call it? You call it a miracle?), this true tale. While the exhausted citizens of their coal town of the 1950s refuse to participate in this event, Homer Hickham sees the satellite as his ticket for life in the mines. <br /> <br /> Mastery and casting make the journey of rocket boy Homer and his buddies seem fresh and new. Particularly impressive plots about a sick young school teacher Homer. Remarkable restraint manifested in the image of their delicate relationship. Also noteworthy is the superblot of the father / son, which anchors the film. Well played. Even Homer's mom gets her moment without cliché or invasion. Her ultimatum to her husband is worthy and broken. Myrtle Beach says it all. <br /> <br /> Next to this movie there is a large chain of video that I despise, which says that you will like this movie, or they will return your money. This time I agree with them. You will never again look at the October sky in exactly the same way. <br /> <br />
