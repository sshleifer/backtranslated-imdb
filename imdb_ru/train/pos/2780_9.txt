Great movie - I liked it. Excellent editing and use of the soundtrack. It captures the real feeling of Indian life, but we can all communicate. Well chose the cast with some great characters. In the film, all the characters develop, so that you really care about them all and feel that you know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some football scenes is great, and the direction really works, since everyone seems to be real and natural. You just canâ€™t help cheering on Jess in this movie! The acting was really good, even the extravagant walk and posture of both leading women are very convincing, since someone played a lot of football.
