Although I would say that I like this show, I was expecting something completely different from when I first saw "What I like about you," I expected to find something like "All this" (I'm not sure does it happen anymore) but I have to say that I like the show, and although I do not classify it as a breakthrough show, it is very charming, and I also like the chemistry between the characters (including the cast) <br /> <I would definitely say it's great to see Wesley Jonathan on the screen, because I really loved him in the City Guy. I also saw a woman who plays Valerie’s friend in Popular, and although I think it was a normal show, I don’t really like her character in this show because she’s not my cup of tea, but she rather well rounds it.
