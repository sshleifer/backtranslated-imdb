I saw this film back in 2005 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and from the 14 films I saw there, I would call this film my number 3. I had an initial interest in seeing this creature of Swedish origin from many of my ancestors came from the Norwegian region of Sweden, where it was filmed. I also grew up in the rural North Forest of America, where many small towns were very much like the scenery of this film. It is great to see more films using rural areas as parameters, such as Så som i himmelen. It was a very good film, and I’m sure it’s a very difficult film for filming in a big ensemble, but director Kay Pollock really did it after almost two decades of no directing. Helen Sjöholm in her movie debut as an actress was fantastic, and I would look forward to her appearance on the big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nyquist at the head of this all-round cast. I would highly recommend this film and rate it 9.0 on a scale of 10.
