... it may seem an exaggeration, but it is not. <br /> <br /> What is so difficult to understand - why did they not make more similar musical shorts? Wasnâ€™t the beauty of this apparent to all participants? I think no. So many shorts were made only for commercial reasons, and, if lucky, there could be some artistic value. Is this one exception the only one? - where, it seems, the director had a vision, and he clearly could appreciate music as art. Why no one ever thought of shooting Lester or Charlie Parker at a concert? Crazy, man. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that there was no continuation. If you saw something of a similar quality, please share it!
