Jay Chou plays an orphan, brought up in a kung fu school, but kicked out by a corrupt school principal after he fought with a bunch of thugs for using a vile villain. He is confronted with the cheater of failure, Eric Tsang, who immediately sees the potential of money in the skills of a young man. Basketball is the chosen path to wealth, and Tsang invites him to take a place in the university team and promote it in the media. Overall success leads to a basketball championship and a really nasty rival team, driven by the same vile villain than before. <br /> <br /> I think it's all a bit of Shaolin Soccer, but not so bizarre or ridiculous - the plot is very good close to sports films and provides all the elements that the crowd expects from the installation. You've seen it all before, but these are things that never hurt to see again, when everything is done well. Fortunately, it is really well done here (some may say “amazing” with Chu Yen-Ping in the director's chair ... I expect he had good "helpers") - the script gives out, and the presentation is nice and stylish. Jay Chou remains virtually indifferent, but that is his style, and when he allows emotions to flicker, this can lead to a rather good comic effect. Eric Tsang compensates himself with a character who is bigger than the life he played many times before (for example, in real life), who gets the most emotional moments in many films. <br /> <br /> Since the film revolves around basketball, it's good that the scenes of basketball matches are exciting. The cast demonstrates some real skills, including Chow, as well as some well-performed work and CGI, which add an element of Kung Fu's hyperreal skill that makes the scenes even more exciting (if you like these things) and justifies the plot / existence of the film. . <br /> <br /> There is only one significant fight scene in the film, but in the “one against many” style it looks unnatural. Jay Chou seems to make a lot of his own movements, and this is quite impressive - he is obviously quite strong and fast for real, and the choreography of Ching Siu-Tung makes him look like a real martial artist. I wish there were more, but at least it is a long battle. <br /> <br /> Very similar to the Chinese New Year blockbuster, I was hoping that it would be from the trailer, and recommended for viewing!
