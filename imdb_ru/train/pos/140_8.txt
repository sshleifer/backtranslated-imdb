I usually don't like TV shows at all. They are all predictable, and, as a rule, they become boring and dull very quickly. <br /> <br /> These series, however, are well played, the story goes through all the episodes, and even if you miss one of them, the story will still be careful. <br /> <br /> All the episodes are filmed in the hospital and take you further and further to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lie directly beneath the surface of a powerful hospital.
