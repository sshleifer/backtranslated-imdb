You will be surprised by the incredibly complex computer animation, and the novelty probably does not wear out during the first, second or third viewing, but you will be attracted to such simple, but intriguing characters that you yourself may actually take care of them in an unexpected way that may can not make you feel a little childish because of the environment. <br /> <br /> Disney continues to firmly hold the title of “The Greatest Animation in the World”, from “The Life of a Beetle” is one of their greatest achievements. One of the innovative applications is the delightful “out-out” added to the end of the film. The DVD has two sets of these outputs, where, as I said, the VHS cassette has one alternating version for each tape. The DVD also features Jerry's Game, which is a delightful little short film PIXAR that was also shown in front of the movie in theaters. <br /> <br /> Is this definitely the best insect film compared to Dreamworks? "Antz", which, frankly, is pretty good, but lacks something in the animation, in the development of the plot and characters. If you look at the star voices of both films, “Antz” is mostly performed with loud “movie” stars and several familiar “TV” star voices, where is “A Bug? S Life "just the opposite, uploaded" TV stars with Kevin Spacey as the only outstanding exception. But the difference in quality is obvious and obvious. <br /> <br /> Dreamworks cannot be blamed or surprised, although when you go face-to-face with Disney, you get your job for you. This is such a film that almost makes me want to have children to share it with. Although for a moment do not think that this is just a film for children.
