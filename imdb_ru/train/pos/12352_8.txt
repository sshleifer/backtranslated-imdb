Me and my boyfriend really liked this movie. The viewer is swept away from modern life in old Japan, and at the same time subject to the most current topics. Characters are realistic and detailed; he has an unpredictable ending and a story that is very refreshing. The story consists of mini-plots during the life of several geishas living together in a poor area of ​​the city. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in a realistic novel or life in old Japan. <br /> <br />
