Well, that's what I think about Jack Frost. I looked at the VHS tape morph box and thought to myself: it looks interesting. I rent it and take it home. The boy was right, this is interesting. They put the spirit of a serial killer in dreams, in walking corpses and in everyday cars. But this must be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer. Inside the body of a snowman. I liked all the friendly images of a snowman, filling the landscape, pot, snow globe, etc. I like the actor who played Jack, he amused the killer who had not been since Freddy Krugger. That's right, I said it. FREDDY KRUGGER. This is the level of "cool." I would like some of the puppet effects to be better, mouth movements might be better matched. But I write it on a small budget. Actors do an excellent job with their work, there are some great liners and it scares any hardcore horror fan. In general, a great story, good effects, great dialogue and great cast. I give jack frost ... 9 STARS
