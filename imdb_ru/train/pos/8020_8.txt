I thought it was the most enjoyable Muppets movie, because I felt that it was the most carefree and had the best comic delivery on most of its lines. The dolls are trying to go to Broadway to sell the original musical they wrote, but along the way they run into ordinary problems, including Kermit's memory loss. Although there are not so many excellent cameos here, as in the original “Muppets Film”, there are such as Joan Rivers and Dabni Coleman. Just the time and delivery of so many lines are great, and the situations in which the dolls find themselves are just funny. The original songs here are also good, and the finale pleases. There is nothing more to say about the film, but Muppet fans should see it for sure. This is the funniest film about the Muppets that everyone will surely like. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
