I donâ€™t see how this show looks like OK. <br /> <br /> First, OK centers around teenagers and their parents trying to live a life. North Shore - is the hotel staff who is trying to manage the hotel and at the same time lead a social life. Secondly, OK takes place in California. North Shore takes place in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> And why does Fox arrange a show like one of the other shows on the same network? I think this is a great show with good actors for the most part. He has a good storyline and plot. I like the events that occur, and the way people care about them and solve them. The most recent episode was amazing how the story turned out. It was not predictable, like most stories on most shows. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox keeps it on the air.
