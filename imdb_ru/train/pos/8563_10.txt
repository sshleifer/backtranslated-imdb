The film tells about the events of the novel "Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni" (can be translated as "The most favorite among people"), written by Marina Predoy (very controversial book and film), a novel that became something like the Bible or the story of Hamlet, very popular and difficult to access because of its satirical content about the communist regime. It represents the drama of an intellectual person, a humanist, in the "red" world. The film is filled with passion, fear, sexuality, all the wonderful ingredients for a great movie recipe. One of the greatest Romanian films, despite its psychological charge (after all, is a European film).
