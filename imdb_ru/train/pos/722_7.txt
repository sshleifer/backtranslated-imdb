One of the greatest cult works of Roger Corman, producer of b- and c-films, was the Ramones car (originally intended for Cheap Trick), Rock N 'Roll High School. This is just a technically outdated story (but it will bring additional portions of humor to nostalgia, given that it was these very things that made the characters of Napoleon Dynamite funny - see Van Eaglebauer) about teenagers who love rock and roll. <br /> <br /> Pupils of Vince Lombardi High School encounter resistance from the evil director Miss Evelyn Togar (played by the cult favorite classic Mary Voronova), who fears that rock and roll turns children into uncontrollable amoral deviants and oaths without rock and roll. In fact, she intends to destroy rock and roll for all students, regardless of whether he is in school, and most adults who can make the plan successful work with her. <br /> <br /> But not if Riff Rundell (PJ Soles) can help him. The Ramones fanatic, she wrote a few songs (including Rock N 'Roll High School) that she wants to give to the Ramones, and, trying to do this, gets a rebuff from Miss Togar, who does everything possible so that she does not go to see the game Ramones in the city . This ends with the culmination of a rebellion between obsolete gay adults and teenagers (in the finale, in a way resembling Over the Edge). After many years of punk, when the fame of garage rockers, The Ramones (and others) marked another shift in the evolution of music, it was great to see a film that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorous, exaggerated way. <br /> <br /> This is basically a soft comedy, but nevertheless a great comedy with a good state of health, when you are in the mood for something quieter to entertain you. Jerry Zucker (from Plane) and Joe Dante (from Gremlin) are involved in some directing, and you can see what kind of humor you have (and not to mention that you expect to see Dick). Miller at least just a few minutes in the final of the film). Later, the story was probably inspired (and therefore updated) by the comedy of the mid-90s, Detroit Rock City, about minor character changes in the car for old glam rockers, Kizz. <br /> <br /> I would recommend driving past the car of Corey Feldman, Rock N 'Roll High School Forever, released almost ten years later. The original is still the best.
