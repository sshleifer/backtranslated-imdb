I really liked this movie in my childhood. At this age, I thought that stupid baseball antics were funny, and that the movie was “cool” because of the sport. Now, a few years later, I can look back and see what kind of a well-thought film it was. This film opened my eyes as a small child to the struggle faced by other children, and to the problems of the real world. Demonstrations of this kind today are largely absent in children's films, and I do not think that this benefits our society. Of course, baseball antics now seem very stupid, but they attracted children. A seven-year-old child will not be offered to watch a film about foster children, but they will be asked to watch a film about baseball. Disney realized this fact and used it to teach these children an important lesson about the world around them. <br /> <br /> In youth, the performance of Al and other angels seems much less impressive, but I will be grateful to the actors playing both children and Danny Glover, who all did a fantastic job.
