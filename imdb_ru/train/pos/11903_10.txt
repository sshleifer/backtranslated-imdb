I was lucky to catch this film during volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. I've always been a fan of classic horror movies and especially William Castle's tricks, so this was definitely a must-have for me. <br /> <br /> This is about the life and work of William Castle, who in my opinion was an underestimated director. True, he made some cheap budget horror films, but he added something to these films: real live theatrical stunts that you no longer see. For example, he had nurses in case someone had a heart attack in his films, and he put the vibrators on the legs of the chairs in TINGLER. <br /> <br /> This is a really well-made documentary that contains a rather shadowed director. into light and noted his contribution to the horror movie. He also portrays Castle as a character who is bigger than life, who really liked it and had a smile on his face. <br /> <br /> Unlike most documentaries, which mainly show testimony to film historians, SPINE TINGLER! shows interviews mainly from members of his family and directors who were influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis and Joe Dante. Be sure to look for classic lovers of horror and fiction.
