“Most of us, at least, live in two worlds, the real world, in which we are at the mercy of circumstances and the world inside, unconscious, in a safe place where we can escape ...” With these words, Mr. Gone is introduced in the world "Maxx" - a fascinating world that combines fantasy and reality. "The Maxx", inspired by Sam Keith's comic books, is very loyal to material inspired not only by history but also by graphic style that looks like comic book pages, which gives this show a surreal and unique look. But also, the story is interesting and interesting. At some moments it may become too strange, but when you get into it, it is difficult to get out of it. History and characters are well developed. Music fits perfectly with the style of the show and creates the atmosphere. Unfortunately, like many good animated shows, this one was short-lived. "Max" - this is a must see. This is one of my favorites.
