Based on the same director who starred in Candymane and Immortal Lovers, I’m not surprised that this is a good film. Ironically, “Papirsky House” is a film that I’ve never heard of before, but nevertheless, it must be one of the best films of the late 80s, partly because it’s the worst period. films over the past decades. (Not to mention the Iranian or Swedish "cinema" here ...) The game is not brilliant, but simply solid - unlike some people claim here (they must have dreamed of this "amazing game", much like Anna). The story is an interesting fantasy that does not end in a smart way that neatly ties all loose ends. These unanswered questions are likely to be left there intentionally, leaving it to the individual’s discretion, and there’s nothing wrong with such a topic. "Pepperhaus" is a somewhat unusual combination of children's film and horror with the effective use of sounds and music. I like the fact that the central character is not your typical ultra-shy, but secretly brilliant social outcast from the cliché film, but a normal, normal child; I am very refreshing. I am tired of writers projecting their own inappropriate childhood into their books and screens, as if someone wants to watch or read more about another mean, lonely childhood, as if this is all there is, or as if character background holds a monopoly on good potential. The scene with Anna and the boy who “dived” (rather long) was a bit superfluous — evoking a feeling of vague disgust and fun — given that she was supposed to be only 11, but, as expected, it turned out that Burke was 13 or 14, when it was filmed. I have no idea why they didn’t raise the character’s age or get a younger actress. It was quite obvious that Burke is not so young. Why filmmakers always leave children older than they play, therefore, dilute realism, I never know.
