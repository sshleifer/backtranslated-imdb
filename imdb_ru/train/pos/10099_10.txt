Anime that hooked me to anime ... <br /> <br /> Installed in 2010 (hey, it's not that far away now!) The earth is now a poisonous gas wasteland of pollution and violence. Seeing how crimes are committed every 30 seconds and are committed by thieves with the firepower of third world terrorists, the government of the fictional New Port City forms a tank police to solve this problem - police with tanks! Oh, madness! <br /> <br /> The “heroes” of this series are the recruit Leon Ozaki, the red-haired Japanese (yes, I know, they never compare their clearly Japanese names with the Japanese appearance), which has just been called to the police tank and quickly became a partner of a blonde with blue eyes of a nice guy Al. Leona is new to the use of tanks, and unfortunately she is destroying the tank commander’s favorite tank commander, Charles of Britain (also known as Brenten), a big guy who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and wears a pair of cool sunglasses, a big revolver and bad character. Britain did not like it when Leon joined the tank police, and she didn’t like her destruction of his Special Tiger (giant green monster tank), nor did he like it when she took the remains of his giant tank. and using it to build a mini-tank, which she calls Bonaparte, and he soon insists that she be transferred to kindergarten "where the boys are bigger than you," as he put it. There are also Specs, a bifocal genius, a Bible quote / God-fearing chaplain, a purple Mohican hunting MO, and a big-bellied leader, who is right on the edge thanks to the mayor, who is always yelling at him about the antics of the tank police. Seeing how tank police often destroy half the city, chasing the bad guys and using extreme violence to capture them, people do not like people very much. <br /> <br /> “Villains” is a cyborg named Bouak, who has a mysterious past associated with a project known as Green World, his gang and his two sexy feline cyborg girlfriends Anna and Uni Puma. In the first issue, these guys are paid for stealing urine samples from the hospital, where they treat people who are not infected with poisonous gas clouds, and in the second for stealing a painting of naked Bouak. This story, however, was not completed in the anime and was completed in the cult comic book (Manga), which is very difficult to find. <br /> <br /> All sorts of chaos and chaos occur in this black comic adventure. it analyzes how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals, and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys begins to blur. This is what if you're going to make a movie, you'd better go for Quentin Tarantino. Rough in some places, but still very fun. <br /> <br /> Following the "New Dominion: Tank Police".
