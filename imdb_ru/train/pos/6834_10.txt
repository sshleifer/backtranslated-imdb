Let's get down to business right away: this is a film that I would take with me to an uninhabited island (with a DVD player). This is just great. If the reason you are watching a film is that you love actors, you like to see them free to participate in the space and feelings, this film is for you. Look at the scene when Myrtle (Rowlands) goes on stage drunk and Maurice (Cassavetes) is forced to improvise because she no longer follows the script. If you are sensitive to the movements of the camera, you will be fascinated by the way the camera moves on stage, with a special flow that creates the impression that the camera follows actors as if it were guided by the theatrical principle of “private space”. "... amazing. And this story is just a brilliant mix of fairy tales and realistic drama. Cassavetis again argues with Hollywood and the politics of the majors, but this time he does it through Broadway, making one of the most exciting films about the theater. Well, this film - happiness.
