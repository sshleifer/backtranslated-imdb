The man in the fire was hot. I love the classic story of good old revenge and what could be better for revenge than kidnapping an innocent little girl. <br /> <br /> The writers did a great job in this film by building a relationship between Chrisy (Denzel Washington) and Pete (Dakota Fanning), so that the viewer could understand and really feel that Chrisy had to save Pete. It was also good that Christie was not a chorister trying to save Pete through the “right” channels, but instead used the tactics of torture and street minds. Some may say, “Torture is wrong, regardless of you,” and you may be right, but when you see the pain that Chrisie faces because of the loss of Pete and the passion he has to return her, you can't help, except with Creasy and pull for him, to be even more merciless. There would have been no progress if Chrissy used diplomacy to fight various vile gangsters and criminals, and he knew that. <br /> <br /> The search for Krisi ended with the return of Pita to her mother and the death of the cryy in the car, the bad guys. But Krazi’s death did not diminish the effectiveness of the film; she actually enhanced it by showing that Krazi was willing to die to return to Pete. His death was truly noble. <br /> <br /> Denzel does an excellent job with his work, as do writers. This film deserves good marks, because it was definitely a good film.
