An eternal musical gem with Gene Kelly in great shape, stylish leadership by Vincent Minnelli and wonderful musical numbers. This is great entertainment from start to finish, one of those films that people watch with a smile and say: “They make them different from what they used to be!” The climate of the 25-minute musical sequence without any dialogue is one of the most beautiful in the history of cinema. The magic of cinema, obviously derived from the hearts and souls of all participants. Must see!
