I watched this movie with my mom when I was in high school many years ago. At that time I was definitely not interested in opera, but he changed my mind. I really liked this film, and since then I really enjoy opera. I even bought a few of his discs. Who cares what his acting skills were, he just played himself, which was amazing. He was so charming, so charismatic; I honestly just wanted to hug him. I am very sad that they criticize him so much. It was so direct, it didnâ€™t accept people who pushed or tried for its actions. He deserves respect and admiration for his talent. He will definitely be missed !!!
