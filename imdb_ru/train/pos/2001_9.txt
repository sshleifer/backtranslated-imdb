I was lucky to see "Oliver!" in 1968 on the big movie screen in Boston when I was a teenager. Later, in the summer of 1969, I was glad to see that this film was still playing in the famous Leicester Square cinema in London after he won the Oscar for the best picture of last year. <br /> <br /> Che successes "Oliver!" both on stage and on screen reminded me that not all talents begin on Broadway and end in Hollywood. This legendary story of Charles Dickens, which is part of the literary heritage of all English-speaking people, was superbly brought to the London scene by Briton Lionel Bart. His charming musical has become a hit in New York and around the world. An adaptation of the film was made in England in the summer of 1967, and then released in 1968. The sets and musical numbers are staggering. The song "Who will buy?" Hundreds of actors were required, and the British director really deserved his Oscar for gathering all this without problems. Some Canadian and American talents are also part of this remarkable production, but mostly it is a tribute to the fine craftsmanship of British film studios such as Shepperton. Good show! Other film studios in Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham and Ealing have also provided the world with many films for storage over the years.
