Notable for the fact that it is the notorious frank scene when the gorgeous Maruschka Detmers takes the penis of her young lover from his pants into her mouth. Even without this moment, the film is a magnificent, albeit slightly disturbing, passionate and dazzlingly sexual journey. Detmers shows a great game as a partially insane, insatiable delight, wandering around her flat nude. Dressed, partially dressed and naked, she steals much of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. For me, the last two are a bit lost, and the ending becomes the most confusing when her fianc√© is released, and the other terrorists are released, she seems unsure of who she wants, and the young lover seems more interested in his exams than anything else when she cries Beautifully of course!
