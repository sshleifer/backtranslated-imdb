This film captured me with an incredible opening sequence that led me to a complete change in perspective, so I was intrigued when the title appeared. The theme of this film is that everyone acts trying to reinvent himself, but not in such a clever way as “Identity” or “Ordinary Suspects”, but in the way that we all try to make any banal life that we find ourselves in. more interesting. The scenes in the chicken warehouses are impressive. One day, Jörgen (who owns a chicken farm) attends a laughter workshop, where he is the worst student. His discomfort at the same time allows you to see the depth of his desire to change himself. The film made me think about the hidden secrets behind the surface of the most ordinary people I see every day. There is not much plot. Guess the old man's secret is pretty easy, but the hobby is trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they find out. I liked this film the same way I liked “Sideways”, although the characters could not be more different.
