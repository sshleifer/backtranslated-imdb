In Mexico City, a former CIA industrial killer, and now an alcoholic decadent John Crazy (Denzel Washington), hired by industrialist Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) on the recommendation of his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken), who will be his little daughter Pete's (Dakota Fanning) bodyguard and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changes the behavior of cold Chrisie, forcing him to live and smile again, and he feels a deep affection for her. When a girl is kidnapped, and Krisi is told that she was killed by criminals, he vows to kill everyone responsible for the kidnapping. <br /> <br /> “The Man in Fire” is almost a masterpiece, and he will surely become a classic in the future. The story is excellent, never trivial, and, despite the 146 minutes of running, the viewer does not feel how time passes. The cast is composed by great actors and actresses, their performances are outstanding, distinguishing Denzel Washington, Dakotu Fanning and Radha Mitchell. There are wonderful moments in the cinema, and in the script there are amazing lines. I personally liked it very much when the character of Christopher Walken explains Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) that Chrisi's specialty is death and he is preparing his masterpiece. I agree with the user who commented that “Man in Fire” is one of the best, if not the best, film of the year in this genre. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Chamas da Vingança” (“Flame of Vengeance”).
