I'm going to at least a few people watching this on September 2 at TCM. If you only knew that Hedy had to change her name to avoid having a connection with this film when she came to the USA. It was a huge scandal, and I understand that the initial release in the United States was so split by censorship that it was almost illegible, I watched because I just saw a documentary about “bad women”, actresses, on censorship advice before the movie in United States, created in the early 30s. It seemed to me that they had gone much more than the most "sensational" shots of Hedy in Ecstasy. In fact, by today's standards, Hedy looked completely innocent in this, and it was nice to see her early untouched beauty. It was a good, lyrical film to relax. I loved it for what it was: a simple romance. I watched it after making an appointment during the sleepless early night of A.M. I would like to see the first version released in the USA for comparison.
