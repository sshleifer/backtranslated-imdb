Nolla's convenient way to unscrew stupid comments, often with curses, to describe things he is more aware of than most, is quite refreshing. There is another character in the film who constantly tries to put into words complex issues using more language than necessary. This guy should never have been given a thesaurus. Go to Noll, and you know that a treat is waiting for you! <br /> <br /> The way the pioneers of surfing on a big wave are portrayed is very similar to the “lost era”. Not to mention the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living, much less cared about issues like medical care. The use of old clips was universally performed.
