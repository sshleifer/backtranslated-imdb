The idea is a very clever title; the film has a serious tongue in its cheek. But it is so thin that you do not know how to read! Do these guys do full-length comedy or something else going on? The little dialogue that is in the film is not very delicate, and this adds to the strength of the film. If all the sound were cut off from the film, it really wouldn't take anything away from the film. The physical activities or art of the show is so strong that they themselves carry the whole story. <br /> <br /> I am a blessing, and with blessing, emotion follows shame. I speak this film for the first time as part of a “black” film festival. After watching the movie, I was very impressed with the work. But then I asked myself, what next? Where can anyone else see this work? A general association of art without a goal is not to be found here. You can see the design intent from start to finish. The use of African music in the style of casting seems all planned and for good reason. Character development is amazing. Casting, I think, is the strongest aspect of the film; characters are easily identified within 2 minutes after 6 minutes of a real movie. <br /> <br /> We need to see more films of this type, we really need to support more the development of short films across the board.
