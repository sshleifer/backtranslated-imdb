Wonderful urbanist Ronald Coleman is shown here, as in several of his other films. He is literally in every scene, and this comic film remains fresh thanks to him, and not contrary to him. He is handsome, witty, and very intelligent here, as he stays one step ahead of his wandering, beautiful wife, who was beautifully played by Anna Lee. The film is based on a French play and shows all the best qualities of this farce. Most of the cast is well known, at least by face, if not by name ... and is absolutely perfect for this very funny movie. The fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable, as he is one step ahead of the other characters. His multi-talents can be further appreciated in the classic Lost Horizon, which every movie buff should see.
