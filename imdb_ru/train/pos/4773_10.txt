Great piece of good cinema. This is one of those films that you see smiling and do not know why. Well, one of the reasons may be that we are standing in front of one of the most amazing directors today, and he is able to capture emotions. <br /> <br /> When you watch a movie, you can feel how Mr. Straight was. feeling when he made the decision to go visit his brother with his “marvelous” John Deere. What has changed in his mind? What changed in YOUR mind when you watched this movie? <br /> <br /> Beautiful story of brotherly love.
