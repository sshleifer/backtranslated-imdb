This Oscar-winning short film can be one of the greatest genres. Narrated completely without dialogue, this is a visual device about a boy who buys a goldfish, lovingly puts it in a bowl, then goes to school, leaving the goldfish unprotected and casually open the window. After some time, the neighbor's orange tabby begins to rummage, enters through the window and slowly goes to the bowl. The fish obviously knows that something is happening, and becomes very agitated. When the cat comes very close to the bowl, the fish jumps out. The cat catches fish, throws it back into the bowl and goes out through the window into which he entered, when the boy, not knowing what had happened, returns. It was amazingly filmed with real animals; How Cousteau made these animals behave in this way is simply amazing. I would just like this movie to be viewable by people; I saw him only once, in 1959, when he was released, but he remained unforgettable.
