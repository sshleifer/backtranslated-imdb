Going to something far from the deliberately coarse material that he usually does, John Waters (happy birthday, John!) Made this parody of the world of celebrities and art. Edward Furlong plays the lead role, a working teenager in Baltimore who loves to photograph things. When an agent from New York (Lily Taylor) discovers his work, she offers him a big break, which he takes. But as soon as he succeeds, he has to revise everything. <br /> <br /> In essence, Pecker looks at how he loses his friends and his ordinary life when he becomes a celebrity. Of course, this can be expected, but under the leadership of Waters there are always a few things that can shock us (you will recognize them when you see them). I certainly recommend it. Also starring are Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.
