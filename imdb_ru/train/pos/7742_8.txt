Intense actors such as Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine to make this modern film noir a winner. Of these three, I don’t know who was the most interesting, since everyone offers good actions and intriguing characters. <br /> <br /> Patrick makes the narration in this film, playing the ex-boxer and the insane. Wow, this one makes for an interesting guy! He looks stupid, but he is not. Ward is a slim, attractive, cynical, intelligent, and compassionate accomplice in the abduction plan that failed. Bruce Dern is also involved in the mix, and Dern will never stop to get involved in any film. <br /> <br /> Cinema may seem like an ordinary viewer, but I find it fascinating ... I don’t like depressive films, as usual. What I found was a kind of criminal film. Look and see if you agree. This is a rather unknown film that should not have this status, because it’s just a good story and well done.
