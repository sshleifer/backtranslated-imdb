Interesting, fast and fun. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of those people who watch a lot of TV shows. I came across this show when I once got sick with a heavy flu at home, and they immediately hooked me. I fell in love with John Burke. Both he and Claire did an amazing job organizing the show together. You could really say that they both loved their work. <br /> <br /> Super collector segments were excellent. I became interested in things that had never been thought of before. <br /> <br /> I would really like to know the following: what happened to dog Jack? One of the owners adopted him?
