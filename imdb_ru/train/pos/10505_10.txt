Yes that's right. I firmly believe that the N64 and the strange looking controller were designed specifically for this game. It was amazing when I first saw it, with its huge environment and colorful characters, and now it is amazing. The playback control is perfect, the graphics are beautiful, and it has that Nintendo charm that is always so intangible, but undoubtedly present. Must be for any owner of N64, and the reason to get N64 for everyone else.
