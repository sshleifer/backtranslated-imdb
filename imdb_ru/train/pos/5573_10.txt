MUST SEE! I saw WHIPPED at the press show, and it was fun. We say laughs nonstop. It makes SOMETHING ABOUT MARY look like a winding drama. Amanda Peet screams stellar quality with her winning combination of beauty, mental ability and serious acting ability. Peter Cohen, the director, made an ultramodern film that tells about the human ego in the world of city dating. Despite all his comedy, "Whipped" succeeds with his intellect. Which is so rare for the first time, especially with the romantic comedy. He is the main talent. Judah Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams and Zori Barber complement the cast with deep and very strong performances, as would be the case for clever men. You should see these guys go to work and get into Pete's network. Check out the trailer on whipped.com, worth 3 minutes of download.
