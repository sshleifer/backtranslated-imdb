The playwright Sidney Bruhl (wonderful super Michael Kane) would kill for a hit play. Enter the young amazing child (solid Reeve), who has just written such a play. Intertwine with the overly hysterical wife of this Bruhl (superbly played by Cannon) and the German psychic (very funny Irene Worth), and you will get a surprisingly funny waiting click. <br /> <br /> While not up to "Sleuth" Standards, The Death Trap, however, is a very capable, funny, funny comedy ride waiting, based on the terrific play by Ira Levin. The performers obviously have a field day with the material, in particular, Kane enthusiastically demonstrates the highest qualities. <br /> <br /> Halfway through, the film loses a bit of steam, and the ending is much less satisfactory than the funny one in the original piece, but overall “Deathtrap” is solid, well-played and intense fun.
