I can not believe that this film currently has a rating of 6.9. In any case, this film was probably one of the most touching real Indian films I have ever seen. It was very nice to watch a movie that featured a traditional family movie. As for the story, I thought that it was great that an agreement in marriage with Amrita Rao was concluded on the captain Shahid. He seems to be lucky, while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who helps her uncle a lot, but the only problem is that her cousin does not seem to pay as much attention as she doesn’t like her Aunt Amrita with passion. This upsets Amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her. It was also very touching to see that, although the Amrita family was not so rich, maybe just the middle class to the lower class, while the Shahidov family was quite upper class, they still treated their family with respect and did not even ask let them down that really hit my nerves. This is because I actually saw people who are very rude to people who do not think so well that they are below their standards, which I consider very superficial. This film showed that the shahid family was ready to look at the great values ​​that Amrita brought up, and turned a blind eye to the fact that she was not the daughter of wealthy business magnates or anyone else. In general, this film deserves 8/10, I would like more and more such films to be made.
