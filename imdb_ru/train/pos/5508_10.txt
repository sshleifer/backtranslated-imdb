1964 Ernesto "Che" Guevara, who has been a citizen of Cuba for the past five years, disappears from the face of the earth, leaving Fidel Castro's grim look to announce that he is probably dead when, in truth, he left Cuba to move to Bolivia, to live the supposed identity. Living in La Paz, Guevara is trying to overthrow the corrupt bourgeois government. Once again, Stephen Soderberg begins where "Che: Part One" ends (only better this time). The pace of the game is more accurate, the task of acting is very good (including the turn of the painful-looking Benesio Del Toro in the role of Che Guevara). Suffice it to say that it would probably be better if you watched both films in order to get a true story about Guevara and what kind of person he was (I had a rare open window to see both films in one show ---- talk about a long journey!). As in Che-Part 1: The Argentine, this film does not have an MPAA rating, but contains enough salty language and violence to easily get an "R".
