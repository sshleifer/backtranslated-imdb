Critical and financial failure in the first release, the critics turned around and said that this film is one of the best directors. The feeling of the film, reminiscent of La Ronde, is developing rapidly as the guys from the detective agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) coax, fall in love and go out of love for some of the most bizarre and beautiful women seen in the film (Audrey Hepburn Colleen Camp , Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Most of the script was inserted or rewritten on the day of the shooting, which gives the film a fresh feeling. Ben Gazzar is excellent in the role of chief detective, who convinces Audrey Hepburn, leaving singer Colleen Camp and seeing taxi driver Patti Hansen on the side. John Ritter clumsily follows Dorothy Stratten and immediately falls in love with her. Blaine Novak has several girls he is pursuing (including Joyce Heiser and Elizabeth Pena). This film has some great supercast performances. Audrey Hepburn stands out (she has no line in the first half of the film). Ben Gazzar has never been better (and an inspirational choice for a romantic leader), and Colleen Camp plays one of his best roles as a manic country singer, Christie Miller. She is very pleased to see how she shoots at her lines in the delivery of "rat tattoo". Highly recommended! ********* stars!
