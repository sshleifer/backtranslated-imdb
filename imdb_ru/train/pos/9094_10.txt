I saw this independent film when it was in Philadelphia, and it was a pleasant surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that made him so funny is that it was based on a true story - fun! There are some great characters too. Mindy Sterling is in it and very good. I loved her in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also awesome. I remember him from the head of the class. I'm tired of all the dark and sharp films that continue to be made. It's fun and easy, and I can watch it with my family and not be embarrassed. I keep checking to see when it comes out on DVD. I will definitely buy it.
