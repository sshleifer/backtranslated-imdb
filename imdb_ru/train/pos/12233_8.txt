Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of Saturn. His comrades die instantly, but it seems that they are in fact lucky. Steve returns to the Earth a constantly oozing mass of humanoid pulp; when he turns into a wild killer at every turn, his friend, Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning), tracks him. <br /> <br /> This is often incredibly ridiculous — with rather absurd lines and situations that can be avoided — it's hard for me to believe that everyone laughs unintentionally. I think this is a kind of stupidity because of the low-budget genre efforts of the 50s and 60s, and, as such, this is an amazingly interesting film. This sequence with the nurse is just ridiculous. We even consider a sequence of split screens, which actually adds nothing, but still needs attention. <br /> <br /> Writer / director William Sachs deserves praise for putting forward this brilliant idea; his ultra slimy nature is really memorable. I think his pace is a bit confused; some scenes (for example, a scene with an elderly couple) continue a little long, but, ultimately, it delivers solid, crazy Brazilian films with a degree of scope. The climax is especially funny. <br /> <br /> The music of Arlon Obers is surprisingly tremulous (but at the same time, amusingly stupid), and Willie Curtis’s cinematography sometimes creates really great shots. This brings me to the fantastic and convincing effects of Rick Bakers' makeup, which form a very respectable starring role in the film, right down to the final melting. <br /> <br /> The armature under heavy makeup is almost the entire film (Sachs also gets my praise for taking up the film) and does what it should do quite well. Debenning makes himself a rather stupid and stupid hero, and Ann Sweeney is not as good as his wife, but Miron Healey, Michael Aldredge and Lyle Wilson are fine. It is also worth seeing people like Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith (makes a noticeable picture of topless), Janus Blythe (from "Eaten Live" Tobe Hoopers and "The Hills Have Eyes") and even director Jonathan Demme in A Small Part. <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting midnight film with enough blood, chills and laughter to rate it as an interesting thing for fans of low-quality science fiction / horror everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8/10
