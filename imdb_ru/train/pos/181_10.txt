UC 0079, the Annual War is almost over. Cyclops, the target group of Zion, chose the neutral colony of Side 6. Their goal is a new Gundam, built exclusively for Newtypes (supposedly built for Amuro Ray from the original Gundam saga) inside. When little boy Al Izuruha, a Zeon MS fan, runs into Zak after a battle broke out in the colony, he became friends with the new MS pilot Benard "Bernie" Weisman. These two become good friends, Al is considered an honorary member of the Cyclops team. During the show, Bernie plays the role of father for Ala (whose real father always works) and seems to be taken with Federation pilot Christina Mackenzie, but ultimately they must meet ... in battle. Soon, Al learns that war is not a child's game, and Bernie must make an extreme sacrifice to complete his mission. <br /> <br /> For only 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is a well-made show. Mobile costumes are very well thought out, and the animation may look outdated, but in fact it shows the emotions of the characters. If you liked 0083, watch this one, or if you're new to the Gundam world, this is a good show to get you started. If you are looking for a show for the development of drama and characters, it is for you, it focuses more on the battle than on mobile costumes. I would rate it as drama rather than action. <br /> <br /> Mobile suit Gundam 0080, the war in your pocket. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose to win.
