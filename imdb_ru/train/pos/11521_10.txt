Wizards are a wonderful trip from start to finish, thanks in large part to the magic that stars generate. Alan Arkin is great in one of his best roles in decades. Like any really good movie, this is a journey in which the topic of redemption and the results of dreams. I can not believe that this film is so hard to find - I would have bought it on DVD in an instant, but have not yet found a way out.
