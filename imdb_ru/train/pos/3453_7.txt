Although this film has a top-notch list of great actors, great special effects and a storyline full of surprises, it was not filmed for studio distribution and immediately got on DVD. It may contain too much information about “anti-police forces”, or maybe it's just too many militants released during the oversupply, but no matter why the big screens missed this opportunity, fortunately, the new concept of release directly on DVD allows us to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The theme is old: the recruit-reporter reveals the inner circle of corrupt policemen - in this case the FRAT Team (First Response Assault and Tactical), a group of well-trained police officers created to clean the mythical city of Edison from its low crime levels, drugs, prostitution, etc. Work under cover of temptation to take confiscated goods and money proves too much about the possibility and now, 15 years after its creation, FRAT is responsible for murder, drug trafficking, eroticism of innocent people, etc. The main dog is Lasers (Dylan McDermott, who makes a terrible gangster!) and his partner Rafe Deed (LL) J cool, even more loving than usual, and proves that he can be a sensitive actor) . Reporter Pollak (Justin Timberlake) notices a "blatant mistake" and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to the boss of his newspaper Ashford (always reliably excellent Morgan Freeman). Gradually, Polak convinces Ashford and subsequently Wallace (Kevin Spacey, also a permanently beautiful actor) and helps Pollack in this investigation. The closer Pollak gets to the truth, the more surprises and unpleasant incidents occur, and the story moves to unexpected results. <br /> <br /> Timberlake lacks charisma to lead, especially in the company of such experienced actors. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey and McDermott keep a well-tuned movie machine rolling to the very end. No, this is not a very good film, but it is a film that makes the film sit on the edge of the film. Grady harp
