I really liked this movie. I rented it, waiting for something not too bad to spend the evening. It turned out to be especially pleasant. Some scenes were hilarious, and they managed to play in the film, not intended to be just a stupid comedy, but with some meaning and moral values. It works out on both points. I had never seen any of these actors before, but they were pleasant and made me take care of what happens to them at the end, what says a lot. The script is smart and fascinating, and it refreshes it, I think you will not be disappointed to see this.
