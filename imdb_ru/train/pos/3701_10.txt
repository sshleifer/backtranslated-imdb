Dinner party may well be, in my opinion, the greatest film production for adults of all time. It is produced in such an elegant way, and the actors portray their roles excellently. The scene in the kitchen with Yvonne and Julie Ashton in the lead role is gorgeous. Using butter and milk really makes a scene. In addition, the scene of the doctor's office is well done. The campfire scene is filled with pleasant acts, although the choice of actors in this scene is questionable. Asiya Carrera's performance on the dump stage is incredible, but who would expect anything less from her? The final scene is somewhat more used in adult films, but is nonetheless classic. I highly recommend this movie to all adult movie lovers and viewers. Run into your video store and pick it up today.
