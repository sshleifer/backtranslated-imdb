Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I always looked at this 1983 record as my favorite movie from a multi-year series. A variety of action movies and really different characters (Jabba Hut, fluffy forest creatures, etc.) made this film especially attractive. <br /> <br /> None of these actions has ever focused in one place for too long. The last half hour illustrates this most, as the scene switches every few minutes from the forest to the battle between the spacecraft to a separate laser duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. <br /> <br /> Another nice feature of this film if the previous two were not the absence of a fight between two stars. There have been endless disputes between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, all were on the same page! It was good to see. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was just a great adventure story, more than anything else.
