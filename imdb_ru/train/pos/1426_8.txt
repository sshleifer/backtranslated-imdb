I have to say that sometimes “appearance” is all that matters, as pointed out by Jeremy Clarkson of the BBC (although not about our land, but he is right in any case). <br /> <br /> And when it comes to looks, this film is so incredibly stunning beauty that you will surely enjoy what your eyes see. <br /> <br /> And there is also the personality of the film, interesting, with the exciting voice of the narrator and narrator. stories that will affect your soul when you watch these superbly shot images. <br /> <br /> The film probably will not affect your way of life, destroying these beauties, but it will surely remember you how precious our land is on which we really live in it. <br /> <br /> This film deserves 10 stars, as it is one of the few documentary films about stylistic land that I really liked.
