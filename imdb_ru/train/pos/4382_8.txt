Overshadowed by Braveheart, released the same year, the two costumed dramas ask for comparisons. I recognize my prejudice against Mel Gibson, but I still adhere to the rational preference of "Rob Roy." Both Braveheart and Rob Roy convincingly portray the Scots story in a bloody, romantic way. "Braveheart" is an epic message to personal honor, courage and a wonderful fantasy of revenge. It is also melodramatic, anachronistic and lively. Note that it uses a slow movie clip. His violence is ugly and glorious. It is the latter quality that makes it more attractive for teenagers thinking. While Braveheart surpasses Rob Roy in clean slaughter levels (not to mention its indulgent duration), the last film is ultimately more mature and satisfying. Its action is more restrained, but even more surprising and clever. His sex is less showy, but more erotic. Rob Roy also has a more conscious romantic interest. His dialogue tries to bring the poetry of the period closer. His rotten teeth in the mouths of the actors are trying to get closer to the dentistry of that era. And Tim Roth is an excellent villain. Also recommended: "The Last of the Mohicans" and "Patriot". You can find the latter more like Braveheart with its emphasis on bloodlust, with the first more like Rob Roy in tone. All of the above films deserve an assessment for violence.
