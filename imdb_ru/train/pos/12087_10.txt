I took a chance at Hardcastle and McCormick, buying the cost of the first season (Canadian release) from Amazon. When I got it, I started with the pilot, and I immediately caught on to him. I rated it 5 stars on Amazon, and I rate it 10 stars here. This is just good. What I liked about this was the opening and closing themes, and, of course, the Stephen J. Cannell logo at the end of each episode, but, above all, the relationship between the Judge and Mark, when they worked together on hacking each case. I was so passionate that I also bought the second season as a companion, and I enjoyed it equally. If you do not have this excellent series on the disc, I believe that you should buy it and put it in your collection.
