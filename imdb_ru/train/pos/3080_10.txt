I complained to ABC about the cancellation of six degrees. If enough people do the same, it can be enough to liven up this incredible show !! Just go to the official website, and everything else is quite simple. I do not understand why this show was canceled. What a fantastic show, actors and characters. The whole concept of exciting viewing! I'm amazed that my favorite show ended after one episode. Why is this? Six degrees is phenomenal, it's better than so many other TV shows! Until I heard that they stopped him from a friend, it did not even occur to me that this could happen.
