Sarah Silverman is a dangerous bitch! She is beautiful, sexy, funny and talented, dark and demonic. I read other “comments” on this show, as well as messages on the bulletin board, and people just don’t receive it. Nothing that appears on TV is an accident. Too much money, time and work invested in the production of a television show for errors. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted it to be stupid. This show is underage because Sarah wanted it to be underage. I thought the jokes were great, and the thematic shows, as well as other musical numbers, are surprisingly quaint. This is very similar to the Playhouse Pee-Vee for the unsuitable, twenty slacker with something substance abuse, America's future porn stars from the valley. The cast is awesome. Scenarios and actions are well developed. I hope that this show will be successful, because Comedy Central did not allow David Spade to save his show. Who plays Sarah's sister? She's not on the cast list on the main page of the show. I would really like to see her performance. Anyone know about her upcoming gigs or DVDs that might be there?
