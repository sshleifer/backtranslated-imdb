This film, also known as Water Lily, tells the story of two girls who make their way into the world of love and sex. This story is told at a slow pace, and it works very well. This gives enough time and space to get acquainted with different characters and some of their attachment to them. <br /> <br /> The use of a small number of actors creates additional pressure on people who play, since they all have more time on the screen. than usual, but the people playing in this film do it well. Everything is absolutely believable. The visual situation is excellent, especially underwater shots in the pool add a pleasant effect. <br /> <br /> Many films were shot on the same topic, and this film doesn’t stand out among the others. He pulls some of the “standard” pressure methods from the cylinder and works on them. This is not bad, not at all, but, of course, this is not great either, and I feel that it could be better if it took several less studied corners. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 synchronized swimmers
