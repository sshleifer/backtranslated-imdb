Prison cell. Four prisoners - Carrere, the company's young director accused of fraud, 35-year-old transsexual in the process of his transformation, Daisy, 20-year-old mentally ill idiot Savant and Lassalle, 60-year-old intellectual who killed his wife. They found a book behind a stone slab in a cell mysteriously torn to freedom: the diary of a former prisoner, Danvers, who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century. The diary contains magical formulas that supposedly allow prisoners to escape. "Malefique" is one of the most horrendous and smartest horror films I have seen this year. The film has a dark, gloomy feeling under the influence of HP Lovecraft's works, creating a very creepy and disturbing atmosphere. There are many bloody scenes associated with some imaginative and cruel death scenes, and the characters of the four prisoners are remarkably well developed. It's a shame that Eric Valet made a really horrible remake of “One Missed Call” after his terrific debut. 9 out of 10.
