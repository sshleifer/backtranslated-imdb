This program is very funny, and the title song is so memorable that I can't get it out of my head. As I get older, I get attracted to the wrinkles that succeed, and these four are excellent in their endeavors. Something that they do is outrageous, but brilliant, given that in our days in our PC world, we can never do this in real life. I always study at exhibitions. But if you like puzzles, dramas, comedies, and a little forensic work, you'll love this show. It reminds me of Quincy, me, on the one hand, and Barney Miller, on the other hand, how they work and interact with each other. They screwed up a lot, but they did their job, and that's the main thing.
