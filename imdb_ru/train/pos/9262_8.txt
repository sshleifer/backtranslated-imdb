Offside is the story of teenage girls who tried to enter the stadium to watch the final qualifying football match of the World Cup in Tehran, which could lead Iran to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. By law, women in Iran are forbidden to go to the stadium, although many of them dress like boys and make their way inside. Stadium guards search everyone at the entrance to make sure no one is wearing fireworks and, of course; no girl enters. <br /> <br /> Like most of Panahâ€™s work, his cast was excellent. You really think you are watching a documentary. The dialogues between girls and privates were delicately and surprisingly plausible. The film tells about the amusing relationship between prisoners and conscripted guards, who themselves serve as wards away from family and friends. In the end, the audience understands that there is no such difference between the girls and the guards, who simply carried out the orders.
