MATADOR is a film about a hired killer ... if you can say so about a movie about a hired killer. Violence in fact never manifests itself, but is often introduced. At first, I was afraid that another story of the comedy “Gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark” of the mid-90s was waiting for me, but I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that it was just a cute and funny story about friendship. Nothing wrong with this movie happens, but each piece of it makes me smile. The three main characters have the best chemistry that the big screen has offered in recent years, and it looks like they had a great time together making this film. The letter was clear, although sometimes it seemed that the script was adapted from the scene because of one set of dialogue scenes. This is a good film that I probably won’t remember for too long, but at the time it was a complete joy. Good film
