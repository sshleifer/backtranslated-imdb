This film is one of the most perilous black-and-white films of the time in the early 1930s, before the Heuitz Codex was put into action. This is a story about how a young beautiful woman moved to New York and made her way to the top of the business, using her body as a tool for this. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwick plays the young and beautiful Lily Powers. which really well copes with its game. Lily moves to New York and sleeps with all the men. Stanvik makes an outstanding performance, being a strong woman who uses men as one-time deals, almost without emotion when they play them as if they were pawns. Lily Powers is a woman who does not think about love, only about power and money. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was a little different from other films that I saw, because there is almost no background music. I heard. I believe that this is only because it was then that people first became acquainted with the live sound and dialogue between people in the film. The music is played several times at the beginning, when we are shown how it moves up the chain. Shooting and different scenes were something fantastic! The director of this film made all the right angles and all the right tricks, making this film full of realism. <br /> <br /> This film was all a good movie. The ending of this film was not as good as it should have been, but it did not completely destroy it. Throughout the film, “Children's Face” had its slow scenes and, perhaps, several predictable moments, for example, with whom she would sleep next. But this is an attractive film that you can watch more than once and offer to some people and friends.
