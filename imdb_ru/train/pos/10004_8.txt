This is not the comedic Robin Williams, nor is it the quirky / insane Robin Williams of recent thriller fame. This is a hybrid of classic drama without excessive dramatization, mixed with Robin's new love for the thriller. But this is not a thriller, as such. It is rather a mysterious / unknown vehicle through which Williams tries to find a sick boy and his caretaker. <br /> <br /> Also starring Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, this “drama-suspense” is in many ways similar to the news report to William the character is approaching his goal. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was very entertained, although this film cannot teach, direct, test or entertain. It was more like I watched a guy (Williams), because he was actually performing actions from a third-person perspective. In other words, it seemed real, and I was able to subscribe to the background of the story. <br /> <br /> In general, it’s worth a look, although this is definitely not a Friday / Saturday evening fare. /> <br /> Rating 7.7 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
