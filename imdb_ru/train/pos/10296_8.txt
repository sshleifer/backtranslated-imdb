Pretty funny car Jim Carrey, in which he as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and destroys chaos. Kerry has returned to his familiar surroundings and seems to have a good time, and Jennifer Aniston, like his girlfriend, is charming and impressive. The story is predictable to the extreme, but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as “God”) is great and makes the film worth seeing. Grade: B
