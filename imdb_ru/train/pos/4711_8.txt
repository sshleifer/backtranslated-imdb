Oh, how fun it is! <br /> <br /> Amy Heckerling can shoot comedies (“Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” “Look Who's Talking”), but here it looks like she told the actors to go out and have fun. Mikal Keaton plays the role of Johnny, his best work on the screen. Joe Piscopo is great in the role of Danny Vermin, who is rightfully called, but the directors did not understand this shame. And I even mentioned Richard Dmitri, who plays Moroni and the character’s unique vocabulary. I don’t think it is by chance that most of the character’s name is MORON. <br /> <br /> Good lines are scattered all over the film, with Peter Boyle, Griffith Dunn. Mourren Stapleton, Merilu Henner gave good lines, Even actors with minor roles, such as Dick Butkus and Alan Hale, are on good terms. <br /> <br /> Recommend this to a friend.
