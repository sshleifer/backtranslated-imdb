Bette Midler shows off her talents and beauty at Diva Las Vegas. I am delighted with the fact that he recorded it on tape, and I can browse whenever I want. She has what it takes to keep an audience captive. Her voice, as always, is beautiful and truly amazes you. The highlight of the show was her singing “Stay With Me” from her 1979 film “Rose”. You can feel the emotions in the song and end up with goosebumps. The show will force you to go out and rent a Bette Midler movie or go to the nearest music store and buy one of the Bette Midler albums.
