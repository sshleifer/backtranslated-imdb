Did you know that Anthony Kiedis (singer from the Red Hot Chili Peppers) is the father in this film. Blackie Hell father Anthony. I noticed this after reading Anthony's "Scar Tissue" autobiography and saw a picture of his father. I thought, â€œWell, this guy is kind of like that guy from that movie that I saw in the eighties. Then I read more, and it said that his father was an actor who had several small roles. After checking this site and comparing with Search in the network, I realized that this is really his father in the film. It's funny, because nowhere in the book is it mentioned that he was in this film. Perhaps his son was ashamed of the role of the father in this film, but he needs not to be. I think his father, Blackie, did a great job on the show.
