The Eskimo is a serious film about the cultural divide between the indigenous population and the white man. Despite the fact that the film was filmed in a documentary style, apparently for non-professionals, Eskimo is a skillful production with a believable story that viewers will want to see before the final shot. <br /> <br /> Local Eskimos simply have different beliefs and behaviors about women and life than whalers who obscure their landscape. When an Eskimo man loses his half, it is natural for other men to share their women with their friend. Also, their women want to take the place of the missing spouse. All this seems natural in the context of desert forebodings of the Arctic. The gullible Eskimo becomes a victim of unscrupulous white whalers (with heavy European accents), who do not consider these natives equal to themselves. Deception, drunken orgies, rape and death occur after the Eskimos go to work in the icy cold sea. In the end, the main Eskimo (Mala) understands that he was deceived, and he takes revenge. Spectators would welcome the theaters of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Enter the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the moral dilemma about whether to return Mala for trial. Mounties are played as feeling cops who know that this is not an accident. Will the horses get their man? Is it fair to adhere to the rule of behavior of Mala outside its traditional society? Is there a way out that Mala doesn't punish? Is it inevitable that the white manâ€™s law should prevail? Is there no hope of innocence? <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie, but you will like it because of the depth of the problem, which is viewed in a completely different context. I suspect that filming sequences with animals was made before today's disclaimer, that no one was injured when making the film - so beware of the raw sequences of nature. Highly recommended.
