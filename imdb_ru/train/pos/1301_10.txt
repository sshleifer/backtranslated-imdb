I loved all the creams, even though there is such a small and valuable catalog of works. Even when they go for twenty minutes with some of their songs (Spoonful and Toad off of Wheels of Fire are prime examples), they still rock the socks of more than half of any rock band working today. This gel ability on stage is one of the most anticipated rock band meetings ever, with their performances at the Royal Albert Hall last year. They may have gotten older, like their fans, but the energy is still there, with excellent arrangements of both classical blues and their own. Reproduction of the White room, Sign, Politics, Spoons, the Sun of your Love, it seems no one will miss a beat. Clapton's solo has a formation that he sometimes doesn't have when on stage with his solo group. Ginger Baker, enough said. Jack Bruce is strong enough, his vocals still have such a power that Clapton can never get on his own. In the end, if you want to see which were the best shows you would like to see last year (well, some might have seen them), this is all on this DVD, with cool special features.
