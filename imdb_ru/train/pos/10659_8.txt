“I prefer the cheap perfume; they do not last so long ... ”- says the convicted character of Ralph Meeker (Lawson) about the heroine of Barbara Stenvik after he felt the smell of perfume that she chose with her husband. in Tijuana ...! This line infuriated me, and also looked like a metaphor for this film - that cheap is better than expensive, because a cheap person who loves perfume, who has a way with 2x4, is the best person to have in the long run! I agree with some other published comments about Helen's involvement with Lawson. Despite the fact that her narrative says that she wants Lawson to be removed, she seemed to be attracted to his fiery nature, and the passion he inflamed in her is unlikely to wash away the tide!
