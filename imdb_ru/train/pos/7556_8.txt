Well, it was a damn good episode. Much better than the loan he gets. <br /> <br /> The film is great. Even better. I like this last shot. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are excellent, and the guest actor (without the help of helpless victims) is strong. <br /> <br /> What I donâ€™t like about this episode is that many things remain unexplained. Why does this change gender? what is the purpose? and they are aliens? what kind? why did they never show up again in later mythology? <br /> <br /> I give this episode high THREE stars. One of my favorites yet, but the plot holes bother me. Still ... I won't let this ruin my entertainment.
