Wonderful documentary about the iconic achievements of the Association of Women Lawyers (WLA) in Kumba in southwest Cameroon in the legal protection of the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign with respect to women, according to Sharia law, one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights on women and children. After 17 years of unsuccessful efforts, WLA leaders have recently begun to win several victories, and the purpose of this film is to share these victory stories. <br /> <br /> Vera Ngasa is the leader of this legal reform movement. State Prosecutor and Beatrice Ntuba, Senior Judge (Chief Justice). Both play themselves in this film, which may contain shots taken spontaneously, although I think that most, if not all, consist of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera. Four cases are considered, and all the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film. <br /> <br /> Two cases are connected with the repeated beating of a wife with violent sex in one case; the other is having forced sex with a 10 year old girl; and another concerns repeated beatings of a child, 8 years old, aunts. One of the battered wives is also looking for a divorce. We monitor cases from investigating complaints to test results. The results in each case are favorable for women and children. The perpetrators receive harsh prison sentences and / or fines; divorce is granted. <br /> <br /> The aggressive persecution of a childâ€™s beating aunt suggests that these criminal justice women are truly gender neutral when it comes to enforcing the law. Also noteworthy is the respect that all parties, including those found guilty, appeal to. This is a very important and well-made film. (An interesting fact is that one of the directors, Ms. Longinotto, also starred in the 1998 film Iranian Style Divorce, which covered related topics in Tehran.) (In broken English with English subtitles). My rating: B + 8/10
