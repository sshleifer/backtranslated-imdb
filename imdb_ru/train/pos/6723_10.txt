Riding Giants is a terrific movie. It really shows how these people lived then just to surf. Their life was mainly surfing, life, breathing and fun. They were not worried about money, work, girls or anything else. For them, the waves were their girls. I have never been on a surfboard, and it looks so difficult, I do not understand how they can stay on them, it makes no sense at all. This is a terrific movie, and if you like surfing, then you should definitely watch this movie. If you are a surfer and want to find out who started surfing, how he came to life, who is really famous for it or something else, then you really should see it. It may be a documentary, but it is really good. -Tara F.-
