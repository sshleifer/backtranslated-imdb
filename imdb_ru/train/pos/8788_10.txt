Well, I'm glad to hear a rumor that it can finally be released on DVD. When this happens, I do not know, but I will take it when it comes out. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, this is Errol Flynn’s most interesting film, especially when “Gentleman Jim” Corbett plays in the ring. starts in the film. Then it turns from a good movie to a wonderful one. <br /> <br /> Few people can play arrogant men and at the same time become a nice nice guy like Flynn, and this film is a perfect example. Reportedly, this was Flynn's favorite role, and I believe that. You can just feel how fun he was here. Ward Bond also looks like he really likes to play the part of the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond has never been better either. <br /> <br /> There is only the right amount of action boxing here, and they are also pretty well made. The Corbett family is also interested in seeing how they continue to play in the stands during the Jim matches. Outside the arena, the constant arguments and shouts of the Corbett family may become too loud and annoying, but they set the stage for a suitable conclusion. <br /> <br /> And speaking of the conclusion, the speech of Sullivan before Corbett after the big Fight is very touching and the highlight of the film. Some despicable critics (for example, Variety) did not like this ending, and also the fact that most of the film is fictional, but - yes - most films are fictional, whether you like it or not. And, in this case, it made for a good story and a good ending. (In real life, Corbett was a very gentle, true gentleman, not at all like the image of Flynn, but Flynn still makes him a good guy.) <br /> <br /> This is one of the most interesting classic films I've ever had. either watched and I look forward to the DVD.
