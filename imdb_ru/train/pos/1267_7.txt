JUST CAUSE is a flawed, but worthy film, combined with strong actions and some creative (albeit extremely predictable) writing. Sean Connery is a crusader against the death penalty, introduced to save the seemingly innocent young black man (Blair Underwood) from the final punishment. To fix everything, Connery decides on a crime scene, where he must fight not only over time, but also with an intervening sheriff (Lawrence Fishbourne). Twists and turns and role changes abound - some are amazing, some are not - as an aging crusader tries to unravel the mystery. The climatic ending is a bit ridiculous, but JUST A REASON worth seeing at a slow night.
