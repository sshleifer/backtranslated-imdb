The only thing that pisses me off is that the DVD is so expensive. Now it’s too much for my budget, or I’d buy it, because the film is a good example of a noir ... and I like to watch Richard Widmark, Gene Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> Criterion produces excellent DVDs, but sometimes the asking price is slightly higher. This is the case with the 80-minute black-and-white monophonic sound film, which is good, but nothing extraordinary from the point of view of cinematography. <br /> <br /> History is history here (as opposed to visual films, actors). sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently ends up with spy microfilm in his possession after stealing Peters' wallet. (say it three times!). All but Peters are believable characters in this film: Widmark, police officers, US agents and communists, and especially Ritter as “Mo,” the informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this film. <br /> <br /> Peters copes well with a cheap game, but loses credibility early, “falling in love” with Widmark at the first meeting, although he is nasty. her. Only in the world of cinema !! It is a pity, because this ridiculous romantic part of the story takes away from him. <br /> <br /> This is a regular film noir, which means good, but not great and definitely should not be worth the price of 25-35 dollars. For this price one could have done much better in the noir film market.
