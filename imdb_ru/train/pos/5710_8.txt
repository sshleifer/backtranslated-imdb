Innovative musical Rene Claire. If you want to see where the songs first affected the story, this is the place. This is a story about a starving young artist who discovered that he won the lottery when his creditors began to call. Unfortunately, his ticket is in his coat, which is in the apartment of his girlfriends and was handed over to a prisoner who is on the run, who then ... oh, but that will speak. <br /> <br /> This is a light and frothy story in which most of the dialogue is sung (most people think that this was not before Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). This is such a film that they no longer shoot and rarely do when they shoot. It sounds like a movie from the first days that plays like a movie five or six years later. Claire moves her camera in the way that even Busby Berkeley did not (although, frankly speaking, it was unfair to compare two directors, since Berkeley mostly performed dance numbers in a performance, and Claire moved the camera in the "real world"). This is an amazing little movie. and this is a charming movie that just makes you smile. This is just the fluffy part of the fun. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I can't say more. It's just a good little movie, and it's really all you need to know.
