The Bourne Ultimatum begins recklessly in the middle of the pursuit and explodes in a pulsating fashion when Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely superb) tracks the masterminds behind the CIA's spy operations, which turned him into the perfect killer in the latest attempt to find out his true identity. Extremely icy David Strathairn as "man behind the curtain" is added to the returning composition of regular customers, including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (does not exist). <br /> <br /> As the second entry in this series, I wanted Paul Greengrass's shaky hand-held camera to remain motionless for at least a few minutes of inactivity. However, as they say, this is an ideal way to capture the intense, claustrophobic sensation of intimate hand-to-hand combat scenes and works equally well in pursuit scenes that mostly go on foot and over the rooftops with an occasional large pile of cars. -before. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant switching of globes and the manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. Bourne films seem to exist in some sandy hyperreality that is full of technological magic. It makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time, but I will be damned if I am not thrilled to watch them get there. Emotional and engaging Frank Potente, the authors try to create some emotional connection between Damon and Stiles, but she is so empty an actress that she never leads to anything. However, this can be forgiven, because unlike “Identity” and “Excellence”, this “Ultimatum” reveals everything, and we will finally learn the truth about Born's past. This is a fascinating and enjoyable conclusion for the series, and if they have common sense, and Damon gets his wish, this will be the perfect end for that.
