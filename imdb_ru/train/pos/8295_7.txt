Robert Urich was a good actor, and he makes this television film believable. I remember watching this film when I was 15, and when I watched it a second time, my opinion did not change. People lose who they were when they join this exclusive club in a computer rich Californian town. Urih is trying to figure out what is wrong with his family, and I like the idea of ​​a Halloween spacesuit, brilliant. This film is about the battle of his spirit. The quality of TV, which exceeds a large budget, gangs of New York. I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his films? I hope so! 6 or 7 out of 10.
