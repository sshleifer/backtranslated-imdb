I show this film to university students in terms of speech and media law, because its lessons are timeless: why opposing injustice is important and can lead to changes that the oppressed seek. Why press freedom and freedom of speech are necessary for democracy. This is a story that you definitely need to see how apartheid attracted the attention of the world thanks to the activity of Stephen Biko and the journalism of Donald Woods. It also provides an important lesson in free speech: “You can blow out a candle, but you cannot blow out a fire. As soon as the flame starts to burn, the wind will blow it higher. ” (From Biko Peter Gabriel, about shaking a tree).
