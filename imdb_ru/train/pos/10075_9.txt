“Masks” is a moving film that works on many levels. In the simplest case, it is an obsessive story about a street artist who is associated with a small child, trying to pass on his work (masks) to the next generation. Although at times the story turns an old man into Job, she is so well thought out (written, acted, directed, has excellent production values), and it is easy to overcome. And, if you have fun, the film is ultimately very pleasant and inspiring. Glory to all around. This is a wonderful film for children and adults. The trick is how to get Americans who don't like films in foreign languages ​​to see it!
