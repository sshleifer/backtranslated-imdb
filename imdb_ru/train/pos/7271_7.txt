Writer / director John Hughes (as usual) told about all the basics of this family movie, Sunday Noon. "Curly Sue" is a sweet, premature orphan, cared for from infancy "Bill". The couple lives tirelessly when traveling the great United States. A. Faith meets them with a “very pretty” lawyer, yuppie, and everything else is predictable. <br /> <br /> Children will love this movie, as they can relate to the heroine played by 9-year-old Alisan Poter (who became the Pepsi commercial for “you go girl!”) It is assumed that the character should be about 6 or 7 years old, as they make her think about going to school. Some of her vocabulary suggests that she is 9 or more years old every day. <br /> <br /> As in “Home Alone”, there are many slaps in the face and small fists that hit the thick chins. Again, this is the "formula" of film production, focused on a young audience. Entertaining and soulful. Look for no surprises, but be ready to shed a tear or two.
