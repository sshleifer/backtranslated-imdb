Excellent image of one of the most harmful aspects of that era. I liked the visual effects - very suitable for the story related to the graphic novel. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hanks was really good at it, he very well met someone who was tempered by his work which he didnâ€™t fully choose for himself), but still wants to have a normal life for his families. He does his best to make it happen. You do not want to spoil the plot - but YOU MUST SEE this movie if you are a person who wants more from the movie than the usual action / gangster format. (It's cruel though.)
