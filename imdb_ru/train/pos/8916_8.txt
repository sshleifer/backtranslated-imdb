Absolutely the very first movie that scared me to death. I accidentally caught him when my older brother (r.i.) was watching him. It was on a black and white TV and not a very good picture, but she interested me. Soon after, my people bought a set of flowers, and, if lucky, the One Million Dollar film showed it on one Sunday. <br /> <br /> I forgot most of the story, but it didn't take long to catch up ... and I was so scared that it was hard for me to sleep that night! I mean, of course, that it was just a film, but it was a creature that not only came from space, but you could not hear or see it ... and as soon as it captured you, it was too late . Even now, after all this time, it still causes a shiver in my spine. This classic, and even better classic, which I saw, scares the pants of a new generation! <br /> <br /> Long live The Blob!
