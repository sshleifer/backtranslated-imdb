If someone is interested in why no one makes films, as before, with a conversation, a character and a simple friendship theme, struggling to develop into something new, better and better, these people should take in this film and look at the highest the quality of writing, directing and acting in a beautiful evening watching how it was in Italy and England. On other days, other times turned into a terrific comedy of entertainment, filmed in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson and Michael Kitchens. Under the direction of Mike Newell's smear, these actors perform vividly memorable performances, which are photographed with the artist's sublimely thin eye. Recalling the bedroom theatrical farce at the turn of the century, this film can be called the friendship farce, which becomes a useful experience in the development of the romantic nature of each character and the viewer. An artistic telegram about the importance of caring for those around us.
