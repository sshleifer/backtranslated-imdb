First of all, the release date of 2009, rather than 2007 for this full-length documentary. It is necessary to more correctly call it "Earth 2009". Secondly, let me examine the complaints of some of the reviewers who watched the 2006 Planet Earth series. <br /> <br /> I did not see this series, but I learned here that this film is the full full version of this 2006 series. I rate any film by its merits, not by its source. I myself evaluate the results, and the results of Earth 2009 are really excellent. I dismiss this trivial complaint from some reviewers: this is just an extended version of the 2006 series "Planet Earth". So what? It does not matter much. <br /> <br /> As a movie buff and one of those who watched dozens of nature documentaries in my life, I was amazed and very impressed with “Earth 2009”. This is the debut film of the new DisneyNature division created by Disney. He follows in the footsteps of Walt Disney's groundbreaking documentary films and the Academy Award-winning films of the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> Cinematography, film editing, music score, sound and narration are all excellent. There were several other nature documentaries that also excel in these categories. What really makes Earth 2009 different is its scale. It literally covers the entire planet, covering all seven continents. <br /> <br /> After my first viewing it was obvious that this documentary required tremendous effort, time and talent to create. <br /> <br /> Three production companies were needed to create this amazing documentary. <br /> <br /> “Earth, 2009” convincingly tells the stories of four species about their great migrations over the course of one year. seasons starting in January and ending in December, from the North Pole to the South Pole. <br /> <br /> Two new special high-tech cameras were used for this film: one camera is equipped with a 360-degree rotating computer-controlled, rotating with an engine. a lens and another HD camera tuned to an amazing 1000 frames per second. This shooting technique really added drama and beauty to some scenes of Earth 2009, especially in the pursuit of cheetahs and big white sharks jumping out of the water to catch sea lions and bird's-eye view passing through the edge of the world's highest waterfall. There are many amazingly beautiful pictures in this documentary. <br /> <br /> With the help of cinematography, musical accompaniment and narration in this documentary film there is drama, sadness, humor and gorgeous beauty. With great music performed by the world-famous Berlin Philharmonic, great creative and technical cinematography and the narration of James Earl Jones, I consider Earth 2009 to be the greatest documentary in the full-length genre. Five years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication really paid off very well. This film must be watched in all schools of the world. I predict the Academy Award for Best Documentary, among other awards. Truly amazing, amazing, exciting and gorgeous documentary. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended
