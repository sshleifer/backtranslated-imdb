Paul Greengrass has definitely saved Best Bourne for the last time! I heard that many people complain about how he made this film, and some even compared the style of the camera with the project "Blair Witches." All I have to say is ... are you kidding me? Come on, it wasn't so bad. I think this helps the action scenes to feel more realistic, which I would prefer a more stylized choreography for stuntmen. As for the rest of the film, I really didnâ€™t even notice it. <br /> <br /> You can say that Damon really got comfortable with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes it can be bad, but in this case it is really good. He really becomes Jason Born in this part. Damon also has a great cast as played by Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the CIA's secret organization. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film is full of excellent car chases and non-stop action, they managed to collect a decent amount. character development with all of this happening. This film is much higher than the other two films about Borne and, of course, is one of the best films of the summer season of 2007!
