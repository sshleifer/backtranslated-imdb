La Teta y la Luna is a symbolic Spanish film. Everything that happens in this film has a symbolic meaning. It is completely different from the usual movie to which everyone has access. <br /> <br /> This film is good, but it will be good only for people who want to find the meaning of the whole fairy tale in the film. I must report that this is not a film sample. <br /> <br /> Please enjoy !!!
