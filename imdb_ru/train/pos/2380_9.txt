I did not mind the whole walk. People really went to places then. This conveyed the spirit of authenticity to this historical work and some view of the Martians technology. I was also disappointed with the effects, in particular the scene “Thunder child”, which I consider one of the most exciting in the book. But I can't praise this film enough for its faithfulness to Wells's story! It's time. The actors are cute and the performances are charming. In addition, this film is very worth watching to hear Jamie Hall’s truly magnificent musical score. It was interesting to see the same actor playing both the writer and his brother in London.
