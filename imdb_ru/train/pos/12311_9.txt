"Chinese Ghost Story" is one of the most amazing Hong Kong films I've ever seen. This is a brilliant blend of fantasy, comedy, melodrama, horror and martial arts. The film has great visual effects and awesome fights. The scene between Wu Ma and the language of the tree demons. A truly original and refreshing film and a good recommendation from another Embalmer.
