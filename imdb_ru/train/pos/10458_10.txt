This film tells about one of the worst geriatric diseases among people of aging. As one who has faced many families who are facing the potential of Alzheimer's disease or are in the making, I would advise every doctor to recommend this film to any family that has experienced the trauma of this disease. The film is intended primarily to talk with the patient's family and penetrates the very heart of the struggle. The casting is superb, and the dramatic image is outstanding with a very commanding plot line.
