The French novelist, disgusted with his wife's friends, goes to North Africa for a break. There he meets a lively and talented Bedouin girl living in poverty. Despite his wife, who deals with romances with the Maharajas, he decides to educate and train the girl and present her to Parisian society in the role of princess Tam Tem ... <br /> <br /> Amazing Josephine Baker played a great role in the title role in this very pleasant french film. With her huge eyes and infectious smile, she immediately comes into contact with the hearts of the viewer. Her great personality and sheer joy of performance make her a real pleasure to watch. Baker makes us care about what happens to poor Alvina during her transformation and acquaintance with European customs. <br /> <br /> Albert Prezhan copes very well with the role of Pygmalion for Galatea Baker; George Pecklet is also effective as a half-blood servant and Jean Galland as a mysterious maharajah. <br /> <br /> The film is very beautiful and well-made, slightly reminiscent of Busby Berkeley films made at the same time in America - although, unlike American films of this period, PRINCESSE TAM TAM does not have racism. It should be noted that in France there was neither the Hays Office nor the production code. Some of the dialogues and actions are quite provocative, but it must be admitted that Baker, who sings and dances under “Under the Sky of Africa”, as well as her climax in a Parisian nightclub, are two of the most memorable moments in the movie. /> <br /> The actual filming in Tunisia greatly expands the possibilities of the film. <br /> <br /> Josephine Baker was born in St. Louis in 1906 in a very poor family. However, her talent and desire to drive soon pushed her to advance to the East, and she briefly became an actor in the film "Zigfeldskie madness." Realizing that America in the mid-1920s, there were great restrictions for the gifted black woman, she managed to get to Paris, where she eventually joined the Foliés-Bergeres & Le Negre Revue. The French adored her and she became a huge celebrity. A short return to America in 1935 showed Baker that things had not changed for African Americans. She returned to France, became a French citizen and worked for the Resistance in the early days of the war. Baker moved to Morocco for a time and entertained the Allied forces stationed there. <br /> <br /> After the war, Baker began to decline, and she faced many financial and personal difficulties. For some time she was even forbidden to return to the United States. Finally, Baker accepted the offer of Princess Grace from Monaco to stay in the Principality. Josephine Baker was on the verge of returning when she died of a stroke in 1975 at the age of 68. <br /> <br /> Having only appeared in two worthy films - ZOUZOU & PRINCESSE TAM TAM - Baker is in danger of becoming unclear. But she deserves her place alongside Chevalier, Dietrich and Robson, as one of the truly legendary performers of her generation.
