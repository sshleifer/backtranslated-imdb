I am stunned by the negative comments I read, and I can only assume that the people making such comments were less than honest. This is the most touching and real image of Joseph Smith that I have ever seen. It was good to the point that sometimes I forgot that I was watching a movie. This brought Joseph’s life to hard times, good-natured optimism, steadfast faith in people and God, and the ultimate sacrifice of life in such a way that frankly left me silent and silent in fear. If someone from any Christian religion can watch this film without any positive touch - I would say that this is a reflection of the individual, and NOT a film. I give the film "10" and call upon honest souls to watch it. At least, this is a very heartfelt image of a person who gave everything he had, for what he believed ... In a world where values ​​and beliefs are ridiculed, this film is a constant reminder of people whom we should consider to be independent on what religious beliefs we hold. Ann Pruitt
