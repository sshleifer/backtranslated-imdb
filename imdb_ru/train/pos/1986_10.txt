Tour defors! Well, the guy who plays Oliver is too sweet! Starting with great cinematography, colors, costumes and the most impressive performances, this film is a must see. I have seen several modifications of this great novel, but this one stands above all of them, and this is a musical for download! This is masterful Fagan, never leaving his character to perform a song. You never know whether you like it or not, the same feeling that I experienced in the book. In other versions, you hate it from beginning to end. Bill Sykes .... when you read a book, he is sneaky, and therefore he is in this film. Oliver Reed was a workshop. His wife led this masterpiece. I went and watched his latest film "Gladiator", based on his many excellent performances, so as not to see the headliners. Music corresponds to the time and mood. Who will buy this beautiful film? You should!
