I finally found the time to see this after hearing wonderful things about him. It actually exceeded my expectations. Considering the budget, it was an amazingly literate and well-made film. Lack of finance actually helped this film in several ways, especially given the plot. As in the case of Blair Witch, this film was all the better because it was videoed instead of film. Another bonus: while most low-budget horror films (even the best of the best) suffer from mediocre or unintentionally hysterical play, this film was actually a talented actor (except for one or two characters), especially with the two leading ones. The only thing missing in the film was the original storyline. He borrows heavily from better-known films, such as “Liberation” and “Wrong Turn,” but if you are like me, movies of this nature do not cease to be terrifying. Plus, the director keeps things interesting everywhere. It would be very interesting for me to see what the director will do with a large budget, and I feel that it will be only a matter of time before we know ...
