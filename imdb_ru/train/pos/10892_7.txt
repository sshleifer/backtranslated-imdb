What's not to love about this movie? Every year you know that at Christmas youâ€™ll get one or two tide films, and most of them will be terrible. This film is definitely a new idea that has been implemented quite well. A very funny look at a rich young guy who pays his family to imitate a real Christmas for him. What good is to have that kind of money if you can't do funny things with them. It was a win-win situation. An ordinary family gets six figures, and a rich guy experiences Christmas the way he imagined. Only if <br /> <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Afflek) was incredibly difficult to deal with, and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly fulfill its absurd demands. It was a fun and funny movie.
