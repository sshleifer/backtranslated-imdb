Clever, sandy, witty, impetuous, sexy, extravagant, sloppy, erotic, heartfelt and banal, Footlight Parade is a first-class entertainment, all films are about. <br /> <br /> Realistic, satirical processing gives a new edge to the material, and its pace and delivery line is breathtaking. To think that they only started filming artistic conversations 7 years before! The brilliance of dialogue cannot be compared anywhere else today, especially considering that “realism” captured and captured modern cinema. <br /> <br /> This film was shot at a time when the Heis code that limited content was ignored and the result was a fresh, self-referential, critical and lively cinema that spoke directly to a modern audience suffering from depression and general anxiety of the era. I would recommend to watch any film of this period, that is, 1930-1935, in order to understand what could be popular cinema.
