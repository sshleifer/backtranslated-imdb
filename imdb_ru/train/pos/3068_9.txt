After reading the previous comments, I realized that this film went straight on the air. Well, I paid to see it in the theater, and I'm glad that I did, because visually it was an amazing film. It seems that most of the settings were made in the early 60s (with the exception of the psychiatrist's office, which was dated differently), and if you miss the episodes of Neve Campbell, the entire movie will be blurred in the early 60s. And the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating. For a novice director, who, I think, has a written origin, he has a great eye. During the first ten minutes, I felt that the plot didnâ€™t deserve credibility, so I just readily suspended my disbelief and set off. From the point of view of acting skills and the image of the relationship of father and son, mother and son, husband and wife, the relationship between parents and child, the film was accurate. William H. Macy, who is pleasant to watch, seems to fill the void left by the late Tony Perkins, if this is Magnolia - any signs. Tracy Ullman, like an abandoned wife, moved towards me. It was a three-dimensional image of a character, too often viewed by a society as two-dimensional. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable images. The image of the parents (Bane / Sutherland) indirectly reminded me of "BUFFALO" 66 Vincent Gallo, albeit a bit relaxed! I would definitely pay the money to watch the second film from this director. He has the self-discipline of the director of a 50-year-old crime film (something that PT Anderson will never have!), But he has a visual style and a way with actors that attract attention.
