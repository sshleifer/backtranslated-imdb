“What I like about you” is definitely a show that I couldn’t wait to see every day. Amanda Bynes is such a wonderful actress, and I grew up watching her show: "The Amanda Show." She is a very funny person and seems down-to-earth. “Holly” is such a capable person and has an “external” personality. I liked that she always seemed to turn everything upside down, so she spoiled herself from time to time. But that's what made the show so great. <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the show when the Vince character appeared. Nick Zano is very hot and funny, and also "Gary", Wesley Jonathan. The whole cast was great, each character had their own personality and charm. Jenny Garth, Allison Mann and Leslie Grossman were very interesting. I especially loved "Lauren"; she is the best! She helped make the show even more fun, and you never know what she is going to do or say further! In general, the show is really good, but the reason why I did not give him 10 points was that there are no more new episodes and because the episodes could be longer and deeper.
