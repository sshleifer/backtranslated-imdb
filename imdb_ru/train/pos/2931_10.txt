Eddie Murphy Delirius is undoubtedly the most fun thing I've ever seen in my life. When I first saw him about 2 years ago, I was in the seams after a few weeks. Today I saw it 17 more times, and I still laugh at my ass every time. For those who don't know, Eddie Murphy was a brilliant comedian before he became a Hollywood superstar. In this work of genius, there is not a single boring spot, unlike Eddie Murphy Raw, which was released in 1987 and which does not stand still in the middle. If you don’t feel like someone who hates swearing, then I wouldn’t advise you to see it, because you’ll probably hear the abuse of one form or another every 5-10 seconds. I gave it 10 out of 10 because it shows the greatest comic genius of them all at its best.
