Well, I personally don't like rap, but I still found Fear of the Black Hat fun. I'm sure I didn't get some internal jokes, but some I knew, and it was funny enough to make me laugh right after I stopped laughing. I'm a big fan of Spinal tap, so naturally I had to check it out. It was derived from This Is Spinal Tap, sometimes explicitly, but this film still stood on its own as an original, clever and funny satire. My personal favorite: “At the time of the slaves, they had no hats to protect them from the sun, so at the end of the day they were too tired to rebel. Now we have hats. ”
