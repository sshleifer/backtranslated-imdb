"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" - all that was indicated in the preview. It is not often you find it. In most cases, the preview shows only the best parts, and then the rest of the movie is terrible. Not so with that. I was pleased with the original plot, although there were no subplots. The animation was not breakthrough, like Shrek, but it was nevertheless good. The plot and storyline were well presented, and there were only a few slow points. It keeps you interested. I found myself enjoying it. "Atlantis" attracts and holds your attention. You should also think a little, but not too much. A little thought, you can understand what should happen, but you really do not know for sure how it will happen. <br /> <br /> Casting was also good. Michael J. Fox, since Milo was a great choice. His personality fits perfectly. Commander Rourkeâ€™s rude temper was also well chosen with James Garner. His character reminded me of his performance in Maverick, which I also liked. I really liked the role of Claudia Christian in the role of Helga Sinclair. Her ability to play a silly personality makes the film more interesting. It is a pity that she is a villain. <br /> <br /> In general, it's worth it (8 out of 10).
