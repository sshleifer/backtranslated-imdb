I originally caught it in 1996 for one week at the cinema. I was impressed, and my feelings did not change much. <br /> <br /> A documentary about the infamous Edward D. Vude Jr., telling about his life and films. There are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. Among them are: Vampire, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with clips from movies or weird entertainment. This is interesting (somewhat), but was it really necessary? I have seen all the films of Wood, and they are just awful. Wood had ambitions, but they had no talent for their implementation. I would not say that he was the worst director, but he is down there. Do we really need documents about a very mediocre director? I like the fact that they did not try to make Wood a kind of saint. Many of the respondents (especially Lugosi Jr.) hated this man, and it sounded loud and clear. They also completely ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s. However, it is interesting if you are a Wood fan. The best interviews are with Vampire (who tears Wood apart) and Dolores Fuller (an old friend).
