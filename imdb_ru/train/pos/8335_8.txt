While the sparkling chemistry between Ryan and Robbins is reason enough to watch this film, the supporting cast (including Mattau, Fry, Shaluba, Durning and the jolly trio of Jacobi, Sachs and Maher) is an added plus. Mattau shines like Einstein, Fry is ideally suited as the clinical fiancé of Ryan, and Shalub’s Einstein Gonad line, as already noted, is one of the highlights of the film. The speech that Robbins speaks for the first time in public is pure poetry. Kudos to the authors for handling this foam with wit and levity. I also thought Kean Curtis was as beautiful as Eisenhower. This may be something like a tiptoe movie, but I think everyone will enjoy it. Eight very solid points.
