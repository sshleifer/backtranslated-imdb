When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely on the screen. His greatness attracted my attention to such an extent that I focused all my attention on him throughout its duration. I would recommend to watch it not only anime lovers, but also to everyone who loves cool movies (or who loves really weird things). The style of art is beautiful, the sound is perfect, and the symbolism in it is breathtaking. I have heard complaints about the strange insertion of English text into the film, but I think that the way to do this complements the strange style of the film. The self-proclaimed description of “Hello Kitty on acid” does not make this film absolutely epic. I would like to find more works of the one who did this and see them.
