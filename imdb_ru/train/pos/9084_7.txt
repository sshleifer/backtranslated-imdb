Yes, some people said that this film was a waste of money, but I am one of those fans of dragon fighters who finish the world / scum in the world. <br /> <br /> But if you take it from my point of view in this movie was one of the best action films were damn good. But this is a movie in which everything became more and more difficult at the right time, or around the time when evil became the main thing, something fell to save them at the right time. Although the film had some funny lines and gangs that surprised me. <br /> <br /> 3D graphics were damn good. I mean, for such a movie, the 3d effects were EXCELLENT !!!! The big battle shown in the trailers corresponds to the fact that there was a lot of hype in the film. The fight between good and evil at the end was, I must say, could be longer and a little better, it was still quite good. <br /> <br /> Now for the parts that I think could be better. The start was pretty good, showing the parts that lead to great battles. I mean, if you really don’t want to watch this movie in cinemas, then at least it’s a DVDer ... <br /> <br /> In general, I liked the movie, but the plot just fell into place quickly and fit harder to good.
