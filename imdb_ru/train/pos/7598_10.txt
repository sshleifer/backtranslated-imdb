"Lost", "24", "Carnival", "Desperate Housewives" ... the list goes on and on. These and many other high-quality shows prove that we are in the middle of the golden age in the history of television. “Lost” is pure genius. Incredible layers of personal and psychologically viable stories, underlined by sublime cinematography (it’s incredible to use this word when describing a TV show), amazing appraisal, excellent presentation and editing. Anyone who is not passionate about it misses one of the most important creative expressions on television. He may have trouble watching just one episode a week, but the DVD format is really an incredible way to watch it. Hopefully they will continue (as I am sure they do).
