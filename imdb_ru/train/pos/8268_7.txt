Apparently, this is the second remake of this film, shot earlier in 1911 and 1918, respectively. And in many ways, he reminds me of the later film “BRIGHT IN OXFORD”. Both films relate to a conceited blow that goes to one of the best schools in the world, and both ultimately show a blow that slowly learns about teamwork and decency. In this film, William Haynes - "Tom Brown", and his main rival "Bob" played by Francis H. Bushman. And in the role of supporting, Jack Pickford is always remembered as Mary's brother. Of these three, Pickford is considered the best, as a sympathetic loser who becomes Tom's boyfriend - he actually has several decent scenes, as well as a dramatic moment before the Big Game! There are all the standard clichés, and the film, because it was done many times before and after, presents few surprises. However, this is a nice movie and a nice viewing. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, for the best quiet student film, try Harold Lloyd “Freshener” - these are football scenes, frankly, more exciting, and Harold is much nicer. and sympathetic than annoying Tom Brown. FRESHMAN is probably the best college picture you can find from that era. Another reason BROWN AT HARVARD is a less significant picture is that William Haines played essentially the same unattractive and pompous character with the same plot again and again (for example, in WESTPOINT and SMART SET ) - and if you saw one of these films, you saw them all. Well done, but certainly NOT original! And since this is just a rehash of his other films, everyone who gives the film 10 points is STRONGLY advised to watch these other films. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 == I just checked and saw this little movie was the top rated movie on the 1920 IMDb !! Talk about revaluation! There are dozens and dozens of the best films - one can only guess how this film should become No. 1.
