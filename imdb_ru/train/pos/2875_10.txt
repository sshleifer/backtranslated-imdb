Cinderella In my opinion, the greatest love story I've ever told, I loved her as a child, and now I love her, this is a wonderful Disney masterpiece, this is one of my favorite movies, I love Disney. I could rave about Cinderella and Disney all day, but I won't give you a brief description of the story. When the father of a young girl dies, she has to live with her angry stepmother and her equally ugly and nasty stepsisters Drusilla and Anastasia. Poor Cinderella, made to do household chores all day, has only small mice running around the house and her dog Bruno as friends. When once in her house a letter is sent with a message to all available women to attend the royal ball. Cinderella, wicked stepmother and stepsisters, try to prevent her from being present. Cinderella finally gets her dream and desire and can be present in her captive beauty, generosity and beautiful nature help her win the prince.
