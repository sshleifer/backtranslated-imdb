This one to view several times. A fine letter shows that they had to live through this story or know someone who did, because they had nailed it. Freebird made me relive and laugh at my inept youth. The name was a great choice. Great movie, setting, plot, soundtrack and characters. This is a film about a biker, but it's a shame to stick it in such a way. Funny to the bone, like the Trailer Park Boys in the UK. If you have never seen TPB, check whether you like this movie. You will thank me. I hope to see more of these characters in other films. A sequel? Can be made There are a lot more peace that I would like to see through their eyes.
