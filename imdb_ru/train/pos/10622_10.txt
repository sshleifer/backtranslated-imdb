“Hate the minute” is an incredibly beautiful film. Psychological thriller that will send you on a journey through the nightmare in which serial killer Eric Siver lives. High performance and excellent cinematography make this film "must-see" for any student of the film or a horror fan. The reality of the story and the human side of Eric separate this film from other psycho-killer films. Some cries of the producer of the film Bruce Campbell, as well as the film "Evil Dead" add humor to anyone who knows the genre.
