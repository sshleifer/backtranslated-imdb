When I think of the Return of the Jedi, I think of epic. Yes, there were Ewok and what? This is an interesting addition to the film (not to mention the fact that they resemble Viet Congists, who were also able to destroy the technologically advanced army through primitive actions). The Jedi is definitely darker than the rest of the movies. Emperor Palpatine (portrayed by the amazing theater actor Jan MacDiarmid) was one of the best parts of the film. Palpatine is so angry and angry that Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him. Speaking of Darth Vader, what an amazing end for such a character character. Vader is truly a modern Greek tragedy, and I think that now people can especially understand and appreciate it after the release of the Revenge of the Sith. His redemption at the end was touching and really brings you a happy, but bitter-sweet feeling. The best part was, of course, special effects. It's amazing how a movie of the early eighties can stand the test of time with its graphics. The scenes in Jabba's palace (Leia looks amazing in this metal bikini) and, of course, the epic battle at the end at the end is still amazing. In all the deep plots and Jedi of the Jedi (mainly between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals the truth of Lei) and incredible special effects - a worthy end to one of the most beloved franchises in the history of cinema.
