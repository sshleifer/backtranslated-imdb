I first encountered this show when I stayed in Japan for six months last year. I found this on the internet when I was searching for subheadings of dramas to help me with my Japanese. My host mother warned me to keep away from it, because she thought it was strange, but I found it amazing! Koyuki showed such contradictory traits, and Matsujuna's spirit made my day every time I tuned in! I first saw him in Hana Yori Dango, but in this I liked him much more! <br /> <br /> Although the characters are interesting and well developed, I was disappointed to find that they had not changed a lot during the whole show. Their relationship has grown, but they are not. However, have fun everyone (even for Fukushima!).
