I just do not get tired of watching FREEBIRD. My husband was complementary, so I was involved from the start. Kept in touch with John and helped promote the film in cinemas and now in the DVD release. Even in terms of the distribution of advertising cards on ferries and in various places throughout France. FREEBIRD was skillfully written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments plus a choice of actors. Only Phil Daniels could fit the role of Grouch. It is a great honor to meet with John and the actors at the party after the premiere in January. Anything else you want to do, John just ask, either by email or by phone, you know how to get me.
