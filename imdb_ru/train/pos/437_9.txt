“Enchanted April” is a tonal poem, a picture of the Impressionists, a masterpiece of the transfer of the message in a few words. It has been one of my 10 favorite films since its release. I continue to wait, albeit less patiently, for the film to be released in DVD format. Apparently, I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> If the lists of the parent company Amazon are correct, there are many people who need this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this actor and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries. The cast is impressive, cinematography and flawless director. The film is a specific keeper. Many have already asked. Please add our names to the list.
