/ * light spoilers * / <br /> <br /> In the distant past, before the creation of Evangelion, before Hideaki Anno became an idol and common name for many anime fans, and before Gainax reached the status of a favorite, was created Gunbuster. Due to the fact that at that time Gainax was producing only the Wings of Honneamise, as well as the famous shorts or the Otakon track, Gunbuster had some difficult actions. In itself, this did not help, choosing a genre that has already been done countless times before, space opera. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Gainax decided to release it as an six-part OAV (right in the video) series. This allows the series to have more scope than would have been possible if it had been turned into a film. It also prevents it from becoming too boring and excessively long, with a lot of senseless battles and filler along the way. In addition, they made some efforts to stay away from the proven mechanics of the space opera used in Macross or Gundam, and many other popular space operas. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the show begins quite easily, from Noriko to the Okinawa mehaplotting secondary school. Noriko is the daughter of a respected commander of the ship, who died in battle when she was still a child. This makes her life at the academy rather difficult, as some of her classmates are beginning to suspect that professors prefer Noriko. The first episode is largely a comedic drama, with very close attention to the characters and the school setting. The situation quickly changes when the threat of alien invasion is announced, and Noriko and Kazumi (the best girl in the class) are chosen to help the assembled fleet. <br /> <br /> The middle part of Gunbuster leaves our female leadership in a space that focuses on both personal drama and action. A couple more characters were introduced, and part of Noriko’s past was dragged out again. In addition, the alien threat is becoming more and more inevitable with each passing minute, and Gunbuster appears, the last hope of mankind. Clever as Okada writer, he used the principles of slowing down time to liven things up a bit. In short, time moves more slowly for those traveling at the speed of light. This means that Noriko can participate in a war that takes almost a century to complete. Also, the dramatic aspect of this is emphasized when Noriko again sees his friends upon returning to base, who have aged much more than her. Science may not be perfect, but it’s fairly plausible even between some episodes of the SD scientific theater between episodes where Noriko, Kazumi and their trainer give a brief description of the scientific principles used in the series. /> <br /> The animation for the series created in the 80s is definitely good. Designed in a retro style of the 80s, of course, but it has its charm. The animation is fairly smooth, and the character design is pleasant, although the costumes do betray part of the fenservisny charm, which Gainax later uses to the fullest extent. The mechs on all shows are pretty cool too, with Gunbuster as a perfect killing machine, strong and extensive. The last episode was completely made in black and white. Although it is usually considered (but not confirmed) that this was done for budgetary reasons, it gives the series a completely different atmosphere, which is ideal for the latter part. <br /> <br /> Music is a very typical space Opera Fair. Too pompous in places, very common, and definitely not worth buying. It fits for the most part to the series, but can sometimes become quite annoying. Tanaka is not really a famous composer, and the only other respectable series he has been working on is Dragon Half. If you think about the 80's anime music, you'll know what to expect. <br /> <br /> As the series progresses, the focus gradually shifts from drama to space opera and the epic battle, but the viewer is unlikely to notice. this. Gradually, the drama will be relaxed, and the battle will take the first row. No aspect ever remains completely excluded, though. With the latest episode in sight, Noriko and his team are fighting for the continued existence of the human race, and given the last battle in sight, the audience is asked certain questions regarding the position of the human race in the galaxy and how far it can go to ensure self-preservation. Although they never respond later, they still provide interesting food for thought. The last episode is very epic, with a pleasant, but quite predictable ending, although, of course, not all endings must contain numerous outlandish turns. Again, this corresponds to the series. <br /> <br /> At first, Gunbuster may sound like a regular anime for space opera, with alien invasions, huge battles and some personal drama, and for the most part it is. But this is done exceptionally well for a change. Instead of going for a permanent combination of the previous elements, six episodes in length, Gunbuster presents us the transition from small-scale drama to large-scale epic heroism. Along the way, we meet with various interesting and well-developed characters, the relationships of which vary greatly due to the phenomenon of time dilation. The show is very densely written, although in some places it tends to slip. Overly dramatic accidents and too stupid fur attacks could have been easily avoided. Overall, the ride Gunbuster is doing is very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic. Perhaps he did not break the boundaries of the space opera genre, but at least he bent them a little. Very nice anime classic, but not without flaws. <br /> <br /> *** / *****
