I strongly disagree with everyone who can dismiss this film as “just” entertainment. Establishing after the carefree, turbulent 20s, in the early days of the Great Depression, Dance, Fools, Dance is basically a serious warning story with a clear message about how to best survive these difficult times. However, this fast-paced and intense film is far from a dull moral story. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, Hollywood was able to produce one interesting * and * enlighten the audience after another, all without losing the frame of the film. Dance, Fools, Dance - one of the * four * films made by Harry Beaumont in 1931 - only 80 minutes, but his characters are well developed, his story never seems fussy, and despite numerous plot twists, the audience will never behind. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Lester Vale, as Bob Townsend’s sluggish love interest, the cast is equally strong. It is worth noting that William Bakewell as Crawford's brother, Cliff Edwards (better known as Jimini Cricket's voice) as reporter Bert Scranton and Clark Gable in his early role as gangster Jake Louva. <br /> <br /> But this is a Joan Crawford film, and it’s absolutely brilliant in it. Made when she was only 27 years old, this lesser-known version of Crawford is likely to be unrecognizable to those who are more familiar with her later work. However, here is proof that long before she brought home the Oscar for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star in the full sense of the word, a stunning actress with charisma who herself carried the picture. <br /> <br /> Rating: eight out of ten
