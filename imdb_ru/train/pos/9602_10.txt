Darius Goes West is a film showing the American belief that everything is possible if you try. In this amazing funny and sometimes heartbreaking film, a young man is shown who never expected, but really wanted to see what was outside his beautiful city of Athens, Georgia. Darius wanted to see the ocean. His long-time friends, Logan, Ben, and several other good friends decided to fulfill Darius’s desire. They started small - Ben and Logan’s mom launched an email campaign to draw attention to Darius’s condition: Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy and raise money for the guys so that Darius not only sees the ocean, but also sees the great United States. To say that the young college colleagues managed to instill hope and awareness of this terrible disease would be an understatement. They understood Darius’s dream, and then some. They save their lives, demonstrating love, care and a lot of pleasure to Darius, helping Darius to understand how he, in turn, can show the same qualities to other people suffering from DMD. Darius went voluntarily to the Red Cross - sat in his chair, collecting money (along with his friends) near the local grocery store. His beautiful smile tells the world that dreams come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends who will support you and take care of you. Give Darius and all the guys Oscar - no one else deserves it. Martha Sweeney.
