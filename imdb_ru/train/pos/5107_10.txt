What a missed 80s soundtrack. I imagine that John Travolta sang some songs, but when watching the movie, he seemed to personify everything that was raw from the 80s. Obviously, movies that use mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships were in vogue. The best was his lousy Texan accent. Compare this to the lights on Friday night. I propose to watch Cocktail and Stir Crazy, to truly plunge into the dead end of the film. In addition, as the note “Made in America” with Ted Danson and Whoopi Goldberg, this is a terribly bad movie. I was so shocked to realize that I had never watched it. Another strange film of this genre should include Cadillac Maine with Robin Williams. Just remember that all these BIG stars played big roles in these CHEESY films .. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
