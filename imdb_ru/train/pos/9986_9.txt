As perhaps one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. Watching a movie without first acquaintance with the plot in no way distracts from the movie. The characters have a lot of difficulties, everyone can relate to them in their own way. The glitter of adaptation lies in the fact that everyone is allowed to project his own perception on the life of the characters, and not on the feeding of opinion. You can love them or not love them, and still feel the emotional impact of the film. The wonderful speeches of Ellen Burstyn and Kristina Horn really enliven the characters. I highly recommend it.
