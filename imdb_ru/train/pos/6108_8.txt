I really liked this movie. Many Koreans will feel familiar with this film, because many of them have teachers when they go to school. Cinematography was average. The film would be better if the angel or camera movement was more irregular. Editing, however, was very neat and unusual. <br /> <br /> The game was also very good. Kim Ha Nol usually played an innocent, weak girl in Korean TV shows. But this time she plays a very nice cute tomboy. Kwon Sang Wu also plays a very believable role. <br /> <br /> What I like best about this film is that the characters' emotions are not too exaggerated. There are many Korean romantic films in which the characters cry in front of the audience, and I always thought it was very stale. There was no such shit in this movie. <br /> <br /> Very funny and well done.
