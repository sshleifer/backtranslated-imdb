Probably the first time I saw this movie around 1995. Since then, I returned to it many times. It's great! I especially like the first and second clips “Creation of the World” and “The Rise of Civilization”. Blimey! It was so cool on the glorious days of computer animation. CG is much older than me, since I know that the film “Tron” was made 7 years before my time. But this film was a milestone in the early 90s. It was probably the first collaboration of various experiments with computer music. I like it so much, I think I'll go watch it now. goodbye
