This adaptation of the film Pearl S. Buck is definitely a classic. This Hollywood epic, it has everything that is in the great Hollywood film: birth, death, happiness, sadness, delight, despair, and so on. There is only one thing that annoys me. I know it was a sign of the times, but none of the two main characters play Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor, and he works great like Van Lung, the owner of a farm in China. Louise Rainier plays Olan. She doesn't even look Chinese! I think she was trying to get the part, but they had to put Anna Mae Wong in the role. I know why they did not, and Miss Rainier is very good at the film, but they hardly tried to make her look “authentic.” Stillm is a great movie, especially if you're reading a book (I did it in high school a decade ago). This is a must see, just look beyond the limits of casting. I think you can.
