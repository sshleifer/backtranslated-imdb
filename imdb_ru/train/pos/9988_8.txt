What I liked about the film adaptation of “The Stone Angel” on the screen is that he remained so loyal to the novel! Great movie! As an avid reader, I believe that the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book is somehow lost in translation. You can say that the Stone Angel team was careful not to let this happen in this film. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn was a great actor for the role of Hagar, and she is definitely a superstar in the movie. However, I think that Canadian actress (Christina Horn), chosen to play Agar in her younger years, also did an incredible job that deserves great praise. I have not seen any of the previous works of Horne, but I will definitely find her after seeing her performance “The Stone Angel”. <br /> <br /> I heard that the Canadian theatrical release of Stone Angel will take place in spring or summer. 2008. I can't wait to see it again on the big screen!
