When I shot this film to watch it, I knew that it would not be a film that could interfere. Instead, I thought of it as a disbelief of reality, where someone would get a serious beating. And you know that it worked. Kurt Russell did, it seemed to me, a wonderful role in showing the senseless soldier he was. I recommend this movie if you are with the guys and you want to see a good action movie.
