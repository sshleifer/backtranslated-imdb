I must completely disagree with another comment about this film. Visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the film and no longer distract from the plot. I really liked how this move was unlike the “Crouching Tiger”, because this time the action with the sword was not tied to the strings, and most of the time you can see the action close. <br /> <br /> I think that Western audiences will be very confused by two scenes, one of which is associated with a monk who is trying to burn himself alive, and the other with villagers who sing that this is the end of the world. The scenes mentioned are taken from certain interpretations of the Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan), and another scene has a quirk in the Japanese calendar ... then people really thought the world would come to the end ... Gojoe has action , story and visual effects to hypnotize any viewer. I firmly believe that with some skillful editing it can be sold in the United States. My only complaint is in the last scene of the battle (I can’t give anything away - sorry).
