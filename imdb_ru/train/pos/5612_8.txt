In Paris, the shy and insecure bureaucrat Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) rents an old apartment without a bathroom, where the previous tenant, Egyptologist Simone Schul (Dominique Poulange), committed suicide. The unfriendly concierge (Shelley Winters) and the tough boss Mr. Zi (Melvin Douglas) set strict rules of conduct, and Trekovsky feels surrounded by his neighbors. Meanwhile, he visits Simone at the hospital and provides support to her friend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After Simone’s death, Trekovsky feels obsessed with her and believes that his landlord and neighbors are plotting a plan to make him commit suicide as well. <br /> <br /> The strange “Le Locataire” is a disturbing and creepy story about paranoia and delusion. The history and process of insanity and loss of the personality of a lonely Trelkovsky slowly develop in a nightmarish atmosphere in the terrible place of his apartment, and what happens is really completely unpredictable. The performances are amazing, and Isabelle Adjani is very beautiful. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "O Inquilino" ("Tenant")
