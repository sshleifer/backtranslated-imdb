This made for the television version of the legendary stand, despite hopeless chances, more objective, more realistic than earlier versions of events, although one film made after that went too far in humanizing the figures of Sam Houston, Bowie, Travis and Crockett. <br /> <br /> The focus here is on Jim Bowie, whom James Arness plays with harsh, cynical detachment, apparently still alive at 85 years old. Then, at 65, he returned to acting skills after several years of absence from the screen. to do this part. <br /> <br /> Raul Julia, who was born in Puerto Rico, humanizes General Santa Ana like no other since the time of J. Carol Naish in 54th. However, the Mexican dictator is portrayed as depraved, vain Popinjai - a healthier form has never been seen either before or after. He receives excellent advice from European officers whom he hired, but, convinced of his infallibility, he does not listen to this. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin is the only actor whose age corresponds to the character he plays: Kol William Travis. His image is serious. He is almost delighted with the elderly, who share command with him. <br /> <br /> The only thing that shakes is Brian Keith as Crockett. In a cap with a yoke and with Ol Betsy, he stumbles, as if he had wandered from another movie. Without conviction in the image, the character is reduced to several stages of conventions. <br /> <br /> The script reveals some historical facts that were ignored or suppressed in earlier versions of the film. We learn that Jim Bowie, in the face of Santa Anna, fought with his own son-in-law. Mexican soldiers acted poorly in part because they were armed with rifles left over from the Napoleonic wars a generation earlier. "Santa Ana loves a deal." Bowie explains ironically. The entire project of protecting the former Spanish mission as a fort was reckless militarily - this fact was investigated in greater detail in the 2004 film Alamo.
