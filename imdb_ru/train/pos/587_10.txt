One of the things in the film that warmed my heart was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene. I sometimes spent time catching dry flies, tying up my flies, and accompanied by my brother and my father, we spend the day on a particular river, trying to seduce an elusive trout to rise and pick up a fly that they were asked to do. <br /> <br /> When we had such cases, any disagreements between us disappeared, and any pressure from the world melted to be replaced by the glory of immersion in activities and the surroundings of the place where we were. <br /> <br /> It was one of the amazing things that was shown to me in the film when the minister and his two sons, Norman and Pauli, performed the ritual. After all, there is something ritual in fly fishing, and in many games there is something ritual. You can't just start fishing and hoping for the best. You have to adjust yourself to where you are, you must scan the surface of the water, considering how it flows and where it is best to place your fly, and, depending on your skill level, you can even get to fly to land there enough long for the fish to notice and strike. The art of fly fishing was directed and presented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists. <br /> <br /> It was impossible to choose a more appropriate name for the film, since the river actually flowed through the life of a father and two sons. This film, however, is spreading wider than the family and community in Montana, by the Blackfoot River, where the film is played. It is able to attract you, captivate you, capture you, as the history of the family, the community and the period unfolds. The story told is not just a family story, but a life story. What can be classified as "River of Life"
