Updated from previous comment. The great and unappreciated Marion Davis shows his comedy works in this later (1928) silent comedy, which also shows the great William Haynes. Davis plays a guy from Georgia who smashes Hollywood with the help of Haines, a bit of a player in rough comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies, until Marion is "discovered" and will not become a big dramatic star. <br /> <br /> Excellent flashlight of Hollywood and its claims. Davis and Haynes - a great team, and guest-starred characters such as Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod Larocque, Litris Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Luella Parsons, Rene Adori, Eileen Pringle and Marion Davis (you should see this) - scream. A must for any serious movie buff or for anyone interested in the still-defaming Marion Davis! Dell Henderson plays father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Rally - slippery lead. <br /> <br /> SHOW PEOPLE was said to have used Gloria Swenson’s career as his model (I think May Murray is closer). Davis and Swanson were friends. But the story of this film really goes hand in hand with the appearance of Swanson from Mac Sennett’s one-component comedies with Charlie Chaplin in STAR in Cecil B. DeMille’s films about late adolescence and early 20s. <br /> <br /> Davis and Haines were huge MGM stars and friends. It is strange that MGM never combined them into a walkie-talkie. They are great together! Sweet romance and a delightful parody of early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned, but do not appear.
