"Home Room" was a complete surprise. Having no idea what it was, it paid off, because it does not withstand any blows, and we see how life changes as a result of the actions of a disgruntled young man who decided to pursue his classmates who are innocent victims of his rash actions. <br /> <br /> Paul Ryan, the director who works and edits his own material, is a talented person who is rewarded with some amazing acting from all sides. <br /> <br /> Alicia Browning is an elderly girl who is trying to finish high school. She was away for a couple of years and does not seem to be at the same wavelength as the other students. On the one hand, she is a rebel with a punk look, lots of makeup and mouth, which will cut anyone who dares to come close to her orbit. Alicia was among the students in the home room where nine students died, allegedly killed by her boyfriend. We understand that Alicia is a wounded girl who has experienced terrible ordeals in her life, but we are not given any clues on this matter. <br /> <br /> The consequences of the tragedy follow. concentrates on the young woman who survived it. Dinna Cartwright is a rich teenage girl who should not have been in school at all. When the bullet ricocheted it, she was hospitalized with more than a wound. She tries to overcome this dark period in her thoughts, but nightmares do not allow her to forget. <br /> <br /> Aliceâ€™s director forces Alicia to go to the hospital. Since she does not cooperate with the police, the head of the school wants her to see Deanna in her terrible condition, and maybe she will soften and tell the authorities that she knows. Alicia does not like Dinna, but in a few days both girls will make peace. Until the last episode, we do not understand what really happened on that terrible day at school. <br /> <br /> The busy Phillips makes great Alicia, and Erica Christiansen is equally good as Deanne. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland and the rest of the actors play the role of the ensemble. <br /> <br /> The film has an intensity, because it clearly does not show how the shooting took place, which helps the tone, Ryan wanted to give this film.
