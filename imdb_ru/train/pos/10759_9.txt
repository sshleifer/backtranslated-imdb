It is true that you always remember what you were doing at the moment when a catastrophe or tragedy happens. And all the more so since September 11, 2001, a date that changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism. <br /> <br /> No, this documentary was not about the events leading up to / 11. Most likely, the filmmakers, the brothers Gideon and Jules Naudet, intended to make a documentary about the hardships and adversities of the New York firefighter. They went to the academy and conducted several training sessions, and also chose their own “test” (test fireman) to join them in the fire station of New York, where Ladder 1 and Engine 7 live. But their production had to be developed and maintained on this . time, which is believed to have been the only shot of the first plane crashing into the World Trace Center. <br /> <br /> I was returning with a friend on the train from the night of the games on the local area network, and they received a call around 850 pm local time from my father, who informed me of the above. After a few minutes, he told me that there was another one, and that the WTC was being attacked. By the time I returned home, the upper floors of the twin towers were on fire and in smoke, and, to my horror, they had collapsed in less than an hour. <br /> <br /> On this day, the directors had two cameras, one that followed the team in the usual call, and immediately hurried to the ITC, hearing and seeing how the plane crashed into it. We trace that perhaps the only sequence of events filmed in the lobby of WTC1, where the first to react to the actions of firefighters, paramedics and police officers, had to figure out what happened and quickly develop a plan of action. The other camera, which the other brother was holding, was heading to the WTC to find her brother, and throughout the journey she captured many expressions of New Yorkers, as well as a sense of chaos in Manhattan and its surroundings. <Br /> <br /> Everywhere in the documentary film there are numerous interviews with people from Ladder 1 and Engine 7, who, oddly enough, have not suffered. But the fact that they survived also led to psychological turmoil, as they try their best to come to terms with this event. Through events that unfold, we learn about the strong camaraderie among these people who risk living and working in their workplaces every day to save lives. <br /> <br /> We started from what the documentary was supposed to be, before the Events of the day were completely immersed and became the center of attention, until the rescue phase, where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were supported by people who work around the clock to sort out the destroyed steel structures. This is not a film that is fabricated, and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary film (and heaven, not sound scenes for Hollywood blockbusters). This is as close as possible to the day when you will witness this security event. <br /> <br /> The DVD with Code 1 contains a separate extra hour from 4 sets of interviews with people from Ladder 1 and Engine 7,
