“The Last Command” (1928) is a silent film, directed by Josef von Sternberg. He shows us the Queen-General, Grand Duke Sergius Alexander (Emil Jannings) at the time of his glory. In 1917 he had all the power, but after the revolution and the collapse of Imperial Russia he had nothing. He also had a love for a woman, Nathalie Dabrova (Evelyn Brent). About ten years later, he claims a small role in a film about the revolution. His long-time enemy Lev Andreev (William Powell) is a director who chooses whether or not to take him as an additional film. The last team is a very good dumb drama. Emil Jennings plays an unforgettable role in the lead role. Evelyn Brent beautifully plays the main role. William Powell is great as there are always many scenes to remember in this movie. Like many scenes with Jennings and Brent. And then Powell and Jennings ends. This is a movie that touches many parts.
