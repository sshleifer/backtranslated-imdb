This is one of those films that you encounter when you watch the channel on Saturday afternoon, and you get involved in it and eventually watch it all. I thought it was well played, and it really made me feel the characters. Despite the fact that it is a bit slow, more attention is paid to the relationship between Bonnie and Clyde and their family members, it was never boring. In fact, we do not see too many robberies, for which they were so legendary, and instead most of the shootings occur when they are ambushed by the police. I thought that Tracy Needham, who played Bonnie, really did a good job with her character. Moving from a good country girl to a cold-blooded killer is a difficult task to portray, and I liked the subtlety she brought to the role. <br /> <br /> Overall, the effort is above average, especially considering that it was made for a television film.
