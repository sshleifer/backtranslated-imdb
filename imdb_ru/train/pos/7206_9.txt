Great plot inside the plot inside the plot. Shame that two of my movie characters had a good dream. Must be my upbringing :) Everybody comes in very well. You never know who will surpass whom. The last little turn at the end allows everyone to get them only deserts. <br /> <br /> Recommend to everyone. The harmless language in the buccal thriller, which, if it has any flaws, is probably the overuse of Michael Kane's words “bloody”, but this is his signature, isn't it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
