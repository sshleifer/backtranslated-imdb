I know only one other film that could compete with “Evening Opening” and this is “Person Bergman”. Both films are amazing, they have a lot of ideas that are difficult to understand at a glance. We deeply reflect on the relationship between art and life, as one actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gene Rowlands), discovers that she is more connected with the character she plays on stage than she would like. The accidental death of one of her fans, a young girl who declares her love for Myrtle, and then a car knocks her down, leaves a deep imprint on the actress. She begins to ask herself a question related to her aging, which begins to influence her, until the only solution is alcohol. But that doesn’t help much, and Myrtle is on the verge of total insanity. The scene where she kills the imaginary (or not) spirit of a dead girl is one of the most exciting scenes I found in the film about Cassava. The film ends with a manifestation of genius on behalf of the director when he is shooting a theatrical scene, where he and Gena Rowlands improvise the scene, as Myrtle is too drunk for the premiere to fulfill her role for sure. This scene was filmed spontaneously, with a lively audience, the laugh is authentic, the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands is absolutely amazing. If you like Persona or you are interested in a film that offers meaningful ideas along with great entertainment, this film will suit you.
