I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. This is not as obscene as it seems, this documentary from three parts (each episode is 50 minutes), in which the Slovenian philosopher / psychoanalyst of superstar Slava Zizek is shot. Zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films, exploring the topics of sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality. Directed by Sophie Fiennes, from the multi-talented clan Fiennes (she is the sister of the actors Ralph and Joseph). <br /> <br /> I really liked it, although I think it will be even nicer on DVD, since there are so many ideas that need to be digested. The analysis of Freud and Lacan can be quite tense, and by the end of two and a half hours, all the series at once became a little disorienting. It didn't help that reckless coffee and bladder storage led me to some discomfort for the last hour or so. <br /> <br /> My only real problem with this is that иižek chose films that were quite obviously filled with Freudian themes. He spends quite a lot of time in the films of Hitchcock and David Lynch, not quite masters of subtlety. I would like him to try to support his theories using a wider range of films, although in fact I just want to say that I want to see the fourth, fifth and sixth parts. <br /> <br /> Zizek is very funny, and part of the humor looked like he imagines, which is tantamount to a lecture, inserting himself into real scenes from some of the films he discusses. So, for example, we see him in a motorboat on the way to Bodega Bay (from Hitchcock’s “Birds”) or Bates’s motel (from Psycho) sitting in the basement. Which does not mean that his theories are not provocative. Even when I did not agree with him, it definitely made me think about films. What exactly is what he is trying to do.
