As an employee of the Swedish Air Force in this film, I liked the beautiful scenes of the flight Gripen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105). One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39 silencer, in this case the inert Rb 75 (Maverick) rocket, painted black with the letters “EWS 39” in white along the side. These silencer pods definitely do not look like this, at least not the ones I saw. <br /> <br /> But aside from this, this is a fascinating film with a very funny ending (at the last minute). Anyone interested in seeing the various Swedish military units, including the now legendary SSG, should watch this movie. <br /> <br />
