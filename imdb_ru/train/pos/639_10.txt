This is a good family show with a great cast. This is a good break in the blitz reality show lately. There is nothing more like this on television right now, unless you think Joan from Arcadia is like that, because she also has a teenage character. In any case, the Clubhouse is worth a look, because Jeremy Sumpter gives the main character (Pete Young) a kind of sympathy and naivety, which are attractive without being too cute and pleasant. Dean Kane, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Stormz complete the rest of the main actors, each one stunning in their role. I really like Kirsten Storms, like sister of Pete Betsy; she is a real pill, but she still takes care of her mom and brother, although she does not like to show it. It may take a few episodes to truly find your legs, but Clubhouse is one of the best shows you can meet in a long time, so check people - you'll be glad you did!
