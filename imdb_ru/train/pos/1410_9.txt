EARTH (2009) *** 1/2 Adaptation on the big screen of the BBC / Discovery Channel series "Planet Earth" offers a rather majestic sampling of nature in all its glory with some truly amazing moments "how the hell did they get these frames? ! ‚Äùwhile the perception of amazing animal scenes in their natural habitat and environment can be cruel (see how the Great White Shark swallows the walrus like fast food!) and are delicious (different children and their rent). ). Basso deep tones of the narrator James Earl Jones reinforce his "views of God" and depth. Collected literally from hundreds of hours of footage, the only trouble is that it had to be in the IMAX format and could even last longer! Oh, well, there is always the next time (since Disney Studios made this count for the series still to come) Directed by: Alaster Fothergill and Mark Linfield.
