Michael Jackson is not very popular in the United States, but in Europe (especially in Germany) he still has a lot of fans. Many will say that this is a bad film, and it is there: he has no plot, he is full of cliches, Michael constantly praises himself. <br /> <br /> BUT, you can’t expect a plot or non-cliché in such a movie! It has funny visual effects and the music is beautiful. Fragment Smooth Criminal - the greatest song in the history, full of lunar trips, group dance performances and even the famous “Michael Jackson's bench” - makes this film one of Jackson's masterpieces with even the beautiful (and white ...) Michael Jackson! <br /> <br /> Required for Jackson fans, mandatory for music fans, mandatory for dance fans. <br /> <br /> However, since I am a fan of MJ, I must warn all the haters of Michael Jackson: do not watch this film, you only increase your hatred ...
