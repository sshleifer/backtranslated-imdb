The original animated Dark Knight returns in this adventure film, which competes with the Mask of Phantasm in its coolness. There is a lot of style and intelligence in Mystery of the Batwoman, much more than in Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. <br /> <br /> A new crime fighter appeared on the streets of Gotham. She dresses like a bat, but she is not an adult Batgirl. And Batman denies any connection with her. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has to do the usual novels and detective work. But the Penguin, Bane and the local mob complicate things a little. <br /> <br /> I didn’t pin big hopes on it, because I was let down badly, but weak Batman: Sub Zero (Robin is not) There is so much here!) plot and sassy sense of humor. This is definitely a movie, without which there should not be a fan of Batman. Keep your ears open to a truly memorable song called “Betcha Neva”, which is clearly visible in all respects. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the DVD is not so good. Don't get me wrong, there are some great features (a short “Chase Me” is awesome) and a very cool Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, but ... the film is presented in Pan and Scan mode. Batman: The Secret of Batman was filmed and filmed at 1.85: 1, but this DVD is presented at 1.33: 1, compared to the widescreen clips shown in the image shown on both sides. I find this extremely annoying, given that the Mask of Phantasm was presented in an anamorphic widescreen mode. Warner literally had to republish dozens of films on DVD because people complained about the lack of an original aspect ratio available for some films. Why they decided to repeat the same mistake, I do not know. <br /> <br /> I would give this DVD 5/5, but due to the lack of OAR, the total score dropped to 4/5. It's a shame, because widescreen would be a great DVD package.
