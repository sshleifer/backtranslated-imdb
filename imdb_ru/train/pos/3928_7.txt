Of course, it was well shot and made, very well shot and made! But the story was so weak. And the image of the Lincoln was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda was bad, but the character he played was nothing short of a psycho. You want to tell me that Lincoln was a wise ass with no respect for the law or the court. I mean, who the hell was he supposed to be? Cousin Winnie? I mean, come on, "I'll just call you Fool then" ???? I understand that Ford wanted a great hero guy, but I didn't like it at all. He cheats in sports, talks like a real sweetie simpleton and does not seem to know where to sit in the courtroom. How should I take this seriously. <br /> <br /> The turn was even weaker. I mean, come on! It was just stupid. It seemed that the whole story was invented by a 5 year old in a dream. To say that I liked it enough was very interesting and made me laugh several times, so I can not say that this is a bad movie. In fact, I must say that I must say that this is good enough, nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can not be bad, BUT this bright and stupid story was just so ridiculous that I can not understand how can consider it big. > <br /> I have no idea how historically accurate this film was, but if it were true, I really would have to shake my head.
