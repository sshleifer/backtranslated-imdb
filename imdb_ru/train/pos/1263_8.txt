I liked this film, of course, because I like to watch Sean Connery play, and there is another plus in this film - Ed Harris and Laurence Fishburn. In this story, a grandmother is looking for help from Connery, because her grandson is in prison, and she says that he was wrongly convicted. At first it seems that there may have been some racist aspects of the case, but later it turns out that the chief officer in the case was black himself, and it seems that he had done some rather bad deeds to get the boy to be recognized. Well, the boy is trying to point out another murderer, locked up in the same prison, the one who will soon be killed. He is also a particularly nasty person, as he gets a lot of joy from what he did, writes to the relatives of his victims and tries to get people to send them by mail. A lot of twists and turns in this, some of which were somewhat unexpected. I just liked the character of Sean Connery who was trying to figure out all this testing. The film also infuriated me, especially when you find out what happened. You get a very good interaction between Connery and Harris, as well as Connery and Fishburn, because in this they all shine pretty well. In the end, this is a pretty good thriller.
