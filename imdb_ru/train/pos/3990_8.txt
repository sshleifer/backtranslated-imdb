May and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren. The visit is awkward, because grandchildren and “children” do not seem to know each other as one would expect. The heat that should be there is missing. After lunch, May's husband says that he is not well, accuses him of preparing his daughter's food and says with irritation that he wants to go home. He dies that night. <br /> <br /> Maya, now a widow, is lost. She clearly did not have a passionate or very interesting marriage, but she had a goal. She had someone who needed her, and although her own needs were not met for years, she had something to do with her days. <br /> <br /> She is depressed and not motivated. She goes to stay with her daughter, Paula, who shortly after her mother's arrival informs her mother that she never felt that her mother gave most of herself to her. She lets go with anger over her mother's lack of care. May seems to be disarmed and surprised, but she also has no energy or desire to do everything right. "I am your mother, and I love you." What actually says? (I heard this from my own mother too many times, and I still have to figure out what that means.) Paula is a little (well, more than a little) neurotic. Both women need it, although they show it in different ways. <br /> <br /> Paula was associated with her son's friend, Darren, who works as a craftsman in a house belonging to her son. While Paula is working during the day, May begins to talk and have dinner with Darren. Darren is a married man who stayed with his wife because of their autistic son Nikki, but presumably does not live in the house with his wife. <br /> <br /> May attracts Darren because he is manly and likes the bond they seem to have. Darren is attracted to May because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not receive from other women in her life. (He also becomes too interested in the money, which, according to May, she can give him to “get away from it all,” although he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on this journey. They end up sleeping together in spare room during the day, and Mei enjoys performing as a woman she hasn’t known for years and never expected to find out again. As her daughter Paula often told her that she would leave married Darren, it becomes part of rationalization Mei that what she does is good. <br /> <br / > In a group of writers headed by Paula, May is introduced to her, rather forcing him to gather with a widower she is not attracted to. we see complete disgust on May's face when she tolerates a one-time horrible connection. <br /> <br /> In the end, Paula discovers through some very graphic sketches made by her mother that her mother and Darren were really having sex. <br /> <br /> This film will surely be watched in many different ways. Sympathies will be divided. At some point during the writing of Paula’s group, Mae, in a short essay, talks about how she felt as if she hated her children by the end of the day, and went to pubs after they slept before returning home. her husband. <br /> <br /> Obviously, a good mother does not think of leaving the children alone while she goes to the local pub. May, however, also showed earlier in the film that her husband did not like that she had friends, so she did not have them. She did what he wanted her to do. She was unhappy, but put up with it, because, as she said, "it was easier." Therefore, although May was not the best mother, for those who are inclined to sympathize with her, May’s actions can be seen as an act of a woman who just wants to be sexy and live “a few minutes” in her life, a Woman who just wanted someone he listened to her, knew her as a person, had a friend and lover. <br /> <br /> Paula, although she is neurotic and unhappy, may have become so because of the distant parents who raised her. Of course, it is not difficult to understand why Paula feels completely devoted to her mother. <br /> <br /> This is a well-made film, with more difficulties than I mentioned, and, of course, one that will leave the viewer with many, perhaps, contradictory reactions. This is a film that is worth discussing and discussing, and, above all, worth seeing. <br /> <br /> One thing that the film leaves us is the horror and fear of a lonely life. Regardless of who every viewer considers “right” or someone else thinks “wrong”, this topic of old age and loneliness, which causes a feeling of fear in most of us, is inevitable.
