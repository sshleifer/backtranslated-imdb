A mad, almost plotless subject of mood, and if he is more inspired by LSD than the Devil, we must remember when it was made! After the startling discovery of CM (which even in itself is not what it seems), we turn to soft focus and dreams, fantasies or memories. Lots of literary and cinematic references, and indeed, this is a film by Franco, which Lang praised himself. A beautiful and fascinating film takes place at a leisurely pace, but has richness in every fold. A rare film to languish inside. Old Jess could make them when she tried. Excellent central performances, including the indomitable Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I didn't even mention the place in Lisbon - oh!
