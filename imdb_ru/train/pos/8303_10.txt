In this film, there are literally every action movie cliché, and they all work in their own interests. Straight out of Deadly Weapons, Gary Bucy pierces, shoots and laughs in this film with such reckless refusal that it can only entertain and entertain. There are tanks, helicopters, machine gun battles, grenades and ice cream wagons, and if they don’t have enough good reasons to watch this movie, then how about the best ... Danny Trejo. And if you don’t know who Danny Trejo is, then you certainly don’t like this movie.
