Moe and Larry - recently husbands with black heads, having married the demanding sisters Shemp. In his music studio, Shemp learns that he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone! <br /> <br /> “Beware of husbands” is a remake of The Groom Without a Bride in 1947, which many consider to be one of the best films about Rick with Shemp. The remake contains most of the material from this movie. New scenes, filmed on May 17, 1955, include a storyline in which Mo and Larry marry Shemp sisters, as well as prepare a turkey with the addition of turpentine! Several new scenes are also added to the end of the film (the double for Di Green was used; if you blink, you will miss the appearance of the double.) <br /> <br /> “Be careful, husbands” would make only a story about the marriage of sisters for a good movie. Budget considerations, coupled with fewer bookings for comedies with two rollers, influenced the decision to use older frames. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the Stooges still made completely new films, most of their releases by 1955-56. composed of older films with several new scenes. “Beware of husbands,” although one of these hybrids is watchable and interesting; we will again see most of the "bridegroom", and the new scenes are funny enough to help the viewer go through the entire movie. This film is one of the latest comedies of Rick, in which Scamp’s new footage was shown, and it was released six weeks after his death. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
