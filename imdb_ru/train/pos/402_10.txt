I previously saw Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In this film, the scene takes place in the mountains of China, the legend of Tzu looks like another dimension! Thank you for Tsui Hark making extensive use of CGI effects. He is able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds, lands where creatures fly freely, and forces varying from razor-sharp wings of the blades, cracked swords and the ultra-steep moon ball. <br /> <br /> While there are a lot of characters in this movie, the focus is on King Sky and Enigma. There is romance here, although the film seems much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful, and her presence on the screen makes this film worth seeing. At first, I like the way she looks like the Countess (from the soldiers of Zou), and she plays Enigma well when confronted with her past life. Oh, by the way, did I mention that Cecilia is very attractive to the eyes? <br /> <br /> In truth, the warriors of Tsu had more comedic elements, and the special effects were limited due to their time in 1983. Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in the cinema.
