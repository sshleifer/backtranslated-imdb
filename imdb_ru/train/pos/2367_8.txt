I could not take my eyes off this film when it appeared on the cable. Dialogue and costumes have the qualities most easily associated with soft core porn. In this case, an expedient plot serves not as a means for sex, but for serial beatings with nunchucks. (Perhaps for sex too, but not on Indian television, anyway.) Without being a fan of the genre, I could not find Jeff Wincott, and I did not have a single link to the search. Only once did Bridget Nielsen exchange her futuristic nurse costume (thus, the mayor!) For the high-top withering that we remember from Beverly Hills, Police II, I gave her a positive ID. <br /> <br /> This film will not Doubt entertain any fashion fan of the early 90s or the nod-and-wink slok in the spirit of Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a genre tag to “so bad, this is good”?
