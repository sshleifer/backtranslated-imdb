Shooter was a different type of film for Mikhail Dudikov. Although this film is usually associated with action movies that use martial arts, this film, since it was a western, allowed him to show that he is a much more capable actor than some of the formulaâ€™s plot lines allowed. <br /> <br /> The problem, of course, is that the film does not allow for any solid character development. The implementation is really left to the viewer. We can only guess at the sadness that made Arrow, whose real name is Michael Atherton, the murderer, who he is the murderer, keep in mind that a small town, terrorized by a local ruffian, hails as a hero who can free it from his suffering.
