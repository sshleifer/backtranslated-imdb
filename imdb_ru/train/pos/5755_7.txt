This is a rather strange movie. It really looks like a film about exploitation with excessive violence and unrealistic situations, but unusual to be built around rural characters fighting against each other, as opposed to the invading "other." <br /> <br /> The film is an excessive stereotype of Vietnam veterans, in a long series of films that portray the vets of that war as dangerous psychopaths. The last line of Chris Kristofferson sounds like this: “I haven’t lost the war yet”, as he meets his demise after having made a long way of killings and destruction, including the city police chief and his brother’s girlfriend in a particularly frightening scene. Nevertheless, Christofferson is a good enough actor and charismatic enough to carry this villain with surprising depth. Vincent is undoubtedly a golden boy, but with sufficient intensity layered on his clean cut. The film has some similarities with the plot of Winchester 73, where Jimmy Stewart is trying to tolerate a crime brother until he is forced to act against him. <br /> <br /> The movie has a b-movie class action, although Christofferson, Vincent, the gorgeous Victoria Principal and Bernadette Peters give her a class rating. <br /> <br /> I give her 7 for the fact that I have long lost sight of the American psyche of post-Vietnamese / pre-Korean introspection, paranoia and confusion, and the film industry, which was ready to deal with such topics at that time. <br /> <br /> SEE ON THIS channel, a great network that continues to play back a lot of old movies from the 70s - 90s, regardless of political inclination.
