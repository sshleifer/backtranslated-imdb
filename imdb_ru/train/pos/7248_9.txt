When I first saw The 3000 Crash, I had no expectations from this film. Although it was not as bad as it seemed to me. This is a kind of Italian version of the Roadwarrior with the cast, which is almost known in Italy, including the Venantino Venantini. Behind this story are Eliza Briganty and Dardano Sacchetti, who are also responsible for the story of zombie cannibals. You can also see other references to Italian horror films: Luca Venantini plays the role of Tommy, and you can see this child in Paura nella citta dei morti viventi (City of the Living Dead aka Gate of Hell) as John Robbins and in the Apocalypse of cannibalism as the role of Maria's brother . Quite an interesting movie, with some boring roles.
