I remember when I was five years old, and my parents thought it was a regular animated film .... except when bras and bullets started to fly. I have to agree that this film will upset one and all, because it is set up to distinguish one and all ... but the truth is that it is damn fun and deep. I recommend this to anyone who loves iconic classics. Also try Fritz the cat and Nine Lives Fritz the Cat. If I'm right, Ralph Bashki also starred in this film. It involves a cat that is going through difficult times with family, streets, work, etc. When I was old enough, I rented all these films. Because Coonskin was an offensive title in that era, it was also called Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki also starred in Cool World with young Brad Pitt. The lively movement was another cartoon that touched the young manâ€™s street life.
