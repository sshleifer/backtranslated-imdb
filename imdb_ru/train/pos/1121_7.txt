Here is a real freak for you. It starts with another takeoff on the scene of the soul of PSYCHO, on campus, then becomes crazy when several students and their dumb guys head south for Spring Break. The trouble begins when they enter the county of the bushman, who is ruled by the killer Shinf Dean. One of the college cuties wanders through the woods, witnesses the sheriff's murder and opens his head. Then the time will come when Dean steals MACON COUNTY LINE, when Dean pursues, catches and kills witnesses one by one. Tony March at the goal as angry, happy with Dean's shotgun. The overall tone of the film is really disturbing. The ending is so sharp that it seems that the director has almost no film; this is also a study in desperation. SHALLOW GRAVE is a must for misanthropes, women haters and nihilists all over the world.
