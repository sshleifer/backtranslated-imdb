I accidentally watched this movie by buying it as side B on the DVD with the film Omega Man. Omega man was a little disappointed - with the exception of the beginning, which was clearly an inspiration for 28 days later, the rest is just the material of television films. But Soilent Green is in another league. I bet it's one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in the film that I have never seen. Heston casually goes to bed with "furniture", discussing something completely unrelated! A whole crowd of people picked up a park of mechanical diggers! A priest accepting a confession and shot by a confessor. Well, maybe it has been done since - but not so many films that would be as original as this one. And what the hell is going on between Heston and Edward J. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple or what? Fortunately, I saw this film, not knowing the end - which, apparently, is rare. Then I looked at it again and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile. Very good script - and a few great sets too. Just when you thought you saw everything. ,,
