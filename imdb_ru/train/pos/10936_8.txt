Most frankly, there is a direction and choreography, which limits each fighter to "style" - it is really based on Chinese circus acrobatics and comedy theater, but the effect works. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is a camera language that uses some impressive methods (even by today's standards) that change the projection speeds from real time to slow motion and from unfiltered to filtered views to display the direction of history to the past or the future. <br /> <br /> The least obvious, but the most powerful and unexpected is the design.

One by one, he finds out who is who, with the same speed as us. who is who. All this follows the tragedy / noir arc. The ending tends to be ironic, a la "Sting." Much smarter than what we usually get from this genre. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the “five poisons” is a sample of Tarantino’s “deadly viper-killers” from the Kill Bill volumes.
