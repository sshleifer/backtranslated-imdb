Holly solves the problem of child sexual exploitation, which is widespread throughout the world (about 2 million children become victims of human trafficking every year), and does so very sensitively and without manipulation - a high order, which the Priority Films team does with great success. American actor Ron Livington starred in the film with rookie Toui Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly, and together they screen, which is common for people in the infamous k11 redlight district in Cambodia. Despite the fact that it touches on a heavy topic, there are moments of laughter and hope in the film, when we get closer acquainted with the characters, not allowing the two-hour film to be too difficult to watch. I am glad that such a film attracts the attention of the whole world to this problem. Child prostitution must be stopped, and this is a very good first step. It's great, and everyone should see the movie.
