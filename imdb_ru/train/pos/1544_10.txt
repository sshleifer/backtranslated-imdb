This is a great but challenging spy thriller during the First World War in the unique Italian style of the 60s. From the psychedelic graphics of the opening credits and the magnificent account of Ennio Morricone to the lesbian love scene with Capuchin and carefully thought-out apocalyptic scenes of the battle without land with poisonous gas and German cavalry in full gas-tight "assault" equipment - this is a film that cannot be missed. This is a film that reflects the horrors and cruelties of war and the ruthlessness of players on the battlefield and beyond. In addition to the battle scenes, some of the production and special effects are primitive, obviously, because the bulk of the budget for this film was saved on the battle scenes, but for movie lovers of the 60s this should not be a problem. I first saw this movie on TV many years ago, and I had the foresight to record it on VHS. I still have a cassette, and I enjoy watching it from time to time.
