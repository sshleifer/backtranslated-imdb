William H. Macy is most sympathetic and convincing here, like a hired killer and a loving father who wants to leave the family business, do not anger his powerful parents. Most of the same territory as the TV Sopranos, from the point of view of the middle age crisis, has a criminal theme (here he also attends psychiatry), but still worth seeing due to some tight direction from Brommel, this guy leads the next script and all around great performances. Macy's great, as always. This is probably his best role since Fargo. Donald Sutherland is at his best - an overbearing father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly exciting dramatic twist like Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is superb as the bright and sensitive son of Macy (many of his lines sound impartial and wonderful). Even Neveu Kampell (whom I usually find disgusting) is irresistible as a worried young woman who captures Macy's gaze. All this is accentuated by a moving score and a clear pace that leads to predictable, but still powerful climax and significant and touching consequences. This film deserved a much wider release, as I suspect that it would be associated with the audience.
