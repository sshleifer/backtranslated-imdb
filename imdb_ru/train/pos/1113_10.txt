Sandra Bernhard - a real character and, of course, one of the funniest women on earth. She began her career as a comedian in the 1970s, but her big breakthrough came in 1983 when she co-starred with Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro in Scorsese's underrated “King of Comedy” masterpiece. However, her film career never began. She made some strange, but entertaining pictures, such as Dallas Doll (1994) or Dinner Rush (2000), but the most amazing were the ones she created for herself. <br /> <br /> “Without you, I'm nothing” is undoubtedly her best effort. This is an adaptation of her hit Broadway show that made her a superstar and Madonna’s best friend for about four years. In ten beautifully set and set scenes Sandra turns from Nina Simone to Diana Ross, talks about her childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco, and performs songs that were celebrated by Bert Bakharach, the Prince or Sylvester. one point but it's funny. If you're a Bernhard fan, you can't skip this film, it's a tribute to both her (strange) beauty, and her extremely unconventional talent as a comedian. And this influenced the directors in their work ?? "Hedwig and the evil inch" , for example, would have looked quite different if “Without you, I am nothing,” would not exist.
