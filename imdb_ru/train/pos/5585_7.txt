It was a very bold film for the day. It can even be described as soft core porn for dumb. It was a walkie-talkie, but the dialogue was extremely limited in German. In any case, it is not necessary. <br /> <br /> Young (19 years old) Hedy Lamarr finds himself trapped in a loveless marriage with an obsessive (stereotype?) German and after a short time in marriage, which, obviously, was never completed, returns to his father . <br /> <br /> In a famous and funny scene, she decides to go on a nude dip one morning when her horse is distracted by another. Then she is forced to run around the field in pursuit of him, leaving her clothes on the horse. The engineer picks up her horse and returns her clothes - after inspection. <br /> <br /> They sit for a while, and at the zen moment he gives her a flower with a bee sitting on top. Here she remembers her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and the insect. She knows this man is different. <br /> <br /> She returns home and, eventually, searches for our young man and finds ecstasy that she was denied. You can use your imagination here, but his head disappears from view, and we see her writhe with pleasure. Since he never undressed, you can imagine ... Of course, respect for women by director Gustav Machata and shock for the audience in 1933. <br /> <br /> The only thing that overshadows this beautifully made film is excessive guilt and a strange ending.
