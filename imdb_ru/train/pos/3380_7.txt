I saw tons of science fiction of the 70s; some are terribly bad, while others think it is provoking and really scary. Soylent Green fits into the latter category. Yes, sometimes it is a bit captious, and yes, the furniture is good for a giggle or two, but some films seem terribly prophetic. Here we have a film for 9 years before Blade Runner, which dares to present the future as dark, scary and nihilistic. Both Charlton Heston and Edward J. Robinson live in this much better than the Ten Commandments, and the scene of suicides with Robinson’s participation terribly anticipates Kevorkian and his loved ones. Some of the installations are outdated (can you imagine how the director gets away with the notion of “women as furniture” in our “oh so politically correct” 90s?), But you can rarely find a film from the Decade “I” make you think. This is what I would like to see on the big screen, because even in a widescreen presentation I do not think that the total volume of this film will receive its due. Check this.
