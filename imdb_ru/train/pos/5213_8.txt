This is the first review I wrote for IMDb, so it’s with me, but I caught this click on HBO and was very glad I looked at it. Richard Gere is great in this film as a passionate agent / detective who breaks the rules to get the job done. I think the story is gorgeous, and there’s never a dull scene that slows down the pace of a movie. Some parts of the movie that are related to insane sex addicts are pretty shocking, but if you have ever seen a crime movie such as Se7en, you can simply digest the scenes. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are looking for a good detective / unknown film, ignore the low rating of this film on IMDb and be sure to watch it.
