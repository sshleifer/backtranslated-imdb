For a low-budget project, the film was a success. The story is interesting, and the actors were convincing. Eva Longoria, who is currently filming Dragnet, is sexier than ever. Places were ideal for the gangster plot, and the director shows his talent, taking on many roles for his project. Of course, this low-budget movie could use better editing transitions and more special effects for gun scenes, but the music makes this scenario move. Although this film has its own problems, such as continuity, I must say that I rent the next film director. If you are a student of a film, you can learn a few things from the director's comments.
