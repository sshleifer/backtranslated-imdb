I think that, unfortunately, the leading comments on this film include the words "Stupid and terrible nonsense." I think this is a very funny movie and great entertainment. You need to suspend your disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian can fall in love, have a baby and live happily ever after. But it's always great to see how it plays out in the movie and gets warm. Is it so impossible? There are much more implausible events described in other films. The acting is good, the script is funny. The only negative comment is that this story could well end when the family leaves their original home, instead of investigating whether the man retains any residual homosexuality.
