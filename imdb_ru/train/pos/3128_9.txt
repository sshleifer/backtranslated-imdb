Trite! I like it! Roots - the same as the TV show was about 40 years ago! Adam and Bert kindle the same chemistry on the screen that never disappeared! They recreate old memories, plus the actors who have been playing them since the 1960s, show some backstage things that are quite interesting to know. In the 1960s, for many of us, television was a banal escape, and this DVD is no exception if you are familiar with the original TV show. Scene of the battle with the written "Bofs and Bams" or something fantastic! The cinema scene shows clips of villains who have passed away. Frank Gorshin appears at the end. I guess he passed away shortly after this DVD was released, so, to his great confession, he returned to play the villain for Adam and Burt again, just as he did for Batman and Robin many years ago. He has not lost touch! Thank you Julie Newmar for playing the role of the villain again. In conclusion, I think that this DVD is for great memories, and I want to thank both Adam and Bert for returning and recreating these memories for those of us who remember the original - !!! Thank you, guys!!!
