Solino really touched me with his deeply drawn characters. Being a simple story about the rivalry between two brothers, it was not just about hate or jealousy. What I liked most about the film was how I could identify with the feelings that Gigi felt, especially when he had to take his mother back to her hometown in Italy and skip the participation in the awards ceremony of the festival. his film was presented. Seeing this character who fought so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so sad. Even at the end, when he made another attempt to contact his father, he was so brave. And, as in real life, most fathers can never pass through their walls to reach out to their children. I could even identify myself with Brother Giancarlo, who, being more self-confident and older brother, had so much uncertainty. A really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry.
