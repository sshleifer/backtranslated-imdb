Why this movie is not among the top 250? This film still looks strikingly fresh 56 years after its production, but it could only be made after W.W.II due to the sensation of nearness of death. People were more aware that life could be stopped at one unexpected moment. What about after life? I liked the scene at the end with the court, and all the people of all nations gathered. Phlegmatic Judge (Abraham Soufer, typical British judge), Dr. Reeves (Roger Livesey), defending Peter Carter (David Niven), and also June (Kim Hunter) against US Attorney Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I) is American-) That's all creatively! Michael Powell wrote, shot and shot this amazing film, which is a real “tour de force”. The meaning of the film is clear: in the universe the law is the most important, but on earth nothing goes beyond the limits of love between people. The way this beautiful story is told is much more interesting than any Hollywood movie.
