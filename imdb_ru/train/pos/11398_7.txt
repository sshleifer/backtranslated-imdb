I like this movie. It was carefree, delightful and very colorful. You can see that MGM demonstrated Technicolor. There are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film. Every scene is full. The choreography was great. Gene Kelly is a miracle. He is so talented. The dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed and well thought out. He understands that dancing can tell a story just like everything else. The last section of the film, the grandiose dance sequence, is very impressive. What makes this film very special is Gershwin's music. Few American composers had the best present for the melody. I really like the music of Gershwin. It is charming. Ira Gershwin is undoubtedly one of the greatest lyric authors. He is so witty and charming. It was a very interesting movie.
