Gung Ho tries to express many ideas and at the same time entertain us with a wise comedy. The result is uneven, but generally interesting. Keaton balances all three aspects of his protagonist. Wantabedde is even better. One warning: George Wendt is very poor in his support role. Otherwise, this is a pretty nice time capsule.
