Playing with the queen is hard. On the one hand, the actress should be majestic and domineering, and on the other hand, she should show vulnerability in a difficult situation, as well as gain courage and determination to overcome differences, since almost all films about queens have this storyline. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is quite radiant, like Victoria, but she is not as complete as I would like, not to blame her. I can't help but feel that this is an adaptation of the Mills and Boone novel compared to a darker and more dramatic film about another young queen, Elizabeth. Therefore, Blunt cannot control the gamut of royal emotions, at least not fully, since she, as you know, is a young Victoria. To see old Victoria, see Mrs. Brown. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Vall√©e is an interesting choice of director for the film. The last time he did was C.R.A.Z.Y., who was superb and promoted him to fame. It was a completely different film, but I remember that it looked great, and this is probably the main similarity between the two films. But while Vally wrote C.R.A.Z.Y., it was Julian Fellows, and although I really liked his Gosford Park, the story for this film was much less interesting. I was soon lost with all government policies. Perhaps it was less attractive because there was no potential decapitation of the monarchy. I'm just talking.
