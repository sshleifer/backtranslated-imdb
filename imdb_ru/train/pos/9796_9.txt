In 1993, after the success of the first season of "Batman: the animated series", Warner Brothers was assigned to the team responsible for the hit show, to release a full-length film, originally intended for Direct-To-Video, but already theatrical. status. This will become known as Batman: Ghost Mask. Ten years after “Ghost”, we had three more feature films released by the guys from WB, “Sub-Zero”, “The Return of the Joker”, and now “The Secret of the Bat” joins the family. <br /> <br /> The plot is basic and in many respects similar to Mask of the Phantasm: a new female witness who models herself after Batman started targeting operations led by gotham mafia boss Rupert Thorn and Oswald Cobblot, AKA The Penguin. Now Batman must try to solve the Batman mystery before she crosses the line. <br /> <br /> Animation is the sleeker, futuristic style that was used for Batman: the fifth and sixth seasons of the animated series (AKA New Adventures of Batman). it's pretty pretty done, and as smooth as the Return of the Joker animation. There is also some use of CGI, but it is insignificant compared to its oversupply in Sub-Zero. The music was fine. Excellent, exotic and similar to the Justice League score, although points in the score when the old animated theme of Batman pops up, will certainly cause waves of nostalgia for the hearts of rodents of old fans. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as always, does an excellent job with the work of Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's also great that old Batman: the animated series graduates are back; this includes Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon), Robert Costanzo (Detective Bullock), Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon / Batjirl; her cameo hints at the romantic relationship between her and Bruce, mentioned in “Batman Beyond”) and Efrem Tsimbalist Jr. (Alfred). <br /> <br /> The villains were also great - especially considering that Rupert Thorn, the old mafia boss from the original series, appeared for the first time since the fourth season. <br /> <br /> In general, although MOTB doesn’t quite fit the standard set by the Ghost Mask ten years ago, it’s great for animated Batman movies. And if you have a DVD and you're a hardcore fan, you'll love the five-minute short Chase Me.
