Often films of this kind are found as a mixed package with a lot of work and little effort to fill the lead time. Whether it is celebrity support or the project itself, Paris je t'aime never falls into this area. I believe that I can say that the film as a whole is better than its parts. I think that between the miraculous transitions and the fantastic final sequence that unites the characters in one last look at love in Paris, the film will suffer if you can remove some cog. True, there are definitely some outstanding personalities who overshadow everything else, but in the end I get a steady image, even if only a split second of each short vignette. Love takes many forms, and the talent here comes to the occasion to surprise and excite the audience through the poetry and elegance of many aspects of emotion. <br /> <br /> Quartier des Enfants Rouges: Maggie Gyllenhaal surprises how the drug Actress acts in Paris and meets with her dealer. The disclosure in his report leaves you a little unbalanced, because the hobby is between two changing hands. <br /> <br /> Quatier Latin: Ben Gazzara and Gene Rowlands (recreating the relationship from the old Cassavet film?) bring some great sharp wits and sarcasm when they meet to discuss their upcoming divorce. The fact that their conversation is truthful, and that just annoying another, it's all nice, leaving a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Quais de Seine: Directed by Gurinder Chadha gives us a touching portrait of existing love beyond religious and racial differences. This is a cute little story about shy love between two people who clearly feel the connection, but cannot voice it. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: I confess that I was disappointed that Sylvain Chomet did not get the animation sequence put together, however, this living story about mimes in love in a Parisian prison has the same bizarre nature as his film Les Triplettes de Belleville. <br /> <br /> Tuileries: The Cohen brothers adhere to their strange sense of humor and deliver a good laugh. Steve Buscemi really shines and sells the performance without saying a word. His facial reactions to verbal insults of a disgruntled Frenchman are priceless. <br /> <br /> Bastille: here is a heart-rending portrait of a couple for love, only to bring her back in the face of tragedy. Sergio Castellitto and Miranda Richardson are worried when a couple encounters difficulties and discovers how strong the bond of true love is. <br /> <br /> Pére-Lachaise: A surprisingly funny little tale from the master of horrors Wes Craven. A little humor by Oscar Wilde can add levity to any relationship. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Alfonso Cuarón seems to be practicing the amazing long receptions he performs in Children of Men, with this story about two people in love walking down the street. When Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier eventually come to a close-up view, we also find the true context of their talk of “forbidden love”. <br /> <br /> Porte de Choisy: a very surreal look at the glamor of Paris, This is probably the weirdest record, but so intriguing that you can't take your eyes off the subsequent madness. Do not be angry with your Asian beautician, no matter what you do. <br /> <br /> Pigalle: an interesting look at the relationship in which the role-playing game takes place, which seems to have been frozen for many years. A little variety from Bob Hoskins is needed to kindle a fire. <br /> <br /> Quarter de la Madeleine: even Parisian vampires can find love among the hours of feeding. I do not know whether to be happy for Elijah Wood as a result or not. Beautifully filmed and muffled to allow the vibrations of a blood-red color, this short strange, but at the same time love. <br /> <br /> 14th arrondissement: leave it to Alexander Payne’s strange sense of humor to really add some depth to this offscreen story told about an American in Paris who found love. Her harsh, uneducated French language contrasts very much with the authentic accents that we have been listening to until this point, it is foolish enough to be both funny and absolutely truthful. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: An interesting introduction to the process. Paris may be a city condemned for daily activities, such as finding a place to park, but when love is found, it will be taken captive anywhere to continue the journey. <br /> <br /> Loin du 16éme: Catalina Sandino Moreno brilliantly shows that love for a child is due to her sophisticated performance, as the story is told by her singing to a small child, but each time is completely different. <br /> <br /> Place des Fetes: my favorite story about the band. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga are fantastic. The cyclical nature of the story and how fate brings the two characters together, so that Boro finally asked her for coffee, it is difficult to watch. Sometimes love at the last moment is enough to take care of this earth. <br /> <br /> Place des Victoires: one of the best stories about a mother trying to cope with the death of her little son. Juliette Binoche, being a mother, is destructive, desperate to look at her son for the last time, and Willem Defoe, oddly enough, is as beautiful as a cowboy who gives her a chance. <br /> <br /> Faubourg Saint-Denis: Sometimes you need to think he lost love in order to admit that he was not fully invested in a relationship. Melchior Beslon recalls, trying to figure out where they went wrong, through a series of sharp, quick cuts from his meeting with Natalie Portman before she “saw” how much she needed him. <br /> <br /> Le Marais: Leave it to Gus Van Sant to show us the story of a break in communication and understanding, since his films almost always deal with this or that form of alienation. His Elephant photographer is an American working in Paris who is a catalyst for the artist Gaspard Ulliel who incites love and soul mates. Sometimes you do not need to know what is being said in order to understand what is happening in the pauses.
