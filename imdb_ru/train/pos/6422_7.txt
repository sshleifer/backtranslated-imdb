Military training films are becoming so common that they are becoming a genre for themselves. Among the most famous of us are "Officer and Gentleman", "Top Gun", "GI Jane ", and now" Men of Honor. " The fact that this turned out to be true does not change the fact that the formula is the same. This film is probably more like “G.I. Jane, because he focuses on the desegregation angle. <br /> <br /> The story is actually quite inspiring and probably the most interesting story among the people mentioned above. Brashear (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is undoubtedly a man of great courage and integrity, and his character strength shines through in this film. Unfortunately, director George Tillman has a tunnel vision, introducing characters and avoiding the development of characters of various characters, other than Brashear, in favor of showing Brashear in a constant state of distress. Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is the central figure, and with the exception of the initial scene, fisticuffs and a couple of scenes with his wife, we know little about him. For example, Brashir sees scars on his palms on Sunday, and we must assume that he worked on the plow, but there is no further action on this issue. Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) gets only one short scene by which we can judge him. The rest of the time on the screen shows how he is pacing and ranting. If the director is going to create a story that interests the person, he must humanize the characters. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. gives a prominent role in the role of Brashear. This is probably the best I've seen him. This is a role and character that are much more complete than any other role he had played before, and he fits the occasion. In Jerry Maguire, Rod Tidwell was a charming but one-dimensional character with a depth of rain puddle. Brashear is much harder and more substantiated, and the problems it faces are life crises, which makes it much more difficult. This is a great recovery from Gooding's latest role in Cold Factor, a film so terrible that playing the role was almost an act of suicide. <br /> <br /> After he tried himself as a comedian (“Analyze It,” “The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,” “Meet the Parents,”) Robert DeNiro returns to his dramatic roots with outstanding performance. De Niro is not a bad comedian, he is such a wonderful dramatic actor that, it seems, he should not waste time on comedy. De Niro gives Billy Sunday an unshakable personality, a crying exhausted soul. Nice to watch him work. <br /> <br /> It seems that every movie I've been watching lately has Charlize Theron. I saw The Legend of Badger Vance, People of Honor, and Yards right in a row, and I began to wonder if she participated in each film in 2000 (in fact, she made only five). It was a minor role for Theron, but she managed it well and managed to stay with DeNiro step by step. David Keith, who starred with Richard Gere in “Officer and Gentleman,” has a cameo here. <br /> <br /> On the DVD there are some interesting features, including reflections of the real Carl Brashear and some deleted scenes. <br /> <br /> I liked this film, despite the beaten plot and one-dimensional presentation. I rated it 7/10. I love stories about losers, and I like stories in which strength of character is a central theme. This film is especially strong in both areas and brings us two unforgettable acting steps that compensate for some of the director’s shortcomings.
