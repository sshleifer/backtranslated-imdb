I found Gray Garden an exciting film, an amazingly intimate <br /> <br /> look at overly eccentric people who have the right idea in general: forget about society <br /> <br /> and live in a dilapidated house without heating and a huge <br /> <br /> brood of cats and raccoons, defending their own interests, <br /> <br /> as usual, all the while chatting in the chamber. <br /> <br /> Big Edie and Little Edie are two crazy people that the Mazles Brothers <br /> <br /> chose to document. They look like characters from the film Fellini, only unfamiliar, if there is any sense in it. Old Edi is <br /> <br /> almost bed-ridden, with lots of papers, clothes and dirty dishes growing around her <br /> <br />. Little Edie is even more interesting. She <br /> <br /> bounces around the house, always wearing a grandmother’s headdress <br /> <br /> completely covering her hair. We <br /> <br /> never see her hair throughout the entire film, nor do we ever get a hint of <br /> <br /> that she still has a lot. However, at fifty-eight, she is still beautiful and full of life. <br /> <br /> In Gray Gardens, we feel that both of these women are <br /> <Life has become much smaller than it used to be. Little <br /> <br /> Edie is probably the saddest of them. While her mother got married in her <br /> <br /> early years, started a family, lived luxuriously and even made some recordings (a scene in which she is 77 years old she sings <br /> alongside with the recording of "Tea for two", which she made decades ago, is one of the best scenes of the film), Edie left her promising career as a model to take care of her sick mother. At 58, she was still eager to find the charming prince <br /> <br />. In any case, Little Edie is still a little girl, <br /> <br /> full of dreams of glamor and fame, as well as of home and romantic bliss that have not yet been fulfilled. <br /> Highlights of the film include moments of discovery, where Little <br /> <br /> Edie explains his outfit in front of the camera, the “tea for two” sequence, <br /> <br /> the birthday party , culmination dispute, product delivery scenario and attic scene. All this is incredible <br /> <br /> frankly and unpretentious And it became even more remarkable <br /> <br />, since all this is real. <br /> <br /> I propose to see the Gray Gardens side by side with Kenneth. <br /> <br /> Anger is a short point to Puce. A criteria DVD costs $ 35, but it is worth every penny.
