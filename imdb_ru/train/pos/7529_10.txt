Two years have passed, and basically everyone looks different, some for the better, and some for the worse. I still enjoyed the same as the original. <br /> <br /> Although they had some flaws, such as changing the Joker, he now has no red lips, and he looks like more blackish hair and black pupils, which Mark still talks about. Hamill, that is a plus, I think. They made Poison Ivy more white, hinting at the fact that it becomes more like a plant, and female cats look quite different and not as “attractive” as it was in the original. <br /> <br /> Although costumes like Batman, Batgirl, Killer Croc and Scarecrow look awful, especially Scarecrow. <br /> <br /> The show is not as gloomy as the original, because Batman does not work as lonely as before. Most of the time I work with Batgirl and the new Robin Tim Drake. Although NightWing (Dick Grayson) often comes to the rescue. Batman gave up the yellow logo and the black wing on his costume, and it seems that he has become a bit bigger, but still kicks ass. <br /> <br /> The show is not as good as the original, mainly because of some of the updated characters, but the stories are as exciting as ever, and the dialogue is still elite. "Over the Edge" can be one of the greatest episodes of Batman in history, so be sure to check it out. <br /> <br /> Total 8-9 / 10
