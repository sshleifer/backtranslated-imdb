A wonderful and gritty war film about the inner torments of the blinded marine Al Schmid. Although it is difficult and unpleasant, in the end it is GEORICALLY - Schmid's triumph over disability and depression. The scene of the battle was superb. But one bone to choose. No matter how many .50 bullets they fired, I had never seen blows hit water or dirt! It hurts realism, but I can live with it. Excellent performance of Eleanor Parker, again, as his girlfriend.
