A warm, cute and surprisingly charming film about two antagonist workers in one store (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan), who lead the novel in their mailbox, and none of them knows. The key to the success of this film lies in the fact that Ernst Lubich does not allow any nasty sentimentality and encourages his actors to give modest, unassuming performances. As a result, you fall in love with almost all of them. <br /> <br /> In this film, a strong melancholy reigns, which I appreciate. Loneliness is the main theme, most obviously represented in the character of the owner and manager of the store, which Frank Morgan plays beautifully. He discovers that his wife is robbing him, and realizes that the successful life he created for himself is not enough for him not to feel lonely when he does not have a partner to share this. This makes the shy romance between Stuart and Sullavan even sharper, because they both turn to this invisible other, which everyone considers a soul mate even before they met. Of course, we know that in the end everything will turn out, but the film does not allow us to forget about that gloomy feeling that any of them would have experienced if he had found that reality does not correspond to fantasy. <br /> <Lubitsch fills his film with an cast that contains a lot of chemistry. A small group of store employees names themselves in the film as a small family, and this is the same as we. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, unsung romance. <br /> <br /> Rating: A +
