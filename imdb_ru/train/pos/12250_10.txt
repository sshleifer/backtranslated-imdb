Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Bravo! It is a pity that the Knight does not look as good as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did an incredible job. Bernard Hepton was beautiful as Emma's father. I like the end scene (which is an addition to the novel, but well written) when the harvest is in progress, and Knightley is having lunch with his employees and friends from high society. Emma has to show that she accepts it now. She has changed woman. This is too fast, but good. I'll buy it. Samantha Bond plays the former governess and confidant of Emma. She is beautiful. just as I could imagine her. I believe that when the UK does Jane Austen, this is the best. American versions of English literature are made for money, not for quality. Watch it!
