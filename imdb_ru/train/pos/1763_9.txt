This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. he had rude moments, but they were full of charm. it was the Altman script, brilliant physical humor and unconstrained friendship, which is pleasant to look at, and a part of life that most of us can relate to. and I can say with some honesty that I was afraid for Steve Carell's nipple .. I really was. Surprisingly, this is a good-natured, shameless comedy, mainly about love and the many relationships in which we can be on this path. Katherine Keener was awesome, like Trish, and all of Steve Carell's friends were vicious, but friendly and very funny. The idea that they suspected that Carell was a serial killer is a fun metaphor for a forty year old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to fall in love first. original, charming and very funny. highly recommended.
