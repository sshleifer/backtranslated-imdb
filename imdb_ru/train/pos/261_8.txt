I went to see this movie, waiting for a pleasant stay in the theater with my younger sister. Instead, I had to really control myself to convince her that I was not afraid. In many ways, itâ€™s still a children's story, but with a scenario that has great potential. Perhaps it was one of the worst films if it was planned for a different audience.
