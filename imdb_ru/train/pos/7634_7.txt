<br /> <br /> Okay, the film won no awards, it's pure gum, and this is a modern update, "It's a beautiful life." But this is just a cheap DVD release, and there are far worse ways to get $ 13. You get a movie that has an amazingly strong cast, but for the most part they were still a year or two from becoming celebrities on list B. However, this is a nice way to spend an hour and a half, just donâ€™t think about it too much.
