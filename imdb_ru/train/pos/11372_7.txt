"Citizen X" tells the story of "The Butcher of Rostov," the nickname of the vile and vicious Russian serial killer who claimed 52 lives in 1978â€“92. The film focuses on an aspiring detective story (Rea), who stubbornly pursued the killer against all odds on the face of intractable bureaucracies in self-serving and convenient denial. The HBO film for television offers a solid cast, good performances, relieves the audience of many creepy details, but plays like a document without the style of a similar Hollywood fare. An even and direct staging of a serious and relatively little-known story, more interesting than the "Jack the Ripper." (AT)
