I have seen a lot of Saura films and have always found it amazing how he combines music, dance, drama and great cinema in his films. Iberia shows even better Sauru, dealing with multimedia concepts and a more modern concept of dance and music. Another thing that caught my attention was that in this film dancers and musicians, dance and music, are equally important: the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation, exploring not only technical issues, but also the emotional experience of the game. Saura's interest in the bridge between classical and modern music and dance is another factor in the transformation of this film, perhaps the most aesthetically exciting among his other works. That is why I highly recommend it to those who love good cinema, good music, good dance, great art.
