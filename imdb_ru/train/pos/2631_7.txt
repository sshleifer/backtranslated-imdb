If the Lion King is a serious story about a young lion who grew up to avenge the death of his father, the Lion King is one and a half, the exact opposite, full of whims and joys. The lion king told a story from Simba, a young lion, one and a half from the point of view of Timone and Pumba, a less perfect duo consisting of a meerkat who left home because he could not dig tunnels without burying his friends and neighbors and warthog whose smell problem is. The film is not enough material, but Disney copes with the filling of various scenes with Timon and Pumba, when they "watch" the film with us. My favorite is singing that happens in the middle of a movie, make sure you look at the bouncing mistake! Disney advertised one and a half and a half as “the rest of the story,” although in reality it is not. This is simply another point of view of the Lion King, without all the serious material that permeated most of the second half of the original Disney classics. Believe Nathan Lane as Timone and Ernie Sabella as Pumba for their voice work, the film may not have worked without their efforts. They sing, they entertain, and they make us laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid a jacuzzi with a warthog.
