I remember watching this movie at the West End Theater in Louisville, Kentucky, when I was a boy. The scene where Dr. Carmus finds the gardener's coffin and the breathing dead body in it was the worst part of the film for me, only reinforced by the darkness of the film. I also wondered about the people hanging in the trees at the end, until I found out that part of the movie in which the Blackwoods name was changed from Blackblade due to the fact that family history had a character who was known for his numerous hanging by different people. Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to receive his blows from adding to the deaths caused by his family. I also noticed that when Foster enters the gate of the cemetery for the first time, he carefully notices the sharp object of the gate where he meets his end. I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to horror movie lovers.
