I myself feel that this film is a rare treasure. This is not only the beginning of the career of Shirley Temple, but also a rare look at how our society has changed. You must understand that some things that we consider to be sexual today would then be considered innocent. For example, the parents of children in the film, as well as many parents who took their children to watch this film, saw in this simply children who imitate adults. Most people do not think about someone looking at children who are sexually attractive, except for adolescent boys, eager adolescent girls. For them it was not sexy. Keep in mind, this was before we had the Internet, television, etc. Most of the sexual crimes were not openly disclosed. Occasionally a whisper about a child with a “funny uncle” happens. But that was often all that came out of it. Yes, very sad. But today it is rather sad, because even I, too, can see this film as something other than intended, innocent and funny. When I saw Shirley dance like that, and the boys looked into her eyes, yes, I felt uneasy. I must remind myself the time when this happened! These children did not know what sex is. Both parents and children in the film, and those who watched it, knew this. This thought may not even have occurred to them. In the eyes of an average adult, then it would not have been more sexual than if Shirley played at home. Even today, children will participate in a beauty contest, many are dressed very mature for three years of age. However, the child is just pretending. I do not blame the child for the desire to behave like an adult. Or old films that show it. Honestly, thanks to our media, many things then seemed sick and wrong. This can sometimes be for the better. But I truly believe that this film is not one of them. This gives a rare kind of innocent mentality that we have long lost.
