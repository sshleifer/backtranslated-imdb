Shirley MacLaine in another bespoke role. As a single mom's aunt in Chicago’s work district in 1962, the veteran character actress gets another training as a bold woman who will not allow any failures to overcome her spirit of success. The children, a teenage boy and girl, are drawn to their energetic aunt Zoe, although many of the magic tricks and practical jokes learned from her and used for all the wrong possibilities, eventually force them to be expelled from school. The plot is cleverly shrouded in a Cuban missile crisis with all the social consequences. Men build bomb shelters, people watch news programs on what seemed like the only TV in the diner, and a haze of anxiety and fear reigns in the air. When a “harmless” miracle is blown out of proportions, the climatic conclusion, however, makes the viewer feel good. Yes, Virginia, the sun will rise tomorrow! This is undoubtedly a low-budget production, it is still a cute little film, filled with magic, from which Sunday matinees were made. With a few select Oldies added to the effective soundtrack, this family will surely enjoy it. ****
