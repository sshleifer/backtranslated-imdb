breathtaking, this is without a doubt the best anime cartoon ever made. I first saw a castle in the sky in the late 80s when he was a child, and he left an indelible impression. Years passed, and I forgot the name of the film, and only by chance, browsing the Internet, I again found this masterpiece. after reading the reviews and analysis of other people, I am not surprised that he received such recognition and touched many, because he leaves the impression. a real fantasy adventure that must be seen by all children and adults. Itâ€™s best not to tell the story, so I would say that watching this movie would be clear and unbiased. if you have children, treat them, I promise that they will like it. There is nothing special to say about this work of art, but if you have not seen it yet, look at it and enjoy.
