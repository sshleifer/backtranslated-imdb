"Purple rain" has never been a critic's favorite, but it is a cult classic - and deserves it. If you are a fan of the prince, this is for you. <br /> <br /> The main plot - the prince sees his abusive parents in himself, and he falls in love with a girl. Believe it or not, this film is not just singing and dancing. There are many intense scenes, and it is touching. Sometimes it's funny, but when it works, it really works. Very hit. <br /> <br /> No one can truly star in a movie. Everyone on the part of the prince acts as "Time" and "Vanity 6". However, this adds charm to the film. When Prince appears on the screen, he lights it, and it's funny to see him at his commercial peak. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, go and see if you love a prince like me. If you are not a fan, it will make you one of them.
