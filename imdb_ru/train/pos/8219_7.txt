The series “Dirty Harry” began with a very harsh police action and was almost immediately covered by “Magnum Force”. By the time the Enforcer was rolling, Dirty Harry was a little more than a TV police show (saved only by Secret Daily). After a seven-year break, Dirty Harry finally returned to his roots. Perhaps this time it was not too long. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood makes the first well-staged film about Harry since Don Siegel shot the first, which helps a lot. Harry is again a darker character, not the cute cop he has become. He can say things like “Come on, make my day” again and you really mean it. “Sudden Impact” is the real sequel to “Dirty Harry”. An “Enforcer” should never have been done. <br /> <br /> 7.2 out of 10
