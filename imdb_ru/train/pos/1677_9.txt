"La Coda Dello Scorpione" (a.k.a. "The Case of the Scorpion Tail") was a continuation of the director Sergio Martino, dedicated to the wonderful film "Strano Vizio della Signora Ward". This is a typical release, which presents all aspects that fans of the genre have learned and loved. Quirky plot, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp blades and a bit of blood - all together to make one piece of Italian exploitation. <br /> <br /> A group of Gialli favorites, both in front of and behind the camera, work to make this one of the best non-Argento Gialli around. The aforementioned Martino adds his touches as a director, Giallo the Great Ernesto Gastaldi as a writer, Bruno Nicholas creates music, as well as many stars and Giallo stars such as George Hilton, character actor Luigi Pistilli and charming Anita Strindberg. br /> <br /> With this talent scorpione deserved? You put. The film works at different levels. This is a thrilling murder mystery, an intense and brutal horror movie and an exciting thriller. In general, one of the best gialli. <br /> <br /> Martino knows exactly what the fans want when it comes to gialli. In some moments of the film, he seems to almost direct Argento in his approach. For example, in the film “Crystal Bird”, a direct robbery occurs when the killer tries to break through the door, which actually surpasses Argento’s click. <br /> <br /> Are there any problems with clicking? Hmm ... only minor. First, any scenes that do not follow the killings or the nascent romance between the two leading roles begin to bore. But shortly before you fall asleep, the killer will jump out of nowhere, and you will immediately return to the dump of things. <br /> <br /> In addition, by the end of the turns become too strange. I mean, what purpose did the pins for a scorpion really serve? If you do not pay close attention to the dialogue, you can easily get lost because of the winding, elegant storyline. <br /> <br /> But apart from these minor quibbles, La Coda Dello Scorpione is a tense, tense, cool and all-around entertainment film for hyallo lovers. Look for it!
