Great idea: 11 stories about September 11th. 11 directors from different countries with different results. Ken Loach, talking about an immigrant (as usual), is simply brilliant (as usual). The Frenchman is also very good at his job, and the film from Burkina Faso was a pleasant surprise. However, the Israeli film was a bit boring, and the Mexican guy, well, he should quit directing and work in a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
