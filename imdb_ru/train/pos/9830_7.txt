No one really understands the numbering logic of Italian zombie films, but ?? honestly ?? why should we worry? Each film in the Zombie series delivers a lot of pleasure, unpleasant bleeding and unreasonable shocks, and Zombie 3 is no exception, despite all the production difficulties that occurred during the filming. This film began as an interesting project by Lucio Fulci, who had to tell you more about his success in Zombies 2, but eventually he became a typical product of Bruno Mattei with many flaws and stolen ideas from previous films. The script is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity, each brilliant idea from the “Night of the Living Dead” by George A. Romero and “Madmen” is shamelessly repeated here, and it’s really painful to look at acting. And yet all this did not upset me even for a moment, because exalted excessive blood compensates for everything! At a secret army base in the Philippines, scientists completed the bacterium "Death alone" and prepared it for transportation. After an unsuccessful attempt to steal a virus, the infected terrorist’s corpse is cremated, and the ashes from zombies infect the entire population of the neighboring tourist village. The last group of survivors must fight hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies, as well as soldiers in white overalls who were instructed to kill everything that moves in the infected area. This film is comparable to Umberto Lenzi’s The City of Nightmares. Really Bad ... but incredibly interesting with rapidly changing sequences of actions and a few very creative situations of zombie madness. For example, the undead birds were original, and the whole sequence of zombie birth in an abandoned hospital was also pretty cool. The infamous scene with flying heads is no longer as terrible as it was intended, and it fits perfectly into this fun and very nice Italian zombie film. Recommended to fans; not against negative reviews.
