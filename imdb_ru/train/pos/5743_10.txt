I like this movie! It was all that I could do to not burst into tears while watching, but it was really very encouraging. I was amazed at the performance of Ray Liotta, but especially by the talent of Tom Hulse, who depicts the twin of Ray, who is mentally slow because of the tragic and terrible event of childhood. But the character of Tom, although heartbreaking, does not know self-pity and is full of hope and life. This is a great movie, do not miss it!
