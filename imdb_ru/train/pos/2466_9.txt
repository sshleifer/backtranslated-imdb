I have never seen four hours pass as quickly as when I watched this movie. This film restores the power and art of Hamlet, which he always had to have. Even these oh-so-famous speeches are made in new and inventive ways. And the cast is incredible, Branna is the brightest star. It is his charisma, strength and command role that determine the film. Creating a complete and complete version fills so many holes and allows you to re-evaluate the tragedy, despite the length. Where we would expect a dark, gloomy castle, we are treated to a luxurious feast for the eyes. The only darkness comes from Hamlet himself, as it should be. It is worth spending time on all four hours.
