No movie caught my eye like this. You see, I wanted to watch this movie again for more than twenty-five years. The only time I saw him was a teenager, who may have been the year he was released, in 1977. <br /> <br /> What I remember from the film is that it has touched these deep emotions so deeply that there is still an overwhelming desire to watch it again. The intrigue of this film, created by the human element of the search for father and son, will surely affect every human soul that watches it. Why this film was not removed from storage and shown as often as many other films of lesser depth, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Postscript: The resulting copy of the film and after watching it was again glad to see that my memory is correct. The rating reflects the content of the film. I would like to watch this movie on DVD, as watching a 1977 movie on a used VHS tape has deprived the overall quality.
