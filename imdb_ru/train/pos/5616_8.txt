What can be said, in fact ... "The Tenant" is a first-class thriller, created with an equal amount of indecision and full-blown paranoia. This is an intricate film, every detail of which seems to be included for some reason, although the plot rarely makes sense, and most of it is never even considered objectively. Therefore, we remain with the increasingly unstable Trelkovski (Polanski) - the meek Pole, who got an apartment because of the suicide of the previous tenant - to lead us through a world of growing fear and insecurity. After a warming party with an apartment organized by a group of nasty employees, Trelkovsky is subject to increased, seemingly inexplicable control by other tenants in his building; the rest of the film tells about his mental deterioration and gives us full attention along with the subsequent efforts of David Lynch. The Tenant, however, is more thoughtful and ominous, riddled with unexpected comic relief, excellent actions and a truly elusive account. This film is better experienced than described, so hope for it.
