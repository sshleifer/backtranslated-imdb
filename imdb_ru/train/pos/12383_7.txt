Christina Rains plays a beautiful model in New York, who is looking for a new apartment and begins to meet with strange neighbors and reveals the secret about the building and how it slowly develops until the end of the film. This film has all the elements of a neat plot: from the Roman Catholic church against the devil, to the gate to hell, strange rituals, a growing conspiracy, and finally to the many talented famous actors and actresses filling the film. We have Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, plums Miles Beverly DeAndzhelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Uolkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum and forget John Carradine as an old priest. Many of these actors take it down â€” especially Burgess Meredith, who gives a wonderful comic / insane performance as one of the neighbors with a little bird and a cat. Meredith is remembered as Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some performers have little to do with Jose Ferrer in an ungrateful role, even if it is nothing more than a cameo. Sentinel is a beautiful horror film with a lot of psychological elements and some really terrifying scenes. The final scene is disgusting and yet frightening. I really find fault with some of the unsubstantiated sex and violence in the film, especially this scene with DeAngelo and Miles. Was it really necessary? I think no. In addition, the father / daughter material was also a bit big, but overall the film works and wins. Director Michael Winner does his job professionally and effectively creates tension and scary moments in the movies. Scenes from Carradine are especially effective.
