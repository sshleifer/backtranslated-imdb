To say that this film is just a demonization of Catholics, and the distortion of history is not true. This is not what this film is. <br /> <br /> This film is a commentary on abuses in the Church (although it can replace any influential body), how this abuse affects people and families, and how many people choose to simply allow and often participate. in cruel treatment, not thinking about yourself. The fact that the Catholic Church is wrong is simply explained by the nature of the real story on which the film is based. To label this as propaganda against Catholics does not seem to be enough truth about what the Catholic Church did from time to time; his story is often not great, and this is what films love this main point, and this needs to be emphasized. Yes, we should comment on the abuses committed by other organizations, but this is not the case for this film. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing film that brought me to tears and it’s worth seeing - “if we don’t do this to study the past, we have to repeat it”
