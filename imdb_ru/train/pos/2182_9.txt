This excellent film attracts the most talented actors and musicians in all its glory - the Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Manone feel completely at home in history, which Billy Wilder obviously set. I would like to know more about how much he did with it, because this is an exceptionally clever version of the story of a sterile host / fertile servant - almost an allegory of the entertainment industry, driven by a dried skull, but turned into a living world of art and games of the lower class, exploited by anyone and non-wasp. Looking at the last six decades of music, television and cinema in the United States, it is hard not to see the fundamental ideas of this film as prophetic.
