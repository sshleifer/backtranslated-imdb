Wow, it's been many years since I last saw this movie. Watching it in 2008 is definitely different from viewing in 1986. Initially, I did not think I could get through the film. The hunt for Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so unpleasant, arrogant and disrespectful that it was difficult for me to watch him. He embodied every negative stereotype of Americans. If it was not bad enough, as soon as the best workers of a small American town were shown, the image only got worse. On the opposite spectrum, the Japanese were represented as passionless workaholic robots. The film wasn’t even that funny, I was just hanging there because of its nostalgic value. And I'm glad I continued to look. <br /> <br /> As in the case of boxing, the referees influence how you finished the round. This film went from three to seven, I appreciated it because of the ending. The end was superb. You always want a harmonious ending, and that was just that. It was great that jobs and a factory remained in the city, but the most special was the marriage between Japanese customs and values ​​and American customs and values. It was a mediocre film that ended on a high note.
