This is a great movie about characters in the adult swimming class, their problems, relationships, and interactions with each other. It should have been more widespread, as it is much better than similar films of major studios at the same time. <br /> <br /> A swimming instructor is almost an Olympian studying basic adult lessons, and often the goal is to show off from her students. He tries, more or less, to reflect them, with varying results. <br /> <br /> Student characters are the mainstream of U.S.A; teachers, police, college students and retirees who for some reason did not learn to swim. The film tells about their relationship, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests during class. A few plots give funny feeds, including a teacher experiencing a divorce, some high school students making a documentary, and a girl who only meets with guys in the classroom. <br /> <br /> This is a good date movie, or just one to watch when you are in the mood for a romantic drama with the overtones of reality.
