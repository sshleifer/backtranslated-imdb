Besides Star Wars and The Wizard of Oz, it remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. This is a real shame, it’s not as famous as previous films (perhaps because it follows a story based on legends, not modern or sci-fi terms, and that it’s British, which means a smaller market for films), but it’s great Know this reputation deserves. <br /> <br /> As in all great family films, this film may be a child, an adult, or even a teenager (I'm 18 years old), but you need to appreciate it. classic movies first. I absolutely adore this movie. He has an extraordinary musical score by Miklos Roses (perhaps my favorite classic film), which competes with any Star Williams score, fast, but not conspicuous tempo, beautiful scenery, dialogue and the use of color (both decorations and the cinematography won an Oscar), and the most advanced special effects that won an Oscar (for now, and some are still staggering). And, of course, the sultry June Dupres looks like the princess vies with the soul of Catherine Zeta-Jones (she even looks like Jones!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is one of my time favorite movie (next to “The Adventures of Robin Hood”) and it really deserves more attention. This is a real magical adventure, and, along with Robin Hood, this is my film about a deserted island, which I can watch again and again without getting annoyed. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** (excellent)
