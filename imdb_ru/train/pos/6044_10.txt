Great British indie movie! Fantastic chemistry between the three main characters creates fun sets filled with drugs that Cheech and Chong would be proud of. It's nice to see Phil Daniels on the big screen (even if he has changed places since the appearance of quadrophenia!), And Gary Stretch is amazingly good and happy for the ladies! I liked the final fight scene with Zulu bow, and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he set himself on fire in Top of the Pops! ... he does not play ... he is really a conscientious British hippie !!! You don't have to be a biker to enjoy it, and itâ€™s straight to my replay collection after Friday night. <br /> <br /> Try this movie and you will not be disappointed.
