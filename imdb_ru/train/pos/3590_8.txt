I just watched this movie the other day when I was shooting it, and I thought it would be another movie with a girl trying to prove her point, but Diana joined boxing because she wanted to. I thought this movie was good. I gave him 8/10. That's how good it is. Plus the film with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. Even if she is only six years old.
