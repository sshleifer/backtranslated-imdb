<br /> <br /> The first thing I have to say is that I have Jake Speed. I have seen it at least 10 times. This movie is one of the funniest movies ever made. The film begins with the fact that Margaret (Karen Kopins) is trying to find his sister. Her sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family heard nothing. Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford) comes in and tells her exactly where her sister is and makes an offer to find her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. He does not work for money, because he just wants to help and a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) follows him and writes their adventures in novels. This film is a great adventure. It's fun, it's full of action, it's just great. I think this is a cult film with a very small cult track. Crawford is as beautiful as Jake Speed ​​and throws away some lines that you will never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also good as a girl and assistant, respectively. John Hurt, the guy who blew the belly of the Alien, plays a devilish, perverted villain who just adds fun. In many ways, this film is similar to Indiana Jones, in some respects it is similar to James Bond films. Perhaps he should have been called Indiana Bond, but whatever it is called, it is a very nice movie.
