This bright and funny short film of 1916, a time when Charlie Chaplin and Fattie Arbuckle were celebrities in a comedy, depicts young Oliver Hardy as a scoundrel who must quickly impress his rich uncle after giving birth to his wife and baby for his visit. <br /> <br /> Of course, things are not going so smoothly, and soon he will have much more wives and children than he can handle; plus the obligatory chases and misunderstandings that are the hallmark of early cinematic farce. <br /> <br /> A well-restored film can be seen as part of Oliver Hardy's Early Films and is now available on DVD - a great addition. Affordable large screen case favorite comedic duo.
