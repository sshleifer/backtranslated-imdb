If you grew up on a diet of game shows, you will realize that gradually you need more and better. Well, in the Running Man world, your needs will be met. After all, in this game show, prisoners are fighting for freedom, and the main prize is for their lives. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. It was such a parody of stupor that we observe daily. This is not one of the best performances of Schwarzenegger, but overall this is a very good film. The basic idea that Telekorporations will someday become the "real" rulers of the planet is very believable and very well represented in this film. Of course, there is the usual one-line Arnie, my favorite, when he is going to eject into the game zone, the host of the game show asks: “Any last words?” and presses the eject button. I give this film 10 for pure originality. I must have watched it 30 or more times. The only film, except the TV series "Die Hard", which I watched it often !! <br /> <br /> In short, do not think that you are the owner of T.V. - He owns you .....
