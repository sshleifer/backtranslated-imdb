This is the story of the 1873 Winchester rifle "The Gun that won the West" For cowboys, criminals, officers, or soldiers of the world, Winchester 73 was a cherished possession. The Indian will sell his soul to his own ... <br /> <br /> Winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart, a duet who will continue to create a series of excellent westerns that have added new, psychological depth to the genre. The story treats Stewart as Lyn McAdam, the haunting man who killed his father. Driving into Dodge City with his faithful friend Johnny Williams {Millard Mitchell}, Lin runs into the Dutchman Henry Brown {Stephen McNally}, the man he wants. But due to the fact that Wyatt Earp {Will Geer} took all the weapons from those who entered the city, both men cannot get the shootout they are ready for. Men instead enter competition to win the Winchester 73 rifle, a competition that Lin ultimately wins. But before he can leave the city with a magnificent prize, the Dutch ambush him, steal a rifle and quickly let the city through. When Lin goes in pursuit of hatred for both man and rifle, the gun changed hands several times, and each time a new dimension was added, like a day of reckoning for all approaches. <br /> <br /> A very landmark for what has become known as the so-called “psychological western”, Winchester 73 is basically a story about a decent person who led to marginal insanity as a result of an event in his past. There, shot in black and white (the only one of the western duets), the scenery is still breathtaking. The tone is set by the opening scene, in which Lin and Johnny are riding a horse, and in silhouette, walking down the side of the hill as they head to Dodge City. This is only the starting point in which Mann would use his perspectives as a way of combining with the emotional states of his characters. <br /> <br /> Stewart gives one of his best and most intense performances in the role of MacAdam, proving once and for all that he was one of America’s best and most versatile actors. The cast is not so bad. Shelley Winters is excellent as the only woman among the courage, while Mitchell, McNally, Gere and the always great Dan Durye add another class to the hearings. There are even minor roles for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, although the latter playing the Indian brave is too far away. <br /> <br /> Initially, the film was a project for Fritz Lang, who even had a script ready to run. But Lang walked away from this, which turned out to be a blessing for Western fans. Despite the fact that Lang was the same director as director Mann {and with the new script from Borden Chase and Robert Richards in his hands}, he set the wheels in motion to change the course of the genre. Not only with the continued efforts of Mann and Stewart, but also with those they influenced. Such as Budd Boyetcher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller, took notes, and, fortunately, for Western purists, they followed their example and carried the psychological torch even further. <br /> <br /> A big blow to the box office After the release of the film “Winchester 73” is a great movie that still does not give rest. 9.5 / 10
