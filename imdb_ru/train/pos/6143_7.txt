I never watched this 1971 film and was very entertained by this magnificent production, created by Walt Disney Studios, and magnificent animation creations. Angela Lansbury (Eglantine Price) played a prominent role as a woman who completed a witchcraft course and was a student who started flying on a broomstick and had a lot of difficulties during takeoff. Eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to travel to different parts of the world. However, Eglantine missed her last exams to become an experienced witch. Mr. Emerlius Brown (David Tomlinson) was the man who sold Eglantine this course in witchcraft, and he tries to help her in every possible way to find her solution. Eglantine has a purpose for her madness to prevent the Nazis from dodging England. Great family fun, and we need more of these films today.
