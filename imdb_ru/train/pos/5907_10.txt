This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. My parents come from rural India, and to some extent I saw the life of the villagers. Peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The film reflects the same thing. Full credit to the director and actor. They did a great job. I just wonder how films like Lagan and Pachel can go to Oscars, not Dogas. I do not understand the criteria by which films are selected. Does the money that matter, or have any big names in the film. <br /> <br /> I hope to see more of these films in the future.
