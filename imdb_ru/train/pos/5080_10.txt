When Mel Ferrer makes or takes a film, you can bet that any of his films will be visible from generation to generation. Only the appearance of Claudette Colbert, (Ellen R. Ewing), Egg and Me, 47, and the appearance in the film and the main roles in it, will make it an even more remarkable classic film. In this film, Ellen Ewing marries, and then she faces all sorts of mental problems and even murder. The mystery becomes very confusing, and Robert Ryan (David MacLean), “The Battle of Ardennell”, 65 years old, comes to the rescue of Ellen, and sometimes you even wonder that David is rising and rising. When you look through this picture, you almost begin to understand who is really crazy, and suddenly you start to change your mind about how the movie will end. The magnificent game of Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, who played a completely different role than he usually depicts on the screen. I forgot to mention that Mel Ferrer was married to the great movie star Audrey Hepburn. Great classic movie with great classic actors!
