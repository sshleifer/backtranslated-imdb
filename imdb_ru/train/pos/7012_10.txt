Despite the fact that it is a tear, it is definitely the movie "I feel good." All the actors were excellent, and Will Smith, as always, does the work and does it well. I could continue, but choose any ten from the “10” ratings, and they said it as well, and probably better than I could. <br /> <br /> BUT, since I have to add at least 10 lines to post a comment, I’ll say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown to me as a spectator. Her performance was very pleasant, and I look forward to her performance in many future films. <br /> <br /> And this film demonstrates that Will Smith has nothing more to prove in terms of his ability as an actor.
