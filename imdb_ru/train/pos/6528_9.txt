I saw this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, in a small cinema with 200 seats in the upper part of the main building at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I was absolutely interested in him. I like the mix of amazingly made fictional scenes. This is an amazing set design. The scenes really look like they were filmed in the 1920s or 1930s. <br /> <br /> And the music is so nice. <br /> <br /> I rate this experience 9/10. <br /> <br /> * ahead spoilers * <br /> <br /> The documentary tells about amazing bluesmen with black and white old scenes where a black man plays the guitar and sings. This is really awesome. But it also mixes in new groups, and this is probably one thing that I may not like in this documentary. This is too common use of references to modern rock bands playing these blues songs in a modern style. I didnâ€™t really appreciate their clever way to play such cool blues songs. This is the same imperfect musical taste that I discovered while watching the social club Wim Wenders Buena Vista. <br /> <br /> The documentary was such stormy applause at this first show in a small cinema that next On this day this documentary was shown to all and ordinary tourists on Croisette Beach in an open-air cinema. Although sand, projection quality and poor sound quality probably made it difficult for thousands of people who sat on the sand that night.
