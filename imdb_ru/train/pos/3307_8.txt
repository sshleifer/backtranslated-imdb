Let's start with the fact that the English title of this film, “The Power of the Province of Gangwon” is an absolute fallacy. The fact is that in the film Hon Sang Soo there are no real shots about wars, troubles and conflicts. So the idea to establish the power of the province is not suitable and not valid in the context of this film. If we judge this film by its Korean language, “Kangwon-do ui him” will look like a mysterious statement about the emotional turmoil of its young heroes, whose minds are not at ease. Hong Sang also sent a very prolific visual document about the strange choices made by people in their lives. These people are a couple of young girls who constantly demonstrate their mood, whims and fantasies. If making a film out of nothingness can be claimed as a director’s merit, then Hon Sang Soo should be given credit to a brave director whose films talk a lot about the ubiquitous insignificance of human relationships, moods and lives. Whether someone likes it or not This is the only fair conclusion that can be drawn from this film.
