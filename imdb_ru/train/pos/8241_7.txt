Fido is a very strange film. And in many ways, very good. <br /> <br /> My first thought after watching: how the hell are they going to sell this thing? If “Sean of the Dead” is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy, and his dog story is mixed with the nostalgic fifties comedy with zombies. It is definitely not falling out of the tongue. <br /> <br /> Fido has little Shawn Shawn, bloody laughter and a belly. This is a completely different beast (sorry for the pun). <br /> <br /> Fido begins with a black-and-white informational film that explains history: people won the war against zombies by developing a control collar that suppresses flesh eaters into stupid servants. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that the paranoia of the cold war of the fifties, parodying a la Matinée, awaited us, but soon we were thrown into the world of bright primary colors and the mid-fifties. - nostalgia for the class. <br /> <br /> Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely child who does not fit into the school. His mother is a potential social climber, and his father is nervous and aloof. <br /> <br /> In an effort to keep up with the Jones, mom (Carrie-Anne Moss) acquired zombies. At first, Jimmy is not interested, but Fido (Billy Conelli) soon turns out to be a great friend for Jimmy. While his collar is not blinking ... <br /> <br /> Fido is NOT a horror movie, but my problem with the movie is to find out what it is. <br /> <br /> Much of the humor has a bright family variety, and sometimes the storyline depends too much on the moments of the boy and his dog / family. <br /> <br /> Still, the film was shot with surprisingly dark, truly funny moments, which, despite the fact that it is welcomed, you will get an R rating for the fact that for long periods it is a family comedy. <br /> <br /> The film looks great and is wonderfully performed by all participants. <br /> <br /> Despite his difficult tonal problems, I hope that this film will find its niche, as it is a small jewel in the stream of cinematic crap this year.
