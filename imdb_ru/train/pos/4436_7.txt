The Tattooed Stranger was another one of those rare B-films that BBC2 showed on Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. See also "They live at night" and "The Brighton Strangler." <br /> <br /> In this episode, a man walking his dog in Central Park meets an abandoned car and finds a dead woman inside. She was shot and the police then tried to identify her only with a tattoo as the main clue. After his identification, the killer is found and shot at the end of the shootout. <br /> <br /> Most of this film was shot on and off in New York, so we will see some parts of the city. we usually do not see, especially the lanes. <br /> <br /> The cast is mostly unknown, and John Miles gets the best bills. <br /> <br /> A tattooed stranger is worth looking for. Excellent, but rather unclear. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
