The icy and deadly assassin Tony Arzenta (divinely smooth and commanded by Alain Delon) wants to stop the murder case, but the dangerous gangs he works for will not allow him. After his wife and child are killed, Arzenta announces the open door season to all those responsible for their death. Director Duccio Tessari tells a fascinating story at a constant fast pace, supports a truly serious and nonsense tone throughout, arranges exciting gunfights and exciting car chases with a significant tearing snort, and also focuses the story with explosive flashes of explosives. bloody violence. Delon's courteous and charismatic presence adds an extra class to the already exciting process. This film benefits even more from sterling, played in different ways, with the laudable contributions of Richard Conte as the wise thief in the mafia law Nick Gusto, Carla Gravini as the supporting friend of Argentina Sandra, Mark Porla as the true friend of Argentina Domenico Maggio, Anton Diffring the roles of the ruthless computing capo Gr√ºnwald and Lino Troisi as the poisonous gangster Rocco Cutitta. Glossy cinematography Silvano Hippolyti boasts several elegant pans. A frightened account of Gianni Ferrio strikes a great place. Erica Blanc and Rosalba Neri briefly resurface in elegant pieces. Moreover, there is no filler that we can talk about, and we even get a decent portion of delicious gratuitous female nudity. The striking conclusion packs a medium and long muzzle straight into the gut. A solid and satisfying winner.
