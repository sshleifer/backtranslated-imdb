I didn’t give this film an excellent rating to be honest compared to great classics such as Citizen Kane and Seven Samorai. However, this film is so wonderful that it is a pity that it is so poorly valued for the general voter IMDb. However, the IMDb voter is inclined to the caller, and “Poly” is no good. <br /> <br /> The only valid criticism I can offer is that Hally Kate Eisenberg did not portray a perfect stuttering child. Sorry, but I’m asking a six-year-old child to beat Dustin Hoffman, and Rainman asks the impossible in filmmaking. <br /> <br /> If you go past this minor complaint, the film has the best of many films: a friendly trip, a scam, a hero like a friendly party-goer (bird-party-goer?), Disney humor for young and old, etc. What don't you like? Tony Shaloub wears his role as a pair of comfortable jeans. It seems to be normal for him. (“I’m Russian ... I like long stories.) I don’t like mangoes, but it almost makes me want to go out and buy one. Watch the movie and it will make sense. <br /> <br /> Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin play very suitable roles in the film. Roles that are consistent with what we all know about them. I always found Jay Mora a little slimy, and his role on the screen also suits this one. The only surprise for me was that Jay was also Paulie's voice. In the end, even this works well: put the Parrot and Anti-Parrot together in a team, and this will create your own magic. <br /> <br /> If you are trying to find a film for you and children that is neither offensive nor boring, “Poly” is the perfect candidate. However, I admit that the happy moment colors my review of "Poly." was on a car trip during a heatwave. The air conditioner in the car died, half of the restaurants were completely cooled (like our hotel), and I said: “Let's watch a movie where the air conditioner works. itioning. “So we did. So for 100 minutes we were chilled, surprised and got a spiritual experience. When I recently saw it on a VCR under less emotional circumstances, I realized how well this film was made. <br /> < br /> This is a movie with a dream that you will not regret.
