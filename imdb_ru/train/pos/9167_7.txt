This, in my opinion, is much better than any of the versions of the 2nd 1990s, but still not so good. It seems outdated, perhaps because it is, but it does compare well with other BBC plays of the 1980s, such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. <br /> <br /> The length of this adaptation allows for a much better book than any of the versions of the 2 nd 90s, and St. John Rivers, at least, are illuminated, although not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester, but the actress who plays Jane is too old. There is definitely an opportunity for a television adaptation of such length, for which more than ten tenge is spent.
