Before going into politics or public service, Glenda Jackson was one of the best British film actresses. This film shows her talent, despite the fact that he plays a minor role in the star cast, which includes Julie Christie as Kitty, the wife of the British royal captain, who lost her memory of the last 20 years, and Jenny, played by the American Ann Unrecognizable role of a loving sister. Alan Bates plays the captain, who suffers from memory loss caused by a projectile attack during the First World War. Sir Ian Holm plays a smaller role as his doctor. You see familiar faces such as Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne and Frank Finlay. You can't help but watch Glenda play the humble housewife and the captain's first true love, but they come from different classes. This is not the best movie, but it's nice to see Glenda's amazing talent. She is still a fantastic actress, comedy or drama. She turns Margaret Gray into a nice character, and you understand why the royal captain fell in love with her.
