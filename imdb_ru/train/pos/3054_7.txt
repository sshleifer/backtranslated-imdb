Panic is a kind of crime comedy drama starring William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland and Neva Campbell. Alex (played by Macy) is the guy who kills people to live. But at the moment he is facing depression, which is why he sees a therapist. There he meets Sarah (Neve Campbell) and falls in love with her. He also faces another problem: he wants to quit the family business (murder), but now he does not know how to tell his father about it. <br /> <br /> The following is a story about a guy when he has a middle age crisis, faced with constant problems: falling in love with a pretty young girl and everything connected with it. <br /> <br /> Pretty good actor performances. Macy is superb as depressive Alex. I had high hopes for this, and it was a good film, but it didn’t fully manage. The story was pretty flat and cliché. <br /> <br /> 7/10
