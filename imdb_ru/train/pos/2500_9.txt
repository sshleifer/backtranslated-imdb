... would probably be the best word to describe this film (in my opinion). except for one wonderful fan service fan miracle (well, it was superfluous ~), it was a story that struck me. Hurray for Takahisa Zeze and Gakta! and I know that some people will disagree with me about this, but not one of the three main actors (the guys who played Sho, the son and Kay) gave a better idea (for me, anyway). it was Taro Yamamoto, boy number 5 from the royal battle! <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I like Hyde, I worship his voice, but the problem was that some of his scenes were a bit “off”, but I liked the scene where he danced with the body of a dead guy kills other guys. and Gackt was not so bad either, I preferred his character to be detached from the very beginning. I can't say anything special about my origin with Lee-Hom Wang, I won't pretend to know him, but he carried his own weight with a star train. <br /> <br /> This film paved the way for one of the best collaborations I've ever heard, Orenji No Taiyou (excuse my spelling if it is not). While the full song lasts about nine minutes, you will not notice the duration, because you enjoy listening to Gackt and Hyde together. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film is a must-see not only for fans (a huge fan base ~), but also for those who love fantastic, futuristic Asian-style films.
