Will Eisner's adaptation of SPIRIT to the TV screen followed many other suggestions developed on the comic book or comic book pages. (Remember that they are not exactly the same tool) It's really funny that this is the only adaptation (at the time of this writing) to clever Alex Eisner, a wise hack, a mocking superhero. <br /> <br /> History has it that Republic Pictures was interested in creating a version of the film and negotiated with the copyright owner in the mid-40s, but they could not make a deal. Filmed from the screen, the film became the series THE MASKED MARVEL, one of the best in the country. Perhaps it was just as good because this studio had a tendency to mess with materials adapted from comic books, pulp magazines, radio and comics. <br /> <br /> As for 1987, made for a television film, It is clear that this was an unsuccessful pilot for the proposed television series. While the old, long-time comic reader, like me, may be a little harsh in criticizing adaptation, a viewer unfamiliar with the character may give some fresh insights, without any preconceived ideas about how this screen version should look like . <br /> <br /> Well, sitting and watching the story unfold when the characters interact in a certain criminal wave, the Little Lady (my wife, Mrs. Ryan) nailed her with one statement. "It cannot be determined whether it is serious or not!" It describes quite well both the SPIRIT and its creator, Mr. Will Eisner, a true creative genius in comics. <br /> <br /> The film is a sincere attempt to show Eisner’s world on screen. Danny Colt / Spirit Casting, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen were really pretty well made. Although in the modern setting it was still in the tradition of the "good old days" when it comes to costumes, you know, when men and women still wore hats! This brings up this last (and tortuous) moment, and this is what the director and director made a conscious effort and succeeded in giving the characters Eisner's will to look at the facial expressions and body language. We thank them for their efforts. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that not one episode followed! Oh, good in the modern world of movies, comic adaptations seem to be the hottest thing. Perhaps some major timer producer and director will be able to make a truly first-class SPIRIT performance for the Big Screen. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. 6/4/2008. To date, everyone who goes to “Cinema at the Multiplexes Shopping Center” has seen a poster advertising the new film “The Spirit” (with the subtitle “MY CITIES”); which should be released on Christmas 2008. Well, then we will see what we talked about. Just cross your fingers! CONTINUED CONTINUES ............. <br /> <br /> UPDATE II: We saw the new film, screenwriter and director Frank Miller, showing the film "The Spirit" a couple of days ago. Well, we got our wish; but this is a good thing or another case: “Be careful what you ask; because you can get it? ”Please read our article elsewhere in IMDb.com. THANK!
