This is not a criticism of the film, but a comment about how blind we are to our past. <br /> <br /> I recently watched The Winter Soldier, and the Basis of the Truth was like watching a remake or a sequel â€” except that it was about Iraq, not about Vietnam. Like the Winter Soldier because of its one-sided message, both films illustrate how happily we rush into conflicts based on false pretexts and let our young and courageous (and often naive) bear the brunt of this greedy military speculation. Both films effectively show that the mentality imposed on the young and ready to make them effective killing machines, but the training is completely at odds with the diplomacy and police skills needed to effectively conquer the hearts and minds of the people they supposedly fight for. This is ultimately what lost the war in Vietnam, and probably loses the war in Iraq. <br /> <br /> My only negative comment is that the film is so one-sided that you can easily pass it off as leftist propaganda. Notice, not by me, but by those who seek to discredit the film and the message. A more balanced point of view will speak to a larger audience.
