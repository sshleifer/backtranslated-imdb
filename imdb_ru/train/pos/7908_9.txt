I recently found a copy for $ 5 in a video store and eagerly bought it. Although the music and (obviously) the graphics do not meet the standards of my favorite TV series Beyond the Mind, I still admire one segment: <br /> <br /> Stanley and Stella in the movie Break the Ice. The music is gorgeous, and the emotions are real. Unfortunately, the clip on the Odyssey website has neither history nor music.
