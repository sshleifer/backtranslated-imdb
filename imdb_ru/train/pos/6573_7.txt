The film is very similar to the play from the very beginning - I think it will be better than the film, because the scenery and the staging make the film version too artificial. But, nevertheless, it is done quite well, and the story and especially the dialogue are interesting. They took the dialogue almost exactly as in a real game. Perhaps this is a good introduction to Shaw's plays. <br /> <br /> The main character, Raina, has cloudiness and talent for drama, and actress Helena Bonham Carter does a good job here. Her fianc√©, Serge, is a little caricature when he really has to be an incredibly beautiful and bright character. Her parents are quite interesting.
