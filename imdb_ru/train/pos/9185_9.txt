DOUBLE IMPACT was a huge surprise. It contains an outstanding game (especially from the undervalued Callan), excellent cinematography and an irresistible storyline. In other words, this is one of the best horror attempts that appeared in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Callan plays a fashion photographer who wants to kill his models when he reunites with his psychologically changeable brother. (who lacks arms and legs). When the models Callan dreams of killing actually end up dead, the photographer begins to doubt his sanity ... but there is more to the picture than he sees. <br /> <br /> This film never received the praise it deserves. Most critics and movie lovers mix it with a horde of slasher films released at the same time, but it stands high above the majority of this pitiful party. He is smart and unique, which cannot be said about most films of this genre, but he is also passionately thought out and executed. DOUBLE IMPACT - a gem of its kind.
