Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are a great couple, demonstrating this with their unique charisma shown in this film. <br /> <br /> This is a typical "alternative" or indie film with a plot that shows a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important. <br /> <br /> Pecker is an ordinary boy with an old camera, and his main hobby is to photograph the exotic inhabitants of the small town in which he lives. Suddenly, an alternate artist pays attention to his work and to hire him to exhibit his work at some important festivals, etc. <br /> <br /> But Pecker’s life is changing dramatically, as now luck and fame seem to enrage people cities that are Pecker’s mastermind. Even his sexy girlfriend is angry, because now he does not pay her "adequate" attention. <br /> <br /> Well, this is an indie film with a poignancy, but not for everyone. To some, this may seem boring or pretentious, but I still think that they are worth the watch only because they offer something “different” than typical Hollywood standards. <br /> <br /> To describe in a few words: this is the typical Christina Film Ricci and John Waters. That's all. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that the lines of "Full of Grace" are really annoying. Geez.
