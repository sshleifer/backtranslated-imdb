This film is one of the few high-quality films of 2000 and, of course, one of my best. The script is based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov, and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film's photography is gorgeous, like Turturro and Watson. Turturro definitely shows its best results to date, proving that it costs a lot more than we thought. Watson also performs brilliantly. <br /> <br /> The story of the phenomenal chess player (Turturro), who is also extremely eccentric in his daily life. The film is presented in non-linear time, with a lot of memories of Luzhin's childhood. Through them the complex character of Luzhin is described. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say except to offer this film to anyone.
