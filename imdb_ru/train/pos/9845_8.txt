I'm not going to lie, this is a great movie. I saw it about 4 months ago in my local theater. I saw it the second time, and I was a little bored in the slow scenes. Sid (the sloth) is not so flattering, but Diego (I think the mountain lion) is really good at the film. The animation is outstanding, and the story has a touching ending. It is worth taking children under 10 with you, but teenagers will probably be a bit bored. In addition, the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting. As I said, this is a pretty good movie, but I would rate “Toy Story 2” or “Shrek” higher. 8/10
