I entered this film after I read that it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift that society turned into a monster. Suffice it to say that I was expecting something completely different from what I received. But it was a happy surprise. My friend and I both thought that the film was very romantic (the fact that the male leadership looked good, surely helped), and there was enough development of the plot, action and even humor (the fact that he shoots them before the 3rd part of the film bearing the name of each other, made fun of the whole cinema) to entertain you and put into the story. In short: not what I expected, but a very good surprise. I will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.
