"A Bug's Life" is like a favorite candy bar - it's full of great little pieces that make up something really tasty. <br /> <br /> History could not be better; he is intelligent, has a “heart” (emotions), and each character has a good “arc” (growth or change). For comparison, the only characters in Toy Story that have an arc are Buzz, who learns to love a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his outrage at Buzz. A Bug's Life has tons of laughter and sweet moments. All the actors are great at voice acting, and the animation, both in motion and in detail, is great. <br /> <br /> This serious movie lover doesn’t fly for about 10 seconds, but this film definitely deserves the “10” I gave.
