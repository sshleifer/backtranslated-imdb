This film received terrible reviews, but because it was unusual and because critics usually did not “get” unusual films, I decided to try. Unfortunately, in this case they were pretty much right. <br /> <br /> The film just has an awkward feeling that surprises the most. Such a feeling is impossible to describe, but it is not very good. To confuse you even more, the script is a boring, pointless thing that is only a little interesting. <br /> <br /> Incredibly talented Thurman just swims through this mess, creating a barely noticeable effect. Hurt and Bracco are trying in vain to add something to the film with enthusiastic performance, but there is nothing in the script. Perhaps they would not be so embarrassed if they simply decided to drift and be done with it, like Thurman. <br /> <br /> However, “dear” film critics did not mention one thing: the film is actually quite funny. Whether it's moments of precise satire or some monstrously strange moments, for example, when the cowgirls in question are chasing the Torn Ranch with the smell of their unwashed ... hmm ... front ass. <br /> <br /> Jokes reigned everywhere, although I would not recommend this film, there is entertainment here, and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is worth something else.
