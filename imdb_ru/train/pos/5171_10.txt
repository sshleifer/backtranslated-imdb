If I could come back, even when I became an adult, and relive the days spent by my summer in the camp ... I would be there so quickly. The camps I went to were not so good. They were in Texas, where mosquitoes really took people away, but we had horses and fishing. The cinematography was amazing, the characters are funny and believable, especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. The character of Sam Raimi and his exploits were priceless. So, who ever thought that this film was lame ... I'm sorry, because they can't stop their disbelief long enough to imagine life in the camp as an adult, or they never walked like children. The thing is that these people had the opportunity to regress and become minors again, which they did at every opportunity. I wish I could. It was fun, intelligent, beautifully written, brilliantly played out, and artistry takes me back, so I want to watch it again and again, even against the backdrop of the landscape. Varieties like "Dances with Wolves" and "LadyHawk" ... are good films, but the desert is becoming a character as much as actors. Rent it, look, buy it and look again and again and again ... never gets old. ; 0)
