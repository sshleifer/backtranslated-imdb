What is so forbidden in love ?! People seem to have serious problems with transgenic ones. <br /> <br /> The name of this film did not catch my attention. It was a grainy shot about 4 minutes after the movie that made me stop watching channels. I could not believe how damn amazing this movie is. He touches so many levels of human emotions that he did not touch me more than once. This is definitely one of the best independent films I've ever seen. I did not see these characters as sex, just as a person. I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Especially independent films. Praise to all fearless directors!
