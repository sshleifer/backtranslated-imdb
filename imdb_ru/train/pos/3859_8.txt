De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) by Paul Verhoeven is one of the most exciting thrillers I've ever seen. It really was a pleasant surprise. The story concerns the two-floored writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he lures into a relationship with the excellent hairdresser Christine (Ren√©e Soutendijk), but there may be something else in Gerard's perverted mind. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bon create a beautiful and dense atmosphere, full of surrealistic and disgusting sexual images, it really drags you into the story, you do not want to look, but you can not turn away. This is by far the best Verhoeven film (possibly the second after Robocop). True "The Fourth Man" is not for everyone, some sex scenes are pretty useless (just ignore them, but believe me, if you watch for at least ten minutes, you will be hooked. This is one of those films that you need to know how it ends, the true one who unites him in the Hitchcock tradition is irresistible, contradictory and exciting. I even like the metaphor of the spider. <br /> <br /> 8/10
