I just watched Holly along with another film about human trafficking and the sexual exploitation of children called “Cinema trade at an international film festival”. I have to say that Holly blew Trade out of the water. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and amazing film on different levels. From a purely artistic and cinematic point of view, this is amazing. Sound mixing, camera angles, directing and acting are all on top. <br /> <br /> In addition, the way it handles an item is tasteful and does not exploit. It presents the problem of the sexual exploitation of children in an educational and accurate manner. The filmmakers paid great attention to detail, truly capturing the nuances of the epidemic of child sexual exploitation and trafficking. Too often, when it comes to this kind of subject, it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape and violence. Holly can achieve all of this without falling into this typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing Holly at two separate film festivals, once in the USA and once in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I have never seen the audience so moved. Just listening to conversations after checking, people ask what they can do personally to combat the sexual exploitation of children. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to everyone, both for cinematic value and for the topic.
