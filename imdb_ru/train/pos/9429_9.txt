This film is a classic in every sense of the word. This is very interesting and also very alarming. The acting in this film is well done. The story itself is believable, tense and well thought out. Character development is also done well; viewers can clearly see how each of the characters passes the emotional test in this film. The villains in this film are very threatening, from the first moment when the audience sees them, they can say that they are plotting something. This film shows how a person who is in civilization and finds himself in the middle of a forest, in a situation of life or death, can gradually become almost as wild and wild as the animals that inhabit it. Not everyone will like this movie, there is a lot of disturbing content that can make some viewers uncomfortable. It is definitely worth seeing. This film is a masterpiece.
