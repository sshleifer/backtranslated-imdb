<br /> <br /> I guess this is not the best movie I've ever done, but I still voted for him for 10 stars. Mostly because of my feelings at the end. I and all the people around me were just touched. This is something that you do not often feel. We all become a little cynical and fed up with sentimentality, lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films. The story of the film tells about Jane, a young woman in the final stages of MND, and about the friendship that grows between her and Richard, a man on the verge of collapse. It could be so simple and boring, but it is so humorous, humane and devoid of sentimentality that completely captivated you, and, in spite of everything, this is a good movie. <br /> <br /> Brana and Bonham-Carter played great, especially the latter, which is always believable and strong in its role. Chemistry between the two also raises the film. <br /> <br /> The name comes from the masterpiece of Richards, a plane made of trash and his old paintings. The flight here is a symbol for Richards and Jaynes living in full, so that one can continue and the other can face the end. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and funny movie that I would recommend to everyone. do not let the object repel you.
