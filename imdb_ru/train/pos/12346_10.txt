This is a very good and poetic story. Beautiful landscape. Great musical score. I was twice in Japan last year, and the film gave me that typical Japanese feeling. The camera movement is superb, just like the actors. It goes deep into your senses without becoming melodramatic. The Japanese are very sensitive and kind, and all this is very well shown on the screen. The director plays beautifully with light colors and shows the audience that you can also let them enjoy the film with fine and fine details. After you have watched this movie, you will want to see more from the same director. This is a really good movie, and I can only recommend it to everyone.
