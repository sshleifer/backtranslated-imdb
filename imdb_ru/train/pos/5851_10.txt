* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is just the second pay-per-view I received for 10, the first of which is the 1991 Royal Rumble. It was full of exciting matches that were not unforgettable, just a one-time fun. And that's why I like it. <br /> <br /> The only negative is the starting match between Razor and DiBiase, as well as Ludwig Borg and Marty Jannetti. These were normal matches, but DiBiaz deserved better in his last payment for the match. Nowadays, a similar match would have had a throw-in and a greater climax for the first big push of the Razor. And Jannetti, who just spoke at the intercontinental race, could have played better with the Borg. But I don't think anyone really cared. They just needed Borga to put pressure on pay-per-view TV. <br /> <br /> The IRS and The Kid were great, like Michaels and Perfect. I wish Perf would win, but Michaels doesn't lie to anyone. Notice how immediately after that he left WWF so that he would not have to work with the Razor. Bret Hart had two big fights with Doink (note that everyone has the best match against the assassin), and then with Lawler. Their rivalry was a classic; this is why Feud of the year of this year was an easy thing. How often do you see how two legends win “Feud of the Year” at such a late age? <br /> <br /> The Steiners-Heavenly Bounds match was one of the best this year. Who knew that bodies could withstand one of the best teams? <br /> <br /> Many people say that the Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez match was a waste of time. But I loved it. Remember, what made the old WWF (as in, before WWE) great was a mix of athleticism and a weird show. Is there a soul that did not like Akim? <br /> <br /> The main event was not bad, although it did not closely correspond to the status of the year. They dressed Lex Luger well, but made a wise choice for Yokozun to hold the belt. He became the first heel since the days of the Superstar Graham, who held the belt for more than two months. These days heels are always champions. But from the beginning of WWWF to the WWF of the 90s, if you blinked, you missed the reign of the title. <br /> <br /> As a fan of old school, this and SummerSlam '88 are my favorites.
