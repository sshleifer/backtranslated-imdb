Like the gentle giants that make up the second half of the title of this film, the last production of Michael Oblovitsa has a grace, but it is also slow and cumbersome. The latest release of the producer Moskitoman-3D had the same problem. Itâ€™s hard to imagine a boring movie about sharks, but somehow they succeeded. The only draw for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy - is passable animatronics, which is always a pleasure when dealing with wonderful worlds under the surface of the ocean. But even that was only passable. Low concentration in some scenes made the production seem amateur. With dolphins and whales technology is almost in vain. Cloud scenes and too many close-ups of giant movie objects do nothing to take advantage of the incredible 3D capabilities of IMAX. Too few scenes of any depth or variety. Close-ups of these amazing creatures just look flat, and there is often only one creature in the camera area, so there is no depth contrast. Michael Oblovice is trying to follow in the footsteps of his father, but when you have Shark Week by cable, his introspective and boring attitude to his subjects causes constant disappointment.
