I watched this movie by a happy accident, simply because I was passing the stage when I had a new admiration for Bill Pullman, and I wanted to watch all of his recent films, and, thank God, I did it! This film has been stuck with me since then and remains one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls who go on a dramatic journey to a foreign country, where they learn the true meaning of freedom. <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlene just tried to spend their holidays together before entering college, but their journey ended in a much more complicated story. The struggle that they go through, being arrested in Thailand and becoming a prisoner, is very exciting and tense. The game is amazing, the images are extraordinary, the soundtrack is fantastic and very suitable for the film and the transmitted message, certainly powerful. I can't even find the right words to describe how this film makes me feel every time I watch it. I know that some people rated the film not as high as I, but I swear, this one, you have to see !!! I promise it will be with you!
