This film begins with a family that moved in different directions, and their teenage daughter Martha Makisak (Olivia Dunn) was very much in love with Joe MacLeod (Zack). The mother plays Mitzi Capture (Jill Dunn), who suddenly enters when her daughter and Zach look and then all kinds of problems appear. Jill Dunn has a husband who often travels or often out of the house. There are also big problems that arise when the family decides to go camping, which their daughter Olivia doesnâ€™t like and simply cannot accommodate for sleeping in the fresh air and demands that there are no insects in the tent. In many ways, Olivia plays a prominent role in the role of a teenager, and Nick Mancuso (Richard Grant) plays an excellent supporting role as the owner of the hotel. This film will make you wonder how it will end, and you will enjoy the film, filled with horror and horror. enjoy
