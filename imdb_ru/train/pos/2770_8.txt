Observing David and Bathsheba is a much better way to get a Bible lesson to be held in a Sunday school. Despite the script, which is sometimes unintentionally funny, the film is very interesting. The studio system had its drawbacks, but it did not spare the money when generous production was required. Peck portrays King David as a lustful but tormented poet who commits murder to bed Sexual Bathsheba Susan Hayward Raymond Massey as the prophet Nathan performs his usual saturnine and ferocious performance. Look for the silent star Francis X. Bushman as King Saul and young Gwen Verdon as a dancer. Hooray for the Old Testament and Hollywood.
