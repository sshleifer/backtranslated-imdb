The name intrigued me, so during a small attack of insomnia (fueled by my curiosity ...) I did not sleep and watched it. Then I checked my TV listings and looked again! When I saw this film, one very clear realization occurred to me - despite the politics, traditions, culture, etc., Teens are almost the same all over the world. Characters of children from Belgrade could be transferred, say, somewhere in the American Midwest at the same time period, if language differences are not taken into account, which cannot be distinguished from any of the local teenagers of that era. They certainly showed the same growing pains and concerns, with the exception of politics: music, sex, movie idols, music, drunkenness, sports, music ... Actually, the same things that took up my time in the 1970s years in southern california. <br /> <br /> It was a bitter-sweet story, but the joy of youth made her very pleasant. Characters, especially young actors, were quite plausible. I will not say that it was the Yugoslav "American Graffiti", but I will say that it fits well with other films of the 50s.
