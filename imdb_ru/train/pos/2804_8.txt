The name of this movie almost made me watch it. Not being a fan of Manchester United, the mere mention of Beckham was a bit out of place, but I left my prejudices behind and glad I did. <br /> <br /> I didnâ€™t expect much from the movie But I was pleasantly surprised. The film sped along with me, never looking at my watch, and I enjoyed every second of the movie. If you like East - this is East, then you will like this movie. So, the storyline is not something new, and the classic storylines are contained in the film, but all this is done very funny and with a breath of fresh air. The film moves very quickly and entertains the audience. Random funny moments - a good laugh, not a bad attempt at humor, and, best of all, a good British comedy.
