I accidentally caught this movie on a cable channel, and I had to rent it to see it in full, and I'm glad I did. I was immediately attracted to the storyline, and I took care of the girls involved. Naive high school graduates, best friends from childhood, go on a school trip and are accepted by a cheater named Nick who gives them serious trouble. They are used as sacrificial mules in the heroin smuggling ring. Taken into custody, girls learn to cope with incarceration, trying to find a way out of their problems. All that they are trying to help themselves fails when the Thai criminal justice system shows flaws and the girls find themselves in more problems and lose the trust of their American lawyer, "Yanki Hank." Hank refuses to try to protect them after he feels betrayed by Alice (Claire Dane). However, Hank's Thai wife smells like a rat in this case and conducts further investigation work and discovers that the girls really are the victims. The end of the film, when Alice does a selfless act to save Darlene (Beckinsale), made me cry. I really liked this movie and I would recommend it.
