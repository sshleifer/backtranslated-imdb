Neil Simon had a penchant for dialogue, and nowhere was it as obvious as the lines he gives to WALTER MATAU and JACK LEMMON as the opposite types in THE ODD COUPLE — a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the believability of two such inconsistent friends sharing an apartment. <br /> <br /> Lemmon is a neat Felix Ungar, prone to suicide after a divorce from his wife and reluctant to agree to live in the same apartment with Oscar Madison (Mattau) with somewhat disastrous consequences. It seems that everything that Felix says and does, pushes Oscar up the wall, and none of them can stand against the other, and Oscar is the dirtiest man you can imagine, and Felix is ​​the complete opposite. <br /> <br /> The funniest scene for me was when the giggling Dove sisters in the apartment upstairs visited them at dinner. The priceless interaction between Lemmon, Mattau, Carol Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to put you in a quandary. Talented pigeon sisters are girls who are voiced by the Hubble Sisters (a couple of geese) in Disney ARISTOCATS, and here their comic time is on top of Lemmon’s desperate sad story to make the film fun - where it remains most of the time. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Neil Simon and enjoyed other kinds of screen processing of his work, then this is not to be missed. Mattau and Lemmon played well (although they thought they would switch roles before the shooting began), and, of course, it is easy to understand why it later became a popular TV show. <br /> <br /> Summing up: Top Simon Comedy, which is not to be missed.
