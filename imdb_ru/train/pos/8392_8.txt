This film shows clever cinematic techniques in which, instead of capturing the attention of the camera with landscapes, we are talking about small details of how someone looks like a woman can wear a cocktail hat and wrapped in a sheet. As a husband, he can wear a hat, socks, shoes and underwear, and both seem completely relaxed and comfortable. As far as provocative woman is, is another feature of this picture, which the director decides to tell us that she is sexually free and seeks to get the pleasure that she is looking for, without flirting directly or with some particular sensitivity to what a man can feel . The relationship between wife and husband is unique. This is open, in which she does not hold back anything, does not feel much shame for the way she behaved, and wants to share these facts with him, because her main focus is always on the fact of their marriage. Nothing and no one can stand between the two. Only the odds of fate can intervene - his imprisonment during the war and what follows after his return in the end. A very intriguing film that completely absorbs.
