I recently started watching this show, and I must say that it really made me laugh. You must appreciate the unreal aspects of this, along with everything else. Some other people said that this show should have more realistic reactions of the dead, by the way. If you're going to come to terms with the fact that Ned can bring the dead back to life, you have to accept the other completely crazy parts of the show. I could not help but smile after every episode that I watched. I really think it's great that there is a show that can take a very strange topic and is really great to watch. I love the story very much, I think it adds a little surprise to the whole show. You cannot always compare the writer's old shows with his new ones, you must take everything as his own essence. Definitely give him a chance, and just enjoy the funny details as they are.
