This is a free adaptation of the novels by Clarence Malford; Willaim Boyd fans will probably feel a little at sea here (and the reviews here so far reflect this). But I first learned about Hopalong from novels and never cared about Boyd films as soon as I found them. <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola made a wise choice - he didn’t make a nostalgic "western"; instead, he approached the story of Cassidy as a fragment of what we used to call "Americana"; or what old critics once called home-spun. As the movie reversed, I was more and more reminded of the wonderful version of Mark Twain's The Distinctive Feature with the narration of James Garner. <br /> <br /> Both of these films remind us of this, although films about the “old west” should probably always be a myth for Americans, they don’t have to be “westerns”; in this place, they may well be just films about what it means to be American at that time. <br /> <br /> I never feel shocked watching this movie; there is no effort to push Boyd-Cassidy’s legacy into our throats, no irony, no camp. Consequently, I feel that these characters walked — or rode — on some real West America, which I, too, could have passed a hundred years ago. <br /> <br /> Considering this, the simplicity of the film - it resolutely avoids everything that we began to call “style” - everything is in its favor; and the simple playing of performers fits well with this; Damn it, it really looks like a story about a campfire on a cattle drive - no visual outfits, just fads and good mood - and sudden violence - what we expect from a good story about adventure yarn. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film, and if the viewer refuses his usual expectations, he or she will find considerable pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I would give this film 9 stars, but I will give it ten points just because most of the reviewers here are completely overlooked; and I urge them to put aside their memories of Boyd and give this film another chance. <br /> <br /> Note 1: The reviewer complained that Hopalong shoots people who kill people in this film, and does not shoot pistols from their hands (ala Boyd Cassidy); first, Cassidy shoots people in novels; secondly, if Cassidy were a real cowboy, he would have shot people - the problem with shooting from the hands of people is that they can always get another weapon - which is part of the subtext of this film. <br /> <br /> Note 2: I admit that I envy the Coppola family that among them is the director of The Godfather, who can provide them with all the opportunities to make films that I cannot; but a good movie is a good movie; and it's a good movie. If it's someone called Coppola, well, that's the way it is. America is a land of opportunity (or was until Bush took office) —that's what great American novels are.
