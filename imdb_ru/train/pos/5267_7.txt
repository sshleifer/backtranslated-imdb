Apparently, Rudzhero Deodato realized early that his story would not work if he approached her too seriously, so he decided to deal with her. The result is a film that can be seen as a ridiculous epic with a sword and witchcraft or as a very entertaining comedy! And I think I'll go the second way. The short bloody moments are well made, the Pauli brothers openly mock the material (they even bark at one another in one scene!), And there is also a charming, energetic, good-natured presentation of Eva La Rue in the role of a girl who is tagged with the "boys". In addition, where else can you see the insides of a dragon lit like a disco? (***)
