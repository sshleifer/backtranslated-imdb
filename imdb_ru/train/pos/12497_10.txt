If you haven’t seen this Mary-Kate and Ashley film, all I can say is: “What are you waiting for!?” It is fun, romantic, exciting and simply exciting! Of course; As always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are the main decorations! Any true fan would like this differently? Of course not! Anyway; This is a great movie in every sense of the word, so if you have not seen it yet, you just need it now! I mean now too! So what are you waiting for? I promise you will not be disappointed!
