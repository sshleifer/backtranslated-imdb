My watch came too late, but I am glad that I watched both this and the continuation together ... which makes me praise the creators of this film for the fact that they relate so purely and thoroughly to the idea of ​​romanticism ... and very slightly share this from the idea of ​​relationships! Since much has already been written about the film, it would be appropriate to single out several parts of the film that I personally liked. <br /> <br /> I think that it was at this moment that Jesse and Celine make fake phone calls to their respective friends were a very insightful way to tell each other what they meant to each other in a journey that did not last even 24 hours ... the curiosity of two people, who both believed that the other had an unmistakable effect on the other, was very cleverly coped ... <br /> <br /> In the foreground of the plot, making a romantic story in pure conversation is not easy. <br /> <br /> I believe in romantic jokes Such a fragrance, the characters are not clearly developed, even in the minds of the writer and director. What the actors show is what happens to them ... right or wrong, even the idea-bearers would be hard to justify ... to become a hero, the life that an actor gives must go beyond the instructions and the story ... here both actors do just the right job! Kudos .. !!! and before sunset another feather that makes it even more beautiful!
