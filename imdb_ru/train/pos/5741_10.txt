One of my favorite films that I saw in Seattle previews. Tom Hulse was amazing, without words could convey his feelings / thoughts. I actually sent donations to Mike Ferrell to help spread the film. It's good. The system says that I need more lines, but I don’t want to distribute plot things. I was in the audience in Seattle with Hulse and director, writer and Mike Ferrell. They talked about an hour after words. Not very dry eye in the house. Why Hollywood continues to be stupid, I do not know. (actually, I know it’s our fault, look what we see) Well, you get what you pay for guys. Get it and see it with someone special. This is a gem.
