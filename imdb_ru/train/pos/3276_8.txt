49. PAPERHAUS (thriller / horror, 1988) The patient in bed with fever 11-year-old Anna (Charlotte Burke) has only her drawings to make a company. Her health is gradually deteriorating as a number of mysterious “black outs” embrace her. In each of these episodes, she dreams of a house in a deserted field where only an incapacitated boy named Mark (Elliot Spiers) lives. When a dark, unknown danger threatens her idyllic “paper house”, Mark’s life is threatened. Her life is also in danger, as these dreams reflect her state of health. <br /> <br /> Criticism: the first debut work of the British director Bernard Rose. Taken from the fable (“Dreams of Marianna”) by Catherine Storr, she leaves behind many other “original” fantasy works. Whenever a story deals with dreams and nightmares, it is difficult to give it a mixture of fable and reality to make it work in the form of a film. Director Rose successfully captures the aspect of the children's fantasy world, along with the darkness that seeks to usurp them. <br /> <br /> Phillip Glass scored with enthusiasm, Rose knows how to competently use music with the skillfully calculated "jump out of his seat." moments. Most thrillers are very careless in this extremely important aspect - to scare the public, not knowing what the next scene will bring. I also like the way he captures the unknown and never lets go of it or fluctuates in the next sequence of events. In addition, his ability to place objects in the frame (as in his P.O.V.shots) gives the cinema an additional dimension, which otherwise would seem to be lacking. Only in Europe will you find such sinister-looking places like those represented here: a lonely house, fields, coastal cities, a watchtower, etc. <br /> <br /> Rose would follow this movie with “Candyman” (1992), the real gem of the horror of the “thinking man” and a conscientious cult of horrors.
