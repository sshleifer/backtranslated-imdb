Two snipers travel deep into the jungle in search of their goals; Slimy South American drug lord and eminent general. <br /> <br /> Moderately successful in creating a thoughtful atmosphere, the Sniper, for many reasons, is a very serious thriller, wasting time, setting his characters, their position and climax. in some good action sequences. The director Llosa does not always manage to maintain a gloomy mood and could somewhat complicate the story; some detours here do not add up to a lot. But this film is much better than his parody of Stallone and The Stone "The Specialist." <br /> <br /> Billy Zane, usually incredibly tedious, surprisingly succeeds, as the inexperienced Sniper teamed up with veteran Berenger. As for Berenger, this film turned out to be his last good budget venture in Hollywood. He can perform such roles in a dream, and he is very persuasive, repeating the role twice more in the direct sequel of the DVD.
