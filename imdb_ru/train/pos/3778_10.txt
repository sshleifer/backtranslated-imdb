The first film had little ambition, so nothing stuck on the screen. It was a bad version of “Back to the Future” with zero charm. Assuming that Bill and Ted are crazy, the joke can only reach the audience until it breaks. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise. This is your only warning about the spoiler ... <br /> <br /> By today's standards it is more fun. This was excluded after graduation, sadly, considering that more talents are involved than for the first time. We have a Face / Off photographer, Fugitive editor, producer-designer of Burton’s early work and sound director Matrix. <br /> <br /> Script writers catch up on the first exit with something deep. Since the fans and the public avoided this, the director probably decided that the style was too extreme. It is not, it corresponds to the material. Like “Death becomes hers” and “Trick-22”, it dares to be clever, but we like our films “simply”, so we do not buy them. Probably because it dared to be different, so it took 12 manufacturers to implement it. What is so good? <br /> <br /> - Good dedication to Keanu; from the head to the Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> - Joss hates his creations as much as he hates their colleagues, he hates himself. Evil B & T and “good robots” have the same vocabulary as their originals: fewer copies and language depreciation. <br /> <br /> - The motive of "duality." Nowhere else is this visible, as in photography styles, many high and low angles. They even use Roy Broxeith from Total Recall to emphasize the point. <br /> <br /> - The motive of "choice." I don’t know where it started in the genre (maybe Ghostbusters), but it’s used pretty well here. It even boils down to 7 games against death - Battleship and Club. <br /> <br /> - Self-referencing film, even present in the game against Death (Clue). It's smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. Notice the cover of the Premier magazine at the end: "Bill and Ted: The Movie." It is also ironic that Death and Nomolos were villains in the Die Hard and Lethal Weapon sequels. <br /> <br /> I still have some nits, but nothing compared to the original. Music and cinema are different environments, so it does not make sense why many scenarios revolve around the first - especially in the teen market. Carlin is an excellent comedian, but in these films he is wasted. Moreover, despite all these bold attempts to show that they cannot even kill a cat, even if they cannot kill a cat? <br /> <br /> So, despite the fact that it looks like the production of Nickelodeon, it is incredibly interesting. From this movie we got Beavis and Butthead. "We are in heaven, and we have just robbed three people." <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = = Middle Class Material
