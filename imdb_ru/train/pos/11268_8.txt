Former love interest Jane Porter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) and his friend Martin (Paul Kavana) come to a hidden escarpment of the Tarzan jungle in search of an ivory gold mine, which is the “Elephant's Cemetery”, first seen in TARZAN, HUMAN BEING ... we will soon discover that both men have hidden intentions ... namely, Jane. Will Tarzan stand it? Unlikely (in fact, Tarzan will not even tolerate any anxiety caused by the Elephant Cemetery), and knowing that Martin is trying to remove Tarzan from the picture, only later does he find himself in the world of trouble, later he and his group (including Jane, who leaves with them after she believes that Tarzan is dead), captured by a tribe intending to feed them with lions. Will Tarzan be able to get to them on time? <br /> <br /> This film is an adventure filled with many scenes featuring Tarzan and other wild animals, face down, and a climax that captures the interest of the viewer and does not give rest. The cruelty shown in relation to animals and the image of local residents may disturb some today, but everyone should remember that this is mainly fantasy adventure entertainment and should not be taken so seriously.
