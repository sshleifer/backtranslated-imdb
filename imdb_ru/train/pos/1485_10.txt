There are characters in this film who play their roles so adorably, I love the final, when no one knows what they are going to do with their lives, but itâ€™s great when you see and understand that the priest is right, it's just a game for two, so what are other people doing there? The film embraces you in a new life, in experiences, so that you can dream with another person and achieve these dreams. Also shows you life itself, as it is. But gives you the opportunity to choose what you want and what you really need. Hope this comment works for you. This movie worked well for me. I bought the movie by the way;) Take care of yourself.
