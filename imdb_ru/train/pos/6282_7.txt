Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retailer hijacker who is forced to retire when he is forced to save the life of his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) when he fucks up at work, doing the work of his brothers stealing 50 cars in one night. He has to put together his old team, which he can trust, to help him take it down and get his brother out of the Dutch. But the cops are at him, so can he take it off? It was one of the best candidates of the film to redo, since the original was far from the classics. And if you do not expect much and turn off the mental part of your brain so that you can ignore the hole in the plot and just take the film for what it is. You will enjoy the trip. Look at his double count with “The Fast and the Furious” to spend a night of high-speed jokes, just don’t take out the car right after the turn. <br /> <br /> My rating: B - <br /> <br /> More information on the DVD: 7-minute interview with Jerry Bruckheimer; Bruckheimer Bio / Filmography; Overload actions: highlight coil; Big Chase; Function "0 to 60"; "Wild Ride" Featurette; Stars in motion; Music video The Painted On The Heart; Theatrical trailer and trailers for the Shanghai Noon, Missions to Mars and Ugly Coyote
