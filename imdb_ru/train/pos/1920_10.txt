Paul Hennessy and his wife Kate must deal with their two teenage daughters and a strange son ... But after John Ritter's untimely death, the show became more about how to cope with the loss of a loved one ... <br /> <I found this is a show that went through the channels one afternoon, and I have to say that I laughed myself until my ribs got sick, just a range of characters; witty lines and the situation in which Paul will deal mainly with his daughters ... Since then I caught the rest of the show when I was free, and I have to say that the writing was very good .. But then I read about The death of John Ritter ... Soon after that, I watched "Farewell" Part 2 and I must say that I was almost in tears, watching the characters' emotions, losing my beloved ... As Rory hits the wall in anger and frustration. ... How Kate deals with sleeping in her bed alone ... Briquette and Kerry are talking about what they had to do. <br /> <br /> But the series continues, bringing with it Jim Egan and CJ Barnes, who gives a strong laugh, as Kate's father tries to protect his family and makes "talk about problems with people" Rory ... But a real gem “CJ ... which is absolutely fun, like a wild cousin.” <br /> This will always be John Ritter's masterpiece.
