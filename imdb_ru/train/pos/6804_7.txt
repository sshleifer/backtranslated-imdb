Do not let my constructive criticism prevent you from buying and watching this classic Romy Schneider. This film was shot with a smaller budget, probably against the will of Ernest Marishka, so he had to do something for granted. For example, England is depicted bordering Germany. on the buggy ride alone. They arrived too fast. Probably nothing can be done about this, but the castle they rented for the film was Austrian. When she is told that she is a queen, she goes to the royal room, where members of the court bow to her, where British citizens outside the castle support their new queen? Why doesn't she show herself on the balcony to greet her subjects? Low budget! Where, then, did the audience realize this imperfection? I wonder what the critics felt? During the inn, she meets Prince Albert, but the ISBN is not thrilled with it. During a meeting in a tavern, you will hear music from famous old American civil war songs, such as My Old Kentucky Home and Old Black Joe. What kind? songs of the civil war of the 1830s? Is Romi Schneider portrayed as Scarlet? Where is mom? Is Magna Schnyder playing her too? Adrian Hoven Rett or Ashley? What was in Marishka's mind? Well, this will add to the camp. This is the unintentionally ridiculous story of Queen Victoria. This is the only reason you should pick it up or watch it. 03 11 09 Amendment Germany and England are bound
