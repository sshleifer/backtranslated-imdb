Scott Henderson, the engineer who hires Carol Richman as his assistant, considers it necessary to call her "Kansas" whenever he speaks to her. This shows us that Carol, who was effectively played by Ella Raines, should be a baby in the woods, if we talk about Manhattan in the 40s. Only a woman from another city followed a shady bartender into a lone metro. Even then, only a naive girl could undertake such an adventure. <br /> <br /> Robert Siodmak did a fine job with the film noir. He shows a talent for instilling a lot of rough sex in history, which was surprising for those days. How else could we justify how a drummer in a musical orchestra, where Scott takes a mysterious woman in an unusual hat, makes such a frank passage on a date lady? The drummer, played by Elisha Cook Jr. under high voltage, does not hide his desires from any of the ladies who sat in the first row of the hit musical where he plays. It was a real clear invitation, first to the “ghostly woman” of the story, Fay Helm; After that, drummer Cliff very frankly tells about Ella Raines, who goes to the theater under the guise of a mysterious lady, who was originally taken by her boss. <br /> <br /> This movie will hook any viewer from the start. There are things that are not explained in this, but it holds everyone’s interest everywhere. The killer is not revealed until the end. <br /> <br /> Ella Raines with an expressive eyes was an underestimated actress. She confronts much more experienced actors. Franchot Ton, a New York actor working in Hollywood, never found in this medium the fame he deserved. He is effective as the best friend of the accused. On the other hand, Alan Curtis looks like a man who, when he was framed, accepts his fate and is saved only by the stubbornness of a woman who secretly loved him. Thomas Gomez, as Inspector Burgess, is an asset to the film as a detective who has doubts that the police caught the man who committed the crime. <br /> <br /> This film does not disappoint.
