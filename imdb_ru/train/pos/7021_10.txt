I had the pleasure of attending the Pacific and Eddy show last weekend at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. This film caught my attention a while back when I came across an article about it in Jalouse magazine. At the time, it seemed interesting, but not too exciting. In any case, I saw it in the festival program and decided to check it out. All I can say is that I was speechless when the caption finale began. This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing films I've ever seen. Photography, artistic direction, acting, and especially directing were solid and flawless. Nothing is “spelled out” for you in this film and really makes you wonder. The fact that today the vast majority of films do exactly the opposite. The dialogue has been carefully thought out, and, although this scenario is not chatter from wall to wall, the words of the characters are very thoughtful and meaningful. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of those films that deserves to be re-watched, and the more you see it, the more things you notice. This is a very multi-layered and smart film. Not sure when or where he will play again, but definitely should see for movie lovers.
