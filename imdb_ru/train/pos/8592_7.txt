Good for evening entertainment - but the plot was unconvincing. The garrison romance with the first lady was unreal and impassive; the president had a cardboard cutout. And who were the real villains? Nothing has been sufficiently developed or explained. I still do not know why they wanted to kill the president or how the krol intervened. The villains were nameless and undeveloped, so you never felt involved in their conspiracy. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did their best to bring some reality into the story - the chase and the standoff were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were incredible in their roles, Basinger was completely lacking in character, and Longoria could not be a secret service agent. It could have been a very good film, but somehow he missed too many unanswered questions. Disappointing overall, despite some very good scenes. And did they use the “West Wing” for the scenes of the White House? - I was expecting a CJ or Charlie!
