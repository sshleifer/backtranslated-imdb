Watching “Impulse” is a very pleasant experience. Unpredictable movies are so rare when someone looks like Impulse, it's something that needs to be taken. The script is logical and extremely creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Mateson, Hume Cronin and Bill Paxton give believable ideas. It could play like a movie about zombies, but Impulse is far superior to any boring zombies, and originality shines through almost every scene. You get the feeling that something like this could really happen, even if the script is pure fiction. From the opening of the "capture" to the rental of loans, you will be fascinated. Very entertaining and definitely recommended. - MERK
