I am surprised that many viewers show more respect for the continuation of this brilliant film ... I have seen all the guinea pigs, and this one is definitely the best. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I saw "creation" I still have doubts when I watch these 35 minutes of pure torture: it is very powerful. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10, because this film did an excellent job: to become the best fake film in history ‚Äùdid.
