Otto Preminger, completing the noir cycle in the film “Twentieth Century Fox,” reunited his “Laura” for this harsh, tough detective drama. Dana Andrews again portrays a policeman, but this time he is cruel, cynical and his boss blames police brutality: “You don’t hate hoods, you liked to beat them!” Mark Dickson (Andrews) despises the criminals, because his own father was a crook. He does not want to be “Sandy Dixon's child,” so he became a policeman, but his methods are cruel and hateful. <br /> <br /> One night, while investigating a murder, he unknowingly beats a suspect, Ken Payne (Craig Stevens), so badly that he kills him. Shocked, Dixon does everything he can to hide it, intending to set up the hated gangster Scalis (Gary Merrill) for the crime. However, the blame lies on Paine’s father-in-law, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), whose daughter, the model of the department store Morgan Taylor (Tierney) is alienated from her husband, but continues to be drawn into his playing schemes. Payne hit his wife, infuriating her father, who appeared in his son-in-law's apartment, but only after Dickson left with the body. Without the best suspects, Jiggs is arrested and charged. <br /> <br /> Accused of wine, Mark falls in love with Morgan and offers money to a lawyer. In any case, he decides to take Scalis, but leaves a letter to be given to the department in the event of his death, confessing everything. In the end, he cannot live with the knowledge of what he has done, and he permits the letter to be read to his superior and Morgan. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan confesses his love for Mark and will wait for him. <br /> <br /> It was great to find this film on DVD after so many years of television suspense. Eddie Muller, the historian of cinema, gives comments and does a good job, but I find his statement that the audience would not catch the meaning of the two roles, since “Laura” was made six years earlier. In this regard, he is mistaken because they appeared in the Iron Curtain two years before WTSE, and the film had a box office success. <br /> <br /> Andrews and Tirnie were great together, and Ruth Donnelly. This is amazingly comical, as restaurant owner Martha is kindling the flames between the detective and the lady. <br /> <br /> Night cityscapes give the film a kind of threat. Gary Merrill is great as a low-level scaleiz who had a criminal past with Dixon's father (“Your father loved me,” he mocks Mark.) Karl Malden and the young Neville Brand are also awesome. And Tom Tully is just touching and funny, like the unfairly accused pop Morgan. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film with a fantastic cast.
