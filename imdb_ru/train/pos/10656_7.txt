What a wonderful film by Barbara Stanwick, which I accidentally saw on another night. "Danger" was fantastic. This was done in 1953 and probably for double bills, but it kept me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stenvik plays Helen, who with her husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and son (Lee Aaker) travels to an isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a holiday. The husband falls from the pier, and the only way to save him is if Barbara returns to the garage for some rope. <br /> <br /> There she encounters a psychotic killer (Ralph Meeker is one of my favorites), and then a cat-and-mouse game, when Barbara does her best to bring Meeker back with her to free her husband. <br /> <br /> The film was so tense and so unexpected - I did not expect such a great film. But I suppose I should have understood - is there something that Barbara Stenwick does, something less miraculous?
