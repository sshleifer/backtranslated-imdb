I look at this page, and it seems to me disapproving to listen to someone who wanders and rant about real classics. Of course, I agree that everyone has their own opinion, but this is mine: <br /> <br /> This movie should not miss any classic horror viewer, and many casual viewers around the world should see it. Of course, he lost some of his talent and greatness with age, especially in the modern world of CGI-effects, but this is not why you like it. <br /> <br /> You should like this, because this is a really scary movie, even by today's standards. This is generally obscenity, which will creep you just like the original audience, so do not throw the classics if you have not given it a chance. Watch this, but not with a critical attitude. Watch to have fun as it was originally intended.
