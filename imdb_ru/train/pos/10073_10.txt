One of the great things about the many excellent Chinese films that you can find, if you're lucky, in the video stores, is that they very accurately retell real, true stories. Farewell, my concubine, the Emperor and the Assassin, and this film are excellent examples. The filmmakers take a true story and work hard to create a film accurately, without endangering facts for the sake of dramatic or commercial convenience â€” the hallmark of many Hollywood films, especially Disney films. <br /> <br /> In this story we follow the subsequent years of the life of a famous street performer dubbed King Masks for his mastery in the Sichuan art of change. Although he lost his only son many years ago, he is looking for a male heir to engage in his rare and dying art in a society that prohibits women from having such work. Master Wang sells his son to a slaver. All is well, as he happily prepares to transfer his art. But the son eventually turns out to be a girl. From there, the story becomes very interesting, with good performance by Master Liang from the Sichuan Opera - a regional opera style associated with the Beijing Opera. Fans of parting. My concubine should look closely at the image of Master Liang of a man who plays the female role in Chinese opera. This may help them to understand that the performers of these female roles were probably not homosexual or neuter, but people who were so psychologically conditioned that they were completely unaware of their own sexuality.
