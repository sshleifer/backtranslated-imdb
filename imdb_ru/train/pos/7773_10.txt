Fabulous film! Recently rented a DVD and was amazed at this awesome job. Douglas Sirk was a filmmaking genius, and he receives performances from Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert Stack (nominated for Oscar) and Lauren Backall, who cannot describe the words. Paul Verhoeven brilliantly paid tribute to this film, forcing Dorothy Malone to play inspiring guru Sheron Stone in his Basic Instinct. What a great joke! <br /> <br /> In turn, the movie is fun, exciting, high-spirited, biting, dirty, irresistible and fascinating! This is definitely the granddaughter of every crazy big and small screen soap opera, but no one had such a dazzling style, as you will see here: the camera is smooth and polished, the use of color is breathtaking, the initial installation is set to The title song is memorable, one-dimensional characters are unforgettable, and on the final image you will scratch your head about how the censors returned, and then give the final version! <br /> <br /> While most are older, very Considered films can sometimes be a boring chore to sit through, Written in the Wind contains so much and passes so quickly that it is actually a shame when it ends. Thanks to Mr. Circ for making the film and Todd Haynes for drawing attention to what has now become one of my favorite films of all time! WATCH THIS FILM !!!
