This film was wonderful and I would like to buy it. A boy walks with his grandfather to catch a young eagle. the boy must feed the eagle and care for him until he is old enough to sacrifice him to the crops. The boy saves the eagle from death and runs away from the tribe. The eagle helps feed him by catching a duck from a small pond that scares the boy. Later, the boy shoots a deer for which the bully claimed, because their arrows were marked very close. Only until they check the thickness of the red lines, they determine who actually got the deer. But it was regrettable because it made the other boys even tougher to him, and in the end he was haunted on a rock, but when you think he will fall, his pure love for the eagle turns him into a golden eagle with only the Necklace as a reminder , who was he. Please, if anyone knows where I can buy this movie, let me know. I have not seen him for more than 30 years, but I still remember parts of the film. deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
