Prix ​​de Beauté was created on the threshold of the transition from silence to sound, which occurred a little later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally conceived as silent, it was released with a dubbed soundtrack in France with French actress dubbed by Louise Brooks, but was released as silent in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was fortunate enough to see the flawless new restoration of the Italian silent print Cineteca di Bologna at the Tribeca Film Festival. I haven’t seen the talkie version yet, but I think it is safe to assume that the quiet version is much more satisfactory, because the duplication is poorly done (Louise Brooks clearly speaks English, so her lips could not be Matched.) In addition, the film is made entirely in a silent style, with a small number of titles and a small need for dialogue. Prix ​​de Beauté tells its story visually, with an exciting, creative camera work. The discovery is instantly kinetic, with fast-cutting scenes of city life and swimmers on a public beach. Throughout the film, special attention is paid to visual details, clothing, technology, decorations and symbolic images, such as a bird in a cage, a bunch of torn photos, a diamond bracelet. This is a silent film technique on top. <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks, of course, is responsible for saving the film from the unknown. Seeing this, it only becomes more heartbreaking to reflect that this was her last major role. Brilliantly beautiful, she dominates the film with its charisma, and also gives a completely natural, but very charged presentation. Her role here is greater than in the Pabst films, for which she is most famous, a woman whom we can fully understand and sympathize with. She plays Lucien Garnier, a typist with a possessive bridegroom who is eager to get more out of life and secretly participates in a beauty contest with immediate success. Then she is torn between the excitement of her glamorous new life and her love for a man who insists that she give up or lose everything. All characters are drawn with nuances. The groom inspires pity and not just brute: he loves Lucien, but a limited man who cannot cope with the fact that she lives separately from him or attracts the attention of other men. Even the “other person” in this story is not the simple slug for which we take him for the first time, although his intentions may be just as possessive as the groom’s. <br /> <br /> *********************** ATTENTION: SPOILERS BELOW ************* **** <br /> <br /> In the film there are many subtle sets of the play, including Lucien’s triumph in the Miss Europe competition, shown through the comic reactions of various viewers, who eventually throw flowers at the heroine; her suffering as a housewife peeling potatoes, while the cuckoo pendulum marks the time behind her; nightmare trip to a fun fair (according to the quiet version, it happens at the end of the film after her marriage), at which Lucien, crushed among poor people and depressed by her husband's macho antics, decides that she cannot go on her current existence; and especially the final scene in the projection room, where she looks at her test on the screen of the radio. Louise Brooks may never have looked more beautiful than she is here, with a projector beam shimmering on her alabaster profile, her shoulders covered with white fur, her face red-hot under a black hair helmet as she watches her sing on the screen. The double shot of her adorable corpse and her still vivid image on the screen is particularly sharp: the image of Louise Brooks, like Lucien, remains immortal, despite her disappointedly interrupted film career.
