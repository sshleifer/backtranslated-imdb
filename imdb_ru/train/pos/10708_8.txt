John (Ben Chaplin) is a lonely bank clerk who lives in a small town near London. Through the Internet, he communicates with the Russian brides agency. He chooses Sophia (Nicole Kidman - the guy can be lonely and shy, but, of course, has good taste, isn’t he?), And when they meet, he realizes that she does not speak English. Communication with each other is mostly limited to sex (again, imagine what a terrible situation for a guy, just have fun with Nicole Kidman!). On her birthday two Russian friends come to her. Then many surprises will happen. I liked this film: firstly, it’s almost impossible to “tag”. Is it a black comedy, an action movie, a thriller? I believe that all the choices are correct. Nicole Kidman, as usual, is gorgeous, and I wonder how she speaks Russian: does she really speak Russian with the right accent or is she just pretending? Anyway, I found this movie enjoyable. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “A Isca Perfeita” (“Perfect Bait”).
