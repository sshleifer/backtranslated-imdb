“The Lion King” is without a doubt my favorite Disney movie of all time, so I thought that maybe I should give the sequels a chance, and I did it. Lion King 1 1/2 was pretty good and laughed and had fun with Timon and Pumba. The only problem is, I feel that sometimes there is no need for any explanation, because they can create holes in the plot and just the feeling that you need your own explanation. Well, I highly recommend this movie to Lion King fans or just spend the night with the family. This is a funny movie with the same laughter and attractive characters as the first one. So hopefully I’ll get the same with the third installment of the Lion King series. Relax and just think of Hakuna Matata! That means no worries! <br /> <br /> 8/10
