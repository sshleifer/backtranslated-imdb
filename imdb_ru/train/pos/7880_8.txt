The plot of this pleasant MGM musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing, which deals with espionage and romance, but the film’s focus is on melodic interludes demonstrating Eleanor Powell’s extremely talented and athletic tapet that is incited by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra. with Ziggy Ellman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Red Skelton shares the high scores with Powell, and he and his assistant, Bert Larue, are given most comedic minutes, although Skelton is more effective when he, if you can believe, acts as a love interest for Powell, and Virginia O'Brien actually provides the most film humor as a companion dancer. Powell’s technical brilliance is confirmed by one incredible scene in which Buddy Rich introduces his drumming skills and needs to be watched several times to allow the breath to catch up with its accuracy. Directed by Edward Buzzell uses his large cast well to promote well the action, despite the rather fragmented scenario with which he has to deal, and admits Powell's occasional inability to manage the business, depending on the circumstances.
