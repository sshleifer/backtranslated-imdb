Accidental meeting with the killer seller changes their lives. This is a strange film that works, an impressive effort for screenwriter director Shepard. In a bold, ugly role that is far from James Bond, Brosnan is amazingly effective as a lone hired killer who begins to strain under the burden of his work, but cannot emotionally contact anyone to help him cope. Kinnear is equally good as a salesman, a decent person with an emptiness in his life. Davis is fine as Kinnira's flirtatious wife. The film, mainly for character exploration, is useful because it seems fresh and unpredictable, an extremely dark comedy.
