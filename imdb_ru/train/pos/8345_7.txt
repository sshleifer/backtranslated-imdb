I recently saw I.Q. and although I am not a romantic comedic heroine, I think it was just a good and enjoyable movie to watch. In my opinion, many films lack honesty. This feeling is familiar to you when you watch a movie and you just feel robbed because it takes something from the story, and it looked like the director just threw it together as if it were rubbish? The story between scientists is cute and funny. How they stuck together and tried to help character Tim Robbins to become smart. I liked the love story between Tim and Meg, because it was simple and brought up a good moment when it comes to love: "Nothing is what it seems." I would recommend this for a Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
