I accidentally scanned TV channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful people who attract each other with a very innocent and pristine-like approach to each other. Ethan Hawke (Jessie) "The Tape" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 TV series (Nicole). This guy and boyfriend will warm your heart and soul and make you think deeply about your past relationships and how you really would like you to follow your boyfriendâ€™s heart strings or greet you deeply loved and lost after these years. . Jesse and Celine have a great conversation and deep eye contact with a strong magnetic explosion between the two. I look forward to the continuation of this film in 2004, and if you watched this film, you will feel the same.
