The film era of sexual exploitation in the late sixties and early seventies began with the gratuitous nudity in ordinary films and ended with the legalization of hard porn. The peak years were between 1968 and 1972. One of the most beloved and talented actresses of that era was Monica Gale, who had a small but fanatical cult of followers. In fact, she was able to act, unlike many who played the main roles in these films, and her subsequent merits proved it. And her seemingly deliberate disappearance into obscurity, when her career took off, only strengthens her mysticism. <br /> <br /> Gary Graver, the director, was also talented; probably too talented for the genre of sexual exploitation, and his skill combined with the presence on the screen of Monica Gale makes Sandra "Creating a Woman" a pleasant experience. The film never delays, and you wonâ€™t press the fast forward button with your finger.
