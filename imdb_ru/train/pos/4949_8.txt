10 ITEMS OR LESS - one of those pictures that “under the radar” are imbued with the simplicity that most independent films have: honest, extraordinary performances of two hosts - Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega, which create an absolutely additional, albeit unlikely duet, the most remarkable that this whole film looks incredible, despite its roots in the “road film”. As an unnamed character, Morgan Freeman mentally (and not physically) arrives at the place where he meets this exhausted girl on the road, who has unhealthy relationships with her current leader (who also accidentally starts a relationship with her husband, a fander who is played by Bobby Cannaval). for some reason, remains for us to witness more than a conclusion, and their witty banter - two people on different sides of the medal of society - is deceptively simple. So in a nutshell, as long as there is no explosion! In moments of tremendous revelations, this film is a peculiar little mood, which probably was otherwise lost in the shuffle of indie, released in 2006, but deserving to be seen, if only because of its honesty.
