I've never been to a midnight movie before Dick Tracy was released. <br /> <br /> I still have a “T-shirt ticket” that I had to wear in order to be admitted to the show somewhere here, and Since this shirt, “Dick Tracy” has stuck with me. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the film, sharp visual effects, vivid primary colors and strong characters are surely imprinted in your brain. This is a miracle to contemplate. <br /> <br /> Beatty, as director / star / co-writer / producer, knows what works in the film, and shows it here, taking the familiar American icon and recreating it in a whole new era. Still set in the 30s, Tracy has a kind of eternal quality like all good films. I lost count of how many times I watched Tracy, and I still catch something new every time I do it. <br /> <br /> Everyone else is top-level, starting with Pacino's Big Whim (a reminder that he can star in a comedy with the best of them), even Madony’s “Lifeless Mahoni” that with the right environment, it can act (GASP!). <br /> <br /> But such topics as the need for a family, maintaining loyalty to oneself, good against evil, and even Machiavellian themes are explored. Strange for a comic book, but hey, it works. <br /> <br /> In general, Dick Tracy is a classic in itself. Compared to other films of this decade, this makes a strong statement. This is a good, strong film that does not depend on blood, violence, profanity or nudity. <br /> <br /> Here you can learn a lesson. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Great Scott!
