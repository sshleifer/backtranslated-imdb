Iâ€™ve seen Dirty Work several times, and probably these are my favorite shorty Stan and Ollie. <br /> <br /> In this film, Stan and Ollie spend the chimney sweep and get the job of cleaning the fireplace in the house of Professor Noodles Lucien Littlefield. While Noodles conducts insane experiments in their laboratory, Stan and Ollie cause a lot of chaos, trying to clean the chimney and make a mess in the living room. The end is where Ollie falls into a reservoir of a special formula that Noodles use for his experiments, and that turns him into a chimpanzee! The best part is that Ollie falls into the pipe, and a lot of bricks fall on his head, but he does not seem to suffer from such pain. <br /> <br /> Dirty work is Stan and Ollie during their funniest acts. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 stars out of 5.
