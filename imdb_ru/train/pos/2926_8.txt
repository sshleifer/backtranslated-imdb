... It even beats the nasty "raw." This show is almost twenty years old, and I still really Laugh when I watched it last night. It depicts Eddie Murphy, dressed in tight red clothes ("Old School"), and he jokes with everything from celebrity to his family. He was then only 22 years old, and this is a must-see! <br /> <br /> 8/10
