Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low-cost chillers for Monogram Studios in the 1940s, and “The Corpse Disappears” is one of the best. <br /> <br /> Bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them, and then extracts fluid from their bodies so that he can keep his aging wife young. After the reporter and the doctor spent the night at his home and found that he was responsible for the death of the brides, the next morning they report the killings to the police, and soon after that the mad scientist was shot dead and fell dead. <br /> <In this film, you have almost everything: the scholarly assistants consist of an old witch, a hunchback and a dwarf (her sons), thunderstorms and creepy passages in Bela's house. Bela and his wife believe that they sleep better in their coffins than in the beds in the movie. <br /> <br /> “The body disappears” is worth seeing, especially for the fans of Bela Lugosi. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
