When you usually watch a short film, you are always afraid that the person making the film is trying to throw too much into it. This is not the case with this. A great story about a young girl who was enough and other worldly forces trying to help mend things. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari copes with the task of representing the spirit of perverted justice and helps to convey the complexities of the blurred line of good and evil. <br /> <br /> In this wonderful short film, both the young girl and dad give excellent performances, but Eric's performance is definitely a hit in this story. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this film for its complexity, performance and magnificence of the whole story.
