This is one of the best conversations Joan Crawford. This was the first pairing of Gable-Crawford, which showed MGM and the audience that they were a terrific team, which prompted the studio to make seven more films with them. <br /> <br /> The film convincingly depicts a downward movement of a brother and sister, who, after their father loses everything in the stock market crash, must stand up for themselves and work to earn a living. Life in the Depression is hard, and soon even their attempts to find legitimate work are useless, and they resort to criminal activity. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford does an excellent job with his work. She is smart, complex and believable. She even softens the theatrical rigidity of the early acting style of other actors. Clark Gable is a brilliant, coarse, manly and coarse, like a senseless gangster who is associated with Crawford's character. In the same year, he played a similar and even more successful role together with Norma Shearer in the Free Soul, securing the title of the main male sex symbol in MGM. <br /> <br /> If you like Crawford in this type of role, do not miss “Paid” for what she did a year ago, which is also one of her best early performances on Talci. <br /> <br />
