Before watching the film, I did not know anything about the film, and I think it was a “no waiting” factor that helped me first endure, and then like more than I expected. <br /> <br /> The setting was interesting, strange but interesting. There were skips / jumps in the storyline, which, I think, repel the audience a little. There is no great soundtrack playing in the background, creating a "romantic" atmosphere. BUT they all didn't matter. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Emma and Louis was just amazing. There was some kind of inexplicable strange chemistry that I could not resist; I fell in love with him and here I am, writing this review. The subtle love image of the two actors was excellent, and I think this is the essence of this film. <br /> <br /> This film is not an everyday romantic comedy; in fact, not all of us will appreciate it. I had to sit for a while, and then slowly I began to understand the little things that I did not catch at first. I can't guarantee that everyone will like it, but I hope you enjoy it.
