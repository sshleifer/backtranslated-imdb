STARS RATING: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Noticeably bad actor, succeeding in his (now disappearing) appearance Richard Gere, and not any strong dramatic talent, has always occupied a rather curious position on the American Hollywood scene, always casting roles for leading roles that still occupy a prominent place in our day. But now he seems to have focused more on such direct roles on DVD / limited-release roles, and perhaps now he seems to be more determined in his forte. <br /> <br /> Here he must pay attention to some rigorous questions. As a hardened, cynical worker in the case of Earl Babbage, one such worker has been appointed to several hundreds of sex offenders in one area of ​​the United States, who along with his new protégé Allison Altrop (Claire Danes) must do his last thing, going deep into the kidnapping of a young woman trying to forgive herself an event that he failed many years ago. <br /> <br /> This is a definite immersion in the dark side of humanity, the attack on the material is definitely not for squeamish people or those who are looking for light viewing. And as such, it is quite a strong, convincing film, unshakable and not constrained by the direct budget on DVD. The only thing that really pulls him back is the overly used shaky, fast-cutting sequences of cameras used in more dramatic moments that look a bit trite after a while. But this is still one of the hardest materials in which I saw Gere, steadily becoming darker and more beautiful as you move. ***
