A deeply humorous but honest comedy about a group of adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane) who are invited to return for a week to Tomavka, camp in (Ontario) Canada their former consumer Alan Arkin). Writer / director Mike Binder used his experience in the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding yarn that makes sense. In addition, there are many funny moments in the film, some of which are quite whimsical, like my favorite, one includes the use of masking tape. Newton Thomas Siegel (“Ordinary Suspects”, “The Three Kings”) presents several spectacular shots of Canadian wildlife in the film. Among the actors, Sam Raimi, the director of the films “The Evil Dead” and “The Gift,” appears here as Arkin’s awkward right-handed man. One more thing, this film convinced me that the camp should not be the site of bloody murders.
