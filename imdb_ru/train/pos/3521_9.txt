Other reviewers summarized this film noir well. I just wanted to add to "Whew!" one reviewer's commentary, made on the obviously coked episode of Elisha Cook’s coke. I have to say it was stupid. Cook has earned recognition for his frantic game. <br /> <br /> A few little things I guess: Cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 Barbara Stanvik film “Ball of Fire”. He was a waiter at a nightclub where Barbara sang, and the legendary drummer Jean Krupa played very vigorously. Is it too much to suggest that Cook’s spasmodic blow in the later movie “Phantom Lady” was very inspired by Krupa’s work, as shown by Cook 3 years ago? <br /> <br /> If you watch Krupa in the Fireball, I think you will notice several similar body movements. Of course, one can hope that at that time no medication had affected him!
