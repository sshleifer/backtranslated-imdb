This is a great end of the show. The fact that Admiral Jenway was able to make a double transition at the Borg was remarkable. The fact that she allowed herself to be infected by infecting the queen with “poison”, which, in effect, put an end to the Borg, was great. The way they ended it also left, not much, for the reunion film. However, they brought them home and the way they did it was fantastic !! It was sad to say goodbye to part of my family. Finishing it with Tom and B'Lanna, having their child as they enter Alpha quad. was a great way to show a new beginning. It would be nice to have some reunion film just to see where their characters will be today.
