When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends get together for a movie night, there is one film that they insist on to watch it again and again: you guessed K-911, the third release in the very successful K-9 franchise in which all the favorite television dad, Jim Belushi, was shot. <br /> <br /> Guys, I knew that you could carry a VHS tape, but a DVD? It was played so often that it starts to miss; I am not kidding! But, of course, you will have it when you have such a charming, such a brilliant film. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have to thank the one and only Tom Hanks for introducing us to the favorite genre of Cop-Dog. with Turner and Hooch; however, even this film does not correspond to the absolute perfection presented in all three K-9 films. <br /> <br /> Some of them say that Belushi has run out of steam with this third film in the series. Poppy, I say. Although you may suspect that the third release - directly to the video - may seem like something worth watching, you will be wrong after watching this quality movie. <br /> <br /> I will not distribute the plot, but I will say that Belushi and his partner will show their best results - the one that will make you scream with laughter! It is a pity that John Belushi did not live to see what great progress his brother made in the acting world. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend that your teenage daughter present this film to her best friends at the next party. Do not forget the puppy chow!
