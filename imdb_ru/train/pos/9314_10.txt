Just saw this show several times, but will remain in my memory. <br /> <br /> It is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find it somewhere to buy, and yet, it seems, there are endless repetitions of such things as Friends! Probably even harder to achieve in England ..? <br /> <br /> They say they were low ratings or was it a complaint from the Bakersfield police? Maybe it was too clever for some people? <br /> <br /> Anyway, only about one comedy that I would like to see again, but almost impossible to find. Did I hear that this is happening or was repeated on another network? But, alas, not here !! <br /> <br /> Summary: Brilliant.
