First, someone mentioned here that since it was released in a “limited” quantity, this means that it MUST be bad ... this is exactly what the “big five” Hollywood studios would like everyone to think so that they can “skip” or “ignore” "features that are not desirable, without losing face or imagining, censoring them directly. By the way, this work was released" limited "because some people consider it" unpatriotic. "< br /> <br /> Now I really liked this feature; I na I’m doing this much better than Charlie Wilson’s War, even if it’s a “fictional” story that “never” happens, but always so DESIGNATIVE. This applies to everyone and everyone who is interested in or affected by current US foreign policy. " "or" on board ". the country "Turakistan" and the "emerald city" are definitely trying to be like Iraq and Baghdad in the same way as the Tamerlan corporation stands for "Haliburton" (with vice president Dan Aykroyd playing Dick Cheney, LOL). Calm moments are in fact, where the film “HEART HEART” is not even sarcastic (the main example is how John Cusack's character copes with his depression, but not only). <br /> <br /> I found that ALL characters can be associated with / someone or certain stereotypes. now a word of advice; if you are not politically active, especially with regard to aspects of “globalization”, you will most likely not like this feature, since most of its content and inside the “jokes” are focused on certain “personalities” who are not “visible” to the general public on a daily basis ... (the main exception will be Hilary Duff, who plays a famous materialistic pop star, do I need to say name (S)?). In its core feature - anti-globalization concert, period. the message is unmistakably delivered with comic revenge. In one place, Joan has a line that looks like this: "here we have a book written by you, who knows, how I conquered the world and solved problems with my father." Pricelessly))) <br /> <br /> Sister and brother Cusacks play well together, as always, as in Grosse PointeBlank, I would say, a bit more “mature”. Marisa Tomeicher doesn’t show her ass and bosom to “impress us” (as she did so recently in “Before the devil knows you're dead”), but instead she plays a very serious role and she calmly deal with it. <br /> <br /> Many critics do not understand this (they can’t or don’t want to). This is not a "regular" film, but rather a comic documentary. This feature is designed to deliver a message, NOT to get an Oscar or to "visually" force the viewer to buy the latest TVs with "HDTV-experience" ... I noticed even in my local newspapers that this film is becoming bad - views, because it is not “artistic”, while films about the war in Iraq are gaining a big thumbs up for being “balanced” and, apparently, “attractive”. Makes you wonder how all the major media in the world are concentrated in the hands of a group of guys. .. <br /> <br /> I bet this feature will be a hit overseas far more than in North America. as I mentioned earlier, all of this is a satire about American foreign policy and how it was captured by groups of "special interests" ... bearing in mind that the "ordinary" American soldier wearing the Tamerlan logo of his combat clothing , is rather offensive BUT EFFECTIVELY is to show reality as it is, or will soon be so far away. <br /> <br /> Some priceless frames: after “liberation”, the country receives captured commercial advertising; a funny scene about how future journalists are likely to collect “news” (“something should be better than these shuttlecocks”))); soldiers deal with their "disappointments"; <br /> <br /> In general, I do not recommend this to “conservatives” or “tough” patriots of one sort or another. This function is not intended to achieve people's "minds" (as the main propaganda and commercial interests are always trying to do it). Instead, it contains a message that is clearly defined for realists and aimed at achieving some ideological goals that are apparently “always” unattainable for realization.
