CONTAINS SPOILER With the possible exception of John Wayne, no other actor sits in the saddle taller than Western Stewart, and this film proves it. This excellent story of revenge centered around a Winchester rifle has only one weak point that I can think of: casting Will Djir as a very unbalanced Wyatt Earp. Casting villains was good: Stephen McNally, the same sullen Dutchman Henry, Dan Durya, like Waco Johnny Dean and John McIntyre (diversifying both good guys and bad guys) as a deft shooter. The battle between Stuart and McNally on the rocks is gorgeous! I would fold this western against the whole harvest of westerns produced today. They would have no chance!
