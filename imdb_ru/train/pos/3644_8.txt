The Rookie is based on the true story of a 40-year-old school teacher in Big Lake, Texas, who has achieved major specialties. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a high school science teacher and baseball coach. His team loses terribly until the team finds out that their coach was playing in the big leagues and can accelerate the field to 98 miles per hour. <br /> <br /> After throwing the batting practice and betting, Jim agrees that if his team wins the regional, he will try to get into the big leagues. The film tells how Jimmy was a boy and played his first game in the majors. This is a great story of losers and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid makes the film worth seeing, gives an emotional presentation and is supported by an excellent supporting actor, including: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> The story takes a little time, and some scenes are a bit slow, but by the end everything works well. The baseball scenes are funny, well filmed, and beautifully depicted. The film is not really about baseball, but about the desire of one person to achieve his dream. It is inspiring, it is emotional, and it is funny. I liked it, I hope you enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The Rookie. Starring: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5 stars.
