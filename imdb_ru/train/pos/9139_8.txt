The film is all right, there are moments in it, the music scenes are the best! The soundtrack is a real classic. This is a perfect album, it starts with Let's Go Crazy (suitable for a start, because it’s a great party song and very fast paced), Take Me With U (funny pop song ...), The Beautiful Ones (funny Ballad, perhaps closest to R & B on this album, Computer Blue (Appolonia’s somewhat evil anthem), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs in history, she very vaguely makes fun of Appolonia), When Doves Cry (culminating to this masterpiece), I 4 U, Baby I'm A Star, and, of course, Purple Rain (a real classic, a very suitable ending for this classic album) would die. The film and the album are both very good. I highly recommend them!
