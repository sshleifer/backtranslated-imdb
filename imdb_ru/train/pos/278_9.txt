I have to say, "Immortal Clive Barker" is the best horror game ever made. I played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Evil Dead and Castlevania games, but none of them had such joy with which this game copes with its horrific elements. Barker is good at what he does, which gives horror to our world, and this shows that his hand is clearly everywhere in this game. Hell, even his voice in the game as one of the main characters. Undying, full of vivid visual images and enough atmosphere to shake a stick, is a game that will surpass my books as the best horror game. I would just like it to get to the console system, but alas, poor sales of PCs nip it in the bud.
