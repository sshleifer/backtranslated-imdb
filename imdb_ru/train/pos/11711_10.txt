The story of Miss Patty Duke about her life and the fight against manic depression was the same as my life. I saw myself acting just like her. I was so struck by the similarity of our lives, including the sexual abuse that we both experienced in childhood. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie when it was first shown in 1990, and I really liked this movie. Anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much from this film. Never mind if these were her rewards or what they were for. This is not a problem here. The question is how Mrs. Duke fell ill and fought to survive and win. Mrs. Duke can be proud of her achievements in the struggle for the survival of the disease, which often leaves many victims without hope. <br /> <br /> If a person did not personally fight this disease, he does not know what the hell, they must live with. The film was successful for me because it showed real problems and how a person who is depressed and acts manic. It was so real ... so real. It was like watching yourself on the screen. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Mrs. Patty Duke personally for daring to inform the public about her illness. Bocka
