The classic TV series, which should at least be repeated or released on DVD. Billy Toth, realizing that he was adopted after the death of his parents, goes on a journey to find his real parents. After various rituals, his search concludes with the discovery that his fatherâ€™s identity was stolen and used by a trafficker in Europe! If I remember correctly, the series ends on the Austrian (?] Ski slopes and race on the cliff top, in which Billie's traitor died. Shot in various locations in Europe to find his mother and the secrets of his fathers. A cool act, but underestimated and forgotten.
