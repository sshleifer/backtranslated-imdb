Blimey! Blimey! Blimey! I never saw a non-preaching documentary on globalization until I saw MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA. This film has no narration and combines truthful shots with delicate interviews with four teenage workers in China who live in the factory. They play with toys, jump rope and dance. However, most of their days and nights are made up of work, work, and work — but the cadres of their work illuminate and fascinate to watch. The owner of a factory in China is surprisingly open, so much so that he reaches home with the effects of globalization, while he “punishes” the workers. The film tells how local people are connected with the global world through humor and interesting, exciting stories from both cultures. One of the most interesting parts in this film is the mutual cultural acquaintance of the factory workers and Mardi Gras revelers with each other through the paintings. Here the film goes full circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation. The film is never preached, guided by guilt and allows everyone to be present. In the end, we - the audience - draw our own conclusions about the complexity of the film and globalization.
