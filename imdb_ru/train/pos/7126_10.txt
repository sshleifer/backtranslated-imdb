This film has resonated with me on two levels. As a child, I was evacuated from London and put on unwitting masters in a village village. Although I escaped the bombing and got the experience that brought cherished memories (for example, I heard the nightingale singing on a dark night for the first time) and enjoyed a life I could never have in London, I missed my family and worried about them. Tom is an old man whose wife and child both died, and who lives alone in a small village village. As an old man, who now has no wife, whose children got married and live far away in another province, I once again feel lonely, the boy's Mother is a religious fanatic with very strange ideas of raising a child. As there was a deep affection between old Tom Oakley and this young guy, Tom goes in search of him and finally saves him from very strange and dangerous circumstances. At the end of the story, a great deal of tension arises, because, due to some bureaucratic decision, it seems that the child will lose the person who has love relationships with him.
