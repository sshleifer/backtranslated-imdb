I accidentally stumbled upon this film when I listed all the films that I wanted my sister to record for me while I was on vacation, and I am so glad that I included this one. This concerns issues that most directors avoid, my only problem with this film is that it's made for television, so I can't buy a copy for my friend! <br /> <br /> people with eating disorders do not necessarily shy away from everyone, and how many people actually have interlocutors on a diet. This drew my attention to the fact that although bulimia can maintain a fairly stable weight, it has more serious consequences for their health, which many people do not know about.
