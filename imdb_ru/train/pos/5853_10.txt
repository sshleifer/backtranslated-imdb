I really liked this Summerslam because of the look of the arena, the curtains and the overall look, for some reason I was interested. In any case, this could be one of the best events of Summerslam, if WWF did not have Lex Luger in the main tournament against Yokodzuna, now is the time when you could have a big fat man against a strong one, but I am glad times have changed. It was a terrible main event, just like every match that Luger is involved in is terrible. Other matches on the map: Ramon vs. Ted Dibias Razor, Steiner Brothers vs. Heavenly Bodies, Sean Michaels vs. Kurt Hening, this was the event when Sean called his big monster Diesel bodyguard, IRS vs. 1-2-3 Kid, Brett Hart first takes Doynka , then takes Jerry Lawler, and things with Hearts and Lawler were always very interesting, then Ludwig Borg destroyed Marty Jannetti, Undertaker took Gigant Gonz√°lez in another terrible match, Smokers Hanna and Tatanka took Bam Bam Bigelow Hedgeinkers and Yokozuna defended the title tiv lex luger: this match was boring and it has a terrible ending. However, it deserves a 8/10
