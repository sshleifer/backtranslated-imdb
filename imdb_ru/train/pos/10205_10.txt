Accidentally met this one, he was behind a box with a film that, as I thought, I was shooting, I did not recognize, until I returned home, I still looked. Absolutely fantastic! Wonderful movie, and one of my three best favorites of all time, I recommend it to everyone! <br /> <br /> The story is pleasant and easy to track, it could be easily spoiled, but the actors and the Director do an excellent job. <br /> <br /> The actors themselves are awesome, demonstrate remarkable character and do amazing work. <br /> <br /> Need to find a copy somewhere ...........
