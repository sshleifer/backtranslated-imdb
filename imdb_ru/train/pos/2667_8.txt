I have never been a big fan of horror movies. They usually try to use cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy kids. They usually lack originality, and they contain too much grace. The only horror film I liked was Echo with Kevin Bacon. It was good, and there was a great story. But he was joined and, perhaps, even surpassed Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the most terrible film in the entire history. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family, who agree to look after the hotel until it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of a place where he was being pursued, and the last inhabitant went insane and killed his family. But Jack is convinced that everything will be fine, and he can use silence to overcome his writer's block. However, after several months of loneliness and silence, Jack becomes grumpy, and then cruel. Is it a fever in the cabin or something in a hotel driving him crazy? <br /> <br /> One of the most creepy parts of the film is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick creates. The hotel is very quiet and the rooms are huge but always empty. It is also terribly calm when Jackâ€™s son rides his bike through deserted corridors. Speech by Jack Nicholson is also one of his best, frightening me to hell and forcing me to go out more than once. My favorite scene is when he talks to a ghost from the fridge. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, The Shining is the pinnacle of horror films, beating up snot shit such as The Ring and Blair. Witch Project. It may be old, but definitely good. 8/10
