The 1st season was awesome, the whole idea of ​​adapting to the island, while the puzzles being explored (and seen), was just phenomenal; filled with uncertainty, tons of rock climbing and an amazing storyline. I mean, I like the idea of ​​just seeing how they get used to the island. And then the first encounter with the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention. Since then I got hooked. The second season was on par with the 1st, only slightly better. I really liked the idea of ​​the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. The whole plot and episodes of the second season were mysterious, creepy and exciting. I liked the surrounding environment on the island, but the history of DHARMA really made season 2 amazing. <br /> <br /> Season 3 was not as good as 1 and 2 ... but, nevertheless, excellent. I liked to see the stories of other people, see their camp and see how secrets are explored further. ("Trisha Tanak is Dead" - one of my favorite episodes). This season, although not so good, was still exciting and fun, but most of all exciting! Now 4 season. I had hopes for this season, and with the first couple of episodes we are good, but then it REALLY became boring and monotonous. I mean that I REALLY despise new “rescuers” such as Miles and Daniel. The plot got old after the first pair episodes ... and MORE ALL ... In the 4th season, something was lost that made LOST the perfect series: mystery, indecision, mixed comedy (Charlie left) and general excitement. In addition, some of my favorite characters remained.
