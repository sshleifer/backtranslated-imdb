In this funny cartoon, Bugs Bunny, the still unnamed Marvin Martian returns and his partner K-9 is a green dog. <br /> <br /> This time, instead of trying to destroy Earth, Marvin performs a mission to land, capture an earthly being and return it to Mars. Of course, the creature he chooses is Bugs Bunny. At first, Bugs thinks that Marvin and K-9 are a trick or a cure, but he realizes that this cannot be right when Marvin dramatically expands the Bug rabbit hole with a ray gun. Bugs is trying to deceive the way out of the situation in several ways, including Marvin’s conviction that K-9 is planning a rebellion. In the end, he was captured with a Basim jacket with Acme's straitjacket. Surprisingly, for the Acme product, it works as advertised, and Bug's is forced to use its wits to make K-9 free it, the tables are soon overturned, and two disgruntled Martianists are entangled, and Bugs tries to drive the saucer back to Earth. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it, although the ending is a bit weaker compared to the rest of the story. Here, Marvin’s voice has changed a bit, and he becomes noticeably emotional when angry, but it didn’t make me the same as he or the cartoon.
