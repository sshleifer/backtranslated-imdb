I watched this movie after watching Broadway. I love the Broadway musical and I love the movie. I watched the movie as if it was not related to the Broadway show. I am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they turn into films, so I developed a philosophy very early. Suppose the film is based on a book (or a musical one in this case), but although the storyline may be similar, it will not be the same, but it will be different, so look what it is. <Br /> <br /> I danced 12 years before I had to make a choice. I was a good dancer (I picked up choral work in local productions as a child, etc.), But I was not super talented. However, I was super talented as a show rider. My dance instructor and my trainer (with whom I spent several months a year on his out-of-farm farm) told me that I had to make a choice when I was 14. That I needed to give up dancing two hours four to five days a week and ride 3 hours a day 7 days a week .. and devote one or the other. So I really love dancing and I love this film and many other ballet and dance films. I just decided to see this film as it is, this is a great film about raw emotions and human interaction. It's about strength of anticipation and frustration, when you really work hard to get what you want, and you just don't get it. I love the movie I love the Broadway musical.
