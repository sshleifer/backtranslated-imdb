You sit there for half an hour and watch the story, believing it all, then watch another half-hour of the same story completely falling apart ... and then reconnect. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting feature films at the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary. I don’t know if there was anything like Anna Blaunovski’s “Forbidden Lie” other than “Capture the Friedmans” by Andrew Yareki. He tells, exposes, protects, reveals and questions everything about Norma Khouri, the author of Lost Honor, the 2001 acclaimed best-seller of honor killings in Jordan. <br /> <br /> What is absolutely unbelievable and what makes the film so exceptional is that this “revelation” of Howry was done with the full participation of Howry. <br /> <br /> In the first part of the film, Howri presents her story about the alleged murder of the honor of her friend in the film. Amman, the history of the book. It sounds believable, convincing. <br /> <br /> Then, her story was exposed, exposed by eminent, believable and convincing people, such as human rights defenders in Jordan, investigative journalists there and in Australia, where Howrie lived for Some time. <br /> <br /> Khouri returns and denies the charges, successfully passing the lie detector test. Another part of the destructive disclosures is coming - not to indicate here, because it will reduce the value of the shock ... and then Khori comes back and faces accusations (not all, but the main ones in the book's question). /> <br /> And the Houdini Act continues, round after round in this heavy, swinging prize battle, surprise after surprise - and in the sense of resolution there is no “happy ending”. Brilliant.
