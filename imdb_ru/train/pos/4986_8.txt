Lensman is a rather obscure Anime gem from Toho and MK studios. It is based on a novel, but it reminds me more of the Metroid game. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it, look at it in Japanese with subtitles or simply in Japanese. The English dubbed version was practically clipped and edited to death. <br /> <br /> Not so much in spite of the fact that this is the first animated function for combining CG graphics. with hand-drawn animation, but nonetheless looking interesting.
