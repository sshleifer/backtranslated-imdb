Gundam Wing is a fun show. I appreciate this because I met Gundam and the anime in general. However, after seeing his predecessors, such as the Gundam mobile suit, Zeta Gundam, and even G Gundam, I discovered that Wing is Gundam Lite. <br /> <br /> Characters: The aspect that Gundam has long held is to have your characters push into difficulties and grow in maturity. It does not occur in the wing. Hiro is the best dog at the beginning, and he is the best dog at the end. Persons do not change, growth is never achieved. The best character is Zech, who, in fact, is a hero for most of the series. But suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Furs: Wing has an excellent costume design. Gundams are very cool, with Epyon being my favorite. I even think that some of the OZ costume designs are on par with some classic Zeon costumes. But the nice design of the costume does not quite save the series from boring characters. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: In the end, Wing has cool fighting scenes, albeit teeming with reworked animation, but with a small plot and character development. Nice, but not moving, like previous walks of Gundam.
