Romer deviates from his usual portraits of the French middle class in order to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of the aristocrat during the French revolution. What is even more attractive in "English ..." (except for the story itself) is the incredible aesthetics that Romer has achieved. The images were also decorated digitally so that they looked like baroque paintings. At some points you can not say for sure whether you are watching a movie or a series of paintings in the Louvre. Each shot is like a work of art. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ---------------- <br /> <br /> --- ----------- - <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> - --------- ---------
