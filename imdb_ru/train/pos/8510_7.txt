It was the eighth and final film "Columbian Whistler" and the only film without Richard Dix, who left the movie and was supposed to die the next year. It's still a literate thriller, the car keeps up fine without it, but ?? something was missing: dicks! The stories on the Whistler series have always been interesting, sometimes brilliant, the noir scenarios have always been atmospheric, but not only Whistler himself kept it all on the screen, Dicks too. <br /> <br /> A young couple, going out for two whole weeks, gets a desire to get married in a pouring rain, but they get in the way when a potential bride disappears first, and then it turns out that she is already married before she obviously goes crazy Is the potential groom postponed, even when the private member he hired to find her, suddenly hit him and killed him, or is love blind? Who turns, who in this question. Michael Duane in his next-to-last film is fine, if a little weak, the finer moments of the beautiful Lenore Aubert came in the next film at Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was wonderful, as always, to borrow from Boston Black. Also the only way out is where Whistler himself must have gotten wet from a bum in the rain, unless he was sprayed with foam in the Voice. <br /> <br /> A lot has happened in the last hour, which is worth seeing and again as usual for fans of the genre, like me. The Whistler radio series, which began in 1942, lasted until 1955 and consisted of almost 700 half-hour shows, almost all of which are available in mp3 format and are based on what I've heard so far, almost all of which are also worth listening to.
