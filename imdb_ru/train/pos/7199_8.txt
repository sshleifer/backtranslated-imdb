Playwright Sydney Bruhl (Michael Kane) led a series of flop games after a huge hit. He gets a play written by his pupil Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), which is fantastic. It's so good, Sidney says he would kill for it. Will he? <br /> <br /> Thriller thinking person. Initially it was a play ... and it shows. It's mostly on the same set and everyone says, but I have never been bored. It is very well written with lots of turns and a good throw, working at full strength. Kane is just as brilliant as Br√ºel - another great performance of his. Reeve is surprisingly very good. I never thought of him as an actor, but he is really good at this role. Dayan Cannon works wonders with the signed role of Bruhl's wife. Irene Worth is also good (and quite funny) as Helga ten Drop, a psychic. However, her accent got on my nerves. Directed by Sydie Lumet copes with his one set. The camera is constantly moving and supports your attention. <br /> <br /> EMERGENCY SPOILER IS DEADLY AHEAD !!!!! My only complaint is that the two funny characters in this film turn out to be infuriated sociopaths, and it also contains one of the most non-romantic kisses I've ever seen - but these are mild complaints. <br /> <br /> A very good thriller. Critics hate this film (for some reason), and it seems to have completely disappeared since its premiere in 1982. This is very bad - it deserves the best.
