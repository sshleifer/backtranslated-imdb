It was very interesting to me that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own American culture and that of the authors, that is, the Chinese. It becomes a story about values ​​and forces the observer to reconsider his own life choices and loyalty to institutions. Surprisingly, he managed to do it in a soft, slightly humorous manner that only retrospectively represents a threat to his status quo. I liked the movie, and I would watch it again if I could.
