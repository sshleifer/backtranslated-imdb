It should be one of the most sincere and touching films about meeting with boys. While “Rebel Without a Cause” and “Say Something” give good images, these films remove unnecessary stories and Hollywood discrepancies. This film focuses solely on looking at an emerging beautiful novel. You do not doubt for a second that the film will lead to a romantic combination of these two people. You almost immediately feel the synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and just watching how they find them is just nice. This film is basically an entire dialogue based. But each conversation between them is also very intriguing. What makes this combination so romantic is how real it is. As in all this conversation, often without having any real relationship to something critical, you can feel the nuances when the two become more loving and trust each other. That’s how you’d dream to meet this special person. And what makes it so true is that it’s not even fantastic to believe in it. This can happen if you were confident enough to start a conversation with the person whom you noticed somewhere by chance. And the fact that puts the glaze on this film, is the magnificent background of Vienna, in which this film takes place. It only adds to the romantic nirvana feeling that the film offers. And no matter how many times I watch this movie, I don’t think I’ll get tired of it.
