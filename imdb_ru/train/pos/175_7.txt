Quite an average movie, but daring from Ms Hawn to promote this car as an executive producer and as the main car. Although she turns out to be justified, she is ready to portray herself as dizzy chatter. How many others did the listed actresses incur errors due to ass injuries after this movie? Little. Does this mean that female ass can not be funny? Goldie is superior to other actresses, as she supports the role of the character and participates in projects that others will not do. Sandra Bullock sometimes comes there, for example, Miss Congeniality, but Nicole Kidman will never cope with a fall. Wonderful performer. Nice to see some of my favorite actors, especially Chris Sarandon and Cliff DeYang.
