Hooray! A space film that does not take itself too seriously, and everyone can come on an exciting trip to the space camp. The film begins slowly, the usual mixture of idiots and pilots mixed in a sly soup. But when things are not easy, they understand, and this is not an incredible change in the characters, as you can believe that there is some responsibility in their young consciousness. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in the film is that Kate Capshaw is extremely annoying as an instructor, "I'm right, and you're all wrong." I would recommend this as a good movie night and 7 votes.
