The soldier is not a very good film, and everyone who hated him has many good reasons. But I really liked the soldier, in part because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me. <br /> <br /> First, the artistic direction was tough and well executed. As for science fiction backgrounds, Soldier did things with more design than 90% of the genre. The sets, costumes and props were consistent and well executed; I disliked all their future military style, but I was impressed with the effort. It was worth it for me to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm a fan of Kurt Russell. I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable films of my youth ... Barefoot leader and his films of John Carpenter. Soldier is a fighter, and the role of Sergeant Todd is the main fighter. This is not an award-winning role, but Kurt gathers convincing emotions with a VERY small dialogue. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the battle scenes and the battles are well set. This is not an iron monkey or even a matrix, but, again, it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre. <br /> <br /> If you havenâ€™t seen this before, and you like fiction action movies, take them if you rent out. Just do not expect the next Bladerunner.
