Jake's wardrobe has Kramer’s emotional power against Kramer, combined with the imagination of the Maze of Pan. It seems that even a beginner special effect gives a hint at Pen's Labyrinth. But this is a story that occurs in our time, and not in a war sixty years ago, and, thus, today it has even greater resonance. “Jake's Wardrobe” talks about a boy, an only child, almost alone during the summer holidays, who deals with the breakup of his family. This is a horror film like “Others” and “The Sixth Sense”, a horror film for a thinking person. If you are looking for a slash film, this will not be your cup of tea, but if you are looking for a story that is touching and tense with good play, this film is for you. At the show, which I saw, I swear, there was one moment when the whole audience screamed. I highly recommend catching this movie.
