This little movie has long been on my list of "keepers". Do people understand how stressful, menopausal, emotionally offended women (as well as mentally retarded) REALLY were treated by doctors at the turn of the century ?? !! All the pious Christian views of the time were deadly dangerous for exploring the TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to accept suffering souls, not to mention what it means to accept our humanity. Can you imagine (by today's standards) that Walt Whitmanâ€™s books were banned because he admitted that women have the same feelings and emotional reactions as men do? Think about it! The sensitivity of this film still attracts me, and I pay tribute to the director for what he shot his eyes.
