This is a colorful slasher. That's all. <br /> <br /> It has a mysterious element that SCREAM has made so popular in slasher films, but I don’t care. Finding out who the bad guy is is not so interesting, considering that all the clues are misleading anyway. <br /> <br /> Deadly scenes were inventive and horrible, recalling the horror films of the 80s, such as Friday the 13th. <br /> <br /> Another nice thing about this movie is that it’s difficult to identify a surviving girl, unlike SCREAM and IKWYDLS, where it was obvious. <br /> <br /> This film doesn’t please people who don’t like slashers. So simple. I really enjoyed it, and I plan to watch it again, expecting more of the same. <br /> <br /> - MB
