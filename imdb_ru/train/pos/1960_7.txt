It begins about a year after the events in Basic Instinct. Katherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. Having sex with a football player, riding a car at a speed of 110 miles / hour (do not ask), she leaves the road and gets into the Thames. She survives, but he does not. Police hire a psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to check whether she is smart to stand trial. Naturally, instead, she begins to play with his mind, and this is followed by many murders and sex. <br /> <br /> This film was doomed before its opening. It took forever to get actors and directors, the problems with the scenarios were constant, and the actors were unhappy (Morrissey often complained about the film). However, this is not so bad. This is very similar to the first one - there is lush music, beautiful locations, a lot of sex and nudity (it needed to be edited for R), a well-designed plot and a good game - but it will not affect in any way. This is similar to the restoration of the first. People are killed here with a choking leash (I guess) ... just like people were killed with an ice pick for the first time. At one point, Stone takes an ice ax and looks at him with anguish. She also plays intellectual games with a man and can involve him in murder. The similarity is too obvious. <br /> <br /> This is also a VERY R rating - there are a lot of outright sex talk, male nudes (Morrissey looks much better nude than Michael Douglas), female nudes (Stone still looks great) and some bloody murders. The game is good in all directions. The stone here is just fantastic; Morrissey looks miserable, but everything is in order; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis are good at supporting roles. <br /> <br /> So - this is not bad at all, but it looks like a remake of the first. Still, I recommend it. People just attacked it because the Stone didn’t like it very much, and they thought that it would be foolish to do the sequel to “Basic ...” 14 years after its creation.
