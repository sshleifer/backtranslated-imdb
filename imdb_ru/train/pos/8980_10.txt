First of all, I have to admit that I am a big fan of The Dandy Warhols, and that is why I came to see this movie. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this film as compared to other modern rock-instrumentalists is that it’s not just about one page of the group’s history (for example, “I’m trying to break your heart” about Wilco), but rather covers a long period of the group history. In this film, film director / producer Ondi Timoner has been on for over 8 years (1995–2003). He has been following the friends / rivals of The Brian Jonestown Massacre (BJM) and The Dandy Warhols (DW) and filmed a huge 1500 hours of raw video cut to 1:45 hours (the next DVD release will contain much more material than the original film). The result is astounding - there are no fillers - the film is 100% pure and genuine archive, which gives you the feeling that the film is progressing in the fact that you live with groups throughout all these years. <br /> <br /> Both bands, at the beginning of their careers, promised to “make a revolution” in the creation of music, and not to sell their soul to the devil of the “recording industry”. However, their paths quickly diverged - The Dandy Warhols signed a contract with Capitol Records and became relatively popular (especially in Europe) after only one album, while The Brian Jonestown Massacre (with its leader, self-destructing Anton Newcomb) dissolved into oblivion (at least as depicted in the film). And the film follows the descent of Brian Jonestown Massacre, in contrast to the rise of The Dandy Warhols. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I was delighted with the film and its approach to tell the story of Anton Newcomb (for example, Courtney Taylor, leader of The Dandy Warhols, tells), but, on reflection, I realized that with this film something is wrong. <br /> <br /> First, he treats Anton Newcomb as a missing person. The project began in 1995 in the form of a documentary film about several promising new groups, in which Anton Newcomb and Ondi Timoner were equal partners (this is why all these years they had direct access to both groups). It was Anton Newcomb who brought The Dandy Warhols into the project. In the end, he was completely ignored, as if he had been kicked out of the project. Everyone is talking about BJM, but he does not participate in the discussion. I think he was not even informed when the group began the final editing process. This story always has both sides, and here we have only one ... Of course, as one would expect, Anton does not approve the final result and considers this film as a betrayal of his former friends. <br /> <Secondly, the film is very addicted to Dandy Warhols. Of course, the winner gets everything, but the fact that Courtney Taylor (the leader of DW) tells (although this seems like a good choice - it gives the feeling of seemingly closer participation), and that the late history of the groups is disproportionately represented (BJM is up to 1997 and until 2003 - does not add objectivity to the film. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film is (somewhat) small. What does it want to teach us? As one critic said: "... the film explores old questions: Where does the genius fit into the commodity world? Can he flourish and receive his due, or does he need to self-destruct No, it doesn’t study these questions! It’s just a story about a brilliant but unsuccessful musician, told by a less brilliant but successful musician who surrenders to self-confidence and the eternal coolness of the ego that surpasses the mountain. <br /> < br /> In any case, the film was fun - it was raw, fresh, stylish, damn interesting, at least for fans of DW or BJM. For the rest of the crowd - I don't know ...
