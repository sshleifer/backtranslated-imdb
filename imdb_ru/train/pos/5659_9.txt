AG was a great presentation of drama, suspense and thriller, so rare for American television. Sheriff Lucas gave many viewers the will. We rooted for Caleb when he sought to resist Sheriff Lucas' overtures. We became obsessed and scared after learning about the unthinkable connection between these two characters. The weekly manipulations that caused fear of what Lucas would do were truly amazing. This show corresponded to the “gothic” nickname in ways that American entertainment so rarely took, and even less so mastered. The costumes definitely made a big mistake by not supporting this show. This show disgraces the current glut of "reality TV", which is so little that satisfies the view. The call for a DVD box set is well founded. This show is high-quality viewing for the demanding market, eager for high-quality viewing. An audience that is tired of being oversaturated with stunning reality will welcome this gem of real-life stories. Take along a DVD set!
