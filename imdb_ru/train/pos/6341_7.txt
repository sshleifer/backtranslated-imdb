Although I really liked the latest "serious" performances of Jim Carrey (The Truman Show, Man on the Moon), I always thought that his real genius was in a physical comedy. This is not to say that he is a fantastic, talented actor: these boobies at the Oscar award ceremony, it seems, do not like him very much, he never had (really deserved) nominations or awards. Well, any “institution” that assigns 11 Oscars to a bore, such as “Titanic,” should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> Continuing review. "The Grinch" is the sweetest, best-looking, best-in-action, more enjoyable seasonal film since the Nightmare Before Christmas Both films seem very similar, with their highly stylized scenery and the premise that someone steals Christmas. Both make their main actors seem villains (one more than the other), both get a strong moral lesson, and both are truly enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll, and Grinch is a man. But a man who is so incredibly expressive, so mobile in his movements, so caricature, so unreal, that he never interferes with the film. He can be fun, he can be a sad soul, he can get angry. He lives in a three-dimensional world where three-dimensional people live. He jokes, he laughs, he cries, and eventually he saves Christmas. I loved this movie in pieces, and I can’t wait for it to be released on DVD. This is one of those films that you really like in 10, 20 years. As always, how they come.
