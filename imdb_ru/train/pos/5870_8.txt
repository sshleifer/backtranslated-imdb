JACKNIFE is an excellent adaptation of Stephen Metcalf's play “Strange Snow” (the script was also written by Metcalf), carefully staged by David Hugh Jones, which explores the too often forgotten influence of the battle on veterans who have been constantly affected by the abominable cruelties of war. It is especially important to return to this film of 1989, when we watch the soldiers returning from the war in Iraq and the rough treatment they receive in our hospitals for veterans. <br /> <br /> Three friends went to Vietnam War together, and only two returned alive: the problem is that while both men suffered in battle, one of them, David Fnanigan, “High School” (Ed Harris) is so badly damaged by post-traumatic stress syndrome that he "exists" in a drunken vacuum with his very simple school teacher, sister Martha (Kathy Baker). When David deteriorates, his friend Joseph "Jacknif" Megessey (Robert De Niro) returns to the city, trying to help his friend. In the course of events, Jacknif first offers help to Martha, and finally two dates - at the graduation party, at which Martha must be present - and at this graduation party drunk David completely falls apart, destroying relics at school and terrorizing the citizens and students. Jacknif makes Dave survive the moment in Vietnam when they lost their boyfriend, and thus brings David to such an extent that he can begin his ascent to recovery. And the long-suffering Martha finds that her needs are also met by Jacknif. <br /> <br /> All three actors give amazingly good performances: Ed Harris offers one of his most fully realized roles, while De Niro and Baker maintain high standards. establish their careers. More people should help to resurrect this almost forgotten film, as it is a fragile reminder of the damage that our wars bring to those who fight with them, and families who receive them after the end of the battle. Highly recommended. Grady harp
