Yes, right. Sammo Hung was already starring in 1983 in "Zu Warrios from Magic Mountain." Now, 2001, he does it again with the “Warriors of Zu”. But this time, he is finally doing everything right. You rarely see him in Usia, more often in the classic eastern or criminal farce. But this role just fits him! The ancient Chinese legend of Mount Tsu is not often shown in films (as far as I know about films translated to the west). Although the legend contains a lot of interesting stories and opportunities. Directly said: you have not seen the story in a modern film! And it makes it so cool! And wow: all the colors, as well as an incredibly deep, insightful story will make you instantly fall in love with this movie. The first time I watched it, I had to watch it again immediately, and I did it. OK, really, I did not understand everything the first time. But it only makes him better! You know, you did not understand all this, because there are so many spices in it! Therefore, it is pleasant for one person to watch it again and again. And yes, it becomes deeper in your heart, the more you watch it. <br /> <br /> Summary: Favorite story, the characters with whom you cry, and indeed: a film that you will never forget! - Editor's note: well, I think I should watch this right now again: D
