"Mr. Harvey lights a candle" is based on a brilliant performance by Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> Although we can predict that his titular moody teacher will experience some kind of frustration or catharsis, based on some deep in the mysteries of his past, it is surprising how his emotions are revealed. The range of feelings transmitted by Spall is quite touching and more than he usually depicts in Mike Lee's repertoire. <br /> <br /> Although the expected boring school bus ride was used only for comic purposes, such as The Simpsons, this central situation of visiting Salisbury Cathedral as per the scenario of Reedian Brooke is well thought out and structured for dramatic purposes and almost formally divided into actions . <br /> <br /> We get acquainted with the city Britons from children of different racial and religious backgrounds (with their uniforms, I could not say whether this is a “private” or “public” school), how are they going ?? rap black children, serious South Asians and Muslims, white hooligans and vile girls ?? but transmitted quite naturally and individually. Young actors, some of whom I learned on British television, such as Shameless, were determined to present the usual range of high social pressure for young children. Celia Imri puts more warmth into her leadership role than the Martins she usually plays. <br /> <br /> A trip break leads to a transformation crisis, while others are still funny to forget. We think, as a teacher portrayed by Ben Miles from Clutch, that we will be fed with a spoon with a didactic lesson about religious tolerance, but this is much more about faith in people and also in God, therefore the BBC showed it in England Easter, and BBC America showed it in the US at Christmas. <br /> <br /> Natalie Press, who was also good at Summer of Love, plays a key role in Mr. Harvey’s atonement, which could have been played to preach about the movies of the week, but touchingly when they unexpectedly connect with each other ( Unfortunately, I saw their intense scene, interrupted by advertising). <br /> <br /> Although it is a bit fierce, several times defiantly calling this trip “pilgrimage”, this silent film was the best incarnation of “goodwill towards men” than I had seen in most television movies on holidays.
