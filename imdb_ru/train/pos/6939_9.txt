I was very impressed with this movie. I would rate it as one of the best westerns of the classical era. I say this as a whole: acting, mature dialogue, crazy history and excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Mann, who has shot several well-made films during the same era, also made several westerns such as this one. He has the same film noir. During this period Mann and Jimmy Stewart collaborated on several westerns. If you like this movie, I recommend Mann-Stewart's "Bend of the River." <br /> <br /> In short, the story of the man "Lyn McAdam" (Stuart), who owns this film. Winchester 73 prestigious rifle, a weapon that he won honestly and honestly in the competition. He is then stolen and transferred from villain to villain. All these villains are interesting characters. <br /> <br /> Helping Stewart play this interesting story, Shelley Winters, Dan Durya, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer, and J.C. Flippen. All of them are fun to watch. However, it was a bit stiff to see Rock Hudson playing an Indian ("Young Bull"), but you can't have everything.
