... in our house. Like everyone who commented on this film, my brothers (at the time 7 and 4 years old) and I (10) watched this film again and again. We all loved Star Wars, but we always came back to it because of the great songs and adventures. We all loved the camel and sang with him during his song. There are some slow moments (time spent with King Ku-Ku in his court), and we usually get bored after the song The Knight (“The reason I {sound effect} is that I love you” ), but we enjoyed the journey to save Babbett and the finale, and everyone was a little excited by the picture of King Ku-Ku, floating above the horizon, laughing manic at the end. I still still sing "Hooray for me! Babbet gay Paris!" around my friends (I'm 33 now) who just look at me, as if I was crazy; however, when I sing it, I am again 10 years old, recalling the wonderful year of Star Wars.
