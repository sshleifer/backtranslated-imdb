It was the most visually amazing, moving, amazing and incredible story I have ever experienced. Frankly, even these adjectives simply cannot describe it. I can't just pick one scene that stood out for me. I suppose if I had to list a few of them, it would have been the response of the fireman to the rumbling sound of jumping victims; the reaction of people trapped in an elevator, who did not know what was going on when they finally walk out onto the terrible scene; shock and disbelief onlookers; and finally silence. <br /> <br /> On that day, and even now, I recall Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says: “I felt a great anxiety in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in horror and suddenly fell silent.” It's amazing how so accurate in your description. There was indeed excitement in the Force. <br /> <br /> This documentary vividly reveals this excitement. Feelings are incredibly visual. Anger, frustration, shock, fear, exhaustion and awareness of its very magnitude. It is all there. Nothing is missing. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful and most touching documentary worthy of an Emmy. Not only because he documents 9/11, but also because this is just all that should be. <br /> <br /> If you plan to watch, be sure to take the box with napkins. You will need them. I know what I did.
