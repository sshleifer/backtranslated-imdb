Found this movie in the video store, it cost $ 2. The whole movie stinks really bad! The so-called colonel, who would be a hero here, if the cover could be trusted, he must be over eighty, and he can barely walk. Nevertheless, he manages to shoot some of the silliest ninjas in the world. Then the story leaves the colonel, which makes sense, given the old manâ€™s inability to do something worth mentioning, now two terrible looking eighties guys are taking part in it, which must have been some kind of story. I lost a hundred times, but did not mind, because the film is so bad, watching it is really fun. Zero rubbish budget with actors not deserving of this name. Go check it out!
