One of the most attractive elements of Gilliam’s film is that well-designed visual effects, disturbing backgrounds and insanely broken characters show the creator’s involvement. Instead of most films (where the director is some kind of director who is paid to show one or two stars), you can feel the presence of Terry Gilliam through this experience. "12 monkeys" - this is evidence of his own vision and style of Gilliam, in contrast to creating original films for their own sake. “12 Monkeys” is a variation on similar themes of Gilliam’s repertoire: repressive / recessive societies, the loneliness of the protagonist, disappointment associated with disbelief, and parallel spheres. In this film, Gilliam perfectly blurs the lines between the two spheres, using vagueness to make the audience believe, not find out. This tendency to neglect Gilliam to fill certain gaps leads to criticism of the pretentiousness of art house. The difference between Gilliam and the fanciful poseur is that Gilliam’s choice clearly has a purpose, and all of his images matter. Cole’s two almost identical bathing scenes are initially designed to make comparisons that leave viewers unresolved. His bald head is a sign of uniformity in a disease-affected world, but at the same time makes it recognizable in the 1996 world. The name itself is a sign of Gilliam's creativity, since it requires that most of the story be revealed so that its meaning is fully understood. In general, Gilliam's commitment to creating creative films that are fun to watch, but also requires thought and interpretation from the audience. The film is of great importance for re-viewing, because there are subtle details and hints that you can skip when you first view. Definitely one of my favorites.
