This is the second part of the Animatrix, a collection of animated short films that tell us a little more about the world of The Matrix. <br /> <br /> In this we learn how people and machines could not work, but live together. This is a small history lesson in the world of the Matrix. Not as good as in the first part (“The Last Flight of Osiris”), but still quite fascinating.
