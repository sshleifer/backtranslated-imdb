Young beauty Eve (Hedy Lamarr) marries an older man (Zvonimir Rogoz). Unfortunately, he cannot satisfy her sexually and ignores her. Disappointed she goes home and plans to divorce. Then, one day, she is thin, diving into a lake in the middle of a forest. Her horse rides with his clothes ... and she runs after her! She meets a young and very beautiful Adam (Ariberta Mog). They make love and she realizes that this is the man she wants. <br /> <br /> ENDING SPOILER !!!! Naturally, since it was done in 1933, she must be punished for her sin, which leads to a tragic end. END OF SPOILER COMPLETION !!!! <br /> <br /> This terrified people in 1933, but by today's standards it is rather tame. Lamarr's naked voyage shows nothing, and when she runs after a completely naked horse, it is either shown at the furthest far shot, or covered with branches and the like. There are only a few small shots of her breasts. In addition, when she has sex with Mog, nothing is visible except her face, but you see that she reaches orgasm. These scenes at one time were considered quite extreme and were completely cut from the American release. Now today they are back. This movie is now easily available with PG-13. <br /> <br /> In addition to the shock episodes, everything is in order. It is beautifully filmed and there is no dialogue around. With the exception of the musical score, it can be a quiet picture. Fortunately, all the actors are good - especially Lamarr and Mog, and they are so attractive that they just hold their breath while watching them. In addition, the sequence in which they make love is easily one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Scenes with sexual symbolism (there are a lot of them), unfortunately, today are pretty obvious. Actually, I started to giggle during one of them! <br /> <br /> So, excellent direction, beautiful images, attractive actors, good acting, but I wasnâ€™t amazed. I found the film slow (beautiful images do not create a picture for me), somewhat dull, obvious, static and with a negative ending. I can live with the finale, but this does not justify the other problems that I had with him. Also, the final sequence is REALLY strange - and inappropriate. Therefore, I admire this film more than anything else. It was well done, and I recommend it, but with caution. Many people like this movie, so I'm outnumbered. Use your own judgment.
