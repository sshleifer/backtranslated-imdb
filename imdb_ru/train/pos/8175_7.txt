Before we begin, I have a fear of dentists. This film makes me goosebumps and even makes me cringe. This is what I love about this movie. The film is pretty boring. For this, I take off 3 stars! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler alert * <br /> <br /> The film tells about Dr. Alan Feynston, who has just learned that his wife is cheating on him. Soon he begins to hallucinations, he begins to torment his patients, kills colleagues, and he even tortured his wife to death and killed the man with whom he had an affair. <br /> <br /> End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The film is very bloody and bloody. I would recommend it if you donâ€™t like it. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein is not your ordinary dentist for every day!
