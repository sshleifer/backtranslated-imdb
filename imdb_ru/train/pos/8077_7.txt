The film is made for a modern audience. The masses see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and, of course, sensual scenes. This is not exactly the film that could be comfortably watched by the whole family. This is not for the eyes of children. I had to rewind a few scenes forward. <br /> <br /> If you are only looking for entertainment, then this film has it all. The songs are catchy. I have to add that this is a magnificent production. <br /> <br /> However, the idea of ​​the film is not universal. This underlines the idea of ​​karma. That is, if you do good, you receive good. And if you do evil, you will get evil. The fruit of good deeds is good, and the fruit of evil is evil. <br /> <br /> In real life this is not always the case. It is well known that most people do not get justice in this world. Although it is true that some evil people face an evil end, many flee. And then, there are many people who do good, and yet in return they meet with a sad ending. <br /> <br /> If you don’t care about the message, all you need is an escape from worldly reality. This film is an artist, good.
