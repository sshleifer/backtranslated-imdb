GIRL FROM MISSURI arrives in New York, knowing exactly what she wants: to turn into something solid, marrying a millionaire - without losing her virginity. With her knockout good looks, she is quickly struck by a playboy, the son of a tycoon, but, remaining true to her virtue, will she also discover true love? <br /> <br /> Gene Harlow hisses in this beautiful little comedy. With her platinum hair and gorgeous accessories, she is gorgeous. But her beauty should not hide the fact that she was also a very good actress. She rightfully earned her place at the very top of the Hollywood pantheon. <br /> <br /> A wonderful cast gives excellent support to Harlow: Lionel Barrymore - a cunning old tycoon, wise on the way of Harlow; beautiful Franchot Ton as his son, struck with love; husky Patsy Kelly, stealing her scenes like Harlow's chum; Debonair Alan Mowbray, like a raised English lord; the elderly Clara Blandik as the angry secretary of Barrymore; hearty Hale Hamilton as a rich man with an eye on the ladies; muscular Nat Pendleton as a lifeguard who deftly looks at Kelly; and Lewis Stone, unforgettable in the small role of a bankrupt businessman. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this film was shot shortly after the Hollywood Production Code was put into effect. A comparison with RED-HEADED WOMAN, made two years earlier, would be fascinating, in which the character Harlow pursues the same goals, but uses very different means.
