Harvard Brown is one of the major hits of 1926 — an exciting comedy / drama featuring regattas and football scenes that gave William Haynes the role he needed to become a major star. He is fully patented by Haynes: a daring clever Alek, who doesn’t take anything serious until everything is rejected, comes up with and becomes a man / hero and defeats a girl. Nobody worked with this formula like Haynes. A terrific comic actor (Little Annie Rooney with Mary Pickford, The Show of People with Marion Davies), Haines can turn from a comedy into a tragedy with a change in facial expression. In this film, he is filled with joy because he was in Tell It to the Marines (with Lon Cheney) and West Point (with Joan Crawford), where he repeats the formula. Mary Bryan is good as a girl, Jack Pickford is very good as a sick roommate, rival Ralph Bushman. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrens, Guinn Williams and colleague Grady Sutton. This film is now known for its homoerotic relationship between Haines and Pickford and the fact that he debuted in the film John Wayne as a football player at Yale University (but I never noticed it). Haynes was the star of the top five box office, starting with this picture until 1932. It is a pity that he was largely forgotten and that most of his films seem to be lost. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.
