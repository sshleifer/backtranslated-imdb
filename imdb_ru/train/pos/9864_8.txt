I watched Ice Age in a movie theater, and I liked the movie. Despite the fact that the “Ice Age” has many flaws and scientific mistakes, such as people, sabers, dinosaurs and mammoths living in the same period, and even the place where the story goes (looks like North America, but has some characteristics from Iceland for example) we can have fun even in this case (if you are not very harsh!) <br /> <br /> The planet enters the ICE CENTURY, and many animals migrate to the south, where it is warmer. Sid is a stupid sloth left by his own family, who can no longer tolerate him. Going his own way, he meets Manfred or, as he calls "Manny," a naughty mammoth who does not care about extinction or immigration and goes north. Concerned that he was easy to catch, Sid decided to follow Manfred, and in the middle of the way they found a human mother with her child. The mother dies, but Manfred and Sid decide to take him and bring the child back to the people. Diego, one of the sabers, decides to follow and help them go to the shortcut to the man’s camp. What Manfred and Sid do not know is that Diego from the clan of sabers, who hates people and wants to kill a child, also pretends to betray them both to become saber food. What happens will depend on the behavior and conscience of Diego ... <br /> <br /> aka "A Era do Gelo" - Brazil
