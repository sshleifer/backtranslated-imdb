I watched this movie a couple of days ago in a small independent cinema in Paris. This was my last night in the French capital and the best farewell I could choose. These twenty episodes made me relive the impressions that I received in Paris, in a spiritual manner, not plunging into kitsch or sentimental Schmalz. Each episode is full of surprise, strong emotions and impressive pictures, and each short film is directed according to the rules of a good story. For me, this type of film requires much more talent and qualities of a director and screenwriter than any epic two-hour drama, and they all did an excellent job! The stories have been carefully selected for their relevance to the Area and perfectly reflect the corresponding talent. Each episode was shown from a different ankle, had a different theme, a different style, and yet twenty stories lead to a harmonious orchestra of films. The most outstanding advantage of the episodic concept, in my opinion, is that you can switch between a wide variety of feelings and moods without danger of overload, and vice versa: melange of sadness, longing Pure joy, despair, anger, anxiety, curiosity or passion give it film unique freshness and harmony. And do not forget the whole topic of love! Love between characters, love between characters and Paris, as well as the love of directors and actors / actresses to this project. I do not want to go into the details of the episodes, because there are so many of them, but I have to highlight the circle of world-famous actors and actresses from around the world and their approach to this project. Some played with their image, some broke it completely, and some interpreted stereotypes related to their homeland or the roles they had played before, so intertextuality was expressed throughout the entire film. In general, I can absolutely recommend this great collage and will look forward to its release on DVD.
