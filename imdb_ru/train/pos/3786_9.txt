Ying, a Chinese girl who speaks Czech, invited us to watch a Czech film (with English subtitles) in the visual and environmental studies department (VES). This was the first time I saw Samotarzhi (Loners, 2000), and it was pretty good. <br /> <br /> As in many other Czech films, the seven main characters seem to have a rather difficult, dirty life; The Internet shows that this theme was popular with American films in the early 1990s. Their relationship breaks up, unites and reunites. Another typical feature of Czech films is that none of the characters is universally negative, and none of them is a constantly positive character. In addition, you can see how the characters evaluate the characteristics of others depending on the context; This is a very realistic feature of the psychological analysis of the film. <br /> <br /> Ondřej is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters. However, you will find out that he only studied neuroscience to prove how much he loves another woman, Hank. He is so obsessed that he dresses as a plumber several times to get into the house of her parents, the house he constantly burns. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Khanka has a very mixed relationship with her parents. She just decides to throw a coin to part with Peter, who works at a private radio station. Khanka does not consider the bourgeois life of his parents as a good example, but it seems that she does not manage to create a more favorable environment. But she is a very flexible figure, as for the type of her guys. <br /> <br /> For a while, Khanka seems to have serious plans for Yakub, an innocent drug addict, whose memory seems rather devastated by drugs. However, friends from his group report to Yakubu that he already has another girlfriend. Khanka is disappointed and returns to his parents. <br /> <br /> When Khanka and Peter broke up, he was organized by Robert, a matchmaker, who also works at a travel agency, where his job is to show the life of an ordinary Czech. people for japanese tourists. Robert, who also supplies marijuana to Yakub, never says anything seriously and usually sleeps with many different women; in the end, his mother dies in the hospital, and he has his own ways to cope with depression. <br /> <br /> Spring (in Slavonic "Spring"), arrived in Prague from Macedonia, works as a bartender - and you won’t find out if she came to the Czech Republic to see her father or a UFO. She seems rather embarrassed, but sometimes helps other characters deal with their problems. <br /> <br /> Peter works at a radio station, and he is the only one who likes his job - a job that he eventually loses. He announces to his audience that he broke up with Hanka - this is how Ondřej learns about the news that makes him very happy. <br /> <br /> Finally, Ondřej Lenka’s wife is always ready to forgive him and stabilize their marriage — even after Ondřej asks the mage to make him disappear so that Ondřej again tries to capture Hanka. (The magician pays his debt because he is the brother of the victim of an important car accident — Jakub and Hanka take the victim to the hospital, and Ondřej saves his life.) Lenka also works in a travel agency — as an interpreter — and eventually she must translate some hysterical Scenes for about 20 Japanese tourists who shoot their films while they are dining at Hanki’s parents. <br /> <br /> Seven characters interact in an interesting and exciting way that it would be natural if Prague were less than four orders of magnitude Given the actual size of the Czech capital, it seems unlikely that all these events will take place among seven people, but this is fun .
