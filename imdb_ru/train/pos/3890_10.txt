This is a great DVD buffet! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I've seen in recent years. His routine is hilarious and makes for a great conversation with others who have seen it. I STRONGLY recommend this. The part about the history of Europe is a bit slow, but the final jokes in French are pretty good because you don't need to speak French to get it (although if you do, it's still fun) Besides, the parts are about being transvestite are pretty good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great, but funny for the first time. Skip those if you can. It is almost not worth watching. However, this is really a fun, fun show that everyone should see. "I was dead at the time!"
