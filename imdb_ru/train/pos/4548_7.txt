At that time, “My left foot” was a small film that could. He was very popular, and everyone applauded the fact that such a small, independent film could go all the way to Oscar. <br /> <br /> Since then, films like My Left Foot have been worth more than a dozen. so it can be difficult to look back to understand what was being said. This is, of course, a well-made and competent film, but it is clear that the bulk of its success lies on the shoulders of Daniel Day-Lewis, who plunges into the role of Christie Brown, a man living with cerebral palsy. Day-Lewis performs the same trick as Dustin Hoffman, who received an Oscar a year earlier for playing a man with autism in the film Rain Man, and the Academy followed his example, honoring Day-Lewis with the same honor. <Br /> <br /> The only thing that really separates this film from the big budget of a Hollywood production is only its budget. Otherwise, it is just as formal as any standard product. This does not mean that this is not a good film, but it is not a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Rating: A-
