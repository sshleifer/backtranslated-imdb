I grew up in the south of West Virginia; I am about the same age as (or maybe a year older) Homer Hikam, the author of The Rocket Boys, which is the basis of the true story of this spiritual film. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I am closely connected with the topic of coal mining in West Virginia and with the tremendous influence that Sputnik had at that time (October 4, 1957) on all of us. Rocket Boys continued to make big lives for themselves. I received a diploma in physics and computer engineering. And all because Sputnik woke many young people in the “Scientific Gap” that the USA had in the USA at the time of the Cold War ... <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful film for all, of all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950s, it will affect the essence of your being. <br /> <br /> All: get it; watch it; recommend it to your friends ... who will thank you many times.
