The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is divided by gender. Things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on the screen for some strange reason. Do they really think that the public will be too stupid to understand if they are not shown everything wrong? In addition, it is of very good quality. All the actors do amazing work, bringing their characters to life. Shallow women are worth watching, if only because Toby Stevens as Gilbert is the sexiest thing in the world. If I were Helen, I would easily forget that I would be married as soon as I saw him ... <br /> <br /> Like a spoiler - the final scene is a fun change of what happened in the book.
