I found this film by mistake many years ago and was surprised (so far) why he had not received due recognition. Well written, beautiful game, one ironic twist after another, and that the vile characters are trying to make is THING. I would not recommend this film to people with short intervals of attention; it requires sufficient intelligence to understand that there may be a core of truth in this story.
