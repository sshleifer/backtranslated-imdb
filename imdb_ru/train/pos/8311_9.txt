I really liked this film, it was good, and the actors were great! Leon Robinson, who played Richard and many other classical singers, does an excellent job with his work, when you see him in a musical film, you know that it will be good! I would advise people to watch this warm, sad and special movie if they want to learn more about Richard! Fine! Fresh!
