This film struck me as a project in which there were a lot of right ingredients, but somewhere along the way they didn’t quite fit. I don't know who did it, but it has a little Disney feeling. Although some of its parts are unlikely (for example, when a teenage child is running for public office) and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously, there is a healthy dose of normality (whatever that is) to keep things balanced and in perspective. The game is fine. Strange, but the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a bit ... broken. It is interesting to see how she has to work hard to maintain a balance between her best friend, grandmother and her two passions: ballet and baseball. Being a baseball player, it was pretty painful to watch Frankie try to keep herself in the boys team, but it shows well what kind of struggle she faces. I read somewhere that she is not really a dancer, but editing in this film very well helped to make her dance not only natural, but also beautiful. Overall, it was a good film about honesty and ambition, but his star Misha Barton didn’t quite reach the level of realism that we saw during her performances in Lawn Dogs, Lost and Delirious, and her small but shocking performance. Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense.
