This review is almost 30 years late. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that I accidentally saw a copy of this film at the beginning of 2008 and watched it several times four months in a row! I just had to write about it! I was amazed and forgot that something else existed when I saw this movie. How strange it is to see the ugliest hero of Literature depicted by the most beautiful man! but what a welcome irony! It suited me perfectly and more than that, because Timothy Dalton fully justified his role. He showed a startling and triumphant performance! I have never seen anything like it! All other actors are also very good. The whole movie was made beautifully. I don't care what anybody says about this movie. I just love it and love it! It made me happy and contented. I'm a little upset to say this, but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 P & J from A & E, which I think is the best mini-series. <br /> <br /> Excerpts from Jane Eyre scared me a little at school. I never bothered to read a book, knowing the storyline seriously. Seeing this particular production, this story came to life for me and brought me almost to insanity. The scenes and the voice of Mr. Dalton pursued me endlessly and finally made me seriously read the book, which, of course, is a masterpiece. Bravo to the whole team and especially to Mr. Dalton !! This film is now part of me. <br /> <br /> I rate it at 10/10.
