This film is about the legendary Dick Bill Hikok. He, Buffalo Bill Cody and Calamity Jane, are the protagonists. <br /> <br /> At the end of the civil war, Lincoln mentions his concern that the dynamism in the country will increase if people follow the advice: “Go west.” a young man - who, fortunately, the film is not mistakenly attributed to Horace Greeley, as many others have done. But then they kill him, and some financiers assume that they can get rich by selling weapons to the American Indians. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, we see the Wild Bill Hickok, who communicates with a little boy while the Steamer is loading at the dock along the Mississippi. Wild Bill uses the Bowie knife, which he eventually gives the boy, calling him an Arkansas toothpick, which was actually a different type of knife, although both were used everywhere. <br /> <br /> Hickock eventually encounters Buffalo Bill Cody, who looks close to photographs and paintings of a real man. Cody had just gotten married and brought his bride to the Old West to settle. <br /> <br /> When they arrive at their destination, they run into Calamity Jane, who is in love with Hicock. She looks at Cody's wife and asks Buffalo Bill: "Is this your mop?" The line was the one that caused the Hayes Board some trouble, since one definition of “mopsy” was a prostitute. DeMille wanted the line to be, and one of his assistants pointed out that in the Beatrix Potter books on Peter Rabbit three rabbits were Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail. He pointed this out and asked the censors to identify a “bad behavior rabbit”. It worked; line remained. <br /> <br /> The Indians became restless, in part because of the superior weapons they received from the agent of the eastern financiers. Cody and Hikoka were asked to assist in the reconnaissance of the area so that the troops could safely reach the besieged area. Cody led the troops; Hicock went to check on the activities of the leader of the Indians, who was an old acquaintance and led some hostile Indians. <br /> <br /> Disaster Jane is captured, and Hickok is captured, trying to save her. They are delivered to the chief, and although none of them speak, the torture applied to Hikoku destroys Calamity Jane's willpower, and she tells which route Cody uses. <br /> <br /> They are both released, and Hicock joins Cody and his forces, partly to warn them that they are going into a trap. With the help of Hicca, they hold back the attack of the Indians. <br /> <br /> Hickok decides to go for the weapon and finally takes them prisoner. While they are waiting for authorities, Hicoc is shot in the back while playing cards. <br /> <br /> The film has many historical anomalies, but it retains the flavor of a legend. Pretty good for the 1930s.
