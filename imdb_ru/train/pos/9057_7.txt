Let's be simple: my two children were glued to this film. It has its drawbacks from the adult, but buy some jelly worms and just enjoy it. <br /> <br /> And the girl with Pepsi was gorgeous! <br /> <br /> And Kimberly Williams was pretty damn hot, although there isn't much of it in the film, so don't worry too much. <br /> <br /> It's not really that bad, but it's a movie that you only watch once. Do not buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> <br /> Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (It was for dads.)
