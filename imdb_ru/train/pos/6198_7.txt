I'm one of those people who would have walked a mile through broken glass to see Hal Hartley's movie. From TRUST and IRIS to HENRY FOOL and (my beloved Hartley) NO, SUCH's unique film brand is an acquired taste. Combining equal parts of mystery / espionage with subtle comedy seems to be his strong point. Comedy is not necessarily in your face, and often goes through the whole scene before its realization. And this is the case with FAY GRIM, a continuation of Henry the Fool. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey plays the role of Fay Grim, the abandoned wife of Henry the Fool and the mother of Henry Ned's only son. Fay lives a quiet life until one day comes home to find a CIA agent in her kitchen. His name is Fulbright (Jeff Goldblum, MAN OF THE YEAR), and he wants Henry notebooks. There are many notebooks of Henry the Fool, and earlier it was believed that there was nothing in them except crazy wanderings. Apparently, there is much more for them. Secrets of researching weapons or the way to terrorists? Who knows, except Henry. Agent Fulbright tells Fay that her husband is dead, but it quickly becomes a ploy to get Fay from her home and look for Henry (and it works ... but not in the way they think). <br /> <br /> Faye fights with a variety of spy rings to collect Henry's notebooks and find him. She also makes a deal with the CIA to get her brother Simon (James Urbaniak) out of prison (he helped Henry escape from the country in the original Henry the Fool film). Several quick events occur sequentially: spy rings shoot at each other. before Henry died, he discovered that the jihadist is safe, Fei frees his brother, but unconsciously risks his son's life, and the CIA gets his advantage to put Fei in danger. <br /> <br /> Hal Hartley obviously, Halley likes to play with themes. And he does it to the extreme here. Even the names of the characters (Grim, Fool, Fulbright, Fogg) have their own implicit meanings, which are quite funny. Supernatural spy movies about old films are also given a lot of time on the screen, as the weapon shoots in episodes with a stop in motion, never hitting our heroine, even if it is right in the firing line. <br /> <br /> Now that I have highly appreciated this creation, I will say that the excessive image of Fay Grim Parker Posey is not the best part of the film, and this is a shame considering how long it is on the screen. I understand that this was probably what Mr. Hartley wanted: an imperturbable woman with gestures on Italian extreme. But sometimes it was painful to watch. <br /> <br /> However, fans will probably devour Fay Grim and will ask for more. Although it was not my favorite film of Hal Hartley, I know that I am ready.
