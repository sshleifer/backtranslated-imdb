If you are a fan of the film noir and think that they do not do them as they did before, here is your answer - they simply no longer do them in Hollywood. We must turn to the French to remember how satisfactory, subtle and stunning a well-made film of this genre can be. “Reading My Lips” is a surprisingly unpleasant little gift to believers from director Jacques Audiard, showing sharp stories and beautiful performances by Emmanuel Devos and Vincent Cassel. <br /> <br /> The main plot could have been written in the 40s: a stupid but attractive ex-cheater and a smart, but silly femme fatale (who turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious) get to know each other, living in gloomy despair and longing, manipulating each other friend to achieve their own goals, develop complex relationships love / hate, prepare a criminal scheme involving robbery, double crosses, close calls and a lot of money. All actions occur in depressed, battered and / or poorly lit areas. <br /> <br /> The audiard, of course, fashioned several modern highlights. The femme fatale is an underestimated office worker who turns out to be almost deaf and uses her lip-reading ability to take revenge on those who isolate her. And where you might expect paired love scenes, you find that both characters are sexually awkward and immature. Add some modern technology and music, and it will be like a modern film, but make no mistake - this is an old school film. It's as good as any movie from the genre and easily one of the best films I've seen all year.
