I originally saw this film many years ago during Cinemax Friday after the dark series (even when the cable box was built as a keyboard), and it intrigued me. Despite the fact that the film has a meaningless aspect, it is well played. The performances of Depardieu & Dewaere are very pleasant. They have good chemistry together, and Miu-Miu makes pink fur look amazing. to be done in these politically correct times (at least not in the US), as it seems to do sensational things, such as violence, robbery and casual sex. This film proves that with a talented actor and also a talented director of a good movie is a good movie, regardless of the subject. I am saddened to learn that Patrick Dewer committed suicide, and in the near future I will check him with Depardieu and Miou. -My's get out your hankerchief.
