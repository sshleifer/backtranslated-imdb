So when I was little, I received this film as a gift, and my sister and I loved it. we would watch it all the time. when our friends came, we had overnight parties, and we watched great mountain sweets and grandfather’s magical toys. I am 21 now, and I still love this film, some old friends, and I recently got together and watched it, we knew all the songs, and we danced and talked about how much we hated Profster when we were little. One friend bought this film and grandfather’s magic toys for her two-year-old daughter, because she wants to convey our love for this film. This is really a film that you can let your children watch and feel safe, without violence, without a bad language, just a lot of great songs and important lessons.
