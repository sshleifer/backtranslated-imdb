Too long, but convincing retelling of friendship between civil rights leader Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the film is the strongest, where we see the connection between the two men and how they help each other, but the second half is not so strong due to the elimination of Biko's character. Nevertheless, this is a wonderful film with great performances by Klein and Washington, in a film that puts the latter on the map. Washington was also nominated for the best male supporting role for the first time. In general, a well-made film that could be trimmed down a bit. 7/10 .____________________________________
