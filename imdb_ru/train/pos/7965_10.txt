This movie was awesome ... he made me laugh, he screamed, and most of all there were talking animals in it !! This film should watch all kinds of people! This is one of my favorite movies, and I just adore it so much that I just need to comment on this !!! Rocks! it is so felt in the heart and a wonderful storyline that makes up an excellent and soulful movie! My favorite character is a shadow. This is because I think that he is the most interesting and charming. I used to have a golden retriever, like a shadow, I miss it so much !!! he was my best friend, and I knew that when he died he would be in a happier place, but I miss him with all my heart !! This film is the best, I love it, and everyone should! Love your pets, whatever they do, take care of them forever !!!
