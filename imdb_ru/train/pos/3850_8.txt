This is the last Dutch film, shot by Paul Verhoeven before being shot in the main Hollywood films "Basic Instinct", "Robocop" and "Total Memory." He sets the scene, revealing this story with a black widow spider catching prey in her web before we meet Gerard Reeve, an annoying self-centered writer with a painful imagination. Gerard was invited to speak as a guest speaker at a meeting of the Literary Club in the seaside town about an hour from Amsterdam. Verhoeven allows us to see how Gerard's imagination distorts reality. When asked if writers are close to insanity, he confesses when he reads a newspaper, ”and he says:“ boom, ”I read“ doom ”, when he says“ flood ”, I read“ blood ”, when he says“ red ” I see "dead." "When he tells a story enough times, he begins to believe it; "I lie the truth." He accepts the offer to be the night guest of the Treasurer of the Club, the beautiful rich salon owner. When he recognizes her and finds out that her husband is dead, he begins to think that she is a “black widow”. Is it more a perversion of reality or is she a murderer? This is a psychological drama, and, telling which of these old films I remember, I realized that this is my favorite gender. Looking at his work, it seems that this is also the work of Paul Verhoeven, and he is a master, forcing us to doubt our own understanding of reality. This is a good change of pace from the usual Hollywood fare. I saw it in 1983, and this film was "stuck."
