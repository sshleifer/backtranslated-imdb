“Liberation” is one of the best films about exploitation that have appeared in this remarkable decade of the 1970s, from which so many other films about exploitation have appeared. <br /> <br /> A group of friends embarks on a canoe trip down the river to the south, and they become victims of a group of toothless mounds that are largely trying to ruin their lives. This is amazing. <br /> <br /> We are treated with anal rape, brutal beatings, archery and killing, shooting, bone fractures, etc. In many ways it is similar to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre of 1974, if we say that “Liberation” this would probably be immature. It will never be and cannot be, even in the dark times of 1972. <br /> <br /> “Liberation” is a very exciting journey, filled with action. This is one of a huge amount of exploitation films that appeared in the early 70s, and he (possibly) is on top of this pile with a great game, excellent cinematography and excellent writing. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, Children.
