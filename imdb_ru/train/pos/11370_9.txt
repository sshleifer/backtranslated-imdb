Spoilers - as far as I describe the characters and their relationship to the plot. <br /> <br /> This is a quality movie. The topic is immediately grim and exciting. The stubborn determination of the character of Stephen Rea, Burakova, simply fascinates. Because of any apologies to him, his lust, a constantly worn expression, serves the character well. He, as we would say in England, about the character of the series “Inspector Taggart”, must be grim, because he sees three murders a week. Well, this is not entirely accurate, since Chikatila acted for several years ... <br /> <br /> You get a real idea of ​​the resistance of the bureaucracy in the USSR, brilliantly depicted by Joss Ackland (which often seems to be created for such a role ). <br /> <br /> The key character (and I am writing this because the BBC1 shows a remake of the film The Invasion of the Body Thieves) is the character of Donald Sutherland “Mikhail Fetisov”. His quiet support of Burakov is unshakable. And it experiences through Perestroika, and stimulates the FBI's involvement in profiling. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, this is a must-see.
