David Lynch usually makes films that resemble puzzles that are incorrectly compiled. They are interesting to watch and think, but in fact they are not remembered. Perhaps art will always mean the most to its creator. <br /> <br /> “Straight Story” is not a typical David Lynch film. In any case, there is nothing typical in them. This is an odyssey in rural America. In real life, Alvin Straight picked up a lawnmower to get to his brothers home. He drove 300 miles from Lawrence, Iowa to the mountain. Zion, Wisconsin, to correct the situation of his sick brother for past insults. <br /> <br /> This film is based on the sweet voice of Richard Farnsworth. He leads Alvin Street straight to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film is slow, corresponds to the slow path of Alvin to the realization. <br /> <br /> On the way, Alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl. She is pregnant and decided to escape from her position. After hearing Alvin talk about the family, she reconsiders. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin sees a distraught woman killing a deer in his car. She complains that she killed a few and leaves. Alvin feels bad, but smart enough to cook some expensive meat that night. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin’s lawn mower loses its brakes and nearly kills it. The good man and his wife allowed him to remain in their yard while he repaired him. They even allowed him to name his lovely, but slow daughter, who is beautifully played by Sissy Spacek, whose terrible tragedy is haunted by her own past. Alvin insists on paying the call. The man even takes Alvin with pleasure to his brothers. Alvin gratefully refuses. <br /> <br /> While Alvin waits, he goes to a bar with a kind old man, discussing the severity of the war and the price she assumed. Alvin even acknowledges the fatal mistake he made as a sniper who pursued him forever. <br /> <br /> Alvin also meets two quarreling brothers who repaired his lawn mower. He wisely lowers their price, calling them the high cost of labor and repairs. He even helps them appreciate each other, learning from their mistakes with their brother. <br /> <br /> On the night before Alvin leaves the man’s yard, he takes off his hat. The man tells him that it is a great honor that he stayed and asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in its simplicity. This is spiritual, because it is so straightforward, so real. <br /> <br /> The journey continues, and we cannot but get carried away with it. We want Alvin to get to his brothers. We want him to improve. We want to know that this world is full of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> It was Richard Farnsworth at his best. It was his last film, and his performance was amazing. You can not understand his pride, listen to his wisdom and ultimately feel his pain. With him it becomes the same as with the man who invites him to stay in the backyard. <br /> <br /> If there is justice in the afterlife, then Alvin Straight, his brother, and Richard Farnsworth sit at the bar. I can imagine how they discuss their lives, regrets, hopes and joys. As Alvin says in the film: “My brother and I are used to looking at the stars.” Well, I know that they are all with the best view in the house.
