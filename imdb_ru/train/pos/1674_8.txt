Lisa Baumer (Ida Galli) is the husband of adultery of a major businessman who inherited $ 1 million in life insurance when her husband died in a plane crash during a business trip. Initially, she is suspected of having recently taken responsibility for her husbands. changed, and so she has insurance investigator Peter Lynch (George Hilton) and an Interpol agent on the tail, to be sure. Baumer travels to Athens, Greece, to capitalize on his inheritance, but insists on getting it in cash ... a dangerous turn of events. Lynch, whose identity is now known to Baumer, is trying to protect her from the lover of her husband Lara Florakis, who, however, along with her minion Sharif is trying to kill them both for the fraction of the money for which she believes she is entitled. And it is here that our masked killer begins his brutal murders. Lynch, as is customary with our hero, is first suspected by the Greek police and warned that the police inspector Stavros must not leave Athens (Luigi Pistilli, a familiar face in Jallo and Spaghetti). Then Lynch is assisted by the magnificent Cleo Dupont (Anita Strindberg), a local journalist who helps him investigate the killings. To say that it can spoil the film more for those who have not seen it, so suffice it to say that there is enough red herring and most of them are plausible for Mystery / Thriller fans to be satisfied with this Giallo-based story. DVD No Shame has an excellent program with English and Italian soundtracks. Bruno Nicholas has a very good catchy score that will remain in your head for a while ... well, great Giallo.
