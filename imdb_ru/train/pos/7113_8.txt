This film, created in the suburbs of Philadelphia and extremely passionate about local history, gives a wonderful vintage look at Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are scenes in the city center, a railway station that no longer exists, a 30th street station - which still exists, as well as scenes from the north-eastern part of the city. Good pictures of old houses, as they appeared then. From time to time, the film becomes a bit "talkative", which leads to the viewer losing interest for a short time ... but the overall storyline is solid and very touching. Anyone who likes this film should also try to see the Bright Victory film, also with local shots from the Forge Valley Forges Army Hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania - and scenes from downtown Phoenixville. The Army Hospital has since become a campus. None of these films come out in any format, and I can not imagine why. I have both on VHS from my home recording, as shown on TCM in recent years. I highly recommend them to all history buffs from my area!
