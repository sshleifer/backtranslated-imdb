With this theme it is so easy to take cheap pictures. You know, a guy with hairy legs is trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Adrian Pasdar does an excellent job of turning Gerald into a REAL person, a person you deeply care about, and as a result you feel his plight trying to live like Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but like Geraldine, he looks HOT! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is electric. These are two characters who love each other, and this shows up even when they just look at each other at the breakfast table. Even the potentially stupid corporate acquisitions storyline is believable, and at the end you are cheering yourself on! At least I did!
