This is unlike any other film with which I can compare it, this is the Woody Allen movie ... But where, when Woody Allen constantly comprehends human weaknesses, Bret Carr seems to be trying to find a way to deal with this one dangerous insecurity that tends define us for better or worse. In the case of Lou, this is the main cause of his stuttering, which can be traced to the unusual trauma of the children's hood, which is manifested through flares on his back. <br /> <br /> There are so many strange neurotics in the world. The world and I believe that they all deserve a chance for redemption, although the diversity of human character ultimately makes the world such an intriguing place, so perhaps we should not correct our neurosis more than we should correct our noses or breasts. /> <br /> This is an indie film shot on a long cord, but the production value is huge, as is the volume of the film. I feel that this is a fancy Gem for the self-help market. I really look forward to seeing what this filmmaker does next, I could imagine a career in the spirit of Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, although usually, when such a guy breaks through, he leaves and does the X MEN and his humble fancy thing. The origin is soon forgotten, or they .... X Men - a bunch of freaks, if I remember correctly :)
