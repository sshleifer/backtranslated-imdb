Let's face it; Nancy Drew has never been a great literature. He is in the same category as the Nanny Club, the magic tree house, goosebumps, ABC Mysteries. In fact, it was one of the original formulas of the story. Nancy is beautiful, good, thoughtful, "sweet", has no internal conflicts! and never changes. Ned is almost the same. The film matched this style, and I must say that I liked it. It will never be a great movie, but it has the same nostalgic flavor as the books. It was just what I needed for my children (8 and 10). There were almost no offensive words. I liked the desire for a more conservative dress. <br /> <br /> Corky was a little annoyed. He was a little out of place on campus. I never understood why he was there at all.
