This film was released that year when I was born, and I, like me, will turn 70 in 2007. I watched it again last night, as I have not seen it since high school. While it was full of the moods of the 30s, and the action was a bit stereotypical, however, it was excellent. History Pearl S. Buck came to life thanks to the magic of chemistry of Louise Rainer and Paul Mooney. The novel, which won the Miss Nobel Prize for literature, comes to life under the direction of Sydney Franklin, who, along with an excellent script, tells the story of a peasant farmer Van Lung, whose father receives for him a bride, a slave from the kitchen of a local landlord. In Buck's story, Vanâ€™s success is due to his willingness to listen to his wife most of the time and his love for the land. In the end, he comes to understand that his wife, like the earth, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. In the stories of Buck, strong women have always found themselves in a critical place to influence the outcome of events in the prefeminist world. German Louise Reiner, who lives in Germany, brings to the image in the image of Olan an indecisive but decisive Chinese woman. Muni also captures the naive but noble Wang, who eventually finds himself between the two worlds of the rich and the peasant. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapevin, Dorothy Gale, Kansan, Uncle Henry from The Wizard of Oz, Walter Connelly - meowing, cunning uncle, and Kay Luke - number one son, but this time not Charlie Chan. <br />> Classics can be defined as a film that you can watch again and again and never get tired. If this is true, then this film is without a doubt a classic one.
