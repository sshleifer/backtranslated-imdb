A magnificent drama that covers all areas, except for a script that was too slow and should have shown more appropriate scenes, such as Pittâ€™s character interviewing the president, or killing Pitt instead of just describing it to us. Scenes like these would make the viewers stay awake. Cutting off some useless minutes could make more room for more heartbreaking scenes like these. Dragging the film has kept this film of the greatest grandeur of all time, although seeing Pitt here is worth it to watch the movie. Also, big fans of fisting early to the styles of the 20th century and Montana will also like it ........
