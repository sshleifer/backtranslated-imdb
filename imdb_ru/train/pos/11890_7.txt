This is a pretty boring movie. A good shot with realistic performances, especially very good from Depardieu as a bully and bad guy with realistic mood locations and art house connotations all over the world, he fails because the director does not take a position, position or critical comments on the topic establishes. One of the respected and regular working partners of France in films with Depardieu - I believe that they did 7 together - Pialat is not able to participate. It seems to be a treatise on why women fall in love with a bad guy who will be hurt when they have a ready caring guy and a kind-hearted husband. Isabelle Hoopert, who plays philander with a casual difference, offers rash answers like “I don't know”; "I like his hands"; “I like the way he makes love” with her asking husband, who is trying to drive her out of the house, but softens and revises because ... I guess he loves her. So he accepts and hopes for what? That she will wake up one day and come to her senses. Such things are not answered in the indulgent style of Piala’s documentary drama with long speeches and even longer scenes that do not add up. I know the answers don't add up, but please stand up. Jules and Jim, it is not. The last cold film we have just watched is a heartache and headache only for the most forgiving.
