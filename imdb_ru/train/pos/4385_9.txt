What can you say about the film, in which there is one of the blackest, most nihilistic, and sometimes the strangest - I will not say “sympathizers” ... Fairbanks were in bloom? This is an epic about stubborn, sometimes stupid, incredibly courageous and honest man to fight for his honor and freedom against tyranny. I like it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were great villains. Jessica Lange was very touching, tender and sensual.
