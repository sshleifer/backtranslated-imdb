In this documentary film about Schlokmeister William Castle, some cheap snapshots are made in the naive setting of the 50s and 60s, in which he performed his most characteristic work - take a look at funny, stupid people with ghost glasses - but he is also affectionate and live with a particularly vivid comment from John Waters, who was an absolutely target audience for such things at the time, and from Castle's daughter, who adored her father and was also quite insightful about how he led his craft. (We will never know what happened to other descendants of Castle.) The films were not very good, that was clear, but their marketing was brilliant, and he seemed to be a sweet, hard-working family man. Funny people keep appearing like Dianne Baker from Straight Jacket, which looks great, and Ann Helm, whom she replaced at the instigation of the star Joan Crawford. Darryl Hickman almost giggles at the happy memories of working with Castle on Tingler, and there is enough material to give us an idea of ​​the level of Castle's talent — not very high, but very energetic. A nice look at a time when it was easier for the audience to rejoice, and this makes you feel nostalgic for more simple films.
