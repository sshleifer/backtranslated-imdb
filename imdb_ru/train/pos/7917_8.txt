After reading other warm reviews and comments, I felt that I should have come to the battle for this film. <br /> <br /> Roag's films, as a rule, have little in common with each other, and expected that this one would be like one of the ones that you liked, probably not intended. <br /> <br /> This film is a thoughtful and shameless look at religious faith. The only other film similar to this — in terms of its religious message — was to be Tolkien's Delight. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that someone might say that the story is confusing or supernatural. This is a simple film about the Catholic faith, miracles and atonement - although you never guess until the end. It is also the only film that I can remember, whose resolution literally turns into a pun. <br /> <br /> As a (happily) fallen Catholic, I know what the film is about, and I find a kind of tenderness in its absolute innocence about the relationship between God and man. But if you are not familiar with the theology on which the film is based, then it will go to your mind. <br /> <br /> Like a film, not like the story “Cold Sky” is not innovative. While “The Rapture” is difficult with artistic significance and cinematic images, “Cold Sky” understates its cinematic qualities. There are no bright pictures, no sharp effects, no attempts to tailor the content to the form. This is professional shooting, but muffled. Nor does it have dialogue or action to put it in a class of high drama. This is a simple story that unfolds simply. This may seem strange; but at the end the secret is revealed. It looks ambiguous; but with one line, the ambiguity disappears in a fit of Catholic dogma. <br /> <br /> In this respect, “Cold Sky” is based on the same thing that drives a film, such as “The Sting, or“ The Sixth Sense, ”or“ Final Descent, ”or“ Pure Formality, ”Polanski. These are all movies with a trick. They may upset you on this path, but they have a point - really obvious - but the most interesting, at least in part, is that you were accepted. <br /> <br /> However, even if it seems a little more than the story of a shaggy dog ​​with a twist, it’s worth seeing how it guides and misinforms you. Try it, especially if you are a Catholic or have ever been.
