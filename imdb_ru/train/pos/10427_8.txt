Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are two strangers on a European train. They are both from different backgrounds, he is American, and she is French, after they talked a little on the train, Jessie manages to get Celine to get out of the train and explore Vienna with him. For the next few hours, they roam through Vienna, accepting all that the city has to offer, and are madly addicted to each other. But will this newfound relationship last dawn. <br /> <br /> This wonderful romantic comedy is a breath of fresh air for a genre that is in decline. Written and directed by Richard (Dazed and Embarrassed) Linklater, "Before Dawn" never gets bored because of his' small throw. In fact, he is thriving thanks to the leading roles that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between them. Smart dialogue makes it a must for lovers of romance.
