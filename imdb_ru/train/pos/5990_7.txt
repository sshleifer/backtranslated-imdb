I have nothing to add to what was said earlier, but this is largely a film of its time and the first (and probably the only) time when the studio completely hung the film on Dead End Kids. <Br /> <br /> The Warner's were of great help to the boys, from director Ray Enright and budget A, to the almost magical cast of actors. At every turn, we get one of those precious ideas from real professionals. There are too many of them to list, but it seems that almost everyone on the Warner game (without the biggest stars) passes through this picture. (See if you can see John Ridgeley). <br /> <br /> The only advantage is always the reliable Eduardo Chanelle, the Mafia boss with the Messianic complex. He plays this character in almost the same way as the leader of the Bandits in Gung Dean. He has something to see! And Marjorie Maine is gorgeous and gets the best part since Dead End. <br /> <br /> My bet on this film is the second feature for double counting with something like “City for Conquest”. <br /> <br /> Cheers for the Warners!
