I believe that this is the most powerful film shot by HBO Pictures to date. This film was to be released in cinemas to the general public for viewing on the big screen. This is available on video, so make sure you search for it and check it out. Chris Gerolmo did an excellent job with directing and writing. The performances of Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffrey Demanna are impeccable. A masterpiece of the genre.
