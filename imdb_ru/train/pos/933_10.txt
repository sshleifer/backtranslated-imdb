I saw this film in sixth grade on Christmas, and I was very excited to see it, and when I heard that George S. Scott was in it, I was very excited because I really love George S. Scott! When my class and I watched this film, I really got carried away with it, and when it ended, I was very impressed, I thought it was absolutely unbelievable! This is the best version of the classic novel by Charles Dickens, which I have seen so far! The performance of George Scott as Scrooge is something else, I thought he was the perfect choice, he was Scrooge, he was the final Scrooge! I saw two different versions of “The Christmas Carol”, the other with Patrick Stewart, but she is better! <br /> <br /> What's really great about it is acting, I thought the actors were great, everyone was spirits, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratch, everything, they couldn't find anyone better than the ones they did parts! But the best part of the movie was George Scott! When I saw him, I thought that he was the best! He is the final Ebenezer Scrooge, I do not think they could find someone better! I don't think they could find someone better to replace someone in the film! <br /> <br /> This film is probably the final adaptation of the classic film of Charles Dickens, and I really think you will agree, you will think that this film is incredible! I'm probably going to buy this movie on DVD, because I thought it was absolutely unbelievable! I fully recommend you watch this masterpiece! This is the best version of the Christmas song, period. <br /> <br /> 10/10
