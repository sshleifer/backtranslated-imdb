What is French in this film is the time it takes to establish the two main characters. This may require a little patience, especially since none is “attractive” in the typical Hollywood definition of such. However, as soon as the “robbery” begins, the film quickly moves forward, perhaps, sometimes too quickly. But this is a real ride on a roller coaster, and if you do not look closely, then it is quite likely. The kind of movie you know Hollywood would have spoiled.
