The last of the blond bombs is an interesting piece of fluff. Judi Dench plays Elizabeth, the newly widowed woman in freedom. She spent most of her life being an obedient wife and mother, but was never truly happy. <br /> <br /> Soon after her husband’s funeral, Elizabeth regularly meets with her stick in the mud for children when she sees a street performer. This brings back memories of when she was a member of a swing band in London during World War II. We soon find out that the band was not exactly a girl, as the drummer was a man dressing like a woman in the style of Some Like It Hot. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth pulls out a saxophone (which she secretly practiced throughout her marriage) and joins forces with a street musician playing the guitar. Elizabeth is much more talented than a guitar player, and the money begins to flow. She does not take money because she is rich and does not need them. Her game is intended solely for artistic performance. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth once saw Patrick (Jan Holm), who was the group’s drag and drop drummer. It seems that Patrick was - and still is - a very feminine man, and Elizabeth - then she was only fifteen - was the only member of the group who did not experience Patrick’s "talents" except to play drums. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to re-gather an old group to play for her granddaughter's school dance. So begins a delightful journey through the memory lane, combined with aspects of a humorous film about road travel - all this ends with really good swings and blues. <br /> <br /> I think that at that age, in which I really enjoy, older actresses are doing their job, and this film is a treasure trove, since not only Judi Dench stars are shot in it, but it is also supported than Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron and many experienced British actresses. All this culminates in the extraordinary voice of Cleo Lane. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is fluff, but absolutely delicious and extremely interesting fluff.
