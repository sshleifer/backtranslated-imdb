I waited a few years before this film finally came out in England, but in many ways I was very happy when I finally saw it. In the film, many wonderful things to start acting. This is not what I need so much in a horror picture, but the people in this film are doing everything well. This constantly exciting and interesting screenplay, with Lovecraft's good love feeling, gives the film a real foundation. Add to this a dose of surreal nightmares and terrible bleeding, as well as films of the winner. I also have my favorite kind of blood, supernatural and splashing. In addition, the characters of Marcus, an angry bodybuilding and Daisy transsexual, his mentally retarded lover / toys are sometimes truly bizarre and unnerving, and give a far-reaching sense of sickly adult madness that goes well with frequent Freudian overtones. This is one of the most impressive recent horror films, far more shocking than anything Hollywood can create. The only thing that bothered me was that I wanted the final to be darker in tone, but it still works, so overall I would recommend it to serious horror lovers.
