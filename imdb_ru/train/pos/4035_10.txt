In a word ... amazing. <br /> <br /> Initially, I didn’t really want to watch Pinjar, because I thought it would be another film mourning the section, and which would show a bias towards India and Pakistan. I was completely wrong. Pinjar is a heartbreaking, emotional and intelligent film with no visible flaws. I chased him after watching. It lingered in my head for so long; themes, pain, loss, emotions — everything was so real. <br /> <br /> This is truly a masterpiece that is rarely seen today in Bollywood. He has no prejudice or prejudice and has given a section of human history. Here, no country is depicted as good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The cinematography is excellent, and the music is melodious, meaningful (thanks to Gulzar Sahib) and haunted. Everything in the film was awesome ... and the game just grabbed me. They were all perfectly matched. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching an intelligent and truly wonderful movie ... look no further. This film gives it all. I recommend it with all my heart. AWESOME can't describe how beautiful it is.
