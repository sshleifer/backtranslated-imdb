I really liked "The revolution will not be televised." This again gave me a positive feeling about the ability of people to decide for themselves how they want to manage. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in Venezuela, twenty percent of wealthy citizens made all decisions for eighty percent of the poor over decades, if not centuries. However, when their coup failed; after the interim government dissolved the Supreme Court, the Constitution, the ombudsman, election commissions and all civil rights, no one brought the conspirators somewhere behind the barn and shot them. They did not even go to jail. Major conspirators live in Florida, continuing. And the protection they had was the "Bolivarian Constitution", adopted by the overwhelming majority of the Venezuelan people. This is not only a story that bites. Democracy can give you damn sharpness if you let it go. And in Venezuela it is free.
