A magical journey invented by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two British cinema titans mixed some incredible ingredients to create a masterpiece of cinema! Some of Miklos Rozsa’s most delightful early Technicolor, SUBLIME and twinkling musical scores, along with Sabu youthful abundance, Conrad Veidt's theatrical and evil meanness and the exquisite beauty and voice of Jun Duprez as princesses — all work fine. Miles Malleson, who plays Dupres's father, the Sultan of Basra, also wrote an excellent screenplay, which is correspondingly grandiose. DON'T MISS THIS ONE! After posting the aforementioned comments, I received a recently released DVD and I can honestly say that I never saw the image properly before watching this version of the DVD. The clarity and resolution are so accurate, and the colors are so bright that I was stunned. An amazing classic can be observed again and again, and it never ceases to fascinate and delight the viewer. MUST SEE AGAIN!
