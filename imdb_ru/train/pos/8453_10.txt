I could write a fairly large comment about any of the characters in Gundam Wing, each of whom could lead the series with its internal conflicts. Instead, we get 8 great ideas that will lead us through 49 golden episodes of anime bliss. <br /> <br /> It contains a dialogue that you can twist in your head for several months ... years, and then come back and get a new value from, a masterpiece in writing scripts (even though has a typical anime trait, which is the discrepancy between subtitles and English dubbing). It has many concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views. <br /> <br /> The relationship between cold, insensitive men and loving female characters is a separate aspect of this series. The relationship between Hiro and Relena, Billionaire and Noin is a joy worth watching. The apparent rejection of a man is supported by the inner turmoil that makes love (a word never mentioned in the series) of women necessary for them in their harsh soldiers' environment. Women are chasing aspects of men that we rarely, if ever see, make mysterious men even more mysterious. All 49 episodes are required by the Hero to show some care, but he gets, and when he does, it pays off. <br /> <br /> And then a giant robot fights. It's fun to watch amazing episodes as well as on any Hollywood epic battle scene. Any less knowledgeable person would consider giant robots fighting as a silly cartoon function for children, as it became clear when I tried to recommend this series to my friends, but they are wrong. Many of the giant battles with robots in the Gundam wing contain a huge dose of pathos, usually involving young rebels fighting for what they believe in against oppressing society, making their beliefs obsolete. <br /> <br /> Constant changes in tone and accent in every episode of Gundam Wing cannot be bored, it is an exciting, thought-provoking study of the potential of the human mind and body.
