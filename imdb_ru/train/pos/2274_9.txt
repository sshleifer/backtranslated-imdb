Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I’m not particularly interested in spy stories, and I didn’t know it. The only reason I watched the movie was Nick Nolte, one of my favorite actors, since I saw "Breakfast of Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course, Nolte was great, but the plot was the same. There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more attention was paid to the moral issue: reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to the Americans, he actually contributed to the general attitude of the Germans (and, as it turns out, the Americans) towards the Jews or Hitler. Who has more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? The dilemma is even more pronounced since these words are never pronounced, even as a narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a man who has learned to hide his feelings so well that he doesn’t reveal himself even in his memoirs. The internal conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film copes. <br /> <br /> There are other moments, such as humor or the ironic use of romantic cliches (for example, the song “White Christmas”), which distinguish it from ordinary American films. I recommend it to anyone who is sick of Hollywood spy movies.
