This is the best movie ever created. He deserved more than what he received at the Oscars. Assigned to such things as his score, artistic direction, minor role (Newman), this film could easily be nominated for Best Picture, Director (Mendez), Actor (Hanks), Secondary Actor ("Newman and Low") and won !! Hanks gives one of his best performances, and the guy who played Michelle Jr. was so good that I was surprised that today I do not see him in other films. The critics themselves did not give this film enough credit. But besides the incredible performances, another real star of this film is incredible music. It was the best result of the year. Was nominated, but did not win. This is a great movie that everyone should watch. My class is A +
