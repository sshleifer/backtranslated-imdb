This is a great movie. If this is at least some sign, then Hon Sang-Soo is actually "the most intimate secret of Asian cinema." In style, it is very similar to Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Xiao-xiang, and thematically covers the same topics as they, but I think I actually like it more than in any of their films. Open minimalism here is a bit less pronounced than in their work, although it still fully corresponds to this style (the camera never moves even once), and for some reason I found the film less shyly “slow” than Cai Ming-Liang or Hou Xiao -hsien that, I think, is one of the reasons why I liked it more. Plus, it does not keep his subjects as separate as Howe. I felt that the film was also somehow more “finished” and less open (barely noticeable) than some of their works, although this does not mean that it had something like a moving plot. It would be hard for me to believe that Sophie Coppola did not have a direct impact on this film for Lost in Translation (scenes of a young woman hanging around herself and languishing in her hotel room in punk panties cannot but seem familiar).
