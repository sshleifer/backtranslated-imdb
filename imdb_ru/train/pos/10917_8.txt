I just managed to get the DVD “Five Poisons” from China 3 and what they did to him is super. A fantastic digital remastered show that any kung fu fan should have. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty straightforward and has already been mentioned, so I will not go into details. It goes without saying that these are fight scenes for which many people buy the film, and they do not disappoint. The only problem is that they are few and seem to be too rehearsed. Bruce Lee could take it on himself and drink a cup of tea at the same time! All the beats and beats come with all the important clicks of the "writer" and the air "whistles", which is a cool effect, albeit a rather funny one! <br /> <br /> I put this movie on B +. Good, but not great. I feel it could be a little better. The Golden Swallow, written by the same director ten years ago, had the same good story and the best actions.
