Although I like the books by E. “The Doc” Smith and the books by David A. Kiles about Lensmann, the anime based on the books is a rather amusing and somewhat innovative fair. <br /> <br /> Although the story may seem familiar to lovers of fiction / fantasy, for example, some child on an isolated planet inherits mystical abilities and avenges the death of his family, however, it is quite entertaining. In addition, Lensman was the first animated film that used hand-drawn animation and computer animation at the same time. Of course, now it may look a bit outdated, but it is still an innovation. If it were not for Lensman, nothing would have happened (I personally think that computer graphics looks better in animation than in live action). <br /> <br /> It is a pity that they only released it on DVD / VCD in a few countries in the world (mostly on formats that are quite foreign and different). I just want them to release the film and the series Lensman on DVD / VCD in EACH part of the world, and not just in some parts. <br /> <br /> P.S. Worse rules! I just think he's so awesome and tidy.
