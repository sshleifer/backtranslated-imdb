At first, I thought the Ring would be more than a regular movie with its usual plot. How I was surprised! Of course, the plot is simple - one girl is in love with two men - but Hitchcock brings it to us on a silver platter, with laughter and fear, with compassion and agony. The way he portrays the popular crowds of the fair, the power of attraction of the girl to both men, the tragic elements that are combined with the technique that opens the mind to most of his greatest films (North to Northwest, Rope, etc. ). The master made it superbly before the thirties!
