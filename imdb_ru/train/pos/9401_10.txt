What a wonderful film, worthy of so many labels that he will never get: science fiction, film noir, with a script and a dialogue of high intelligence, which implies an educated, cultural audience ..... kind of film in English, only made in 1960 in England (and shown only in cinemas in the United States, when she first appeared), and never in the United States did. <br /> <br /> The main characters of the film “The Man in the White Suit” (1951) in the lead role, Sir Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, regularly use weak-strength, scientific references, such as “polymer,” discuss and explain the concepts of chemistry, as “long-chain molecules,” and then they report on the importance of this for the average person and the benefits that science provides. <Br /> <br /> “A Man in a White Suit” (1951) is the opposite of movies about explosions in video games that now (2009) dominate world cinema and, of course, dominate in major US cinemas ...... ., an intelligently told story from talented and believable educated English actors (you are educated, experienced people), and all this is done with the help of comedy, charm, pathos and irony that would have been approved by ancient Greek playwrights. <br /> <br /> Everyone should watch this film, and sometime, one way or another, some worthy director and his supporters should make another one like that. <br /> <br /> This is great.
