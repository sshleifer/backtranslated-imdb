Fans of old films will know why I called it “The Man in the Gray Flannel Mantle”. Most Bible-based films — mostly shlok — that can cause smiles and giggles here — is how Peck tries to raise his mind on various psychological and social issues when the spear carries Neanderthals around him. Like the Great Romance, it falls like unleavened bread. But there is something exciting in this film. Of all the big pictures in the Hollywood Bible, this is the most striking reflection of the common American’s attitude towards belief in the biblical God. The thesis of Billy Sandy beats him with the help of the antithesis of H.L. Manken throughout the script. Who gets the best in the synthesis supported by the Heavenly Choir depends on your point of view. In addition, D & B boasts good performances by Peck (especially in the final scene of repentance) and Jane Meadows as his bitter first wife Mishol, a bright, capricious atmosphere (a good idea to set most of the actions at dawn or at night) and inspiring performance of the twenty-third psalm at the end.
