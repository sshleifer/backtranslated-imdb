If the Lion King was the Disney version of Hamlet, then the Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata is the Disney version of Guildenstern, and Rosencrantz is dead. As in the Tom Stoppard film, we will see action from the point of view of two minor characters from the original: Timon, a meerkat with a tendency to crack a song when hitting a hat, and Pumba, a warthog with flatulence problems. By following their stories — and not Simba’s stories — we will find out why all animals worshiped when Simba was introduced from Pride. We find out why Timon and Pumba decided to follow Simba back to the Pride of the Rock to exorcise the Scar. And we will find out how they once and for all coped with the hyena. Nathan Lane as Timon gets most of the best jokes, but Ernie Sabella expertly supports him in the role of Pumb. It's also nice to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg perform their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give their distinctive voices to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only drawback is the constant stop-start-rewind-fast-forward device, which does not always help to develop the story. Having said that, there is a brilliant zoom at the beginning of the film. With more laughter than any other film in the “third in Disney TV series” series, Hakuna Matata is worth seeing - at least for the jacuzzi scene, which is still funny, although a bit predictable.
