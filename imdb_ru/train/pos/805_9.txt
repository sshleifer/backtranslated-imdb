The Return of the Jedi is often remembered for what he did wrong, not for what he did right, and this is a shame, because the last chronological episode in the Star Wars saga is a prime example of epic storytelling. He manages to wrap all the plot lines of previous films into one grand finale, and this is very convincing. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears, which may have served to expand the demographic situation in Star Wars. - and in the middle of the film slows down a bit. But the last hour is perhaps the best part of the whole saga, where Luke finally encounters Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in cinema history. <br /> <br /> The return of the Jedi has done so many things right that people tend to lose sight of: he presented the incredible conclusion of Darth Vader’s storyline (which in the Empire Strikes Back to incredibly convincing), an exciting discovery during Jabba’s palace, the masterful performance of Jan MacDiarmid as Emperor, finally Luke comes into his own, the permission of the novel Solo and Leah, and the extremely powerful last moments on the moon of Endor. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is some minor trouble. But they annoyed the generation of film fans who managed to find fault with every scene. It is still a magical and touching film, which also serves as an excellent last chapter. This is not a “good” movie - it's fantastic!
