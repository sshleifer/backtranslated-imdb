“Film Noir” is an excessive expression when it comes to describing films. Every crime drama seems like a noir. But “Where the sidewalk ends” is really a good example of what the whole genre is about. <br /> <br /> Very briefly, an overly zealous detective (Andrews) accidentally kills the villains who work for the bandits. The murder of the father (Tom Tully) of the woman whom Andrews meets and falls in love with (Tirney) is to blame. To save Dad from Old Sparky, Andrews captures the rest of the crowd and gives up. <br /> <br /> Morally guilty policeman is guided by gusts of the past. His father was a thief who was killed trying to get out of prison. But this does not justify his actions after he accidentally turned off the wretch in self-defense. He immediately goes to the phone to report the incident, but he hesitates. He is already in hot water with a department, and this may end his career. Then at the wrong moment the phone rings. This is Andrews’s partner, and Andrews tells him that the suspect they are pursuing is not at home. He hides the body, and then gets rid of it, killing the guard and dropping the body into the river. <br /> <br /> What makes a guy do something so stupid? Good. His work was in danger. But now he has committed several crimes. At least I think they should be multiple. I considered the obstacles to justice, assault, disposing of a body without permission, rubbish, clearing the first degree and perjury against his neighbor. <br /> <br /> In the end, we don’t know whether to root for Andrews or not. The suspect did not deserve to die, true, but still it was an accident, because Andrews did not know that he was a war hero, and "he has a silver plate in his head." Perhaps it was precisely this ambiguity that made noir what it was, among other things, for example, characteristic lighting. If noir were not engaged in anything other than black and white photography, murder, criminals, secrets and suspicious women, then we would have to include all Charlie Chan films in this category. <br /> <br /> Andrews is good good. He is like Mark MacPherson (from Laura), who has become bitter. He never laughs and rarely smiles, even when he is sitting at Jean Tierney's restaurant table, a situation that can cause many men to smile. He has no sense of humor at all. His few wise men are insults. When he shoves a stool into a taxi, and the stool says: “Careful. I almost hit my head, ”Andrews replied:“ It's all right. Taxi insured. Andrews can sometimes seem wooden, but this is a role that requires stubborn and humorless determination, and he copes well with it. His underestimation is ideal for the part. Small twitches or blinks project his thoughts and emotional states. And I believe that director Otto Preminger did not allow him to declare a bullet “BOO-let”, and the police - “POE-lice”. I could never decide on Gene Tierney. She copes well with the role of the daughter of Tom Tally, model, but she looks like Marilyn Monroe in that you can not separate the accepted manners from real personality traits. Did Tierney have such an innocent, almost holy person? When she answered the call at home, was her voice as good as on the screen? Poor Tierney went through some psychiatric problems before effective remedies for bipolar disorder appeared. And Andrews, a good guy, although, it seems, he fell into alcoholism, before he finally recovered and made public announcements. <br /> <br /> Peter Muller's DVD comment on a DVD is unpretentious, informed and sometimes funny. /> <br /> Anyway, this is a good film, as well as a good example of a film noir. Good guys are not all good, although bad guys are all bad. Perhaps it is this ambiguity that makes a photograph of an adult instead of a movie about popcorn. For children, only one shot is made on the screen and no one explodes. Sorry.
