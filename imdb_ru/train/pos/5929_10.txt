Stephen King was brought up on such films. - Movies, NOT movies. <br /> <br /> Similar films and Jeepers Creepers are “returns” to good horror films. They should be fun, cheap and hopefully a little good. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is looking for a theory about the human condition should use this feature of the being, because this is all ... all this will ever be. <br /> <br /> Stop spoiling what was already considered garbage. -Good, fun, trash! <br /> <br /> If you like it, I recommend: “Jeepers Creepers”, “Jeepers Creepers 2”, “30 days of the night”, “Scarecrow” (“88),“ They live ”,“ Planet ”. Terror "Proof of death" and "Halloween III: the season of witches"
