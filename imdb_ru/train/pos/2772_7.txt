I have always believed that David and Bathsheba were a film originally intended for Tyrone Power in The Fox of the 20th Century, although Gregory Peck describes himself well as King David, a wandering monarch. <br /> <br /> This film covers many biblical scenes: adultery, redemption, sin, punishment, and in general what God expects from his followers. <br /> <br /> When you are a king, even a king in Bible prophecies, the Kingdom, of course, you have many perogatives that are not available to all of us. King David has many wives, including one really wicked in Jane Meadow, who was the daughter of Saul, David's predecessor. But his eyes see Bathsheba in her garden one evening. It turns out that she is just as unhappy in a marriage with Uriah Hittite, like David and several women. Uriah is one of David's military leaders. David sends for Bathsheba, and he is king, she runs, because she also looks at him. <br /> <br /> What happens is a romance, pregnancy and a carefully arranged death for Uriah in battle. But the all-seeing and knowing Deity caught all this and not only punishes David and Bathsheba, but the whole Kingdom of Israel is punished by drought, disease and epidemics. <br /> <br /> Sexist Day Law calls Bathsheba to death by stoning. David demonstrates a weakness in his previous actions, but here he comes up to the plate and asks that all this be put on him. He even lays his hands on the Ark of the Covenant, which was an instant death, as seen in the film. <br /> <br /> My interpretation of this is that God admires courage, even if you are mistaken, and he gives up on David and forgives them both. Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon, and she and David are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judea, until they both are conquered. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward - charming Bathsheba, caught in a marriage without love with Uriah, played by Kiron Moore. The only thing that causes Moore is a good battle. I liked the performance of Kieron Moore as a bold and rather stupid horse from behind. <br /> <br /> No one can establish a law like Raymond Massey. His Nathan the Prophet corresponds to the character of John Brown, whom he played in two films of the same intensity. <br /> <br /> So when His own law called for death, why did God spare Bathsheba and leave David on the throne? Perhaps it was the fact that he simply did not want to train the third guy for work. He has already replaced Saul with David. <br /> <br /> But I think that the Christian interpretation may be that it was a hint of the coming New Testament, that you can sin and receive mercy if someone asks for it to repent. I will leave it to the biblical scholars who will represent the interpretation. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie and you can come up with a completely new theory.
