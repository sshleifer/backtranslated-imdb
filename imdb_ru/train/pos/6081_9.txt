You are not becoming more dismal or tragic than Othello, and this film captures the play quite well with outstanding performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburn expresses Othello’s suffering very convincingly, falling prey to Iago’s lie, even providing a realistic episode of epilepsy. Jacob is a loving and loyal wife, who becomes either a tool for revenging Iago against Othello, or an object of his anger (it is unclear what motive Iago is proposing). Although Kenneth Brann (sp?) Demonstrates his usual Shakespeare talent in this film, he is somewhat detached. The characters Cassio and Emilia also roam and walk out of the scenes, although they, like Iago, seem more important to the plot. I didn’t compare the film with the play to see how many lines were cut, but I know that Shakespeare is very good at developing his characters, even seemingly unimportant ones. <br /> <br /> If I had a criticism of the film it would be that the story unfolds too quickly, and that the relationship between some characters is not laid out anymore. The director had a great cast and no one offered a bad job. The relationship between Cassio and Othello, as well as the relationship between Emilia and Desdemona, requires further development in the film. I have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the film suggests, although you felt it was very late in the film. In addition, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their suffering is convincing, their interaction with each other gives the impression that they have just met. On the other hand, they may have just met - like Romeo and Juliet. <br /> <br /> In short, good performances are too short. <br /> <br />
