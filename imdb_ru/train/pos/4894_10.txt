I grew up at a time when the music in this film was popular. What a great time for music and dance! My only complaint was that I was too young to go to the USO and nightclubs. I think it sounds like I live in the past (I have wonderful memories), so whatâ€™s wrong with that? !! World War II was a terrible time, with the exception of music. The death of Glenn Miller was terrible sadness for us. This movie will be my favorite. Clea Lane was excellent; what a voice! I don't know how I missed this movie. My main reason for this comment is to warn the current generation about an alternative to rap and new-age music, which is insulting to me. Please watch this movie and give it a shot!
