Thanks to Kevin Smith, a lot of fans run around and say that “Return of the Jedi” is not very good, because it’s actually fun to watch. And no! Dolls are involved! That makes it bad! Everyone liked the return of the Jedi until someone in the Kevin Smith film made a negative comment on this. Now, suddenly, people look at you as if you had some kind of a disease, if you mentioned how much you like it. This film is much better than anything Kevin Smith ever intended to create, and it stuns me that this man will even think about his condemnation. This movie is very fun! It’s as fun as I remember when I was six! Enjoy the movie as it is and stop stealing Kevin Smith's opinions! Its not right! <br /> <br /> And this song Ewok was finally ruling! I bet you people don't even enjoy "Ewoks: Battle for Endor" !!!! I'm going to set you all on fire!
