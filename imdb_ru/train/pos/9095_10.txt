A charming, funny movie that gets a solid rating everywhere. I have seen screening this film recently at work. It was so nice to see this movie, unlike all the crappy horror movies I see every day. So much so that I decided to write. I'm not sure that this film will go to the cinema, but I hope it will be so. This is a good movie that can be seen with friends, charming, with funny jokes. The acting was awesome (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf. The direction was pretty good (not the movie that needed to be redirected). What really highlights this film, I think, is the script. It was like Neil Simon, Seinfeldish and banter between the characters clever and has a good rhythm. As a novice screenwriter, I notice these things! (I'm a moron.) Anyway, a really cute film that I recommend.
