One of the most provocative films in the history of superb cinema, backed up by Fox Mac-Clarence and the awesome quote “Do you believe in love in the first place?”. <br /> <br /> In this picture was a trace of expressionism. We catapult the films with impeccable integrity. Gaba (AKA Joey) performed by Eva Longoria clearly loved the film and the role she played so much that she didn’t even bother to mention it in her filmography. Lol. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film would have to be, without a doubt, a heroic rescue from MC clure, since it saved a young child with disabilities with speech difficulties. What I can add was acted to perfection! The use of sound effects by James Kahiil is unique to this day. The drug bust he performs at the beginning of the film is an incredibly realistic pain. When I watched this movie for the first time, I was so forced to have deep disrespect for the Brothers Bandits from the Southside Gang and CTM (“Cut the Throat”). This is undoubtedly one of the most encapsulating crevices that Cahill dedicated to the shootings. <br /> <br /> Personally, this film has sentimental value for me, and I will upload it in the near future. Here if I can find it somewhere, lol!
