More than just a “children's film,” “holes” look at how past incidents still affect us today, whether we know about them or not. When a teenager Stanley Yelnats III (Shea LeBof) is sent to a prison camp, where he has to dig all day, he learns a lot of things about the camp and his personal connection with him. Thanks to the memories, we learn that some things are closer than we think (you will understand this better when you see the film). LeBoff does a pretty good job, like the other actors: Sigourney Weaver, John Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette and Eartha Kitt. A very interesting film.
