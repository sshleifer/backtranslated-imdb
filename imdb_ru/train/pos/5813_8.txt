This movie is great. <br /> <br /> Now I like films that have a lot of history and dialogue, but from time to time something like Moonwalker appears, and it can be watched, despite numerous shortcomings. <Br /> <br /> This film is nothing more than an entertaining advertisement for Michael Jackson. Starting with the painful video “The Man in the Mirror”, which describes his achievements and beats throughout his career, he goes through all his life tops and then falls into a really interesting segment that acts as a fun music video for “Bad” and "Speed ​​Demon", which tells about the adventures of MJ, when he runs away from fans of insane stop motion and, finally, dances to the rabbit costume. Stopping traffic is not as bad as some make you believe. It is bearable. <br /> <br /> Then we will see a great video “Leave Me Alone” and go straight to the main function. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is funny. Very funny. We see Michael coming out of the building, and then thousands of soldiers are shooting at him. Then we turned to the memories, showing MJ and three children stumbling over an underground lair. “Mr. Big” (Joe Sands) is a villainous villain who has a plan for every child in the world to be addicted to “drugs” (no details were mentioned) at an early age. MJ and the little girl he was caught with, then pursued ... yada yada yada. The plot is not really the important part. We get two very cool sequences, where MJ turns into a car, then into a robotic spacecraft and, of course, into an amazing Smooth Criminal sequence. <br /> <br /> This is a so-so movie, but it's fantastic for those who love MJ. He has most of his best hits, and a few cool little pieces, and some pretty good special effects (in particular, the Robot / Spaceship sequence). It’s worth it, especially considering that on ebay you can get it for about a pound. This will keep the children quiet for a couple of hours, as well as the 20 children who were children when it was first released.
