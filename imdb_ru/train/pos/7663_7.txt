As a rule, the logo of the production Full Moon is a warning sign to avoid the appearance of the film. But since I enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other films, I gave him a chance. <br /> <br /> This is not bad. Not great, but it is something else. The film includes the struggle with the mystical (evil) "brother", who wants to dominate the worlds, and the title character. Dr. Mordrid also deals with people and authorities in the secular world, which he does successfully. <br /> <br /> Possible spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> Dr. Mordrid can travel between “dimensions” and does this to find a companion guarding the fortress; However, the guard was blinded. His eyes are shattered pits. So, the wizard runs his hands over the eyes of the other, and hey, Presto! His eyes have been restored! This healing seems to work only with the eyes. <br /> <br /> Later, Mordred and his “brother” enliven a couple of animal skeletons in a museum for battle. Guess who will win. <br /> <br /> However, besides this, the picture is not bad at all, although it looks like a comic. The more "human" adventures of Dr. Mordred are fine, and Combs plays this role convincingly. <br /> <br /> I have seen much worse.
