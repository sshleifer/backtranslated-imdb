I felt obligated to write a review for the Space Cobra, as it received a good score of 7.3 stars, but only some of the reviews at the time of my writing were particularly positive. A strange situation and, I hope, my positive feedback will point people to this old and mostly forgotten anime film. Space Cobra is a funny story about a smuggler and a crook who is associated with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force that wants to use the forces of the planets. This is an old film that shows animation, but lacks modern sophistication, which creates an abundance of charm. Space Cobra is very focused on Western audiences and very easy to view. There are several references to a specific Japanese culture that are great for beginners in anime. The Cosmic Cobra itself is witty and pleasant. I can not say how it is connected with the English dub or the intentions of the creator, but this is one of the few Japanese comedy characters that seem to me really funny. The style of the very sixties Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack Yello. The style is colorful and creative, and there is a constant action to promote the story. The strangest aspect of this film is how it begins as a comedy and ends on a very sad dramatic note. I can't think of another Anime or a general film that could do it so easily and convincingly. You barely understand that this is happening, but it is done so subtly and seems completely natural. You also really feel that the characters set off on a journey, and their lives have changed as a result of the whole experience. Check if you can.
