The shortest way to describe Ride With The Devil is just one word: authenticity. I will not rephrase what has already been said about this wonderful film, but I would like to say how much I appreciated the historical search and the painstaking attention to detail that the film crew, no doubt, went through. <br /> <br /> As a history student familiar with the period and production of this film, I have to say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films about “bleeding Kansas”. Yes, freedoms were taken on real events, as all fiction can do. But the overall feeling of the film is genuine. Authentic costumes, authentic looks (without retrospective perception of the PC), even the actors look authentic. Even Jewel Kilcher (who has a small role in the film) looked like she came out of a photograph of the mid-19th century. <br /> <br /> A few viewers with whom I spoke expressed a lack of confidence in stylized dialogue. They cannot believe that 19th century farmers would "speak as poets." <br /> <br /> What they do not understand is the fact that in our century of verbal chatter the 19th century American public was a surprisingly literate and eloquent bunch. These people were raised on Shakespeare and the King James Version of the Bible. Script writers recreated the most likely verbal styles of these people, judging by the documentation of that time. The stylized dialogue only adds to the magical atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> But in addition to the historical document, this film also works on an intuitive level. Beautifully photographed and performed, it dates back to the times of the great Western epics. The raid on Lawrence, Kansas, performed many times earlier in many other less significant films, is depicted with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the thick of things. <br /> <br /> Romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict. This film has everything that an astute movie lover could want. <br /> <br /> In that year, when excesses of garbage, such as American Beauty, prevailed, this magnificent work was buried by an indifferent studio system. But I am sure that the “Journey with the Devil” will be given in the coming years. Please rent this movie. You will not be disappointed.
