Looking at some of the other comments here, I have a main complaint with this presentation. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are attractive in their own way - a beautiful "victim" and a beautiful, obviously extremely "not in the center", the main character with a blue collar (not counting "completely deranged") ") - in turn they beat each other, sort of like the Caucasian Kabuki scenario. <br /> <br /> It's all right, and this, of course, is basically a "turntable" story. Nevertheless, my cited complaint is that what I think is that the director is captured by his desire to demonstrate Farrah’s well-known and obvious physical qualities. She is seductively dressed in a thin robe, and with many scenes showing more than is necessary for any dramatic effect - although they are very pleasing to the eye, they distract from the severity of drama. I am sure that her neighbors they are writing and directing around the room, but their skepticism, eerie mumbling and sobbing are not true - based on Farrah’s previous experience with this guy, clear evidence that he came to the room with only the worst intentions and that she didn’t would absolutely no reason to exaggerate what happened. <br /> <br /> But this film and the story are no less convincing than because of the director's work.
