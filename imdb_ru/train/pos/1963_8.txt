We start all our reviews with the following information. Over the past 15 years, my wife and I watched nearly 100 films a year. Recently, we were honored to receive passes to any film at any time for free! Thus, we can see everything we want, whenever we want. The bottom line is that CRITICISTS count on ZERO. Your local critics or national critics, such as Ebert, are really no different from you or me. The only difference is that they write about the film and are forced to watch hundreds of films, whether they like it or not. Therefore, we believe that if you receive your money in two hours of pleasure, that is enough of us! We NEVER listen and read critics. We only care about our friends and those we know, like us. Good enough about that. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good. not just good, but very good. Critics are a bunch of morons. Just because there is nudity and language, they hated it. It was worth the price of the ticket, and that is all you can ask for. Isn't that right? Each film can not be nominated for an Academy Award. Sharon Stone is great and does an excellent job with the film, and it puzzles me as to what the heck the critics want
