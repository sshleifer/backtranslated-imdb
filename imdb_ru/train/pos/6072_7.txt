Brana and Fishburn demonstrate superior performance in this version of the Shakespeare classic. Brana plays Iago better than I saw a character playing in a movie or on stage. Someone may say that this film is too self-centered, but I disagree. Ironically, Fishburn, the first black Othello in cinema history, shows off a powerful game. Fishburn has always been a good actor, but this performance in the role of the Venice Moor may be one of his best. <br /> <br /> The only problem I encountered in this film is the simple subtraction of a number of important scenes. The character Desdemona is given far less than in the play. In this film, it may not be added at all. One of the worst cuts made by Bran in this film was the subtraction of the conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act. This part of the play shows that Desdemona cannot be the innocent child she portrays, as in this film. There were several subtractions that damaged the integrity of this film. <br /> <br /> However, if you have not read the play or have not seen the film version of Othello, I recommend this film. The story, carved or not, is still incredibly fascinating. The game, as mentioned earlier, is very good. If some important scenes were added, and the Desdemona character was given a higher priority, it would be a great movie. In its current form, this is still a wonderful version of the original. I give him a minor recommendation.
