This film captured my heart from the very beginning, when I heard Quincy Jones's first notes or saw the wonderful purple color of flowers in the meadows. This is really a movie to cry and die for ...! The whole cast gives the best performance in the film, which I have seen in many years, and Spielberg really surpassed himself! Wuppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (oh, lord!), Danny Glover and others, all give us everything we can and you can feel it - almost touch it! Goldberg IS Celie, she gives her the insecurity and feeling of inferiority that are necessary for the character, and we grow with her, we become strong with her throughout the entire film, and we triumph with her. Margaret Avery is wonderful as Shug Avery, even when she is very arrogant, and shows us that "sinners" really "also have souls." Always sympathetic, charming Danny Glover does an amazing job, making people hate him, and great music (I would say sir) Quincy Jones adds even more beauty to this great movie! Photography, music, director and music transform this beautiful soulful film into a life experience. You do not want to miss it! "Sista" ... remember my name ... "
