At the beginning of this film one of the commentators says that he was told that he has two blows to him: he is black and man. But in addition to this, he has the third blow: he is gay. “You will have to be stronger than you ever imagined,” they say. "Paris is burning" - a documentary about gays, blacks and Hispanics, who are transvestites or transgender people. <br /> <br /> The miracle of “Paris is burning” lies in the fact that director Jenny Livingston removes a theme that could easily become a Strange show and allows people in it their humanity. We study their views on homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, their disappointments, their dreams. Some of these dreams are so unattainable that they are tragic. Many people seriously deny it; <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. In this film there are shots of naked transsexuals. If you have problems with homosexuality, then this film is not for you. But if you watch this film, you will understand that “Paris is burning” is not really about men wearing women's clothes, but about a group of people who are usually marginalized and humiliated by society as a whole, and that to get a sense of community in their life. <br /> <br /> I watched this film four times since it was released in 1991 because it says a lot: it’s a comment about materialism in our culture, gender roles about rich and poor people, about the media and that they celebrate, of glory and admiration. "Paris is burning" - one of the most humane and saddest films I've ever seen.
