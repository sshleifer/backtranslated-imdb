Where "The End of the Sidewalk" is a good crime drama from the film "Noir", well shot in black and white and on the ground. <br /> <br /> Copper accidentally kills a murder suspect and defends himself. he hides it and blames it on another person who does not like him, who has committed many crimes in the past. But towards the end he is humbled, but not before falling in love with the woman he meets, who is the mistress of the man he killed ... <br /> <br /> Starring Dana Andrews (While the city sleeps, Curse of the Demon) , Gene Tirney (Laura, Ghost and Mrs. Muir), Gary Merrill (Mysterious Island), Carl Malden (Streets of San Francisco, Beyond Posidonian Adventure) and Craig Stevens (Deadly Mantis). Good parts from everyone. <br /> <br /> Where is the end of the sidewalk, if there is a chance. Fine. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
