This film has its ups and downs, but for me the good things in this film far outweigh the bad ... <br /> <br /> What is good about the film is sometimes dialogue, sounds, lighting (Iâ€™m the only one who noticed how the scenery, amateur and acting was lit ... <br /> <br /> What is very good is the original storyline, the atmosphere is very tense, the blood factor is very high, and the effects are made to the highest degree. <br /> <br /> So, definitely worth a look, or maybe even worth a look to all horror fans and blood ....
