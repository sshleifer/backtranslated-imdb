“Sudden Impact” is the fourth film about “Dirty Harry”, and one of the best features of these films is that they do not degrade the quality from one film to another. Thus, Sudden Impact provides another exciting journey through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time, Harry is trying to uncover a series of vacation killings. It seems Harry is always at work. Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all his people of action, slow, deliberate and without fear. As the first of the films of “Dirty Harry”, filmed in the 80s, “Sudden Impact” lacks the sensation of the 70s, which characterizes the first three films. This does not mean that this quality is less. Bottom line: “Sudden Strike” is another worthy addition to the “Dirty Harry” series.
