Before Nicolas Cage became the big star of action films, he was a great actor. In this little-known film, Cage gives one of his best performances. Red Rock West was a low-budget, almost unknown film, but this is one of my favorite films of all time. I discovered this while walking down the aisle of the video store, and wanted Cage and Hopper (who are also great in the film) to appear together. Go take it, and I am sure that you will not be disappointed.
