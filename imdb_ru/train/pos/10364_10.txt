Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neal) have just greeted the little girl Azaria. As Seventh-day Adventists, they confess their beliefs every day, and Azaria soon dedicated herself to God in her church, and their two older boys look at it. Michael is resting, and the family decides to go to Ayer Rock, one of the most impressive tourist destinations in all of Australia. Not being rich, family camps near the site. After a wonderful first day, Lindy sleeps little Azariah in one of the tents. Suddenly, she hears Azariah crying. When Lindy rushes to the tent, the dingo dog just comes out, shaking his head. The child is gone and soon, like a dingo. Although the whole camp is looking for a baby, she is not found. Concluding that she is dead and that the dingo has finished with her beloved child, Chamberlain struggles to make God's decision and continue her life. But, unfortunately, this story gets sensational media coverage, and soon a story is spreading that Lindy killed a child. She was subsequently arrested and brought to justice. How could this happen? This is a great depiction of real events that shows that the “crowd rule” is not a figment of the imagination. The whole country is rebelling against the Chamberlain, in part because they seem strange. Streep gives her the best performance in the role of challenging Lindy, whose strong-willed demeanor resists her at every turn. Neil also does a wonderful job like Michael, who is hesitant and confused. The cast is one of the biggest in history, with images of people across the country digging into the Lindy case. The costumes, the scenery, the script, the direction and the staging are all at their best. If you have never seen or heard of this film, correct it immediately. No wonder from reality we can say that this “Cry” should be seen by everyone who is not indifferent to the film and the abuse of power of the media.
