Footlight Parade - one of the best enchanting musical comedies of the 1930s. The fast-paced screenplay and cast, including Jimmy Cagney, the beautiful Joan Blondel, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, make this movie a cut above the rest. Directed and choreographed by creative genius Busby Berkeley, this film will make you grin from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Busby is undoubtedly the undisputed master of a Hollywood musical with “Gold Diggers of 1933” and “42nd Street” in his assets (as dance director). Footlight parade is decorated with hundreds of poorly dressed choir girls Berkeley's trademark. Complex dance numbers were filmed with just one camera, and Busby was the first director to shoot dancers' close-ups. His obsession with beautiful legs and back shots was vividly demonstrated here. The overall effect is very erotic and mesmerizing. <br / > <br /> Our boy Jimmy Cagney plays Chester Kent, the producer of prologues or short musical productions that were performed in cinemas to entertain the audience before the conversations were shown in the picture. He is surrounded by dishonest partners, a corporate spy and a gold miner. Although Cagney had solid experience in vaudeville It was the first film in which he showed his dance talents. Joan Blondel was remembered as the clever and insane secretary of Cagney. And Ruby Keeler, as always, is amazing. <br /> <br /> The film culminated in three outstanding numbers: The Bridal Hotel, Waterfall and Shanghai Leal, each of which is a masterpiece and is unlikely to be duplicated in today's Hollywood, where the so-called “special effects” replaced creative cinematography. <br /> <br /> The result of Claudia: smart and erotic, with some of the best pieces of music ever put on celluloid. Carefully pleasant vanity of the depression era.
