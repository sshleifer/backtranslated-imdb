This film is difficult to watch in our rapidly developing 21st century culture, but itâ€™s worth it for the messages that it conveys, mainly about the implications and implications of technology for society, especially when this technology is used for military purposes. /> <br /> This film presents the full cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization, influenced by the emergence of technology and the subsequent destruction of civilization, and therefore it serves as a warning story against the misuse of technology, but when the circle ends, familiar themes and moods reappear selfish, not self-destructive ways in which humankind can use technology. <br /> <br /> An excellent time, the quality of the image and sound can be a problem for some, but as a landmark in the history, development and evolution of the science fiction genre, it is necessary. In the end, free will and freedom of choice are again presented to humanity as a means of controlling our own destiny, and not serving it to someone else or, in fact, the state of society itself, in accordance with world events. <br /> <br /> Those who are intimidated by what life throws are sometimes inclined to remain so, but, nevertheless, there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity, as the film claims. <br /> With regard to qualification as science fiction, one of the most common demonstrators of this genre is its speculative nature. He asks us questions, what if these events happened in this way, and how would this affect society or individuals in it? How would we respond? <br /> <br /> As far as influence is concerned, this film is about those speculative sciences that make science fiction as unique as it is and forces us to ask these important questions.
