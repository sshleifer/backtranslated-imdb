Where to start the Snitch'd movie review? James Cahill, God, God rest his soul, has made one of the wildest ideas about the human psyche since the days of Human Encino. his beautiful story unfolds around the policeman McClure, whose name is synonymous with the character of the Simpsons, who is also an actor! said the cop goes deep into the underworld in which they take drugs in high school and discovers gang warfare to compete with Police Academy 1, and I mean the one where Jones racistly accuses his new partner, but he manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will ever hear. <br /> <br /> The exciting perception of Cahill's effects, both visual and auditory, is electrified, a small pause between the action on the screen and the speakers adds a drama that sounds real sandy as an underground thriller. In addition, the glory of his brilliant use of cosmetics, such as extremely persuasive burns, notes that a gang member suffers in his showdown with an internal barbecue! YUCK! I feel that the world of cinema is much less from the death of James, his memory will be saved again and again, reborn with every passing mention of his leading production, Snitch'd. his shrewd director's commentary produced a blow of cola in the nose to any shrewd viewer, truly corresponding to the harsh reality of life on the streets, imprinted in all its glory of coarse punk, tipping a trash can in a fight. br /> <br /> but I ask you, why did the big pool of bosses look so cheap? I will tell you why, because this is life in Santa Ana, baby, it's not all the offices that are hurriedly built and hastily built up principle, oh no. There are people who need to penetrate a soft tattooed lively street space in Los Angeles to get through the moves that don't seem out of place in the Double Dragon: The Play for the School for Special Children. <br /> <The only thing that worries me in this film is that there was never a sequel. come on Steven Spielberg, come on George Lucas, come on the guy who avenged the botanists from 1 to 23, how difficult it would be to make it a step higher and pay homage to this great man James Cahill. <br /> <You know, he discovered Eva Longoria. oh yeah he did that. <br /> <br /> Jonah
