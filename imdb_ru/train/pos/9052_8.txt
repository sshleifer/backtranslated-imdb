This is a good drama and a good change in the pace of today's more turbulent and loud films. This is another reliable store based on real things, which still means that most of it can be used for dramatic purposes. Honestly, I don't know, but I liked the story. <br /> <br /> A story about a young man from the fifties who is interested in rocket science and wants to enter this field instead of working in coal mines. like everyone else, including his father, in this city of West Virginia. The big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father, who, I think, was exaggerated. I wish there was a little less tension between them. <br /> <br /> I think the young man, still a boy, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first major assignments. He is as pleasant as his school buddies here. Nice to see good kids in a modern film. The other two key actors in the film are Chris Cooper (Dad) and Laura Dern (the teacher of the child who constantly encourages him). <br /> <br /> Cinematography is decent, soundtrack of the 1950s sounds interesting. Once again: I want more such films to be made today.
