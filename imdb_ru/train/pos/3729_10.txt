Although I believe that this film can be called anti-Vietnamese, I did not feel that this was so, since the film was just an honest look at the prospect of preparing young guys for war. that the public did not support ... it showed their fear, their despair, their desire ... all this, outdoors, naked. As a soldier, many of the themes sounded believable in my experience in the army, especially in the training camp. In general, this film, although it was shot with a very small budget, looks great, is very well built, and shows excellent acting and directing. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for another great Colin Farrell movie. 10/10
