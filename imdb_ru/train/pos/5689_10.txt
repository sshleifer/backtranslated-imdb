First, this is a review of the two disk sets that came with the rental of the Wonderland DVD. <br /> <br /> Two films included in the rental, "Wonderland" and the documentary Johnny Wadd, completely wiped out. myth created by Boogie Nights. This myth was that the characters involved in the sale of adult films were much more than slugs who would do something for money, basically denying that they were anything other than disgusting selfish whores. It is surprisingly similar to the fact that the book "Wiseguy" and the film "Goodfellas" made with the fable "The Godfather" and most of the rest of the gangster romance. <br /> <br /> Now, what irritated me most of all while watching these films and probably annoying anyone who saw and loved Boogie Nights is how educated and sophisticated people can be supposedly foolish . “Dirk Diggler” in “Boogie Nights” is, without a doubt, John Holmes, who, unlike “Dirk Diggler”, did not have the quality of redemption. Holmes was a criminal sociopath who insulted anyone who was with him, was completely absorbed in his desire for self-gratification and, without a doubt, was one of the key participants in the brutal murders on Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981 lies about what the “Boogie-Woogie Nights” were, and reinforces Linda Lovelace's description of the cruel and pitiful business known as the adult entertainment industry. This is required to view both features on the Wonderland DVD, for anyone who has any positive opinions about the story in the Boogie Nights movie.
