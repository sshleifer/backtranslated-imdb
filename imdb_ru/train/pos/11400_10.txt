I found it necessary to respond to comments posted on the first page of the page of this film, because some of them were slightly misinformative. <br /> <br /> Initially, I posted quotes from the original poster, but I was not sure that it was correct, given that this is an index of “comments” and not a bulletin board (although we used them in this way even before like IMDb added the movie's bulletin board), so I will edit it to make it unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, you may not know about it, but for the first time Gene Kelly became famous for playing “Pal Joey” on Broadway in an original production. When Vincente Minnelli decided to shoot Gershwin's Panorama, he wanted Kelly to be more sophisticated than the roles of the “good two shoes” that he played in most of his films (except for “For me and my girl”), Alan Jay Lerner was commissioned to build a new storyline in Paris based on the story of “Pal Joey”. This gave Kelly a chance to play his famous role on Broadway, although Warners bought MGM for the rights to Pal Joey. In my opinion, the Pal Joey film is a crash, although Sinatra was suitable for the role, but other problems have sunk the film (the script is changing and bad leadership. ============== === ========================================= <br /> <br /> You complain that Kelly's photos are not very well made, even if you refer to your artistic education to prove it, but you miss the fact that Kelly's bad art was clearly designed to be bad, and this is necessary for the story / characters. The pictures are so bad that the public knows that Kelly is not ready for the show ke. Even he knows it, although Milo somehow slept him to such an extent that he almost believed her. But it is important that the public not sit there and say: “But he is a great artist.” If he only had a chance! "You want the audience to be fully aware of his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Then you complain that he is sabotaging his interest in the show; again, you do not understand the structure of the story. He refuses because he does not want to feel Gigolo himself, and because he knows that he is not quite ready for the exhibition. His enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not as great as Joey's enthusiasm for "creating a nightclub." But he performs the same function in the plot. Remember that in the “Pal Joey” (play) it is important that Joey abandons his nightclub after he realizes that he does not deserve it. The same with art shows. If Kelly's paintings were really good, it would undermine this whole point. ================================================= = <br /> <br /> Then you complain that Caron and Kelly do not have "chemistry." I think it is in the eye of the beholder. I agree, the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be, but for me it was good. Compare this with even worse “forced” novels, such as the novel between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in Pride and Passion. ================================================= == <br /> <br /> When you say that the finale of a big dance has nothing to do with something else in this film, it simply shows that you have not sunk beneath the surface of the film into its symbolism. Many elements in the dance sequence are associated with the story and characters, and through dance the plot is solved with the help of images and symbolism. It is about finding love, enjoying love, then losing love (he looks around and his love disappears). The movements of the symphony are constructed in such a way that part of each dance scene reflects a separate phase of Parisian art, as well as a separate phase of their relationship. If you have not seen this, it is not the fault of the film. This, of course, is not a "load of crap." =================================================
