Bill and Ted's “Fake Journey” is one of the most misunderstood films I've seen in a long time, the second fun adventure of Bill S. Preston Esqua. and Ted Theodore Logan, aka Wild Stallins. There are two ways to look at this film: first, you see a stupid dialogue, a contrived plot, a juvenile idea. OR .. You see brilliantly understated idiots who are again in a situation too big for their brain. Throw Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar into this story, and he will become a big blockbuster. Bill and Ted enter the story with the same level of sincerity, only Bill and Ted. This is a tricky fence on which you need to balance, but when you watch a movie not as a quick joking comedy, but as an adventure involving two guys who have nothing to do with adventures, it becomes much more.
