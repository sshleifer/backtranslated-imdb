This movie was awesome, this is the movie in which you watch it, and instead of watching other films of the actor, you watch other films of the director / writer. Sandler did a good job working with the character outside his comfort zone, and always a good Chudl did a great job too. This film is great for a mature, intelligent audience. The acting was fantastic and can only be surpassed by the writing and directing of the film. This film focuses on real Americans, past generations, without stereotypes or racism, only on people who got together and realized the true meaning of life. This film is about losing and overcoming. Instead of pointing to psychiatry, it does not define it as someone who magically heals you, but rather because of the need to tell your feelings to an impartial person you can trust will not judge you, but rather direct you through your thoughts. This movie is awesome!
