In the old commercial for empty audio cassettes, the tag was: “Is it real or is it Memorex?” The same can be said about the events in this episode - the compilation and remix of “The Cage”, the first pilot of Star Trek. Mr. Spock skillfully commanded the ship to take him to the forbidden planet Talos IV so that Captain Christopher Pike, his first captain, who was burned and paralyzed, returned there. Why the final? Because any contact with Talos IV implies a death sentence. Why this is never explained — it worried me a lot — but if you say nothing else, it adds to the story. After he got the ship to go to Talos IV, Mr. Spock returns to Dr. McCoy (the senior officer is present; the captain Kirk was from the ship) for arrest and says: "Charge of the insurrection, doctor I never received orders to seize the ship" Next comes a military court in which, thanks to the Talos, we find out why it was so important (apart from obvious paralysis) to Captain Pike to get to Talos IV, even under the threat of Mr. Spock's death. And mae Willy as a Guardian (Talosian head) is wonderful. Call me a sexist, but it never occurred to me to have a woman for this role, but she was perfect! You can’t say whether it’s a man or a woman, and it doesn’t matter.This episode, more than any other in the series, gives me hope and prayer that there are other worlds and there are civilizations that have come so far! What a graceful thing, if it were so! This is one of my favorite episodes, and no matter how many times I saw him (I even have this on video), he always delights me. Meg Willie looks like an alien, and I do not mean it is unkind.
