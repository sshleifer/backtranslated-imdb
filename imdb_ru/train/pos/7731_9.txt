<br /> <br /> “After dark my sweet” is a strange mixture of sensuality and stupidity. The film goes slowly, very slowly, but he needs a rhythm to tell the story of murder and passion. Jason Patrick has never been so sexy and powerful (a man gives a real idea), and Rachel Ward is almost sexy. <br /> <br /> Sexual tension, psychological heat, footsteps of the past ... scenes of memories, the strangeness of Patrick's character - everything becomes a sexual mystery. I recommend this reason, this is the sexiest boring movie I've ever seen. Check out the love scene, this is especially sexy.
