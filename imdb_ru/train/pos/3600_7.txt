At first glance, I expected this film to be shitty, because I thought the plot would be overly feminist. But I was wrong. As you may have read in previously published comments, I agree that the feminist role in this film does not bother. It never occurred to me that the main character exaggerates her position as a woman. It looks like Guzman is represented as a person with a spine, unlike her classmates. So I was surprised by this story, in fact, I thought it was pretty good, except for the predictable end. Perhaps it would be better to give the plot a radical turn, so that the viewer was somewhat more surprised. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like to say that Rodriguez deserved her respect as she removed her character. I cannot explain why, but especially in love scenes she convinced me. I think it looked real. <br /> <br /> I gave him 7 of 10, simply because of the dull last half hour.
