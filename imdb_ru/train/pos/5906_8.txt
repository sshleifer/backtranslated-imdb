Doghi is a great movie, and Renuka Daftardar is an excellent one. As well as Uttara Baokar, who is usually excellent in most of her roles. Along with Kairee, this is an example of Marathi cinema at its best. In both films, there are certain parts that have a tendency towards didactics â€” perhaps this would improve the film so that there would not be several scenes into which social information is driven in. These scenes probably arise from the political considerations of the director, but the film is realistic and move enough not to need it. But apart from such minor controversies, this is a film that deserves to be seen, and I highly recommend it. Sumitra Bhave's care and humanism shine through.
