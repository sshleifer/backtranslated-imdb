Peter Bogdonavich made some really great films, and THEY ALL LAUGHED - one of his best. The cast could not be better prepared to play this light but slightly bitter-bolt comedy. Interestingly, the witty, light touch that Bogdonavich so easily uses gives the film a rather disarming emotional core. Fresh and immediate, the film begins without explanation. There is no music for the soundtrack to remind us. We meet the heroes in action, and when Bogdonavich slides through the streets of New York, the film unfolds without much effort. Robbie Müller’s camera captures all of this with a simplified simplicity that seems random, but of course it’s not. The cast is awesome. In all respects a classic.
