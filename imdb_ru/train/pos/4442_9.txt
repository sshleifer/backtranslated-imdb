“Ogre” is a film created for television in Italy, and it should not have been a continuation of “Demons”, since Lamberto Bava even mentions this in an interview on DVD from the show “Shairk”, but it was called “Demons III” to become part of the series "Demons". The music in “Demons and Demons 2” was rock music from the 80s, while this is more horrible music, and the first two were horrible horrors. “Demons III: Ogre” is an architectural horror, therefore “Demons III” are not a suitable continuation for “Demons”, but I still like this film. <br /> <br /> The music is creepy, and it adds tone to the lock in which the movie is set. Ogre is another thing why I like the movie. There are two other films that are classified as Demons III, and these are Black Demons (Demons 3) and the Church (Demons 3). Demons III: The Ogre is a good film if you do not compare it with Demons and Demons 2.
