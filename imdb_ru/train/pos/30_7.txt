An old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather came to life after 16 years, as he had predicted. <br /> <br /> People are killed, shed blood, rats run, and naked bodies are killed. Enjoyment <br /> <br /> Kitty (Barbara Boucher) is a suspect, but we know that she is not a murderer. Is this Francis (Marina Malfatti)? Is Evelyn back from death for revenge? Is it a conspiracy to steal an inheritance? The color is gorgeous in this thriller from Emilio Miraglia, who, as far as I know, made just another Jallo. <br /> <br /> The only thing that spoiled the film was that a few frames were cut. Someone calls the police, and suddenly they are trying to save Kitty there.
