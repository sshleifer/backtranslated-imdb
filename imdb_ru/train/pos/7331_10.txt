In times of magic, barbarians and demons abound in a diabolical tyrant named Nehron and his mother, Queen Juliana, who lives in an icy world and wants to conquer the region of fire ruled by King Jerol, but when his beautiful daughter, Princess Tigre, was kidnapped by Nehron's goons, the warrior Larne must defend her and defeat Nehron against the conquest of the world and kingdom with the help of an avenger named Dark Wolf. <br /> <br /> A beautifully crafted and superb underestimated animated fantasy epic that combines live actors with animation traced over them (rotoscoping) is Ralph Baksha's second best film, only “American Pop” is number one, “ Heavy Traffic is the third, and Wizards is the fourth. This is certainly better than his “Cool World” or “Lord of the Rings”, a work of art designed by the famous artist Frank Farzetta, and the animation has a good color, and there is also beauty for the guys. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this film to fans of fantasy and animation everywhere, especially the new DVD with 2 Limited Edition discs from Blue Underground. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: "Black Cauldron", "Dark Crystal", "Conan the Barbarian", "The Wizard of Oz", "Rock and the Rule", "Wizards", "Heavy Metal", Starchale: The Legend of Orin, Fantastic Planet, Mononoke Princess, Nausikka: Valley of the Wind, Conan the Destroyer, Willow, Princess Bride, The Lord of the Rings (1978), Sword in stone "," Excalibur "," Army of Darkness "," Krull "," Dragon's Heart "," King Arthur "," The Hobbit "," The Return of the King (1980) "," Conquest "," American Pop "," Jason and the Argonauts "," Battle of the Titans "," The Last Unicorn "", " The secret of the NIMH is “The Flight of the Dragons”, “Hercules (Disney)”, “The Legend”, “The Chronicles of Narnia”, “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire”.
