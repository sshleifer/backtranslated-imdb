Pauly - a little girl's fantasy or, perhaps, her memories of how her youth grew. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub performs an impeccable performance as a Russian scientist who cannot find a decent job in America. He became friends with an isolated parrot, performing the usual duties of a cleaner in the laboratory of behavioral sciences. <br /> <br /> The head doctor is a bitter person, since Paulie, who can speak and fully understand the language and learn, confuses the doctor, who later expels him to the lower levels of the building, where Michael finds him (Tony S.). <br /> <br /> Paulie repudiates her life with Marie and for how they lost each other. The quest begins the reunion of Pauly with Marie, just over 20 years have passed. <br /> <br /> The film ends, as some will say, predictably, with Michael, reuniting Paulie with Marie. The story ends with the three entering the house of Marie, where you can make the final of your choice. <br /> <br /> Great family movie!
