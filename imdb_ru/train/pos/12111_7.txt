When I first started watching this anime, I never thought that something in bread making could be interesting, but fortunately, I was mistaken. From the moment I started watching it, the anime just got involved in the world of baking, I was hooked. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage of this anime is humor, very smart and very funny, with some repetitive jokes. But the animation, soundtrack and character development are below average, although these flaws are not so noticeable in the first episodes, because due to the excellent work on this anime, it really begins to manifest itself in the last 20 episodes, when the reactions and repetitive gags just age and no longer as funny as before. <br /> <br /> As far as I understand, if this anime ended with episode 52, I would give it 9, but the last episode just leaves a bitter aftertaste, which, unfortunately, cannot be washed away with an amazing 50 episodes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
