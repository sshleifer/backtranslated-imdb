Yes, this art ... successfully making a slow thriller. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in good volumes, until you even notice it. <br /> <br /> Perfectly executed by Robin Williams. The angles of sexuality in the film may seem unnecessary and probably affect how much you like the movie. However, the main plot is very attractive. The film does not rush at you and still captures you enough to surprise you. The direction is good. Using light to achieve the desired effect of uncertainty and surprise is good. <br /> <br /> It is very pleasant to watch once if you want to lie back and hear an exciting story!
