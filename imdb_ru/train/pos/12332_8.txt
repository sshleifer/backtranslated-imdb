After seeing a short time on the horror movie marathons, I think that this is a humorous parody that divorces the main point of its mention. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the themes are crisp and outdated for today's viewers, this is by no means a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Although the student film doesnâ€™t give a reason for justification, the proof is that it is created with care, with a budget ranging from a small to a zero test. <br /> As another reviewer noted, less than ten minutes is enough time to clear the audience sky with a toast of joy, laze around and idle in the film. <br /> <br /> I think that this short piece of the film should be used as a snack to link to the title, and the viewer should relax and ride with him.
