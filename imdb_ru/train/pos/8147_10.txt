Fear of a black hat is a hilarious deception of hip-hop culture. It's as fun as This Spinal Tap, if not funnier. The actors are incredible, and the documentary style is superb. Mark Christopher Lawrence is a terrific talent that should play a major role in many films. This film is a true cult classic!
