I do not know the stars or the modern Chinese teenage music - but I know a very interesting film when I see it. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Dunk is pure Hollywood in its values ​​- it is played for a laugh, for love, and this is a great combination of kung fu and basketball. <br /> <br /> Everyone looks like they had a lot of fun doing it - production values ​​are excellent - and modern China looks more brilliant here than Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> The story of an abandoned orphan who grows up in a kung-fu school only to be kicked out and then discovered the superstar as a basketball game (and love and much more;) is gorgeous - it's fresh fun and immensely entertaining. <br /> <br /> With great action and good communication, it’s easy to enjoy - for all ages - and for our money it was one of the best family films that we have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Please do not pay attention to negative reviews and give Danke a chance - we were very glad that you did it - a GOOD sports comedy film.
