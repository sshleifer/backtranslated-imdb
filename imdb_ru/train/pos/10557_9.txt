I just saw it at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2003, and it was damn funny and a bit surreal. Occurs in Toronto, where the two losers live in this abandoned house in the middle of the highway. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are great, because two losers want the world to just go. The acting, the dialogue and the compositions are very good, and the whole film looks great for such a low-budget film. Director / screenwriter Vincenzo Natalie was present at this show, and he seemed so smart and practical. This guy is so inventive with these wonderful stories that work so well with small budgets, that he disgraces big budget Hollywood nonsense!
