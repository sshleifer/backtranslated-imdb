Some people say that this is the best film that China has ever released, Iâ€™m not too sure about that, because I have a loving place in my heart for some of their mysteries. I will say that this is probably one of the most unique films that they, or any other studio, major or minor, have ever released. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. The ghost of an improperly executed ferryman returned to the swamp to kill all those who lynched him, as well as all of them from the spring. This mixture includes the granddaughter of the victim of one ghost, the current carrier. She takes over the ferry when the ghost approaches the man she loves. <br /> <br /> Shrouded in thick fog and staged mostly on the same marsh set, this is more of a musical poem than an ordinary feature film. the rhythms of dialogue, especially in the early scenes, their poetic cadence to them. Just as in the case of camera work, there is a similar frequency of movement when it moves back and forth through the swamp, as if crossing the door back and forth through the path between life and death, innocence and guilt. The film reminds me more a lesson about opera, oratorio or musical subjects than an ordinary horror movie. This is an amazing film, which is probably unique in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> This is not for Lilly's guild. This is a low-budget horror / riddle telling you a neat little story that will entertain you. Here the story about love and revenge is important, not about poetic filmmaking, and it attracts your attention first of all (technical aspects are just window dressing). If there is any real flaw, then it is cheap production. The fog creates a mood, but it also hides the fact that this swamp is completely on land. Fast forward and rewind is normal, but even after 58 minutes you really want to see something else. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I really like the movie. This is a good little movie, which I would like was a little less poor. It is definitely worth seeing if you can come across this.
