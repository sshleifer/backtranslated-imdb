This is a very dramatic and intense film. There are many plots and turns. The story or director opens question marks on death row or suspected crimes committed by black people. This film is very well directed by Arne Glimcher, and the wonderful sound of James Newton Howard is superb. Strong performance by Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you liked it, do not miss the "TRUE CRIMES" or "HARRES". My wife and I gave 8/10.
