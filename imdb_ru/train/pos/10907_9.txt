Wandered on TV, and HBO showed a double wave of incredibly horrendous diseases, so I turned to my twin sister and said, "Hey, that looks funny" - I really like documentaries - so we started watching it. At first I thought that Johnny Kennedy was a young man, but then they explained that because of his condition he never underwent puberty, thus a high voice and a smaller body. He was in a crusade to raise money for his business. He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a wonderful sense of spirituality ... I cried, looked a little more, laughed, got up to get another Kleenex, and then wept again. When “time is up” Johnny Kennedy, he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he learned lessons from this life, and he was free. I highly recommend it. If you don't fall in love with this guy, you have no heart.
