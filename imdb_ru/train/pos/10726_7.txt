To my surprise, I really liked Spacecamp, I remember seeing it about 13 years ago, and recently I hired it again. I was very impressed. Obviously, the special effects in modern space films, such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, are far superior to SpaceCamp. However, this film had a story - a very stereotypical story of the eighties, in which you could almost read the next line of dialogue before hearing it. But what I liked about this is that they no longer make such films, so this was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Phoenix Liszt and Leah Thomson in early roles, with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw, to add to the plot a light and fluffy plot. Absolutely loved the robot named Jinks, he was very cute, but, unfortunately, he had more emotions than some of the main characters. The film was almost inspiring in its own way, and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at NASA space camp in Alabama (I think).
