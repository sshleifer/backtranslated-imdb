Well, Tenko, without a doubt, the best British TV show, performances, directing, casting, suspense, drama ... everything is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the show fell A little later, in the final season, this final film perfectly hooked the themes and made a great story for fans of the show and newcomers. I can't recommend this movie anymore, find it and see. But I advise you to watch the series first, as the first 2 seasons are even better than this fantastic film. <br /> <br /> Obvious (10/10)
