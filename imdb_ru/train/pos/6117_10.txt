All I can say about the TV series Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 is ... if you are at least remotely "PC" or you do not have a serious spoiled sense of humor, then you probably will not get it. No matter how sick and disgusting this film is, it really is a comedy, not a horror film in general. If you can appreciate someone who pushes the boundaries of good taste and political correctness to the extremes that you can imagine, to the extent that it becomes so unmanageable that it is comical, then you should see it to believe it. This film was so out of control that a large film studio could not touch it with a 10-foot pole (with a condom at the end). In my opinion, the best, most extreme works of art come from the underground. If you don’t stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing, then they reject it. <br /> <br /> I saw a stack of terrible, boring Z-Grade films, Indy, which were just a waste of a perfectly good VHS or DVD-R tape. I also saw stacks of smelly bombs coming from large registered studios that were a waste of millions of dollars. When there is NO BUDGET film, similar to these two, from Ron Atkins / John Giankaspro, which blows up all the other “shock” films completely out of the water, you really need to look at the whole scene of the film “Indie” again. Seeing this, you can really see how much freedom an indie director can get when they work on their own. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that even other people who watched this movie and “hated it” Admit that they laughed to the end. I don’t think it can be boring for someone to watch any of these two. So if you don’t take everything you saw in the mainstream media too seriously, and can laugh at the misanthropic puppet psychopath that finally broke, YOU MUST SEE THIS. You can simply see it as a separate cult classic. Both Schizophrenics / Schizophreniacs 2 are among the favorites in my collection of over 1000 DVDs.
