Without a doubt, this film should be one of the greatest ........ in the history of cinema. I watched it too many times to remember, and every time, as if I was watching a movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> How to start? <br /> <br /> The main role of Mina Kumari is undoubtedly one of the best performances in her career, he is closely watched by Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam and Full aur Puthar. Every movement and nuance of its performance makes any other Bollywood heroine pale in meaning. Her virtuoso interpretation of Kathak, combined with her grace, tragic vulnerability and poetic manifestation of Urdu, is not like anything on the screen of Bollywood. <br /> <br /> Pakiza is perhaps the most stylized interpretation of the human condition; photography, gorgeous cinematography and mise-en-scenes are so full of symbolism and meaning that the audience simply held its breath. <br /> <br /> Headphone music is unsurpassed, his knowledge of courtesan guarantor music is incredible. And the way he emphasizes the narration with dark atmospheric motifs and stunning romantic melodies is really wonderful. <br /> <br /> My only advice to anyone who seriously loves the spectacle of total cinema is to watch this epic mediation on Life and Art.
