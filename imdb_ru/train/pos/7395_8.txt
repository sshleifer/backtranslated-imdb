Almost the entire film takes place in a public bath in China. There are no fancy decorations, explosions or glamorous people - only good writing, acting and directing (Hollywood, take note!). <br /> <br /> An excommunicated son returns home when he believes that his father is dying. He is surprised to see that Dad looks good and is going to run a family business, as usual. In fact, he notices that his father and his mentally retarded brother did establish close and caring relations, and it soon becomes obvious that he does not know! Dad is very traditional, and this visiting son from a big city does not see the value of the old bath. The way their relationships change and where the plot comes from is exceptional and believable. <br /> <br /> I was glad to see that not every Chinese film is an action movie (for example, starring Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden). Dragon), since I donâ€™t really like these crazy movies. Shower and Spring in a small town - two great examples of good Chinese films about PEOPLE!
