At the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends recall how stubborn he was in search of the scoop. Meanwhile, the late Joe reveals the identity of the serial killer of Tarot cards of London He deceives the Reaper and appears before American journalism student Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is on stage during the magic show of the magician Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London and tells her that the killer is aristocrat Peter Eman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra drags Sid into his investigation, looking for evidence that Peter is a murderer. However, she falls in love with him and wonders if Joe Strombel is right in his scoop. <br /> <br /> Scoop is another great Woody Allen comedy outside of Manhattan, actually again in London. His ironic and witty lines are just fantastic, and I laughed a lot, including over his fate as a hero in a country where people travel "from the wrong side." Sid Waterman is very funny, and Woody Allen is in great shape like a comedian. However, his current muse, Scarlett Johansson, from which I am a big fan, is over-active and annoying in many ways, including changing her focus to historical pronunciation. Her character is completely stupid and dissolute, and I was very disappointed with her performance (perhaps for the first time in her filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still fun and worthwhile entertainment. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Scoop? About Grande Furo” (“Scoop? Big Scoop”)
