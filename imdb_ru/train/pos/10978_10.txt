A few years ago, when I first looked at the Gray Gardens, I remember how I laughed and found a fun camp there. Years later, I still laugh out loud when I watch it, but after many views I came to see the beauty in a strange, distorted relationship between the inseparable "Big" Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter "Little" Edith Bouvier Beale. br /> <br /> Mother and daughter, living together in their decaying 28-room mansion in East Hampton, add a whole new meaning to the term "shabby chic". With countless cats, raccoons and possums as roommates, this aunt and niece of Jackie O. allowed filmmakers Albert and David Mailles to enter their mansion to film their lively daily lives. The result was a funny, beautiful, sad and touching story about true love and the rule of anarchy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Big and Little Edie is evidence of the inseparable connection of love. And their life is an example of aspiration, determination and free will. This film can recommend more than words. This is a rare experience that you should see for yourself. <br /> <br />
