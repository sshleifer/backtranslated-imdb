This film has problems in the presentation, it may even be offensive to people who are looking for temporary and cultural loyalty, but it makes the viewer think about a lot of problems. One of them is the nature and nature of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. The other is the historical nature of the Bible and faith. And third, the humanity of Jesus. The tension of the Christ traitor relationship is developed and maintained in the film. The passion of Judas seems darker than the passion of Christ. When Judas deprives himself of life, the viewer may feel fear. The denial and guilt of Peter, no matter how touching they may be, are not depicted as strongly as the drama of Judas. Chris Sarandon proposes a new and provocative Christ, plausible or not. I would like to find this film on DVD or even VHS for use in study or discussion groups.
