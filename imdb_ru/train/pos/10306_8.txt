As a person living near Buffalo, New York, this film scored me points before I saw it, since the story is based here. There are even some episodes with real people from Buffalo news television ... and, this time, it is not out of date. Hallelujah! <br /> <br /> Theological wisdom! God is still created to look and think like people ... and, of course, be a little liberal. Being an easy comedy, this is nothing that should win no awards, but it is still interesting and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are several funny comedic scenes and, I hope, the audience - from Christians to atheists. - got some of this, besides a few laughs, for example, what prayer really should be about, Kudos to the writers for at least understanding the correct theology and giving a good message. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good film that should offend very few.
