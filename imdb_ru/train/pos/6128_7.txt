Yes, this is the horror of the B-class. But at least producers, directors and actors do not pretend that this film is manna from heaven. The plot is a banal, psychotic serial killer on the way to execution, it is flooded with a genetic acid that turns it into a snowman. The snowman, known as Jack Frost, then begins a violent murder to find the sheriff of the small town, who finally arrested him. The crew had to manage with a limited budget with a limited special effect, most of the money is spent on a snowman costume. Particularly complex shots are performed using cartoons or panoramic shots (shots when the camera moves back to disguise the details). <br /> <br /> This is not a children's film, and should not be confused with a Disney film with the same name. If you do not allow your children to watch pg-13 movies alone, parents should not allow their children to watch this movie. This film has two claims for fame. 1. Beautiful Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) made her first major movie role. The scene where Jack Frost attacks Shannon Elizabeth is worth seeing several times. 2. In this film, the most terrible joke of the snowmen. The joke is so bad that the directors credit the cashier on the credit list.
