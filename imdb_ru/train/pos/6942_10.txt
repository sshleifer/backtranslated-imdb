In the fifties, the age limits for films in Brazil were as follows: unlimited, 10 years, 14 years and 18 years. Westerns were usually allowed for ten years, when they were subjected to a little more violence, they moved to 14, but rarely one could see the Western restriction for those under 18 years of age. Winchester 73 was one of them, and I think that explains very well how this film was considered different from the average. The hero, James Stewart, fought against his own brother, who killed their father. He was looking for revenge and seemed rather injured, far from the average good guy. Anthony Mann tried variations of characters of this type in the following films, which he shot with Stuart. Shelley Winters, the leading lady was far from being virtuous; she continued to follow the man who was left with the rifle. Dan Dourier as Waco Johnny Dean is one of those great villains who will always be remembered. The history of the film, which always follows the man who remains with a rifle, is one of the best, suitable for the West. This should have been done in the Fritz Lang film, which did not pass. When offered to Mann, he decided to start from scratch again and take nothing that was prepared for Lang. With Winchester, Mann created a different concept of Western, but still retaining all his traditions. “Winchester” is still a great film that can be seen again and again, but nothing compares to the impression he made on those who saw him when he was first released.
