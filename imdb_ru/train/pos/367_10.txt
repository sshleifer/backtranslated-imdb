"Violet" is really awesome. There is nothing of the kind, and I do not think there will ever be. This is a movie that brings emotion and pain to the viewer. The actors are flawless and the direction is great. I really liked it. The film never made me so happy. It is beautiful, it is the best way to explain it.
