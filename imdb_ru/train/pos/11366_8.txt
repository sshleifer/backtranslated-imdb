Gorgeous and convincing drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Stephen Rea's magnificent performance as a forensic scientist responsible for the investigation, which finds the greatest obstacle to his progress, is the Russian government, in particular the old members of the Communist Party, who want to support a closed society. <br /> <br /> The film has a main theme about the decline of the communist society, and the progress in finding a murderer is reflected in the progress in social and political changes in Russia, which is subtly reflected. There is a conflict of old and new ways, and they are represented by two points of view of Chief Rea (who is played by Donald Sutherland) and Ree himself. At first they are polarized: Sutherland “high” in the system looks down, and Pu “low” on the ground, looks up. However, they have a common cause? to catch the serial killer. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the relationship between the two develops and the tension gradually decreases, until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Ree and Sutherland mutually respect each other, the killer is caught, and symbolically appears publicity. Great script. <br /> <br /> Another merit in the performance of Sutherland, who is magnificent and responsive: Jeffrey Demann is a murderer whom we despise, but cannot hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is completely persuasive as a humble psychologist who risks his reputation , To help.
