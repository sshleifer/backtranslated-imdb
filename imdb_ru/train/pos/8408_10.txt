“It was not me! That was my twin brother Rupert! ”Bobby tells Dugan when he is faced with being with Sally. I have used this line dozens of times over the years (although no one has believed it yet). <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best of all time for pure fun and incredibility. Stephen Oliver was perfect for the role of Dugan, so much so that he was in Malibu Beach in 1978 as the same character (although not so much time on the screen). <br /> <br /> “No one calls Dugan a poop!” is another line for centuries. This classic film was definitely worth the price of admission.
