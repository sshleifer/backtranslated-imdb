A photographer from troubled men's magazine Adrian Wilde (well played by Michael Callan) has terrible nightmares in which he brutally kills his models. When cute ladies start to seem truly dead, Adrian is worried that he may be the killer. Writer / director William Byron Hillman tells a fascinating story at a steady pace, creates sensible stress, delivers several terribly effective moments of cruel misogynistic violence (one woman who has a plastic trash bag with a rattlesnake over her head). assesses a wave-inspiring zest), adds a refreshing accent to beautifully drawn and attractive realistic characters, further emphasizes everything in a believable everyday world and complements everything with a pleasant slice of delicious female nudity. A wonderful game from a great cast is very important to me: Joanna Pett, sunny charming mistress, Mindy Jordache, James Stacy in the role of macho-double amputated brother Adrian B Jay, Seymour Cassel as a caring psychiatrist Adrien, Dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter in the role Adriana's bad guys Assistant gay Louis, Pamela Hensley as a fearless detective in the murder of Sergeant Fontan, Cliveon Little as the head of the police with a hard nose and Misty Row as the cute, bubbly model of Bambi. R. Michael Stringer's polished cinematography makes it possible to use impressive panoramic images from the air. Jack Gogi's ominous roaring account also does his job. In the steep episodes, Robert Tessier appears as a rude bartender, Sally Kirkland as a daring prostitute, Katie Dush as fierce female wrestlers fighting the ring, and Francis Bay in one of her standard roles as an old woman. Solid and nice image.
