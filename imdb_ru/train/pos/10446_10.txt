I watched this movie 10 years ago. and since then have watched it on video on average once a year. This is a type of film that is timeless, because the themes are universal, but the stories and conversations are so personal. it is also one of the very few films that captures you from the first frame to the credits roll, despite the fact that there are only two (very exciting) characters. this is largely due to the attractive game Hawk and Delpy, which makes us believe that they are in fact Jess and Celine. This is also the first film I saw in which reality TV was mentioned, and now this phenomenon is flourishing! I love how this movie simply covers the audience in its space and makes you think, no matter how exhausted you are, that you are one of these characters. it also made me want to ride the train around europe! I have not met anyone who could not be related to this film. maybe it says about myself, my friends or just about the genius of this film.
