Not sure why it doesn't play in Peoria, obviously, but this is a very funny, clever British comedy. It is set at the end of the swinging sixties. Peter Sellars is fantastic as a rich forty-year-old serial womanizer. The absolutely amazing Goldie Hawn, who plays the 19-year-old American girl in London, is at first the “prey of the day” by Sellars. But the culinary television critic cannot help but fall in love with the dizzying American blonde. <br /> <br /> Humor, pathos, magnificent script, strong presentations of presenters and supporting caste. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, and the best game is the very last line. <br /> <br /> Try it, you will like it.
