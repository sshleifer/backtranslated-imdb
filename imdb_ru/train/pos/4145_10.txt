This is not the Masterpiece Theater. You should not go into it, waiting for it. This is a clean girl with the most fantastic cast. As someone else said here, this film “Mama-Mama” was supposed to be. And the only drawback of this film is that Tina Fey wasn’t in it, except that the most intelligent and bright girls on the planet were shot in it. This film is just nonsense on the surface, but if you really look, you will realize that it has many messages and deep meanings for any of us who would like them to come back and do it again and again in their lives, knowing that we know NOW PLEASURE PLEASURE and I recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape.
