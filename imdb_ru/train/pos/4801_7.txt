I watched it with my whole family when I was 9 years old, in 1964 on our black and white TV. I remember my father saying that "this is how it could happen - Adam and Eve." I remember very well the scene when Adam finds Eve, her eyes turn black. I asked my father why her eyes were black, and he said because she was tired and hungry. I have not seen this episode for 45 years and still remember him well - television programs with my home planet back and forth, scenes of bombs that shook headquarters, with the final scene in which two leave, Adam carries his bag, and Eve follows her. Perhaps it was not a theatrical work of art, but it certainly left an impression on me all these years.
