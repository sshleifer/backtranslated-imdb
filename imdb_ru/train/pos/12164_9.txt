In the year of pretentious mud, such as Sinekdoche, New York, a film that was born out of Charlie Kaufman’s own indulgence, a film is released that is also difficult to watch, but about three times more important. “Frownland” is a labor of love of the whole team, actors and director, filmed over the years by friends. It traces a person who cannot communicate through his completely authentic, REAL Brooklyn world. The people you see are a step beyond even the styling of the “mumbling” movement. These are real people, painfully locked into their own neuroses, unwilling to change, incapable. For them, the real world is their own set of misconceptions, and since this is a film about people who are not so deeply in the know, it is very difficult to watch. This 16-mm filming without proper lighting, money, or any other factors that would make the film “smooth,” but its honesty cannot be understated, a fact that would make a room full of people reject it for Richard Linklater, to give him a reward, as he did in SXSW. It really reminds movies like “Naked” or the best of “Mumblecore”. This is a film that is not for everyone, but one that challenges you to look at it, and the longer you think about it, the more you like it.
