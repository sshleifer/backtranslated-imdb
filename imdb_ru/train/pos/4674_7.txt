What percentage of movies do people visit these days, and they wonder what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER: TOO MUCH! This film is not like that. This is a story about real people, who are sometimes both pleasant and unattractive. <br /> <br /> Disadvantage: <br /> <br /> Insufficient character development and some plot lines left spinning in the wind. <br /> <br /> Upside: <br /> <br /> Makes the audience think about the choices they have made in their lives, good or bad. <br /> <br /> Well played: Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, Ato Essando and Elliot Court. <br /> <br /> Contains a good, carefree humor.
