If you like movies about animals, this movie will make you happy. My wife loves animals and animal films, she especially likes the parrot in this film. He is focused on children, but I laughed at most of the humor. The French fashion character made me laugh and adds balance to the script. This is a Disney movie with its juicy, happy, family love, but I like to leave the theater with a positive feeling.
