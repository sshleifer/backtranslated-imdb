Cinema Retro Magazine No. 2 states that Mark Lester’s voice was actually voiced by 20-year-old Katt Green. Although Leste was considered ideal for the title role, director Carol Reed was not at all pleased with his singing abilities. The secret was revealed in a 2004 British documentary entitled “Oliver! After they became famous. ” Green paid £ 400 for her work, and she had to agree to keep her secret, as did Mark Leicester. They kept their word and revealed this fact only in the framework of a television show decades after the film was released. For reference, Mark Lester retired from acting and is a practicing osteopath in England.
