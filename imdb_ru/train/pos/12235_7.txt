“Incredible Melting Man” is a fantastically rude, dirty and energetic production of Z-rank, which every self-respecting camp-horror just has to see for himself! The perfect way to describe this low-budget gem of the 70s is like a shameless replica of Hammer's "Quatermass Xperiment" ... just a thousand times dirtier! Astronaut Steve West is the only survivor of a catastrophic cosmic mission, but he is a carrier of a terrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... makes him melt! In shock, seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve runs out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off parts of the body. Dr. Ted Nelson has to find him urgently, as the disease also caused Steve an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The premise may sound completely silly, but this film is extremely interesting and contains excellent makeup effects from Rick Baker's hand. The face of a melting dude looks like a rotting pizza, and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader! Another great advantage is that the William Sachs script does not waste time on tiresome scientific explanations or emotional speeches. Disgust begins immediately and lasts until the very last moment of the film. Just enjoy this silly terrible horror and try to turn off your brain activity as much as possible, because if you start thinking about the many nonsense in the script, you will miss all the fun entertainment!
