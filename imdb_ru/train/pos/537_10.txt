For me, “The Question of Life and Death” is simply the best film ever made. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, he exudes a class. It stimulates, makes you wonder, is a mirror for the postwar world and relations between nations. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is simply overwhelming, and the blending effect of monochrome and Technicolor to accentuate different worlds works without problems. The development of the characters and the plot is almost perfect, and the attention to detail contributes to a very believable fantasy. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times I watch a movie — and watch a lot of it — it never stops touching me. It makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it makes me think, it makes me cry. Today it is as fresh as it was in 1946. <br /> <br /> If they allowed me to leave only one film and watch it again, the film “Life and Death” would be this film.
