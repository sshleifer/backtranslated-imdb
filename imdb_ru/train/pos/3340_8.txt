“Fever Pitch” is a pleasant and charming addition to the small genre of sports novels, in which you can watch date films or films to which the son could go with his mother (although the guys from the public were noticeably worried during the romantic scenes). br /> <br /> I experienced a milder version of this story, since my first acquaintance with baseball took place on a date with my husband in the spring after winning the Mets World Championship, and then I watched as the Mets grabbed their next one because I it was the one that still weekend with our two little sons, who grew up to teach me more about baseball through other heartbreaking setbacks of our local national league to win it again (and it was I who took our eldest son in his only game at Fenway Park, when I picked up a little Red Sox fever as a graduate student in Boston). <br /> <br /> Thus, compared to reality, the scenario plausibly creates two people with real work. Particularly impressive is that Drew Barrymore's character is a serious workaholic with anti-Barbie skills, although she mostly only visits her three girlfriends during gym workouts, which allow a lot of jokes, and the side stories with her parents are not completely work. <br /> <br /> Even it is reliably established how she meets the teacher of mathematics Jimmy Fallon and how she falls in love with his “winter guy” - although it is surprising that his apartment in the Red Sox did not fill it with his Jekyll-Hyde guy". The crisis of their relationship during the baseball season is also played out in an adult way: from compromise efforts to its overt problems with it, centered around the fact that they both face thirty and none. Fallon unexpectedly rises to the gradual emotional maturity of his character. <br /> <br /> Although the finale borrows heavily from O. Henry, the scriptwriters did an excellent job of quickly incorporating the incredible 2004 Sox season into the revised storyline (with much cooperation from the Red Sox organization for filming at the stadium). <br /> <br /> The script goes all out to explain why Fallon doesn’t have a Boston accent, like a New Jersey immigrant, but that doesn’t explain why his colorful friends don't do that. The most authentic sounds of Boston come from the majority of his “summer family” of other season ticket holders who kindly tell the basics of Sox knowledge to newcomer Barrymore (and any other members of this audience). <br /> <br /> Song The favorites include many Red Sox fans, starting with the introductory notes of the classic “Dirty Water”, although most of them are considered to be heard for the final credits, as if you were listening to local radio and are worthy of hear.
