Although Kurt Russell was and probably the closest person to Elvis in show business, a lot was false in this movie. First, the creators claimed that Elvis opened his famous live performances in '69 after a 9-year-old movie hunt in a white sportswear suit of 1972. They also claimed that he sang “hot love”, which he sang in 1972 “the miracle of you”, which he first recorded in 1970. They also claim that he got his first guitar at Christmas, when all Elvis fans know that he got it on his birthday. I know that in all films based on the past, there is something false, but these things are so obvious to people who like Elvis.
