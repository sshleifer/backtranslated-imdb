That is why I love this site so much! I saw this film in the 1980s on British television. Over the years I would like to know more about him, because he stayed with me as one of the most unusual things I have ever seen in my life. Having just a few key words to remember him, I traced the film here and a lot of information, including the fact that he was going to be a musical outside Broadway! <br /> <br /> Interestingly, unlike the previous comment creator, I don’t remember to find this movie sad or exploitative. On the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between mother and daughter is stuck in the mind as evidence of great strength, honor and dignity. Ironically, you might think, given the poverty of your life. Maybe this is because I live in Britain, where fading greatness has an established language in the life of old money, where poverty is often allowed as evidence of good breeding; I saw it as a rare and unique image of great spirit, deep and deep humor, whose extremely fragile and elegantly balanced fabric gave him balance and respect. In a sense, I was sorry to see it discussed as a “cult”. Over the past years, as he disappeared in my mind, he has shone the brightest, first of all, to others as a brilliant and outstanding television experience. It was so deep in private exposure that it was strange to think that it had become so public that it became a New York musical. But, perhaps, somewhere the daughter will be surprised by such an outcome. Maybe it was she who would be the last to laugh ... (They made a musical out of her before you, Jackie O ')
