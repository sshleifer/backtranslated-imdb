The "twelve monkeys" have all the elements to become Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. Outstanding script, steady rhythm, smart, sometimes ironic dialogues. Moreover, he was well versed in the cast. Twelve Monkeys is also the first film in which Bruce Willis departs from the character he played in his previous films. Here, the exhausted and hopeless character, who can be called the prisoner's nickname, has moved from a fearless and invincible hero (as it was in “Die Hard”). No matter how hard he tried, he was captured by that time. The film also contains a very exciting ending. He has real dramatic power. But this terrific film is also a reflection of a person, the dangers that he fears (especially those that can cause the end of the world, and here it is a virus that can create diseases). No matter how long it takes, the “twelve monkeys” will be judged by the true meaning: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.
