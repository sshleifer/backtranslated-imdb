"In Cold Blood," adapted by director Richard Brooks from Truman Capote's famous novel, talks about the cruel and senseless killing of a family of four by a pair of unfortunate criminals. The film stands out as a study of the killers' characters, in particular the Perry Smith trigger (Robert Blake). <br /> <br /> In the cast there are few recognizable names, but, nevertheless, they easily enliven the story. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson together are excellent as two criminals with different personalities. They play with each other effortlessly, while Blake also gets plenty of opportunity to learn the characteristics of his character. The rest of the cast is just average and not worth noticing. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks was nominated for an Oscar for both the script and the direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, although the script is miscalculated with some rash narration in the later stages. Oscar-nominated cinematography, Konrad Hall is also first-class, as is editing. Also worth noting is the jazz score of Quincy Jones, which received the last of four Oscar nominations in the film. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other crime films, this film does not embellish violence. Brooks turns the killers into deplorable characters, rather than decisively condemns them. Do you agree with this opinion, the film is an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend the film for this reason, as well as experience with technical aspects.
