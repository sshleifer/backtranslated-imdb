Yes, as other reviewers have already noted, this may not be a vintage L & H, but this is far from the worst of their work, as in 20th Century Stupid ... I mean Fox. In this film, of course, has all the basic ingredients that the boys did not succeed. But their serious approach and determination make them ridiculous. They don't play it for fun, like other comedians might, but they take their work and situation quite seriously, and this is the essence of their eternal humor. In this film, they face some of the major problems that any of us can really face today, namely work-related stress. First, the doctor will check us in, and he will prescribe a much-needed rest and maybe stop at the sea. That's where surrealism comes to all this. L & H always accepts the most plausible circumstances and exaggerates them, but not to such an extent as to be unbelievable, except maybe once. This makes us laugh, because we can relate to their complacent difficulties and attempts to exit. That's what makes Stan and Ollie versatile in its appeal. In this film, all these ingredients are presented exquisitely skillfully and gracefully. Not in the best way compared to their early work, probably because it was the last film they shot for Roach, because he wanted to reflect on the “big” studios and create exclusive features, and also wanted to hurry and finish his contractual obligations. BIG MISTAKE! They had to stay together and continue for another five years. That the world may have missed without considering it as an option. Watch, laugh and enjoy it as the last great show.
