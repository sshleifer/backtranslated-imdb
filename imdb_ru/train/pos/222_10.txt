Neil Simon's hilarious comedy that makes you laugh from beginning to end. The late Walter Mattau is a grumpy ex-comedian who is urged to join his ex-partner (the late Oscar-winner George Burns) for the final reunion show on stage. <br /> <br /> Benjamin Martin is Matto's agent and nephew, and both have the same chemistry as Mattau and Burns. I love the grumpy character Mattau - he is the same as always, and at the same time completely different. <br /> <br /> Burns, like a distracted old man, is as funny as Mattau. <Br /> <br /> Matthau: Want crackers? I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: How about a simple cracker? <br /> <br /> Mattaw: I have nothing. I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: good <br /> <br /> Matteo: They are in the closet in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> Burns: maybe later. <br /> <br /> Or how about this: <br /> <br /> Mattau: When I did black, the whites knew what I was talking about! <br /> <br /> You got to see it in the film, to understand it! <br /> <br /> In general, a refreshingly cheerful, sweet, soulful, warm, attractive comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time. <br /> <br /> They just don't make them that way anymore! At a time when all the latest comedy cheeses are juvenile and stupid, this returns to the tender essence of what comedy really is - funny characters, intelligent and funny dialogues and great entertainment. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedic friends of all time, right there with “Planes, Trains and Cars”, “Deadly Weapons” and “Difficult Way”. <br /> <br /> You may find it difficult to find it for rent or on TV, but trust me, it will be worth your time! <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 stars. <br /> <br /> - john ulmer
