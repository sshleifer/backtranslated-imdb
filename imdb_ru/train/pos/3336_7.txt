I have to admit that I left Fever Pitch with low expectations. It will not be a great revelation for me to say that the last Jimmy Fallon movie (Taxi) was Catwoman Bad, and the Fever trailers were fine, but they did not hypnotize me. I already prepared some funny baseball games for my review ... <br /> <br /> "I like Jimmy Fallon, but Taxi was the first in his film career. Well, now we have steeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo! One more hit, and he’s back to SNL! "or" Buy yourself some peanuts and crackers, but don’t buy Fever Pitch tickets. You’ll leave the theater and never come back! " Then the film was supposed to be more interesting than I expected. But hey, I couldn’t allow my puns to be wasted, right? Another reason I thought I didn't care about the film was because I hate the Boston Red Sox. My whole family hates them. The mere mention of Pedro Martinez’s name makes me run to the bathroom. Oh wait ... <br /> <br /> ... Well, I'm back. In any case, my mother, who is a fan of the St. Louis Cardinals, still believes that the World Series was rigged last year. She refuses to believe that Sox won it legally. But I’m human enough to admit that Fever Pitch made me sympathize, albeit slightly, with the plight of the Red Sox fans. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has a passion for sports will be able to relate to this film at some level. If you do not have a favorite sports team, you cannot fully understand the extreme highs and lows that a fan like Ben Fallon can go through. There is nothing more fresh than the smell of the new season, and nothing smoother than pure slate. Well, figuratively speaking. It is a joy to be a sports fan. “Wait till next year” becomes your mantra, your motto, your prayer - and “Fever” effectively reflects this essence. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that the film takes a fictional story and throws it against the real backdrop of the incredible Red Sox World Series launched last year. I do not like it so much that I want to marry him, but you know what I mean. I expected this to be handled rather stupidly, and although some of the humor is a bit stupid, in fact it is quite realistic. <br /> <br /> You see, Uncle Ben took him to his first game at the Red Sox, when he was 7 years old, and when he died, he left Ben his two season tickets. Ben has not missed the game for 23 years. At the beginning of each season, he comes to a draft day when he and his friends get together to find out who and what games to go to. He makes everyone dance for Yankee games, and whenever someone complains, he threatens them with tickets to games with Royals (sorry, Mr. Shade) and Devil Rays. This is a very good scene, and it works so well, because I really know people who are arranging the “day of the call to sell tickets”. I also have to admit that I can relate to when Ben goes to dinner with Lindsay and her parents. The Red Sox are playing a road game, but instead of watching it live on TV, Ben decides to record it on tape. One of the most dangerous things in life is listening to the game, and then publicity and trying not to hear the result. Was there. This is a very tense and scary situation. Well, okay, Ben enters the danger zone when a guy appears in a restaurant and mentions that he is watching the game. Ben immediately closes his ears and starts screaming like a banshee so as not to hear the result. Lindsay is confused, and her parents don't know what to think. Yes, sports fans can be strange, I do not deny that. But it is real. <br /> <br /> Now, if you expect the rough, sharp things for which the Farrelli Brothers are famous, you may be disappointed. They do have their moments, for example, when Ben says he likes the way Lindsay sometimes speaks from her mouth “like a charming stroke victim”, but overall this is definitely a softer, more romantic side that the brothers demonstrate. <br /> <br /> Not to say that the film ever becomes too sharp. Fortunately, when the juice starts to trickle, Farrells know when to break away. The romantic moment when Lindsay jumps across the field and runs up to Ben to announce his undying love for him turns into Ben, sincerely responding: “You have to tell me about the outfield. Is it spongy? ”Jimmy Fallon proves that he can do well with himself on the big screen with the right material, and Drew Barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy charm. Fever Pitch is just good, solid entertainment that takes a fresh look at the genre of romantic comedy. This is a movie guys and girls can relate to. Especially the guys who practice sports fanaticism at some point during the year, and the women who need to deal with them. <br /> <br /> Now, if Red Sox fans please shut up on the “Curse of Bambino”, I would be grateful. you. <br /> <br /> GIST Fans of Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore, romantic comedy, Red Sox, baseball or sport. Fanaticism in general should consider looking at Fever Pitch. I would not hurry and see him for the first time, but he will get an excellent matinee. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.25 (of 5)
