My super ex-girlfriend was a pleasant surprise for me, I was really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? It was! But this film had so many wonderful laughs and a funny plot that anyone could enjoy the game. I know it was a very funny movie, but Uma and Anna were so cool, and Steve was a great addition, as well as a great cast that looked like they had a lot of fun, and that was what made the film really work. <Br /> <br /> Jenny Johnson (scary, this is my best friend's real name) is not an ordinary woman, like a librarian, when Matt, your average man, asks her, he has more than he expected, he asked G-Girl for a date, super hero of the world! But when he finds out what a jealous and crazy girl she is and decides that it is a good idea that they will spend some time separately, but Jenny won't have him because he fell in love with another girl, Hannah, and she will make him life is a living hell, I mean, let's face it, he could not choose the best girl to part with her. <br /> <br /> The effect was banal, but you seriously move past them quickly, the story and the cast made the story really working, and I loved Mind in this film, it was such a step forward from Prime. My super ex-girlfriend is a funny movie that should not be taken seriously, it's just a cute romantic comedy, and I think that if I could laugh at it, anyone could. <br /> <br /> 7/10
