Richard Willims is the god of animation. He was hampered by the director of this film producer. The end product is a very jagged film with a very confusing story, but with some amazing animation moments (for example, Emery Hawkins' Greed). Repeating music by Joe Raposo doesn't help either. It was made on a wide screen, so VHS does not show it in all its glory, let's hope that some day DVDs with boxes will appear. However, you should pay attention to some stunning animation.
