In this satire of commercialization and “frivolousness” of war, John Cusack plays Brand Hauser, the murderer who was sent to Turakistan to kill Omar Sharif, who is involved in the oil business, which will create problems for the former US Vice President's own company. In addition to this, Hauser has to rig his fake position as an exhibition producer, a wedding with pop princess Yonika (Hillary Duff) and curious liberal journalist Natalie (Marisa Tomei). <br /> <br /> Evaluating the technical aspects: <br /> <br /> - The game (at least the main characters) was good, as expected. Some of John Cusack’s conversations were clearly not written for him, as he often found it inconvenient to say this. may be unrealistically more accurate. Joan presented an excellent and often fun performance. Marisa Tomei, although I was never a big fan of her, was more than suitable for this role and worked well. Hillary Duff, however, was pretty terrible. They needed an attractive pop star in the Middle East (or Russian, or whoever it was). Unfortunately, they went 0 for 3 with her. <br /> <br /> - As I said above, the letter seemed a bit stiff and irrelevant in some points, especially the dialogue of John Cusack. Not a lot, mind, but some. This story has also become a bit ridiculous in some moments, which is good for satire, but raised it to a whole new level. Fortunately, Cusacks and Tomei everywhere retain relatively calm, calm behavior, and this creates a pleasant mixture of film madness and balancing of the actors. <br /> <br /> - Joshua Seftel, who previously had a drought of real titles to his name, did a good job with a fairly wide range of film. He coped very well with a small ($ 10 million) budget, stretching it to make it seem much bigger. Seftel also managed to mix the humor of the story. , with painful and hard-to-reach parts of the present war (including the killing of civilians, etc.). <br /> <br /> - As for the general satire, her exaggerated view of the commercialization of the war is very well done, especially the advertising of Golden Palace Poker on American tanks. At some point it becomes too much, but in the end, it still accurately reflects what is happening with the young style of Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is very well made for a tight budget, and it is definitely worth a look. This will not be considered one of the greatest satire of the movie, but it certainly is not the worst. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
