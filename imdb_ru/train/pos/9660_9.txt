Only after some thought did I decide that I liked this film. And after reading the comments from all the other posters here and having thought it over, I decided that I really enjoyed it. I love American films - probably because they are so narrative. Usually they have a clearly defined beginning, middle and end. Presque rien, on the other hand, makes no such attempt. I disagree with other posters that say it is “too fancy.” In all respects, this film is intended to awaken your sensual memories. So often throughout the film you feel that you are there ... you feel the summer sun, breezes, heat, winter cold, communication, loneliness, etc., etc. And so on. And so on. In all respects, the director pulls in bringing you to life is why so many people feel so bad that the film disappointed them. After I finished watching it, I felt the same. But, on reflection, I realized that the film should be like this: “story” is not a story, but the emotions that you (the viewer) are experiencing. <br /> <br /> Lighting, scenery, and camera angles immerse you in scenes - they are rich, elegant and full of details and nuances. Although I usually can not watch movies without a fully developed plot (after all, the film should not tell a story), this film is definitely one of my new favorites.
