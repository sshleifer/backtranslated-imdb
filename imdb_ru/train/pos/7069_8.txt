It is said that Dina Durbin invented a teenager. This first film was one of the best. Humorous story presented a delightful 14-year-old Dinna, a small beautiful woman with a gorgeous voice, as Miss Fixit in a family divided by divorce. For a brief description of the story, see other IMDb records, but Deanna and her two older sisters quickly plan to go to America from Switzerland to prevent her father from remarrying. With an excellent cast, especially Barbara Reed and Nan Gray in the role of sisters, a good director and editor, the film managed to capture it even on subsequent shows. Of the three songs of Dinna only "Il Bacio" from the classical repertoire, but when she sings it on the stage of the police station, the place of the film in history is guaranteed. At least for this viewer, who at the age of 15 was amazed for the rest of his life with both Dina and classical music. One of the many nice features that occur in THREE SMART GIRLS is a brief glimpse of a drunken, stretching neck to see Deanna when the cops push him! One unfortunate result of the success of this film was that subsequent authors for Durbin's vehicles were locked up in the theme "Miss Fixit", which quickly became outdated. Dinna herself never did. Her status as an actress is more dubious than her charisma, which she certainly had. It seems to me that, like many other characters in the film, she replaced “naturalness” with historical abilities that she lacked. The trick worked well for 21 feature films.
