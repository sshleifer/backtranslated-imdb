A group of people travels to Belgrade on a terrible bus headed by a drunk guide and his stupid son (who likes to drive with eyes closed). Their journey is often interrupted by many fun events, which with great irony describe the fall of the nationâ€™s spirit in 1941 and are so funny that even today they are used as ordinary jokes. The man who "steals the show" is a peasant 4 feet tall with his 4 sons, who are almost twice his size. In the end, the film takes one dramatic turn, and the journey becomes nothing more than the swan song of a dying country.
