Speaking in a role of a kind in the early stage of the Great Escape, 13 years later, this stunning little British film shows it straight, without thrill, and dares to exaggerate. The first part of the film is the preparation and subsequent escape of our main characters, and the second part is devoted to their survival, while they are trying to get to Sweden. The film relies on clean characters with a simple, effective and, yes, plausible dialogue to bring it to the end, and it perfectly achieves its goals. A bit of uncertainty makes the movie tick, and, like an adventure story, it works fine for a period of time that it sticks to, so what are the thumbs up for a movie that may well be the first of its kind ?. <br /> 7/10
