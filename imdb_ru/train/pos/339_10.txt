I read Schneebaum’s book (the same title as this film) when it was first published, and was deeply touched by his ability to see through many ways of “otherness” (himself and the people of Amazon, with whom he lived and loved) the way live a decent life. His subsequent books were not so strong, but showed his ongoing search. His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was far ahead of his time in the early 60s, but his honesty and openness on this occasion were welcomed. This film perfectly conveys the quirkiness and generosity of a person, but also gives an idea of ​​the inevitable destruction of innocence (which in this case is not a morally positive term), which occurs when “civilized” people invade traditional societies. Nevertheless, Schneebaum himself turned into a kind of innocence, which suggests the possibility of saving mankind from its own destructive power.
