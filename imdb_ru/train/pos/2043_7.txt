I just saw this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival, where it was shown in the Midnight Madness section. In truth, the only reason I went to this film was that he shared his name with the song Radiohead, and also because my friend bought the tickets, so I really had no choice: it was that something like "Silence of the Lambs," but it turned out that this is a semi-dry film. Someone has already mentioned that none of the characters are cute, and this is absolutely correct. I really didnâ€™t care if the character Potenti pulled out her insides from Creep. I was rooting for the homeless to survive with Potente's character, who received it only desserts. Christopher Smith certainly did a great job with the visual aspect of the film. Nevertheless, the story is rather weak, but on the other hand, the whole point of the film was to scare you to shit, and he did it quite effectively. The score of the Bristol group The Insects was top notch. This, more than anything, really scared me to shit. <br /> <br /> The director was a really decent guy and was quite interesting during the question and answer session. I really hope that in the future he will get the best films. <br /> <br /> This film is intended exclusively for fans of the genre, but I would recommend that non-fans try it anyway. It was a fun ride.
