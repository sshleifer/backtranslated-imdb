If you like Deep Purple, you'll love this wonderful movie starring Stephen Rea. The story of the most famous 70s rock band, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But, of course, there will be many problems at their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great, and "The Flame Still Burns" is great. You should watch this.
