I just saw it last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporationâ€™s Passionate Eye TV series. This was shown recently (September 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival, as well as in many others. This is a pretty wonderful movie. The filmmakers literally stumbled upon this story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they were right in the middle of the events when the coup took place. They had unprecedented access to events and people, and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens. They, of course, have their own ideological perspective (which they make obvious), but they keep themselves in the shadows and instead try to focus on events, people, as well as on the history and history that led to the revolution. As a film, it is not innovative in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and I think it should be so. What we will see, what should be the "built-in" journalism. What we see is a wonderful story about a country that is fighting for democracy ... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who really cares about his people ... a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate / military / media interests unite to a coup of a democratically elected leader ... and unprecedented access to a historic event as it progresses. <br /> <br />
