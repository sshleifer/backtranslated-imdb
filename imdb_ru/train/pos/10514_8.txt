Emma is a horribly spoiled movie based on the classic Jane Austen novel. I did not read the book, so I really didn’t know so much about the plot, and yet I still predicted almost the whole plot. There were also many scenes that upset me because of bad writing or directing. Although the film is for some reason very interesting, and I really liked it. Of course, there were all the scenes that I didn’t like, but most were nice and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best heroines as Emma. The film also starred Tony Collett (who has it all good, but it was much better) Evan Mekgreger (who also had better, but he is still very good) Alan Cumming (who never impressed me and is a lot like here) and Jeremy Northham (whose performance at first glance is rather wooden, but in fact quite subtle, even if it was not what he needed). The books of Jane Austen were much better adapted, but this one is still very interesting and worth seeing.
