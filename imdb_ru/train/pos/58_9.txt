I caught the tail of this channel, looking through cable channels, and was so intrigued that I was looking for the next show. <br /> <br /> I really didn’t know what to expect after reading the program’s summary, but I came out of this film, feeling rather anxious and upset. It also gave me, as an adult who attended high school in the 80s, a little better understanding of what our children must fight these days. <br /> <br /> The fact that you do not see the shooting only adds to the coldness of the plot. Seeing, like a child, and an adult, trying to understand and reconcile with senseless skirmishes, was at times overwhelming. And I admit that I shed a lot of tears everywhere. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is not the one that I would be looking for, but I'm sure glad to see him.
