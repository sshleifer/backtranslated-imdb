witty. funny. smart. cool. I switched channels late at night many years ago. stumbled upon this and started a forest fire. I didn’t sleep every night and wrote it down for everyone I know. Little. like 3 people out of almost 100 people I did watched, but I didn’t think it was as cool as me. others laughed so loudly that they cried and thanked me at the same time. please do yourself a favor. run, don't go. watch it and enjoy. intelligence and humor. This is a win-win situation. I would like to have an afternoon tea with him and meet a really rare comedian whom we, as a society, need more ... sanechaos.
