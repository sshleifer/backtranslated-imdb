From the rainy, dreary late winter of England in the early 1920s ... where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled veterinarians from the great slaughter of men and the killer of the dreams of their women- Now known as World War I ... <br /> <br /> Four women share this beautiful little sunny Italian castle on a hill; one young widow who is buried in her crazy parties, two women who will rediscover their husbands, and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends ... <br /> <br /> ... These four women will gather together with two husbands and a former soldier — almost blind — to receive spiritual "restructuring" for one great April holiday in the early 1920s in Italy. <br /> <br /> NOTE for future directors. Study this film to find out how mood and beauty can tell a story. (Perhaps this is not a movie to please many men ...) <br /> <br /> NOTE: Stock up on coffee and hot chocolate and invite the girls on some dreary late winter day ... Spring is coming ... Enchanted April promises you!
