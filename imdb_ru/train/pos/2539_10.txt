For real cinema people, this film is simply necessary, since it works as an ideal little allegory for the films themselves. The science of Janos Ruh / Boris Karloff is associated with the capture and projection of light from cosmic phenomena. This light can cause harm, or it can be used for good. On the one hand, it blinds his mother, on the other, it is used to treat blindness (“I see!” A young girl screams on whose eyes this light is projected). When Ruh / Karloff himself is poisoned by the supernatural power of this light, we see that he actually radiates a ghostly shine on his hands and face as a poorly developed negative, drawing attention to the fact that the person we are watching is a projection, the object shown on film (as seen in a movie theater when the lights are off). <br /> <br /> In the beginning there is a wonderful passage in which Karloff / Ruch explains his research with the fact that everything that happens is captured by light that rolls through space for millions of years, as light from Andromeda emitted from this Galaxy while the earth was still molten rock. <br /> <br /> There are excerpts in the film in which this new science is compared with more ancient cultural means: the science of the writer in the form of Beula Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and the religion depicted on the sculptural figures in the local cathedral. Karlov blows up his projector / beam gun. <br /> <br /> Here you have to wonder if this film was intended to look at what was happening in Germany at that time, and especially how Riefenstall used the film a year earlier to promote a regime that, will certainly continue to cause a lot of harm: the triumph of the will. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Mother eventually intervenes (Violet Kemble Cooper), reminding Janos Ruch of the first rule of science. <br /> <br /> If only more films made you stand up in the theater and shout: “I see!”
