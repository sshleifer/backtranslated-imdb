Soilent Green ... really good movie. <br /> <br /> I would never have thought about it. I don't really like Heston in his science fiction. He is one of those actors who, like Superman, manages to face all the mocking and invincible most of the time. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. And indeed, he also mockingly sneaks through most of Soilent Green, but since he has to play for the self-confident bully, I don’t mind. <br /> <br /> I understand why some people turn their noses in this film. Soilent Green makes no effort to create futuristic visual effects (which, as you know, looks like 1973), and lacks action. But I admired the film’s vision of a complex, corrupt, and very stratified society, and I was so pleased to see that Edward J. Robinson played such a touching, funny last role. Good little moments of character - for example, when he shares some precious products with Heston - really make a film. <br /> <br /> Soylent Green is very relevant today, when it seems no one knows what the hell the government or corporations are up to. It's funny, though, to see Heston in the Michael Moore film prototype ...
