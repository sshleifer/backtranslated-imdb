I watched this movie when I was 13 years old, and I really liked Dana Plato, who later starred in different series as Kimberly Drummond. I don't think this is rubbish. It should not have been a continuation of the documentary. It's just a cute kid's movie about three kids who are chasing men trying to find a swamped monster in a creek. men are injured, and children are saved by the creature. Arkansas-hunting swamps and landscapes were neat. This is a good film for children, without real violence, a few small scares, but good fun for young children.
