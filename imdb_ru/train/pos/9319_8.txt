....... Playing Caddidlhopper, Colonel San Fernando, etc., the man was quite versatile and screamed. I like to watch him communicate with Amanda Blake, or Don Notts, or someone else - he obviously had a ball, and I think he made it easier for his guests - as long as they knew beforehand, it was not disciplined, 19 take the type of production. Relax and have fun - this is clearly the name of the game. <br /> <br /> He reminds me of guys like Milton Burl, Benny Hill, maybe Jerry Lewis too. Great time, ancient jokes that kept the audience in the seams for decades, great pleasure from what he did. His sad little clown, which he played, was also good - but touching. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think he's great, having just bought two DVD-sets of his shows from or so, he brings it back to love me. I remember seeing him on TV at the end of his run, when he finished the series in 1971 or so. <br /> <br /> See if you are a fan or curious. He was a riot.
