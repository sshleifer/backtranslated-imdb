I bought Dark Angel “Seasons 1 and 2” two weeks ago, after I caught a couple of episodes of season 1 on channel 5. Nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is. I haven't gotten anything special since Firefly (as well as a terrific show). I admit that season 2 is not so good, but there are a few more amazing episodes (see “Mark This”, “Bag-Em”, “Burrisford Agenda”, “Harbor Lights”, “Strange Nation”, etc. D.) And Alec is great. I heard some plans for the future of season 3, and I have to say, I cannot believe that it was canceled - I won’t spoil it for you - but it would shock! I also think that he has a lot of potential, like a movie (although at the moment it seems unlikely). As proof of my obsession, Max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks that I had, I’m 3 episodes from watching both seasons twice. It's just too good.
