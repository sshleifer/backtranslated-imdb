There are a few clich√©s in this series and some great moments resembling the Dawson Creek (a 16-year-old teenager says that life once made sense?), But in general it looks like a decent show. Most of the characters seem very real, and the story seems to be well advanced in the pilot game - at the end it ends with a good lesson. I just hope that every episode will not be as life-changing as the first, it would be too dramatic for this car. In his youth, Jeremy Sumpter does an excellent job with baseball passion, I think that many of us could relate to his awe and sometimes the tunnel vision of the team, of which he always wanted to be a part.
