The performance of Victor McLaglen - one of the best in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> I think we can all feel “Gypo” because we all struggled with what is right and what is not and what is not. It was one of the first art-house pictures released by a large American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures). <br /> <br /> Joseph H. Augustus cinematography is the best here. However, the staggering part of August was largely missed; He did not get an Oscar nomination, which he rightfully deserves. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama with thought, philosophy, sadness, conveyed as few words as possible.
