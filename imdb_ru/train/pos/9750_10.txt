Yes, Giorgio, this is a good movie. A bit of romance, great music, beautiful landscapes, comedy, (great culinary battle) and a bit bitter-sweet taste - these are the components of "Yes, Giorgio" Any movie lover will enjoy this film. Those who require massive special effects should look elsewhere. Most of us need to escape a little from time to time, and how best to do this than a treat for the eyes, ears and heart? Must see!
