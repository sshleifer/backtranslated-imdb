It was the best Muppet movie I've ever seen! I happen to know that Miss Piggy's fantasy about meeting in infancy was the cause of the Muppet babies. Songs forever remain in my head. Only because this is the stupid Nickelodeon show “Hey, dude” is still in my head. Sorry, a little off topic is. But in any case, what I like is this Animal after the credits, saying "Bye, bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Hasta Luego!" It made me laugh so hard. My absolute favorite is the game at the end. I was surprised that the characters of Sesame Street appeared at the wedding. I'm just glad that this movie was very interesting. I borrowed it from the library, and now I bought it, because I cannot keep a copy of the library forever. In conclusion, I declare that this is the best film I have ever seen! In my case, this is even better than Austin Powers in Goldmber, which was my favorite movie!
