This is a cute little horror parody / comedy featuring Cassandra Peterson, also known as Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, the most shameful mistress of horrors of all time. He was supposed to be a pilot for Elvira and was so successful that he was picked up by the NBC network. They shot a pilot for the television series, which depicts a busty beauty in black, but, unfortunately, the comedy series could not get past the pilot scene because of sexual references. This film, however, is very funny. Elvira is the modern Six Morgan and the queen of one-line players. This movie was followed a few years later by the terrible Elvira's Haunted Hills, which was supposed to be Roger Corman’s old-fashioned movie, but didn’t work. Watch this movie for even more fun!
