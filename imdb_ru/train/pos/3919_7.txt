Rehearsing Carmen Bizet, middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades) invites sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) to play the main role. Antonio falls in love with Carmen, an independent and seductive woman who is unable to accept possessive love. When Carmen has an affair with another dancer, Antonio is absorbed in his jealousy, like D. José, in an original opera intermingling fantasy with reality. <br /> <br /> “Carmen” is another wonderful film of the trilogy by Carlos Saura dedicated to flamenco dance. A dramatic love story develops with the lives of artists intertwined with the characters they rehearse, and many times it’s not at all clear what is happening (with dancers) or fiction (plays). Paco de Lucia is another attraction of this original version of the famous opera Bizet, based on the novel by Prosper Merimee. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carmen"
