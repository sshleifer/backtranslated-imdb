Although I don’t like remakes at all, considering that remakes are a waste of time; This film is an exception. Until I read the previous comment, I didn’t really know that it was a remake, so my opinion only concerns the film itself, not the comparison. <br /> <br /> History and the way it is written there is no doubt: it is Capote. No more words needed. <br /> <br /> Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts' play is great. I saw several films with them, each in one or the other. I was sure that they were good actors, and in the case of Eric, I always wondered why his sister was the famous star number 1, and not her brother. This time, this confidence is raised to the fact, without question. His game, as well as the game of Mr. Edwards, is undoubtedly the pinnacle of their whole profession. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to enter the top 50 movies to watch and keep it on DVD shelves.
