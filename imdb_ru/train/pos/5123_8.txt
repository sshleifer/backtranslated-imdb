An unmarried twenty-year-old boy (played by John Travolta) leaves the farm and goes to Houston, where he learns about life and love in Texas honky-tonka. At first glance, this is a modern love story ... Texas style. It contains cowboy hats, pickups, neon beer signs and links to big belt buckles and rodeos. The music, if not a native of Texas, is adapted to Texas, thanks to the talents of Mickey Gilly, Johnny Lee and the band Charlie Daniels. And this Texan melody ... "y'all." <br /> <br /> The story and characters are as subtle as the taste of Texas chili with five cues, cooked with jalapeño pepper. It is enough to force civilized viewers to interrupt the film in favor of the classic classics, perhaps with starring Laurence Olivier or Ingrid Bergman. "Hamlet" is not. But “City Cowboy” is spicy and frank, and I like it. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is generally good. The dialogue, design and costumes are realistic; skillful editing. Both actors and actors deserve praise, if not Oscar-worthy. I would not have played Travolta in the role he plays, but he does an excellent job ... the same thing, Debra Winger. Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson, among others, are also good in supporting roles. But cinematography seemed weak. The copy of the film I watched was grainy and sometimes suffered from a reddish-orange hue, a visual trait that I noticed in other films of the same time period. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the film does not seem to offer any social or political "message." But I would say that when the “City Cowboy” was released twenty-five years ago, this had quite prophetic consequences. In 1980, all kinds of problems arose in the United States, including American hostages held by Iran. At that time, according to many people, the US was harassed and intimidated. <br /> <br /> This film, along with others at one time, offered what the Americans wanted to see in their political leaders. .. strength. “Urban Cowboy” is a very physical movie. The characters in it may not be the brightest people on Earth. But they are tough! <br /> <br /> Everything related to the “Urban Cowboy” is anti-intellectual. Then this film of 1980, as a means of cultural expression, was one of several that foreshadowed a new era of tough struggle in the United States. It began in 1980 with the election of Reagan. And this era continues to this day, with the president, who is probably not remembered for his intellect, but will be remembered for his resilience and aggressiveness, which Americans seem to be just like the Texans to five alarms.
