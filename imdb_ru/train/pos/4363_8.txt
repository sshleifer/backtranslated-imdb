A little embarrassed by the presence of a character named Gig Young in the film ... which is played by Gig Young. But in this film Gig got his name, as well as a good career, playing small roles under a different name. <br /> <br /> I am going to go against most of the other comments and say that I really liked this film, mainly because of the bright performance of Barbara Stanvik as Fiona. She was funny, angry, vulnerable, caring and angry as the eldest of three daughters, whose mother died in Lusitania and whose father was later killed during the War of I. War. <br /> <br /> As a “person” For years, Fiona’s house stood firmly against the will of her father, which would allow a type of Donald Trump named Charles Barclay to get a home for the family. But Fiona keeps a secret why she hates Barclay so much. Geraldine Fitzgerald is a mean, flirtatious sister who is married to an Englishman, but longs for her younger sister's boyfriend (Giga Young). <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Stanvik, this is not an accident.
