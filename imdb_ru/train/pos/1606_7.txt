“A film aimed at adults” is rare nowadays, but Moonstruck does it well, and yet it’s a better-than-average movie that is aging very well. Although his comic moments are aimed lower than the rest, the film has remarkable specificity (Italians in Brooklyn), which is not used to deceive characters or spectators. (i.e., gangsters never appear complicated. It never becomes grotesque like My Big Fat Greek Wedding) Secondary storylines are economically narrated with short scenes that allow you to break away from the main thread. These are scenes that are currently missing in contemporary films, where their immediate value cannot be impressed by producers and celebrities. I miss these scenes. It also nicely draws old characters. The film goes its own small, quiet way to the conclusion. There is no poorly written scene included somewhere to make some heads of the sphincter relax. Cage and Cher do an excellent job with their work. <br /> <br /> Moonstruck is reminiscent of old-fashioned, ethnic, everyday New York, very similar to 'Marty', except for the fact that Moonstruck is much less sanctimonious.
