Even if you know absolutely nothing about Ireland, you will love “My left foot” (and especially Daniel Day-Lewis’s performance in it). He plays Christie Brown, suffering from cerebral palsy. Because of this, he spent most of his life ostracized. Even trying to warn people about something, they just laugh at him. The light in the dark for him is that he controls one part of the body: the left leg. He uses this appendage to draw and write poetry, drawing him to fame. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan were very successful in this collaboration, as well as in a later collaboration: “In the Name of the Father” (but “Boxer” was not needed). “My left foot” can make you feel in many ways: sad, encouraging, or something else. But in any case, Daniel Day-Lewis spoke here for life. Great movie in every sense.
