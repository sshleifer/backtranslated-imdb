“The Invisible Mouse” is a delightful and unusual cartoon by Tom and Jerry. Here are the usual cat / mouse chases and battles, but this time in a different way. Jerry accidentally drops into a bottle with invisible ink and is obviously very happy about this, because he understands that he can prepare a lot of “surprises” for Tom, scare him, torture him, and confuse him. <br /> <br /> As much as it may seem, it’s also very cool and fun to see what we don’t see: Jerry is invisible. It's funny to see things rise into the air, not seeing who does it (we know who, right?) - it looks like these things had a life of their own or even almost like ghosts. It is just as fun to see Jerry eating candy and fruit while he is invisible. I really like this instrumental music, which sounds when it is not visible. <br /> <br /> Some of the best jokes on this short film are when Tom sees Jerry’s shadow and slaps him, and even when Tom tries to hit him with a griddle and Jerry writes “He missed me.” I also like it when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, again becoming visible and with a happy facial expression. <br /> <br /> In general, this short film has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun, and some good work too.
