Masterpiece. <br /> <br /> So this may not be for everyone. <br /> <br /> Camera work, actions, directing and everything else is unique, original, excellent in all respects - and very different from the garbage to which we, unfortunately, are used. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix creates a deep, believable and intriguing Esther Kahn. Like everything else in this film, her acting is unique — she is completely her own — not “British,” not “American,” or anything else I've ever seen. There is something fascinating about this. <br /> <br /> Long continuous natural shots are wonderful, reminding us that we are too used to a few limited ways of shooting and editing.
