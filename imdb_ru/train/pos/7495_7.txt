Dwight Frye plays on the show in this film as a stupid young man (who seems to be mentally defective), who is accused of murders similar to vampires, especially after he reveals his love for bats, which he likes to stroke and give to the unsuspecting to friends as gifts! Besides all this, there is an interesting mysterious story concerning the above-mentioned murders. Underestimated.
