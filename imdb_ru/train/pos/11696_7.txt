“Thief in the night” is a film that was usually ignored by film fans in general because of its low budget (which was obvious) and its subject matter - The Rapture of the True Christian Church and the fate of those left behind. However, it was a fascinating story that kept the viewer and definitely made him or her reconsider their relationship with Jesus Christ. It touched everyone - even the pastor who preached the Word showed, but did not believe it, knowing exactly why he was left behind. This film and its sequel "Distant Thunder" must see films. Even with the release of the new series “Left Behind the Back,” telling the same story with a much higher budget, the effect remains the same - “Thief in the night” laid the foundation of this genre and will be remembered forever.
