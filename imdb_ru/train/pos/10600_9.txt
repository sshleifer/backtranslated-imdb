This is Elling's very funny comedy about a community in central London, which, due to unusual circumstances, reveals that they are not English, but an appendix to the French province of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> The film features comic actor Stanley Holloway (better known as Alfred Doolittle in the film “My Fair Lady”), as well as many other classic comic actors of the period. <br /> <br /> The story was apparently based on the news of the time. when the Government of Canada “officially” granted a room to a European member of the royal family. The idea actually reminded me of a real case with the Hutt River province in Western Australia, when the landowner "came out" of the Australian government because of a wool quota dispute. (This was never recognized by the governments of Western Australia or Australia). <br /> <br /> This is an excellent scenario that addresses many political and economic issues, for example, the series “Yes, Minister”; and also be a great little eccentric character.
