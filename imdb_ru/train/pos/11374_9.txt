There are some great comments and comments on this film. I was pleased to note the comparison with the "M" Fritz Lang (forgetting the unfortunate remake of the 50s with the lightweight David Wayne). The real villain is a not tortured killer (an extraordinarily beautiful performance by Jeffrey De Mann), pulling out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims - mostly on children. He is the target. The real villain is the suffocating bureaucratic Soviet system, sinking in its corrupt incompetence. The disappointment of an uncompromisingly devoted person (Rea in his best role after "The Crying Game"), a frivolous pragmatist who is ready to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland is always successful in such a role) The awkward, mad bureaucrat of the prosecutor (the brilliant British actor John Wood) and the quiet, supportive wife of a slave investigator (the delightful supporter of Imelda Staunton). It's a damn good movie. His darkness and gloom are supported by the image of a corrupt, incompetent system that works against success. There is no need to dive into the blood-filled sensation, which is characteristic of many recent films. Gore is present - this is a terrible story - but it adds to the image of a pathologically twisted person. The success of this story lies precisely in the fact that these were acts committed by a person, such as you or me. When you and I decided to pour out our frustration through reasonable means, Chikatilo expressed his anger at the most innocent and vulnerable of us, our children. The superb premise of this story is manifested by an equally great cast. - Unfortunately, I note that our Australian friend did not like this speech, and, undoubtedly, he would prefer to hear them speak the Australian dialect. Well, too bad. This wonderful film certainly worked for me and everyone I spoke to, who saw it.
