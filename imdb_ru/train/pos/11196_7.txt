"One-Round" Jack Sander is so called because he is a carnival boxer who fights with anyone in the audience. If they manage to hold out for one round, they will win a prize - a popular way to get clients involved in tourist shows for a long time. Jack is in love with the ticket girl, Mabel, although her head quickly turns when Bob Corby enters the ring to try his chances with Jack. What no one in the battle knows is that Bob is the champion, so he can beat Jack - although this requires some work. As a result, Bob asks Jack to become his sparring partner and abandon the carnival scheme. Later, Jack is so improved that he also becomes a legitimate boxer. Slowly, he rises in the ranking until he is almost ready to fight for the champion. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Champion and Mabel begin to run behind Jack’s back — although Mabel has already married Jack. So, when the last fight takes place between Jack and Bob, this is a very personal matter, and Jack is ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Will the justified anger against Bob raise any help or hinder his performance? Tune in and watch. <br /> <br /> This film was made by Alfred Hitchcock, and although today this film seems strange for a director who is famous for mystery films, back in the 1920s Hitchcock did not have a specific genre that he directed or wrote ( he did both for this movie). In fact, in many ways, this film is more indicative of Hitchcock’s silent style, as a somewhat similar plot emerged in one of his next silence, MANKMEN (also with Karl Brisson as an offended husband). So, although it looks like a standard boxing movie of the time, it was not a radical departure for this great director — even with his rather formal ending. <br /> <br /> Overall, although a bit predictable, Ian Hunter, who plays boxing champion, seems silly, the film works well. Although it is far from perfect silence, it is worth it, and it gives a good blow.
