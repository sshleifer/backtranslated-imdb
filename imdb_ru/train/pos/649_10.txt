We do not need to lose this film, it is one of the best films I have ever seen. Jean-Pierre Law is amazing (more than usual), and this film is one of the most memorable in the “New” fashion. Gene Yustach is no longer on this earth, we just have these black and white images to remember one of the greatest and most underrated French directors. You just have to love this masterpiece. I will never forget this. <br /> <br /> PS: sorry for english ...
