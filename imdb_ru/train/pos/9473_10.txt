I was lucky to see it on the preview last night (October 20), and I was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and the sincere feeling of the acting heart. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is not particularly complex or Exceptionally new story unfolds in such a way that it seems fresh, unique and distinctly “stylish”. This is not something that can easily be compared with the films of the past, it is a unique look at the classic depressive love story of middle age. <br /> <br /> I was particularly struck by the casting of the film, Up to every extra in the family, it was a beautiful and talented cast. The three daughters did a wonderful job, the talent was evenly distributed between them, and neither of them "surpassed" the other two. <br /> <br /> It was a really amazing movie, suitable for all ages, and laughing out loud is ridiculous, but it is very touching and warms the heart. It was a wonderful break from the sexual jokes and nudity of the latest films.
