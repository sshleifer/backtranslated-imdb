Pleasant game that offers a fun and easy game and the possibility of fair play. Staying true to the comics and providing a low learning curve, this game today is not found in most action movies. In addition, storytelling and animated scenes (although long versions of the animation are replaced with slide shows in the Nintendo 64 version) take full advantage of the platform features.
