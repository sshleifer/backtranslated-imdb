I totally enjoyed this movie. I firmly believe that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are comic geniuses of our time. They have an uncanny ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it funny, but in a realistic way ... if that makes sense. This is basically what makes South Park sooo funny. As soon as you realize that this is probably the most vulgar and immodest cartoon, you will see in each episode a message that is transmitted. This is evident in BASEketball. Although it is directed by David Zucker and extremely ridiculous, it has a sincere message about corporate America and the shame that is a major league sport. I'm also a sports fan, so I sometimes find this movie funny, because it’s so true that people hate to love. The opening prologue is great ... tears of laughter every time I see these players start Riverdance! Some may not like this film, because it’s not just a cup of tea for everyone ... but, like in South Park, when you look through the absurd ... it has a truly authentic message that is transmitted through literally comic genius I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars.
