The events of September 11, 2001 cast a shadow over this Oscar award ceremony with a minute silence before a memorable montage, and there was little in the way of singing all the dance enchanting comedy extravaganzas that we expected from this award, but this is not bad. The entertainment was more or less limited to sending LOTR with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, and thatâ€™s it. The rest of the show was filled with clips from the nominations, and I have to admit that it was actually more pleasant than the bloated numbers of songs and dances that we have seen over the years, and Whoopi Goldberg was not a bad lead, unlike David Letterman's esoteric from a few years ago and a minute of silence for September 11 victims was obsessive and worthy. <br /> <br /> As regards the awards, New Zealand was completely robbed. FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING went home with four insignificant awards, while BEAUTIFY UM undeservedly received most of the main prizes, except for the best actor who had to go to a cool guy, a New Zealan, but instead to a good American. The only Oscar awards with which I agreed, other than those presented by FELLOWSHIP, were the awards for Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actress, both were correct.
