I just came out and I can't believe what a brilliant documentary this is. Rarely do you leave the cinema in such fear and amazement. Recently, films have become so bloated that they rarely open sensations from the discovery of something really special and unique. Amores Perros did this to me when he first came out, and this film is doing to me now. I did not know anything about this before going into this and what a surprise. If you hear the concept, you might get the impression that this is one of those touching films about an amazing triumph, covered with amazing music and trying to convince us completely that this is a wonderful story that he tells but does not let us in. Fortunately, this is not the movie. People tell a story! It does such a good job of capturing every moment of their participation, as we enter their world and feel every second with them. There are so many things behind the climb that makes everything that they go through much more stressful. “Touching the Void” was also an excellent document about climbing and a fascinating demonstration of intensity, but this film is more of a human story. I just saw it today, but I will go and say that this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.
