I like this movie. But I was surprised to see that people call it a comedy. Sometimes it was funny, but in fact it was not funny at all. If I had expected it to be a comedy, I might have been disappointed in the film, but, not expecting it, I found it enjoyable and fascinating. Maybe it is because, as an engineer, I identified myself with the main character. I was less interested in the satire of capital or labor, and more - the main story of a person fighting for his invention. A person who is less interested in the monetary benefits of his invention than in seeing how it is implemented and launched into production. He is absolutely heroic when he refuses to take big money and a hot woman in exchange for suppressing his invention. So I wonder that people compare it with the Jurassic Park; I, I compare it to Fountainhead.
