Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan are taking their flock from Seattle to Alaska and Canada to make a claim. Once there, they have to contend with the seductive, quirky business woman Ruth Roman and the icy, careless villain James McIntyre. <br /> <br /> John Wayne might talk about more, but his good friend Stewart did some great, with a sharp western too, some with great director Anthony Mann. Honestly, I would take it, with its sturdy action sequences and beautiful melodrama, over the North to Alaska at any time! <br /> <br /> There are breathtaking landscapes and cinematography in the Far Country that should definitely have been shot in widescreen. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is reliable support from the always reliable Brennan, Roman (who is great), the incredibly sweet Corrin Calvet and James McIntyre, who plays one of my favorite types of bad guy, one that doesnâ€™t concern himself too much Seriously. <br /> <br /> This would make a great double count with another highly recommended western mann-stewart located in the west, a bend in the river.
