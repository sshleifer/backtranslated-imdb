High Bromwell is nothing short of brilliant. This artful parody of students and teachers in South London public school makes you literally ride with laughter. It is vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. The characters are a superbly caricature of British society (or, to be more precise, any society). After the escapes of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "main characters" due to the lack of a better term, the series does not shy away from parody of all conceivable topics. Political correctness flies to the window in each episode. If you like shows that are not afraid to poke fun at every imaginable taboo subject, then Bromwell High will not disappoint!
