this film is almost impossible to describe. The alternative name “Don't look up” is much more obvious. As in most Japanese cinemas, the story is not as linear as the American one. The story revolves around the director, who shoots the story of the ww2 deserter. The set is haunted (?) By the actress who died (?) During the filming of a television show in the 60s. the director is the only one who saw this show. If you saw Ringu (the same director Hideo Nakat) and you liked it, you will like the ghost actress. I loved the ghost actress a lot more than Ringu. really scary and disturbing film. ten!
