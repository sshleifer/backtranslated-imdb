I gave this film such a high rating, because he was very cute, very funny, but at the same time was unpretentious. I went to see this movie when he played in the Philadelphia area, and it was a central moment of a great night with friends. The film is well written and well played, and although it is more like a comedy series, not a film, it does not take away from the film. You simply will no longer find comedies where you do not need to shock people to be funny. The film tells about the Ukrainian housekeeper who works for a young couple in need of help. Although at first she helps, but soon she adds more madness to their lives than the one that the couple was counting on. Things are more and more out of control until ... you must see! The joke made me laugh, even after leaving the theater. This movie just made me feel good. I can't wait for it to be released on DVD, because I want this film in my collection.
