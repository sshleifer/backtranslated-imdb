I suck on unreasonable Boob links, so I'm just going to write a clearly flat (no pun intended) review. I love Elvira not according to the principle “I'm going to shoot in the press, just to impress Jodi-Foster a fanatic,” but suffice it to say that I think she is amazing. The film is reproduced as a 50s horror film, only more fun, look for the “Terribly Stroking Ankle” link to understand what I mean. what appears in the film is Elvira’s absolute charm (or it should be Cassandra). I first saw this film at the age of 8, and since then I have seen it countless times. I really have to find a copy, the video store version looks a little worse due to wear. If other film fans want to email me about it, feel free to contact me. <br /> <br /> ps is another great performance by actress Edie McClurg (partial pariah) who never gets the attention she deserves.
