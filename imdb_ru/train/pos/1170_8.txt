The Night of the Living Homeless is a ridiculous parody of the 1978 film (and the 2004 remake) Dawn of the Dead. Only this time ... with the homeless. I can not understand why. They treat homeless people like zombies who want a change, and several parents find themselves on the roof of a supermarket, like in a movie. So now the boys have to figure out where they came from and how to get rid of them. This is a pretty funny episode with some good moments when the boys sing their own version of the song 2pac / Dr. Dre "California Love". Overall a good episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
