Theory of Flight is an interesting study of the character of the artist (Bran), who is seeking to break free from boredom and mediocrity, and the incurable patient (Bonham-Carter) in the final stages of an ASL who is wheelchair-bound, who wants to make a love for a man before his death. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham-Carter radiates wit, disobedience, and independence as an ASL patient who is almost dependent on others to take care of her. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Brana, convicted through community service to participate in caring for her, complements Helena's charm with sad melancholy, creating a sentimental, compelling love story in which two people try to help each other find their way to happiness, before time is running out
