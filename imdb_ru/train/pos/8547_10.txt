Many people hated this film, but I blame two facts on this — 1 — they want it to be too much like the first couple of American pie films. and 2 - they try to take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> This one I found was the best of all six, and I really love Dwight. The plot is predictable, I will say this, but what then for a teen comedy? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds, etc., and they are all incredibly predictable, but still damn funny! I say it's worth a look, I like it, I find it fun. Just do not watch it, comparing with the first, because it does not look like. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie “Naked Mile” and it seemed that all American films about cakes were only about Stifler. What is for me ONLY. <br /> <br /> Look. Enjoy. Be in love. XD
