I watched this movie many years ago and have been looking for it since then, in my opinion, although it is very raw, it is very informative in terms of what awaits me in the future, I enjoyed the film and to this day I highly appreciate it, excuse me, everyone who disagrees, but the film should always be judged on its own taste, and, in my opinion, great to try it with all the clones and test tubes that occur today. Who are we to judge this film, it may be a theatrical event of what to become, but there you go. All the horrors of today are so great that even I laugh, but this one makes me think, and it scares me, like a mother, that if I were in despair, after watching this movie I would think twice that I'm sorry, but I love this movie, decide yourself not to watch the movie - just find out the story and ask yourself how far will you go after the child?
