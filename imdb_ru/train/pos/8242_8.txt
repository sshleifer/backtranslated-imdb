I watched FIDO on some channel, and I must say that I immediately became a fan of it. The film resembles a comic strip that perfectly reflects the look of the surreal 1950s. You know what a beneficial decade they danced with Elvis when they dropped nuclear bombs in the desert just for the sake of it. People were so naive then that it scares, and the idea that these purebred people consider it normal to have zombies, as pets really work here. <br /> <br /> The prestige of this Canadian production, colorful clear cinematography and a great cast, including Carrie Ann Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and the child <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this film was not a big hit. This deserved greater recognition. This is much better than the material of Tim Burton or the team SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Well. However, this is an instant classic.
