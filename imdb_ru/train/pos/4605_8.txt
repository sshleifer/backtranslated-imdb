This is not only one of the best films about Jackie Chan, but also one of the best Kung Fu movies of all time. <br /> <br /> We used to expect crazy stunts and quick, creative acts in Chan's movie. films, and this one sets a guideline for others to follow. This is two hours of pure entertainment, which is impressive throughout the journey. <br /> <br /> In addition to great action, we have a viable storyline and believable characters, and Chen has a more Western approach to writing that mixes oriental resolution techniques (i.e., kick). <br /> <br /> In general, this is fun, serious, interesting and awesome. A must for any Kung Fu fan, while still being accessible to wider sections of the cinematic community.
