I have to admit that in the first half hour of this film I was basically lost. There was some kind of funny humor, but at best a nude plot and a general sense of meaninglessness that made me think that I was wasting my time. Then - for no apparent reason - I suddenly realized that I liked it. There was neither a blinding moment of awareness, nor a suddenly dramatic scene that grabbed me. In fact, nothing much happens in the whole movie. As if I suddenly realized that the film was supposed to be largely meaningless, and that in its very meaninglessness lay its charm. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman appeared in the role of an unnamed actor who finds a "small project" to begin his career. He is going to play the supermarket manager and spend the day at the supermarket next door to find out the role. While there he meets and contacts Scarlet (played by Paz Vega) - a cashier who wants more from life. He helps her prepare for the interview, as if she is going to the role while she introduces him to real life. It’s really fun to watch how “him” (that’s how the character is defined in the credits) is overwhelmed by a visit to the local Target store. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega were great, along with a strange, but completely believable kind of combined romantic, but paternal chemistry. If you feel lost in the beginning, stick with it. The result is a delightfully charming film. 7/10
