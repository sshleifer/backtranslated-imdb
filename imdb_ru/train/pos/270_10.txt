I have to say, Seventeen & Missing is much better than I expected. The perception I took from the previews was that it would be ridiculous, but I was pleasantly surprised by this impressive mystery. <br /> <br /> Dedi Pfeiffer - Emily, a mother who insists on her daughter Laurie (Tegan Moss), does not attend the so-called prom night of one week, but Laurie ignores her mother's wishes and still goes to the party. When Laurie does not come home, Emily realizes that something is wrong, and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance. <br /> <br /> “Seventeen and Lost” is better than many other television films about this type, as it’s not so predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason to watch this film, and most of it seems believable. The premiere of this original LMN movie took place last night. 10/10
