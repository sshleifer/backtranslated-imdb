"Ghosts" is a film that boasts a really creepy house, good effects and sound, actors who seem to believe that everything around is real and this house. There are scenes that make you jump, and the ominous aspects of what happened in Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are really terrible moments in the film, and I liked how the ghosts appear in the sheets, curtains and in the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's assessment gave him the right atmosphere, and voices appeared around the sound design. What would I like to happen, something more stressful. Ian De Bont had a PG-13 rating, and I think he was holding back a bit. The poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still stands. Ghosts could use several more scenes of pure terror. The ending was a bit anti-climatic for me. Overall, I liked it. The game is good, and there are moments that make you jump. I just want it to scare me more.
