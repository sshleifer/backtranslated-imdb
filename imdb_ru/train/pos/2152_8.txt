There were some wonderful moments of reality depicting modern life (not only in Japan, but everywhere). This shows how sultry the culture can be, and the desire to break out of the form created for you. <br /> <br /> Dance was just a means to say: “do what you love, even if it’s against the norm,” Rather, Billy Elliot, as I would say. I also liked this movie. <br /> <br /> The humor was timely, and the touching moments seemed so real that you could feel the awkwardness between Sugiyama and his wife, the hysteria in the dance hall. I loved Aoki - he and this wig and his excessiveness on the dance floor made me just howl! <br /> <br /> All the actors did a wonderful job, the story was well written. I watched it a second time and caught some of the little nuances that I missed when I first viewed it. Good fun!
