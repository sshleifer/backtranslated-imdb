"8 simple rules ... for getting to know my teenage daughter", in my opinion, an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I didnâ€™t see every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when misfortune happened. I always laughed at it. Despite the fact that James Garner and David Spade were good, I liked the show more when John Ritter was the lead man. If you ask me, his sudden death was very tragic. Everyone always gave a good presentation, the design of the production was impressive, the costumes were well thought out, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope that some kind of network will return it on the air for fans to watch the show.
