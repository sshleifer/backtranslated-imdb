This is a great British movie. Cleverly observable scenario with many quotations, which perfectly reflects what magic mushrooms can do with a man on the weekend. As usual, Phil Daniels is great along with the most underrated of British actors Jeff Bell. Peter Bowles, with the joint hanging from his mouth, is a masterful blow, and Gary Stretch, with his thoughtful look, brings something strangely atmospheric into the play. Although it seems to be announced as a biker film, I think it will find an audience outside of it, simply on the assumption that many people did it there and got a t-shirt. Also a great original soundtrack with a dazzling version of Freebird. This may indeed be the heir to the 21st century of Ealing's famous comedies. Like a weed on Welsh fields: this is a producer!
