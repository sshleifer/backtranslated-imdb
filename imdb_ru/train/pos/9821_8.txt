I saw this film in "Real Movies" (which automatically caused my skepticism), but in reality it was good. What for? Not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue (which are few), but because, in fact, despite what people say, I thought the film was accurate in describing teenagers dealing with pregnancy. <br /> <br /> This is NOT Dawson Cry, they are not elegant, cool witty characters that permeate sexuality with a touch of knowledge. They are children and behave like children. <br /> <br /> They are stupid, clumsy and vexatiously entangled in everything. Yes, it can be random, and they may just be bad actors, but I donâ€™t think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (when not trying to be cool) a very believable idea, and I loved him for it. Patricia Arquette is crying and annoying, but she was pregnant and was a teenager? The combination of the two is not exactly lavender on your pillow. The plot was VERY predictable, and so what? I believed them, his stress and inability to cope with her - her bold, but slightly erroneous attempts to bring them together. I think that characters played by someone else would really be annoying and incredible, but they are not. This reflects the unreality of the situation in which they are, that he is sitting in the classroom, and she walks around the campus with a child. I was angry at her for it, I was angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her. I felt it all. <br /> <br /> In the end, I liked it and I would recommend it. <br /> <br /> Beware of the scene in which Dermot Mulroney is running from catastrophic counseling - career growth,
