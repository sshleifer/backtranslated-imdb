The most touching and truly exciting documentary ever created. I cried all the way from start to finish. Watching the show, you are immediately embraced by the human struggle for a life without pain, for a life that we take for granted. The first time I heard the name, I was almost scared when I saw the program, it was difficult for me to understand life in agony every day of every year of my life. I really felt for him. The saddest part of the documentary is when Johnny gets his coffin. Can you imagine it? Moreover, despite the fact that he was in excruciating and unbearable pain, he still opened his charity. (DEBRA) Johnny is one of the few people who deserve true respect and admiration, he is a role model, as he was a real and indisputable hero!
