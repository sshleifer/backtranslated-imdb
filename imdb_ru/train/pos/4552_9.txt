Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot gives us one of the best performances of the actor. He's great, like Christie Brown, a man with cerebral palsy who learned to write and draw with his left foot. Honored Oscar for him and Brenda Fricker, who plays his loving mother. Hugh O'Conner is awesome because the younger Christie Brown and Ray McAnnely are great as a father. Worth seeing on outstanding performances.
