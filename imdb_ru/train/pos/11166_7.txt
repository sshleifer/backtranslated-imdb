George Raft in the role of Steve Brody, a carefree dancing gambler who will never refuse to challenge, is set against the awkward, sentimental Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery). A soft touch to every trainer, Connors impulsively accepts failures and sucks, especially the swift orphaned Swipe (Jackie Cooper, complete with kittens!) And homeless Lucy Calhoun, an innocent village with ambitions to become a writer. <br /> <br /> In this male-dominated culture, communication takes place mainly in the form of violence (it’s understandable why THE BOWERY is the favorite of Martin Scorsese). Exploding cigars give a gag. "Strikes" like throwing stones at the windows in Chinatown, once setting fire to linen. (The simultaneous arrival of Brody and Bury volunteer fire companies leads to a fight during which the building burns down.) Bury accidentally kills a restless girl and beats anyone who disagrees with him, including Brody, who he defeats, into a night fist fight on a moored barge, to regain control of his sedan, lost because of a bet that Brodie doesn’t have enough courage to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. (Brodie makes the jump, but only because the mannequin ploy fails at the last moment.) <br /> <br /> As usual, Walsh fills the frame with details, illustrating with pleasure the everyday life of the clipping; singing waiters, bullying barmen, whores from the Suicide Hall, pushed into Black Maria, tailors, crossing out the unfortunate hooks from the street and forcing them to buy costumes that they do not need. A small but admirable little film.
