I read about FLAVIA THE HERETIC for many years, but I only saw it at the beginning of last year, when I went to a crazy party with buying films, and for some reason it was in my head lately, although it has been a few months. since i looked it up. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing film made in Italy around the 15th century. Definitely an era of the Middle Ages (although I do not think that any particular year is ever given). This is a time of Christian domination, age is a time of complete madness, and the film reflects this very well. <br /> <br /> Flavia, our main character, is a young woman who meets a fallen Muslim on the battlefield. He seems like a warm and intriguing guy, and she immediately took him with her. Her father, a soldier of some standing family, almost immediately comes and kills the wounded man right in front of her eyes. But she will continue to see him in her dreams. <br /> <br /> Her father sends her to a monastery that looks more like an insane refuge under the open sky - residents so cruelly suppressed by inexorable medieval Christianity. Slowly go crazy. Flavia falls under the influence of one of the more psychotic nuns. But in a mad world, only sensible people are really mad, and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the madness around her. Her view of the time in which they live finds a response from Flavia, who, being young and clearly protected, begins to question everything connected with this world in which she finds herself in a trap. <br /> <br /> The film is undeniable in its depiction of this world, showing a lot of trouble. We see a horse with gelding, the lord raped one of the women of his lands in a pigsty, the pious torture of a young nun. Despite all this, Flavia observes and asks questions, rejecting, in the end, Christian dogma, which creates such a horror parade in terms that would have caused the film criticism for many years because it seemed anachronistic. I disagree with this criticism. The views of Flavia, although sometimes expressed in such a way that vaguely reflect, for example, the then modern feminist commentary (the film was shot in 1974), revolve around really obvious questions. It may be hard to believe that she could have been such a big fish out of water at one time, but this is a kind of secondary moment that she does not do for white bees. Flavia is written in such a way as to allow people of our age or any other era to empathize with its difficult situation. If you get bogged down in this matter, then there is not enough forest for the trees. <br /> <br /> Flavia is inspired when Muslims arrive, invading the countryside, and she finds in their leader a new version of a beautiful person. Islamist, who still visits her dreams. Struck by her almost immediately, he allows her to actually lead his army, becoming the figure of Joan of Arc in full military gear, and ordering the invaders to destroy the Christian society and take revenge on all those whom she saw were committing evil. /> <br /> Is she the herald of a new and better world? Maybe she thinks so, but the Muslims of that era were not too keen on feminism either, as she soon comprehends the hard way. As they say, get to know the new boss ... <br /> <br /> In fact, this is just a miniature of some things that happen in FLAVIA HERETIC. The film is rather gloomy, with a very sad, rather depressing ending. Of course, this is not a film for a mass audience. This is pretty good, however, and does not apply to the heap of "nunsploitation", on which it is often casually thrown. I think that in the final film there is great value, and I am glad that I saw it.
