"Thief in the night" should be the best of all the latest thrillers. I have no idea what people are complaining about, what people are complaining when they say that these films frightened them with the acceptance of God. They just needed to find an excuse and blame the thief in the night. Do not listen! These films not only tell about one of the many possibilities of grief, but also look at their fun in their simplicity. They are actually low-budget, and this is a bit obvious, but not too obvious when you first view it. I had no idea, because I really assumed that in many similar films shot in the 70s, low-budget ones were always present. <br /> <br /> The night thief tells the story of the young and cynical Patty Myers, living for the sake of what comes to her until her husband and almost all her friends disappear in a prophetic delight that everyone warned her about. At first, the film is not based on it until the rapture happens. What it leads to shows that everyone around her becomes a Christian and believes in Christ, which usually happens to many people. All around, whom they once knew and loved, will leave forever, and the one who was left behind is the one who blames everyone except himself. No one can ever blame themselves, because they are always right. <br /> <br /> Like these whiners who complain about the film. These people must be adults. I am thirteen, and you cannot see how I whine, especially since I was exactly the same as Patty, before I again took Christ into my heart. For those who have not seen it, if you want a Christian film to have a little bit of everything, and not stereotyped, all the others are wrong films, then you will like the movie “Thief in the night.” Don't knock until you try. Something new is always good. Trust your own instincts.
