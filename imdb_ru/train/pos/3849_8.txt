This latest Dutch film Verhooven made me laugh well. As a movie lover, looking for all the small details, cross-references, etc. In any film, I can assure anyone interested in cinema that this play amuses all the senses. I did not read the book by Gerard Reeves, on which the film is based, but I still believe that we get a frank picture of a little self-satisfied poet / writer who gets it (in a sense, it doesn't spoil here). The antihero is surrounded by characters who have ambiguous intentions, like him. All this in a superbly packaged cinema, Paul Verkhoven manages to turn the pretty Dutch locations "gesellich (?)" Into a tense atmosphere of the noir, an impressive job!
