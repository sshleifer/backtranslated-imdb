This film was the first British teenage film that actually touches the reality of a brutal rock and roll society, and is not a vivid parody of the teenage life of the 1950s. In an attempt to celebrate the work of Liverpool junior liaison officers, the introductory title indicates that 92% of the potential offenders encountered in this scheme did not commit the second crime. However, this becomes only a pretext for the next teen drama before the epilogue of the film, where we were instructed that we should not feel responsible or regret such criminals, no matter how mixed they may seem. <br /> <br /> Stanley Baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly assumes the position of a juvenile liaison officer. This hard-boiled character is a typical Baker role. Being currently on the trail of the notorious arsonist, known as the firefly, he does not enjoy the transmission. Nevertheless, as in all good police dramas, he returns to full circle with a remarkable turn of events, returning to his original investigation. <br /> <br /> His first case brings him to the home of two small children, Mary and Patrick Murphy (played by a real duet of a brother and sister), who committed petty theft. Here he meets Katie (pleased to picture Anne Haywood), their older sister, with whom he eventually becomes romantically involved. It quickly becomes apparent that the miserable situation in such urban neighborhoods is a breeding ground for juvenile crime. <br /> <br /> The elder brother of the Murphy family, Johnny, is the leader of the gang of rock and roll hooligans. McCallum makes an attractive turn as an Americanized mixed child who is more indebted to such as Marlon Brando than any previous British star. One of them is reminiscent of the character Brando Johnny from Wild, who led a gang of rebellious bikers dressed in leather, much like the Johnny of this film leads its gang. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the preaching of Deardenâ€™s early criminal dramas, such as The Blue Lamp, are not so obvious. Instead, we were presented with several well-drawn characters on both sides of the law, as the drama of the criminals and the romantic interest between Haywood and Baker come to the fore. <br /> <br /> The plot, although at times predictable delivers some memorable scenes. The subversive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have played out in a scene where Johnny gives himself up to music, which leads to a threatening attack on the police sergeant. The most exciting and memorable fragment of the film, however, is the climate scene in the classroom, where a bunch of scared schoolchildren, including Mary and Patrick, are held hostage by the Johnny gun. Obviously, in the light of the real massacre in Dumblein, this scene seems terrifying. It is clear that because of this, the film rarely goes on the air or is available to a modern audience.
