I finally bought and added a copy of Show People to my collection. I can not comment more than what the previous audience said, and to the characters, the plot and the overall quality of this film, without repeating their own words. Seeing the cameo, the unusual performances of so many silent M-G-M stars are worth seeing in their own right. I really like the scene in which Marion Davis plays herself, and she plays the main role in the film, Patricia Pepoire. Make sure you read her lips, as there is no title card indicating what she says when she sees Marion Davis, but this is something like “I don’t think I like it! Pop corn, insert the ribbon and be ready to go back more than three-quarters of a century in the history of film making. Enjoy!
