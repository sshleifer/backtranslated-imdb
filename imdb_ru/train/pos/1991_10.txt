Yes, no matter how incredible it sounds, in 1968 the musical won the Academy Award for the best picture - and it was the third musical that won this award in five years: first “My Fair Lady” in 1964, and then “Sound” Music in 1965 The difference between My Fair Lady, the Sound of Music, and Oliver! nevertheless, it is Oliver! immeasurably better! No comparison. The first two films are tasteless, wet noodles compared to the surprisingly strong Oliver! The game is great; great songs; The story is beautiful, and the dances are great. This film is dynamic, relevant, relevant to the human experience and, unlike the bloated gangs of New York, Oliver! offers a depiction of poverty in 19th-century London, England, which evokes sympathy without being indulgent. Oliver Reed was a great actor, and he proves it in Oliver! Other actors and actresses, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are equally remarkable and offer powerful characters that evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.
