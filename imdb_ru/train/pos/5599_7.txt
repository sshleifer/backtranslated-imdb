This was my second film viewing (through the French version, not the first one, which was dubbed in Italian), and I feel that it improves on subsequent screenings. <br /> <br /> Irresistible, if you slowly create a study about the character, which is beautifully removed and with the Parisian settings is equally impressive. In the end, this is not a first-class Polanski, and I would rate him as number 9 in his filmography, but it is still a confident mixture of subtle chills and, surprisingly, often a broad comedy. It also shows a great cast, all of which are in good shape, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvin Douglas and Joe Van Fleet. <br /> <br /> Despite this, I'm a little confused by the sudden coercion of Trelkovsky to “change clothes” into a previous tenant; except for the owner of the cafe opposite the apartment building, where he is given everything that Simone had, without asking him if he wants anything else, indicates little (as far as I can discern, in any case) that this is all wanted him! So, he found that Simone's things still lay in the apartment, but what exactly made him wear her dresses and dress like her (even if he obviously started to do it unconsciously)? After his nightmarish visions in the bathroom, the last section of the film (where Ajani almost disappears) is almost anti-climatic - especially the scene where the landlord and other tenants witnessed his suicide attempt, as if it were an Opera night, a concept that had already been used 46 years earlier Jean Cocteau in the book "THE POET'S BLOOD" (1930)! <br /> <br /> Thus, the ending is immediately predictable and unresolved: exactly what made the two inhabitants of this particular apartment jump out of the window?!; I remember that this factor disturbed me at the first viewing, and I am sorry to say that now it is not so clear! Keep in mind that the first two thirds of the film is pretty solid, but I would like Polanski to be less dependent on obscure plot points everywhere.
