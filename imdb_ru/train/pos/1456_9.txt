Documentary films of this kind are often very self-confident. This film seems to collect all opinions and allow the viewer to decide what to do with the information provided. Sadly, in these poor people have to work, this film perfectly shows the ugly side of the store sweat. The film “Mardi Gras:“ Made in China ”is a good way to show the world how such small things as beads for celebration can affect the lives of many people in another country. <br /> <br /> I had to watch a film for an English class, where we spent time talking about sweat shops and how some people are trying to eliminate them, and this film helped develop the theme. It was a great, very informative film, and I would advise him to see it all, he opens his eyes, as it were.
