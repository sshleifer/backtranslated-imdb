"Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman" is about as interesting as the animated films about Batman. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the animation still remains true to the sense of comics, the animation is done in a lighter spirit than in the animated series. Bruce Wayne looks the same as before, but now he looks somewhat less impressive. Dick Grayson Robin was replaced by a less sharp, younger Tim Drake Robin. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as usual, calls Batman's voice better than most live actors. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa made a much more decent voice acting than I expected. <br /> <br /> Similar to Batman’s live movies, the film lives or dies depending on the quality of the villains. My favorite penguin is here. His design is more elegant than he seemed before, he listens more to the image of Burgess Meredith of the 60s than to the image of Danny De Vito "The Return of Batman." David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for Penguin's voice. The penguin is finally depicted as sly sophisticated, as he usually appears in comics. Hector Elizondo’s voice creates Bane, which is much more memorable than the forgettable version in Batman and Robin. And, finally, Batman will have to solve the mystery of the descent, returning "Detective" to "Detective comics" (this is what DC means, after all). A revolution into a secret is a delightfully sneaky twist. <Br /> <br /> Score adds a mysterious movie atmosphere. Sounds like a mix between Poirot and Mission Impossible. In general, it is more interesting than your regular cartoon.
