I'm going to keep it pretty brief so as not to spoil anything for you. This movie is awesome. From start to finish, it is filled with authentic sensations. The battle scenes are fantastic, the chase scenes are breathtaking, and they move at such a speed that in fact they only felt slowly towards the end, when everything is explained, but this is because everything that preceded it. Damon shines and really turned out to be a very solid actor, daring not to believe him in this role. He is a role. A welcome addendum to the TV show on "David Straightrain" (hopefully, I wrote this close to right) as a wretched CIA agent to kill Bourne. This is not a stop and will really leave you at the edge of your place for most of the journey. Some things towards the end are simply ridiculous, so they give a negative score of 10 points. The final is left open to continue, and I very much hope that they will think about doing more, because none of them was bad. Great movie and fantastic ending to a terrific trilogy. <br /> <br /> P.S. The wobbly camera did not hurt any action, but I still think we could do without it. The good news is that you only notice it when people are talking and not so much.
