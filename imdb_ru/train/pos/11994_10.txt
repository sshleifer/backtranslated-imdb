As for many here, I can not help but praise the actors and actors who developed Talespin and others that they did throughout “My childhood”, I, like everyone who commented here, fully enjoyed the quality not only of animation, but also quality story. lines and characters. <br /> <br /> To classify this work of art as “Cartoon” will never succeed, as an insult to classify it as “Cartoon”, Talespin - animation and nothing less, obviously, this is the greatest genius work created to date in Disney when Disney pulled it out of thin air, they almost didn’t realize what they had done, and I’m sure that since then their souls have been tortured because of regret. br /> <br /> I will use the moment to explain: from the first (duck) to the last, which I consider to be the Darkwing duck, Disney suffers from failures due to political correctness and since then has made a qualitative leap back They prefer quantity to quality than quality Not to mention a monkey-filled room, I could not allow My children to watch the stunning “Cartoons” they throw out now, in fear that sometime in the future they will all become Homer Simpson and 50% of the blame will be for letting me see I couldn't let that happen, which is why I have ALL the shows from the late 80s to the mid 90s on a hard disk, so one day my children could not be spoiled by Cartoon Crap today and to enjoy the last part of my childhood, and for which I must hold on, and I owe it all to Talespin. <br /> <br /> Talespin for me is without a doubt the best animation ever created in the world because of its depth, charm, wit, compassion, emotion and the absence of really bad quality and storylines that many have Today. Do you see any of this content, say, “Ed, Edd and Eddie or something else you can think of?” Today's rubbish can be compared with the illegible character of a 3-year-old child with a Picasso image. <br /> <br /> The next time you watch episode f from Talespin; Take a look at the wood on any wooden object or building, such as Higher for Hire, and appreciate the workmanship and effort invested in this animation. Even the background shots were made as if they would use them over and over, The Buildings Look true to the art deco movement that was popular in the depicted time frame. Even the cars are true to life, well, not all the episodes were fantastic in the animation, but the scenes of the lower grades were covered with superb scenes, so in general it leveled it all towards the end of the episode, and you probably would never even notice if you were not focused and did not pay attention to details. <br /> <br /> The only thing I like about this is that I like to call “Intentional mistakes” or “Intentional mistakes” in each episode, and some have two, for example, in sheep's clothing, where Rebecca says “You are plotting something, Balu,” and Balu replies, “Who, I! I am innocent, like a schoolboy, "look into Rebecca's eyes, I won" Do not spoil the rest of the Baloopers, but just watch this next time. <br /> <br /> All comments from other users are thrilled and 100% true, I have nothing more to add, what others haven’t said here yet, Disney, wake up and smell the coffee, you are asleep for more than ten years, stop making garbage and return quality of animation and stop the production of "cartoons", we saw evidence of what you can do, and we want to return it as soon as possible.
