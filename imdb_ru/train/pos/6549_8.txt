Taking an old collection of stories is a difficult task for the production team, as this classic character can be updated and made it interesting enough to attract a new audience, evoking memories from its former audience. In my opinion, their mission was accomplished. Be sure to look after young children, adolescents, teenagers and their parents. Well, there are a couple of scary moments that are resolved in a short time, but parents with small children have to sit back, the film is moving for the better. I'm going to go with those astute reviewers who point out that Emma Roberts provides us with a positive role model for young women, but also does not skimp on this. Nancy balances her femininity with career skills. There are a lot of things like it, laughs, do not take themselves too seriously, a real mystery that needs to be solved (this can be imagined as an additional bonus and cute characters. In my opinion, even Nancy Drew makes a good date movie).
