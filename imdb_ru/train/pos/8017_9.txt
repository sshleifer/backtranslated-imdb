After they failed miserably, they all split up and went their own ways. I love characters and cameos. The songs in the movie "Together Again", "Look at me, here I am," "I say goodbye," "And I will always love you," "Rat Jazz" and "He will make me happy." Frank Oz is a great manager of this film, and all the actors do an excellent job, acting like real dolls. See it! 91 min. Score G. My assessment: A.
