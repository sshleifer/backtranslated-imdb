I have to say that, as a BSG fan, I wasn't exactly sure what I was thinking about this show. I saw it tonight on the big screen in the Arclight movie theater (as part of the show at the Paley Center), and the actors and directors performed after it. Ron Moore said that they "want to break away from Battlestar and do something else, and yes, they will lose some fans, but I hope they will get others." <br /> <br /> Even without their talk, I am now a fan of the new show. But that's what I thought about the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked him. It was really very good. I think I’m really fiction (or "ciphyte", "do I really need to print it?", Geek, because I would completely watch it as a series. He has a strong and rich history, and he interested me. <br /> <br /> It all starts with a small group of teenagers, plotting something that for me was the weakest part and a bit confusing. The actor who plays "Ben" should have given us a closer look at his tense convictions. The actress who plays "Zoya ", Seemed a bit picky, but she played a teenager (and I'm sure that I won't be the only one I thought that “Zoe” was first a cylinder, it’s dangerous to be a BSG fan.) If they hope it will be a new Bamber / Helfer / Park, they can rethink it. Surprise ngly, it was the adults who attracted the attention of the audience. <br /> <br /> Eric Stolz gives a stellar performance like Daniel Graystone, a man who is so harassed by family tragedy, that he jumps at the first chance to get out of his grief and does not let go. the inner world of computers and people especially in the scene in which he weaves a web for a young teenage friend of his daughters, catches her, then dismisses and releases her. No sign of the "serial killer" he played in Gray's Anatomy, a really impressive acting game. <br /> <br /> Paula Malcomson is as powerful as his wife as his wife Amanda Greystone. She is just as smart, well written and well played, like the role of Stolz, and I fully believed that they were a couple and a couple who were together forever and have a strong relationship, which is rarely seen these days. I look forward to what will happen with this family, and I hope that they will give her the same amount as Roslyna in BSG - she is strong and smart, and when she attacks her child, you cringe, it's really great. Not to mention her eyes, which may have magical powers, that's how intense they are. The scene where she is filming with a government agent - a very short scene, but beautifully played - really gives you an idea of ​​her power. <br /> <br /> Another part of the show that didn’t work for me 100% was the scene with Esaia Morales and his mafia clan. In general, he does his job well, but I did not believe in this power of mobs and was not afraid of their threats. I caught myself wanting the whole storyline to be a bit more mysterious and difficult to understand; The way he is presented is almost a tribute to the Godfather, they hit you a little on the head. But over time, I can see how this will grow into an interesting thing like “Above / Down” with poor minorities (Morales and others) Against the rich people who rule the planet (Stolz and others). And, frankly, I really liked it when he spoke with his son about the origin of their name - it was a very well-played scene. <br /> <br /> A note for BSG fans, the boy playing "Willie Adamu" doesn't really look like Olmos, but he's just a kid. Who knows if he will be presented more than he was in this film? I sure could not say. But it did not bother me, because he was not as interesting as everything that happens around him. <br /> <br /> Polly Walker plays Sister Clarice, and she is frightening and weird in every scene she plays. I'm not sure where she will go or who she will end up with, but I was very impressed with her game. In this film, she was on the side, but obviously set to play a very important role later. She was not at all like her character in Rome, which always impresses me in the actors. <br /> <br /> One pleasant surprise - the music is actually better and less obvious than BSG, although it is the same guy who does it. McCreerie Bear He has a haunting and unusual approach that took me by surprise, I would buy this account if I had such an opportunity. <br /> <br /> As for the “group discussion” after the show, it was conducted by Seth Green. , Ron Moore was very clever and eloquent, David Eyck was wise (like his video diaries), Esay Morales told a long story about how he was shot, and Eric Stolz was very funny and did not answer questions (but I was always something for him). Paula Malcomson was tough (she claimed Seth Green’s responsibility for mistakenly saying she was 24 years old), and the girls who played Zooey and Lacey were very sweet. Grace Park and Tricia Helfer were also there, answering questions about how they were filmed in BSG. Overall a very interesting and wonderful evening. <br /> <br /> I give the show 9 out of 10, and really look forward to when all this unfolds. <br /> <br /> NOTE. I just watched it a second time and really hope that they explore what HOLOBAND was originally created for. I have no idea what it could be, but it attracts me a lot.
