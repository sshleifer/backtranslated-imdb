I originally bought this DVD because SRK and Aishwarya Rai were on the cover, and I thought: hey! another film with Aishu and Shah Rukh, I never knew that Aishwarya will appear only in the item number in the last quarter of the film in the song she shares with SRK, and helps to present his character, who has been in the film for 15 years. minutes Shakti is a film about maternal love and endurance. This is a film about transformations, ignorance, coming of age, entering into the knowledge and acceptance of the harsh realities of life. The item number in which SRK and Aishu appear has nothing to do with the film. This is actually a sequence of dreams that occurs when the drunk character SRK faints from drinking. He dreams that Aishwarya Rai is this sexy street girl who once appears at her favorite meeting place, dresses poorly and starts seducing him. The name of the song is “Ishk Kamina” (in the translation “Love is a bitch!”), And she is just hot! Do not miss it.
