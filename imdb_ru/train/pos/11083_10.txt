Ice Fox is one of the most heartbreaking and wonderfully filmed wildlife films ever created. <br /> <br /> This film makes you take care of every member of this fox family, from the blind to the strongest - their adventures are sometimes fun and also tragic. Against the backdrop of inhospitable countryside, the hearts of the spectators are warm towards family members. <br /> <br /> Musical score and lyrics tell a story mixed with a narration about what's happening in general. <br /> <br /> Man remains one of the largest predators, but we leave no doubt that foxes are able to live, and not just survive beyond human effort.
