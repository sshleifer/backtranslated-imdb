Obviously, it is aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but it has less cartoony sensations (despite the deliberately caricature characteristics of the leading creatures). This is not a story in which at the end there was a huge moral (it looks more like a jerk in the shirt), but it just tells the story about the relationship between different "animals." You know the result, but you can not resist. <br /> <br /> The characters themselves are much more than their voices (the advantage of lesser-known actors who make voices), unlike most Disney movies. They are well rounded and perfectly believable, oddly enough. The dynamics of the group are brilliantly presented, and the revelations and quirks of the characters are subtle and pleasant. You will be rooting for them much earlier than you would like to think. <br /> <br /> The animation, as you would expect, is brilliant, and you will pray for the opportunity to ride on an icy hill to the movies. You will fall in love with the characters, especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and her desperate attempts to bury her nuts. I came out with a desire to purchase goods, especially a sloth toy, only the next day, when I could not find anything vaguely connected. <br /> <br /> That, oddly enough, makes the film even cleaner. <br /> <br /> Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek.
