This is one of the few films out there that are very erotic, not being pornographic, despite having only a very rudimentary plot. There is not much live sound or dialogue; instead, the actors behind the scenes talk about their experiences, why they participated, etc. <br /> <br /> This is a document. <br /> <br /> This is incredible. <br /> <br /> I can fully understand why no one else has ever tried to do something like that. There is already something like this. It. :-) <br /> <br /> Note: the producer does not have the rights to distribute the DVD version. I also never saw it sold anywhere; You can write to Mr. Burner and order a copy on VHS.
