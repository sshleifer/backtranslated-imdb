Nora is a single mother who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s, like her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. The philosophy of "free love" is not entirely out of the system and Nora did not expect to fall in love, especially with the addict. Hazlehurst received her first of two AFI awards in four years for her amazing image of Nora, who is sure that she does the right thing with her children, but at the same time falls in love with drug addict Havo (Friels). Garner ?? Who will later appear in films such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES and the STRANGE PLANET ?? Kaston (perhaps ready to play the role of the leading program for the HOT PROPERTY lifestyle in 2000 ???) looks like a bearded artist. Director Cameronâ€™s early efforts are a winner; he continued to make the award-winning mini-series MY BROTHER JACK among his later projects. But this is an amazing delivery from Hazlehurst, which embodies an intelligent, searchable scenario based on the award-winning novel by Helen Garner.
