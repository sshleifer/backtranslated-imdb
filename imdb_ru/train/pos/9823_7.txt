I really thought it was not so bad. Not a great work of art, but Dermot M was much stronger. Patricia Arquette replayed most of the time. In fact, he played the cello, which was very impressive, and his lines were never forced. In addition, he is an incredibly handsome man. Really sexy. Add it to talent, and almost everything he was in is much more tolerant. He is always laid out, even if some of the projects in which he participated, did not achieve the highest marks. In most cases, this is not the fault of the actor. Unfortunately, he starred in some strange films that simply did not find a response in the box office. Always with A-list actors, but not always “hit”. But it is "worth every penny" of any DVD rented or bought. Look at the date of the wedding with Debra Messing - one of his best films. WORTH EVERY PENNY! ; ) (if you haven’t seen yet, do it, then you will understand this quote!)
