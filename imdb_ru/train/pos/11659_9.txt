This animated film (co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is surely one of the strangest plots for the cinema: the creation of the famous illustrated manuscript of Kells in the 9th century. In this fantastic retelling of this story, an imposing boy named Brendan, living in a monastery ruled by his uncle, a strict abbot, who is concerned that he is preparing the abbeyâ€™s defenses from the impending attack of the terrible Vikings, must penetrate the forbidden environment of the forest to find which master enlightener named Aidan must complete the book. To accomplish this task, in the forest, he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named Aisling. Superbly and delicately drawn by hand (computer animation is present in several key passages) in such a way that it resembles both medieval and traditional Celtic. art, and with a very creative use of color and various geometric forms, this film is relentlessly strange, but good, not strange, but not stunning, but sensational. If someone was fooled - with the exception of some anachronisms, how is an African monk in Ireland of the 9th century ?? One could say that the mixture of Catholic mysticism with Celtic paganism in this film is never combined. And comic relief is sometimes too wide. That is why I can not give them the highest rating. But these are minor issues with an amazing and gorgeous movie.
