Sasquatch Hunters wasn't really as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Journey to the forest, Park Rangers, Charles Landon, (Kevin O'Connor, Roger Gordon, (Matt Latimore), Brian Stratton (David Zelina) , Spencer Combs, (Rick Holland) and his sister Janet, (Stacy Brancombe), escorted by Dr. Helen Gilbert, (Amy Shelton-White), her boss, Dr. Ethan Edwards, (Gary Sturm), and assistant Louise Keaton (Julian Dever), to find the site of some alleged bones found in the area.When they set up camp, the team discovers a giant burial ground and more strange bones littering the territories When group members begin to disappear, they begin to wander around the forest to a safe place. It is discovered that Sasquatch is behind the killings, and the team teams up to survive. <br /> <br /> Good news: It wasn’t as bad as I was thinking. The film is really starting to gain momentum about halfway when the creature attacks. This is a masterful series of scenes, as the whole group is being attacked by the creature, and the tension throughout the game is very high. During these parts, the forest zone is best milked, heightening the tension and wondering when a lonely man who wanders through the forest will receive his retribution. Also common in the film is the effective use of ordinary growls and roars, which are truly strange. They really add a lot to make this part so eerie, as in other cases when a growl is heard. It is quite effective and works well. It's quite nice that the later part of the film is gaining momentum, as it comes out very well on a high note of action. Especially it seems to me that one scene should be special at the first viewing. When a person runs through a forest from a creature, he notices an expedition that continues to search for him. Raising his hands to call for help, the second time when he announced his presence, he attacked from nowhere and killed pretty quickly. It took me by surprise and actually made me jump a little when I first viewed it. <br /> <br /> Bad news: there were only a few things to complain about, and one of them is a common complaint. The creature here is mostly represented by a terrible CGI that makes it look completely ridiculous and destroys any authority it could have. The threat air caused by the opening of the film almost fell out of the window when the creature appears on the screen. It is so distracting that it is a shame, a little more work was not invested in it. I have complained a lot about this, and I really need to get this over with, as it doesn’t look so realistic and rather fake. Another important thing is off-screen kills. Very often in the film a man was captured, and then pulled out, and then found a bloody body. This is quite aggravated when the killings look beautiful and juicy after. Otherwise, I have no particular problems with this, since everything else that is usually criticized about this didn’t really bother me, but it was caused by others besides this. <br /> <br /> Final Verdict: I liked him, but he is still not the best Sasquatch movie. This should not be taken seriously, and when viewed in this way, it is actually very pleasant. Fans of these films should take a look at this, and those who like Sci-Fi Creature Features can find some good stuff here. <br /> <br /> Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence, and some graphic mascaras
