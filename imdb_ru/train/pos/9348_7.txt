What we have here is the situation. The person is in distress, and people want to help him - as opposed to. In the end, they have to let it go. You can't fix people. And although in various aspects of the "Reign over me" conditionally Hollywood, this message is not. <br /> <br /> This story is not about Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), a man who lost his wife and three daughters on an 11th plane, who has since fallen into the almost psychotic state of the PTSS. This is about meeting Charlie with Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a dentist in New York who was his roommate at the dental school and, knowing about his tragedy, notices him on the street and reconnects. Charlie rides a small toy scooter - a rather fancy device for Manhattan talks - with big headphones on a mass of naughty hair. Hair is the main support of Sandler, to show that he is crazy. And using music as an escape should hit every driver who owns an iPod. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a disaster, but, paradoxically, Alan, stuck with the controlling wife (Jada Pinkett Smith), soon begins to envy him. Charlie lives like a crazy teenage boy with a huge trust fund (insurance money from the tragedy) and starts dragging Alan to hang out, eat Chinese, buy records or watch Mel Brooks Marathon in a representative house, Charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by a vile hostess, redoing the kitchen again and again, collecting the old Springsteen vinyl, Who's and so on. And playing the Shadow of Colossus video game on a giant screen in a large empty room. living room. <br /> <br /> Charlie's son-in-law is deeply concerned about him, but also offended, as we will find out later. Alan has a new patient who offers it. Charlie's desperation makes us see Alan. Attempting to help Charlie partially allows Alan to escape from his choking realities, but partially only makes him more acutely aware of them. <br /> <br /> Chuckle and Sandler make a strange pair, but it doesn’t matter, because it’s to convince them that they both need each other. Charlie desperately needs friendship with a friend who never knew his family, because to avoid his loss, he pretends that he never had him. And what if, as a roommate, Charlie slept naked and slept, walked and had a terrible musical taste (without Motown)? Alan wants to escape from his neat, draining life. He is under the thumb not only of his wife, but also of his dental partners who manage him, even though he himself organized the practice. By the way, they are white, and it is black. <br /> <br /> There is still a lustful patient from hell who seriously breaks things in the dental offices, but begins to look different when Charlie comes and notices that she is a baby. It seems his libido is ready for life at any moment. He is also drawn to Liv Tyler’s chest, a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists, who are beginning to try to treat Charlie when he admits that he may need help. <br /> <br /> Sandler’s mad scenes are too dramatic like many plot moves (in fact, this film resembles a play at more than one point), but he has several monologues in which he expresses his grief in deeply touching ways. <br /> <br /> Charlie is not only delusional and sad, but dangerous and cruel, and all these efforts to help him start having unpleasant consequences. The film is amazing in that it conveys the feeling that people cannot be made correctly. This is an interesting film, sometimes touching, and for the first time 9/11 is viewed in terms of the suffering of the survivors. But there is an element of comedy that sometimes seems tasteless, many people are too broadly drawn, and the overly stately Hollywood interiors have terrible decor; only the streets of Manhattan look real. There is a court scene that is ridiculous, and Donald Sutherland is a judge who is too good to be true. Alan's family problem is solved too easily with a phone call. And yet it is worth observing acting skills - control and subtlety of Cheadle and Sandler in a serious role, almost as good as the one he had in PT. Anderson's Love 2002, although this is clearly the best film, is in fact a much better one.
