In MTV cots, all viewers and photographers shoot the classic Scarface film from their DVD collection. This can give you an idea that Scarface is a “gang movie”. Of course, it has gangsters and mobs, but this is not the point of Scarface. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a Cuban refuge seeking a new lifestyle. He joins the Mafia group and becomes a famous drug lord. Montana was completely for what you wanted to do with your life. The classic phrase: "Say hello to my little friend!" located in Scarface. This quote always comes to mind when I think of Brian DePalmas' Scarface. This falls under my top 10 favorite movies. I would rate this *** 1/2 (of ****). Definitely a movie you should see. PHENOMENAL.
