Why didn't it pick up a bag full of Oscars? This is an amazing interpretation of the often-removed / performed work. The visual effects are breathtaking (especially in widescreen ... panning and scanning really kill the wonderful cinematography and scenery of this film). Each frame is a picture. Amazing. The game is almost completely intact, and Bran’s passion for it is clear from the first titles. There is no Zefferelli, just a great story, as only a film can, but rarely. Jacobi is especially perfect in the role of the murderous uncle of Hamlet: he does not play an evil freak with a mustache, but a charming politician, which allows us to understand why only Hamlet suspects a dishonest game. Brana also underlines the subtlety of the lines between Hamlet’s fake / real madness and the burning vengeance within him. And many cameos look pretty decent, everything from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Depardue and Charlton Heston are unobtrusive if you are dragged into Bran’s vision like me. Fascinating piece.
