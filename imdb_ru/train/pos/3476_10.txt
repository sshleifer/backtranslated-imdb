Let's move on to the pursuit: if you are a baby boomer, you will inevitably spend some time thinking that in 1976 McCartney had a desire to look into the life of the hermit John and spend the day with him. You also probably wondered how it all went. I heard the same messages that the author of this film heard, from the point of view of John and Paul, and I admit that I reconstructed the meeting in much the same way as this movie. But none of my ideas could buy tears in my eyes, as does this incredible piece of work and acting. I found this surprisingly realistic, completely believable and 100% sugarless. Now, can anyone explain why I did not hear about this masterpiece before it was shown on the CBC last night? I mean, it's already three years, for God's sake! And yes, if you're a fan of the Beatles, this is a must-see! Even the subtle rephrasing of the Beatles tunes in the background is inspiring.
