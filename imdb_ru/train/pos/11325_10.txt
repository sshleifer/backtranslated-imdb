When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I have to say that of all the shows that I saw, this one completes everything. I had to see this show, and this is what I really did. When I received the first volume of this show, it was the best. I really liked the animation, and all the battle scenes were awesome. I must say that my favorite characters in the series were Saber, Archer and, of course, I also love Illya. And of course, all the episodes in terms of volume were interesting and very cool. Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnochy (known by transformers and others), playing the voice of Berserker. He has a cool character. And I even watched the entire series again and again before watching the final volume. So if you see something good, then watch this show, it is the best.
