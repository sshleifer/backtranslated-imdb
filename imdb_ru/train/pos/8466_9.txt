Like TALK RADIO, BOOTH is actually predictable (TALK RADIO, because we know the truth about what is happening, BOOTH because of - let's face it - the genre and the basic installation). This is not necessarily a bad thing in this case. In essence, this means that the filmmakers in the end do not go beyond, as, for example, in the American version of this story. BOOTH inexorably moves to its (predetermined) end, but at each level it is so beautifully crafted that you can enjoy the trip as you can take a familiar cruise on a well-traveled stretch of the (very scenic) road. It reminds me of Harlan Ellison's creepy story, FLOP SWEAT. Claustrophobia is sometimes almost palpable. It is nice to watch for a long time.
