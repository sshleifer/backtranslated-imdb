I love this movie about Freekin! Walsh is a true master of cinematic form, his film is sometimes, in my opinion, overlooked. But this film is my favorite, because it really gives you the feeling of the time when the film was made. \ <br /> <br /> All the wonderful characters that existed, the way of life, the style of clothes, the way they said: â€œYes, they can be exaggerated, but it's nice to know that there were cases when two men tried to outdo each other with crazy tricks. <br /> <br /> I just felt that this was part of the story that many people appreciated. <br /> <br /> Can I get it anywhere on a DVD? I saw it only on TV. But for anyone who wants to get a film about the life of that period, this is the perfect movie.
