1984 seemed to be nothing more than the Orwellian nightmare, which was to become George Orwell's science fiction novel !! 1984 was one of the happiest times in American history !! The rise in the economy and the revival of basic American values ​​have created an idealistic aura of renewed innocence, which the American people viewed with a very favorable inclination !! In the past there have been many versions of classic movie ersatz, but originals are almost always considered excellent !! Purple Rain is such a film in this category !! Created in 1984, "Purple Rain" provided a dog of the eighties, carefree and high-quality music, which they included in the creation of this excellent film !! Certain artifacts characteristic of the eighties, really classic !! Screwball comedies, clothes with a neon accent and, of course, music !! Music of the eighties is considered the best decade of music in American history !! Located in Minneapolis, Purple Rain combined naive entertainment with the changing times of the city. When I was small, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, then the color population was less than 3%! By 1984, African Americans made several roads to Minneapolis, and thus they also created a solid culture of their own !! The film "Purple Rain" recalls the style of clothing of the eighties and the musical ensemble, which easily conquered the audience of the film !! I loved the music for "Purple Rain", and the innovative approach that this film applies to confrontational success is really great! Watch this movie if you haven't seen it yet !! The prince became an icon of the eighties with this masterpiece! He met Kim Bassinger for a while, he must have done everything right !! "Purple rain" put the prince at stake !! This film gets my insistent verdict THUMBS UP !!!!
