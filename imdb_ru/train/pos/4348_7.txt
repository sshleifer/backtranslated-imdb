Paul Reiser moves away from the comedy spotlight to write a warm, humorous and tender story about a family — what we see and what we don't see, what we expect and what surprises us. Things about my people do not set any new standards for the film, but this is a good little story, well told, which reminds us of the significant connections that the family represents. <br /> <br /> Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) was a workaholic, sometimes pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis) and his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan) and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) into the background. One day Muriel leaves a note that after several years of marriage, she leaves! Her daughters, along with wife Ben Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), immediately begin to look for her whereabouts, leaving embarrassed, hurt, and disgruntled Sam to sort things out on a road trip with her son Ben. The trip becomes a time when two men find out who they are, and what each of them means for their status as father and son and family members. Sam for the first time in his life is resting and now introduces workaholic Ben with the pleasures and joy of life. The trip ends with a phone call about Muriel's whereabouts and why she left, and regrouping a wiser family completes the story. It’s not what it seemed: it’s better and, well, different. <br /> <br /> Falk and Reiser are playing each other like professionals, but in many ways the film refers to short moments when Olympia Dukakis is on the screen, reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs in the movie. Worth seeing. Grady harp
