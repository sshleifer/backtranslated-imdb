I really liked the pilot, it was as cool as I hoped, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a riot, although at first I thought I could not stand his temper. He and Megin Price had a bit of chemistry, but I hope they will be more comfortable with each other as the season progresses. Megin must have been strange to be a star on her last show ["Gounded For Life"] and become one of the stars. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kailic and Oliver Hudson seem really new to the entire Sitcom scene, but I think they will get better over time. To my surprise, the character of David Spade was not fully in the center of attention of this pilot. The way he pronounces his lines is so different from what I've ever seen on TV, but I think it's just his style. It works for him. <br /> <br /> I think couples, or even loners, will be able to relate to all doubts and struggles and to be unsure of their decisions about which this show is going. All the situations in which the characters fall, just resemble the real life, and not covered with sugar, as in most shows. <br /> <br /> I hope that for all the actors CBS gives them a chance. This show can be one of the best TV shows, if only it has a chance and time.
