Another powerful chick throw. This time it revolves around Diana Guzman, who always quarrels at school. Instead of being expelled, she transfers her anger to another place, to the boxing ring. She trains to be a boxer, and there she meets the featherweight Adrian and begins to fall in love with him. There is a powerful idea in this film about how to make your dreams come true and make them come true, even if someone does not believe in you (in this case her father does not believe in her). This alone makes the film worth the price. enjoy
