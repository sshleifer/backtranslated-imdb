I watched excerpts from it as a child, but although I immediately bought the Blue Underground suite, since it was a limited edition, I just put it on my viewing schedule - and this is mainly because the American POP Bakshi has just appeared (1981 ). on Italian TV late at night (see my review of this film below)! <br /> <br /> In any case, I found that the film is a nice animated epic with a sword and witchcraft with particularly impressive looking backs (rather clumsy characters with a rotoscope were admittedly less) with the animating Goal derivative. The plot, again, is not quite original, but unquestionably proven participation at the underage level and leading characters are quite well developed - the villainous Ice-Lord Nekron and the mysterious warrior DarkWolf are particularly interesting; the hero and heroine, however, are rather soft stereotypes - but you can hardly complain when Bakshi and Frazetta portray the girl as well endowed (her bra can be torn off at any second) and half naked to boot (her tiny panties Disappeared forever) ! However, this is certainly an action-oriented part, and it certainly helps on this front (in which Darkwolf is especially wild); the final battle, albeit a short one, is also pleasantly processed and shows how our heroes on pterodactyls attack the lair of villains in the cave. <br /> <br /> In the long term, aside from the Frazetta backgrounds mentioned above, the main attraction for me is that this film is nostalgia because he brought me back to my childhood days, when I watched not only films like CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1982) and THE BEASTMASTER (1982), but also animated series such as BLACKSTAR (1981-82) and MAN AND MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE (1983-85). <br /> <br /> With regard to the companion creation of "Fire and Ice" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) ** 1/2: <br /> <br /> Vintage themed animation on an animated film with a sword and witchcraft , available only through a blurred VHS print owned by Ralph Bakshi himself! It tells in detail about the technique of the rotoscope, as well as shows several examples of "performances" (in the studio) live script fragments, which could then be followed, mixed with the background and removed. Nevertheless, looking at several such backstage favorites in the art of animation (for example, on the Disney Tins and Looney Tunes sets), this does not create a particular appeal ...
