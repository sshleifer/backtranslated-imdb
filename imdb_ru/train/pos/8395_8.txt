*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This is without a doubt the best movie ever made by Reiner Werner Fassbinder, and even with the amazing script the movie is enhanced by the great game of Hanna Shigulla. The film begins with the fact that Maria (Shigulla) and Herman Brown (Klaus Lovich) only get married because the bombs continue to fall, and Herman is sent to meet the passing days of war, and now Maria, her mother and sister must pass to survive. Maria decides to get a job as a dancer / prostitute at a club that serves American soldiers, and she meets a black army soldier named Bill (Greg Eagles), and they begin to see each other on an ongoing basis. Maria hears that her husband Hermann died in the war, so she takes Bill very seriously. But one day, talking to Bill, they see Herman at the door. He is not dead, and when he enters the room, there is a fight, and Maria breaks the bottle over Billâ€™s head, and he dies. Hermann takes the blame, and he is sentenced to a long term in prison, so Maria tells him that she will succeed in something and pull him out. The war is over, and Germany must recover, and once on the train, Maria meets Carl Oswald (Ivan Desny), who is a successful businessman in the field of textiles, and she uses her spell to get a job. Maria is determined to succeed, climbs the career ladder and becomes Karl's mistress. She tells him that she will never marry him, but he is in love with her. Herman gets out of prison, but goes to Canada to try to overcome everything that Maria has done since he was locked up. <br /> <br /> ***** WARNING ABOUT SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> One day Karl dies and leaves Maria almost everything he pleases, and Maria buys her own home. Then, finally, Herman comes home to his wife, and they both are ready to marry, although they have been married for some time. But Maria leaves gas on the stove, and the house explodes, and both of them are still in it. <br /> <br /> There are so many interesting things in this film that this is one of those films that you can learn and talk about. for great lengths. As with all Fassbinder films, the use of color is used in a very interesting way. When the film begins, the brown and gray tones represent Germany torn apart by the war, but when Mary begins to succeed, they change to bright saturated colors, such as red and white. The restoration of Germany with all the sounds of construction is used only as a background, and the film remains focused on the exploits of Mary. Fassbinder wanted adjustment sounds to remind us of what was happening at the time in Germany. Hanna Shigulla has never been better, and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With a lesser actress, it would be just another interesting film, but Shigulla is so strong that her performance raises this film to elite status. Schygulla shows Maria as very determined and intelligent, but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She is not embarrassed and does not feel guilty for it, and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman who practically sells her soul in order to survive. Shigulla was not nominated for an Oscar, but gave an excellent performance that will stand the test of time. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler, and his own mother, Lilo Pempeit, plays Frau Emke. I heard a lot of things about ending the film, and this is due to the fact whether Maria deliberately left the gas on. Later in the bathroom she flows through the wrist, and she seems sad. This is just a guess, and if you think I'm wrong, drop me a line. I think she was too excited that Herman was at home and left him by chance (remember how she dressed for no reason?). Then, when the will is read out to her, at that moment she learns that Herman and Carl became friends without her knowledge, and I think that she felt that everything she did was a gift. That's the reason for the bathroom scene. Therefore, when a house explodes by chance. But I think that the reason that Fassbinder has such an end is to show that anyone who sells his soul does not have a business life. Fassbinder was fascinated by the survivors, but he was also incredibly passionate. In his opinion, Maria cannot have both. Fascinating movie.
