When we talk about Hollywood Hotel, we can talk about one of three things: about the hotel, about the radio program and about this film, which was partially inspired by the first two. Dick Powell was the host of the Hollywood Hotel on the CBS radio network, in which Luella Parsons talked about the weekly scoop about the stars. <br /> <br /> Powell and Parsons made their debut in the Hollywood Hotel in 1934, so by 1937 she had his fair share of the radio audience. Powell received guests, sang and played with Luell and her guests from movie stars. Possessing the power she had in her column, she was able to get various stars to work and connect her latest films for nothing. <br /> <br /> The American Federation of Radio Artists intervened and demanded that she pay a salary. accordingly, they won the case. This put an end to the Hollywood Hotel program in 1938. Of course, both Powell and Luella went on other broadcasts. The whole story is covered in Tony Thomas’s film “Dick Powell’s Films”. <br /> <br /> But before the fork was lifted, the film came out of Powell's Warner Brothers home studio, inspired by a radio program. Powell plays the singer / saxophonist in the Benny Goodman band, who signs a Hollywood contract. But when he leaves for Hollywood, he encounters the selfish movie star Lola Lane, her resemblance to the double real sister Rosemary Lane and amateur actor in Alan Mowbry. <br /> <br /> When Mowbray is called to sing in an epic about civil war that he does with Lola Lane, they use Powell’s voice. Then Mowbray has a problem with Lina Lamont when he is asked to go to a radio program of the Hollywood hotel, broadcast from the Hollywood hotel. Here is a studio in excitement. Suppose the problem is not solved as in Singing in the Rain, but Powell’s manager Ted Healey turns out to be resourceful. <br /> <br /> Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer give a very good result for the film. The song with a big hit appears at the very beginning, when the band Benny Goodman sings with scandal, Johnny Davis sings the anthem of Hollywood, Hooray for Hollywood. My favorite, however, sings Powell and Rosemary Lane, I like fish out of water. Just listening to Johnny Mercer's words about Ginger Rogers, managing the Brooklyn Dodgers or Sally Rand without her fan, is a collection of American popular culture in the thirties. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley choreographs here, but the film does not. He doesn’t have so many imaginary things as in his early work with Warner Brothers, the numbers are well-placed. The main point of Berkeley in the eatery, where Powell and Healy were forced to get a job. The number begins with the fact that Benny Goodman broadcasts from the Hollywood hotel "Let it be a lesson for you," and then at the entrance to Powell, Lane and the entire place in the song begin to join the irritation of the owner Edgar Kennedy. And you know what to expect from Edgar Kennedy's annoyance. <br /> <br /> Benny Goodman shows why he was called King Of Swing when the band with drummer Gene Krupa and xylophone player Lionel Hampton are in his ensemble. This, along with Francis Langford, is also sung. And, perhaps, the last surviving cast of the group was a guy who performed a bit as a radio announcer. He died in 2004, but not before he became the 40th president of the United States. Ronald Reagan always thought that Dick Powell and Pat O'Brien were the two Warner Brothers guys who were most helpful to a young player looking to get him. <br /> <br /> Hollywood Hotel is one delightful and interesting movie, from, but charmingly so.
