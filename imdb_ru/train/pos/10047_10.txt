All the miserable people who did everything complain about the dialogue, the budget, this and that .... who wants to hear it? If you missed the point of this incredibly beautiful film, this is your loss. The rest of you, who deeply love this film, don't care what you think. I am a guy who is thirteen years old, and he has seen thousands of films in my life, and this film is in my book. It should not have been a documentary or a completely factual account of what happened that night. This is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know that this is a cynical 90s, and in the millennium everything is in shock, but come on. Someone on this comment board complained that he made too much money! How is it lame? He made wads of money in every civilized country on the planet and is the highest-grossing film on the planet. I will happily join the majority this time. Okay, cynics, it's time to crawl back under your stone, everything is ready.
