The main reason to watch this movie is Warren William, who is in great shape as a campaign manager for Schister. He is full of energy, constantly finding ways to fool the public and defeat the opposing side in the midst of the greatest calamities. William is an excellent actor - I feel that he never got his due. Bette Davis in the role of her friend also brilliantly played a role. Personally, I discovered that Guy Kibby is not quite right, like a stupid candidate that William and others are trying to impose on the public. He seemed more like a blank canvas than a man. I would prefer a real character to appear, not a character. The story itself is implausible, stupid and clich√©. But Warren William and Bette Davis are worth seeing.
