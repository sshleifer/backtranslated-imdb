This is probably unfair, because I looked through most of the interesting reviews on the Soprano, and then added that people forgot, but oh well ....... <br /> <br /> From an acting point of view, like any actor Can fail with these characters? Everyone fascinates and strains in their life activities. Tony Soprano - although the Kapo crowd is suffering from a mental illness, he still sees his life in front of him and knows what needs to be done to survive. Each of his people, you see your life almost from the inside, like a true form of voyeurism. This definitely reveals a kind of “curious” side with every viewer, and I include myself in it! <br /> <br /> Although some of the above do not care about Bracco, I must say that this is the most recent role since she went through the Good Good Fellas. She is the side of Tony that makes him listen to reason, makes him decent, gives him a breather when dealing with his human emotions, which he has not felt for so long, if ever. She, simply put, is his savior. (Not to mention religious tones) <br /> <br /> But the unconditional statement here is without a doubt Edie Falco. To see her role as a prison guard in another famous HBO series “Oz” and then see her as Libya, this is the best compliment for any actor or actress. She went beyond the recognizable actress, with which only actresses like Merle Streep can handle. This is a kind of chameleon, superior role. But, as I mentioned earlier, with such strong characters, how can any actor fail? <br /> <br /> The strength of Libya in her daily affirmation of faith in herself. She is a survivor because she hopes her husband and family will be survivors. She is ready for the worst because she knows about the dangers of her husband’s business, but she knows that her lifestyle is more than that of most women from Jersey. She is wise, if not wiser, and more streetly than Tony himself. <br /> <br /> In general, the biggest crime in the Soprano family is that we, the spectator, have to wait until January 2000 to see the next season. This, in my opinion, is the worst in the HBO series. This was what brought Larry Sanders, Sex and the City, Dream On and others back to popularity and ultimately killed them. Too much space between seasons and very rare. Until then, I will watch replays in the hope that this gap in programming is filled.
