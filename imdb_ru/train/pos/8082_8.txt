It's been a long time since I watched this LOTR. I am now looking for a copy to buy. Bakshi's work is fully consistent with the original work. The visual effects are fascinating and sometimes haunting. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages? Sometimes the movie is confusing or confusing. Eat once or twice when the storyline slows down to a crawl. But in general - buy this movie. This is great for kids, adults and collectors.
