I rarely appeared after watching a movie with such a warm, happy feeling. I felt as if I was with really good friends and had a great time! I really liked this movie. The game was great, although I would, in particular, mention Bill Nye as an absolutely flawless performance. Bill is a great actor and would like to see him in the following films. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Neil are also favorites and always love to see them, as they give such a solid job. And Billy Connolly, as always, is absolutely gorgeous. It was a wonderful ensemble performance from all interested parties. Such a refreshing experience to see a well-written, beautifully played and beautiful film.
