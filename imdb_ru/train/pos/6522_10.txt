Throughout the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, Paramount Pictures really missed the opportunity to restore this film, directed by Anthony Quinn, under the guidance of Cecil B. DeMil and burn it to DVD and Blu Ray with all the extra features. It’s obvious to me that Paramount Pictures Execs are blind as bats and don’t know that they have a really good pirate movie in the repository about a real pirate who really lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, who would help create the Crescent again famous for its pirate connections. When Execs at Paramount finally gets the program and releases this movie in digital format, I will be a happy tourist. Paramount Pictures is your business to get rid of yourself and restore this movie now!
