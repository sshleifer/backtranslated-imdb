Thanks to a clever script and a firm hand from screenwriter / director Kevin Meyer, Perfect Alibi is a fascinating and very pleasant mystical thriller. The film begins methodically and is gaining momentum when the clues begin to reveal that nothing is what it seems. Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo are awesome, as they come together to solve the mystery, reminding me of Nick and Norah Charles from The Thin Man movies. Kathleen Quinlan is great because Alex McArthurâ€™s tormented wife and character roles played by veteran actors Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Ann Ramsey and Estelle Harris are well done and provide plenty of light moments at the right time. There is even a camex Rex Lynn. In general, I felt like I was reading a good book by the fire.
