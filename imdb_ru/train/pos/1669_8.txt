Artemisia Gentileschi, the daughter of Orazio Gentileschi, soon showed herself as an artist. Taught by her father, Artemisia was born in an era that deprived talented women of the right to have their work viewed alongside the art created by men. Her tragic life is captured in this biopic, filmed and co-authored by Agnes Merlik. <br /> <br /> After reading Susan Vreeland’s novel The Passions of Artemisia, we began to explore more about the life of this woman, her work and her legacy. We also read Mary Garrard’s Artemisia Gentileschi book, which should be a must-read for all art lovers. <br /> <br /> “Artemisia” presents the facts we have invented about how to show the youth of a young woman as she begins to draw. She was clearly influenced by the work of her father, Caravaggio, Agostino Tassi and other Florentine artists of that period. Her relationship and romance with Tassi form the basis of the film. Artemisia, unfortunately, could not go as far as she could, due to prejudices against women in art. It did not help either that she caused a scandal where she was accused of raping Tassi. She had to go to Rome to distance herself from this miserable time of her life. <br /> <br /> Valentina Worms makes an excellent Artemisia. She is a magnificent creature that aroused passion in men. Michel Cerro plays Orazio, her father. Miki Maoylovich is considered Tassi, the man who wanted Artemisia, but he ended up in prison. Emmanuel Devos appears for a moment. <br /> <br /> The film has a glossy surface, which captures the camera work Benoit Delhomme in all its glory. The film’s scenes give an idea of ​​what inspired this school of painting to show on its canvases. The music of Krishna Levi serves well what we see. Agnes Merlik sent a confident hand, showing her visual style.
