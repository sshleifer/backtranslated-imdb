This story was probably one of the most powerful that I have ever perceived. John Singleton certainly did his best to put together this educational masterpiece. Brilliant performances of the entire cast, but Epps and Rapaport were the best and most convincing in the career of any young star. <br /> <br /> However, as a college student, many of the issues raised by Singleton were taken to the extreme. In a sense, despite the fact that they are problems encountered in many university campuses, they are not presented as widely or openly as this film would have believed. In some cases it seemed almost absurd to think that something like this could happen. However, despite the fact that it was a bit dramatic, the film was brilliant and left me stunned, unable to speak, just think. One of the things from this picture, which I will remember forever, was a quote from the character of Lawrence Fishburn: “Knowledge is power, without knowledge you cannot see your power”. Brilliant, just brilliant.
