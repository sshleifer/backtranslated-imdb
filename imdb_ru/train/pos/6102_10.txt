I had to give this film 10 points simply because it did something so many films thrown at the black audience could not do. In this film there was no video clich√© about whores, and he also missed gangsters, rappers and foul language. He looked at several relationships between doctors, African-Americans, and African-American romantic relationships between a man and a woman on a completely new and refreshing level. I was very impressed with the careful mix of frivolous humor films with some rather tough and hard problems. The film will make you feel happy and sad at the same time. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival. The premiere was held at AMC Loews Boston, and I sincerely hope that this film will get a much larger audience. Black people (and ALL others) LOVE such a film - if the industry were intelligent enough to show them there! <br /> <br /> As an extra - if your doctor, resident, medical student, Preschool student, married to a doctor, sibling, doctor in the family, or who knows an excellent doctor - they will also like this film. It depicted the location and practice in real life, which was highly appreciated by the doctors, residents and medical students who watched the film. Dennis Cooper graduated from internal medicine residency, so he definitely applied his knowledge and experience to the film, and this is very obvious.
