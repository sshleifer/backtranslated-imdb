This film received terrible ratings from almost everyone who voted here, but I'm here to say if you like movies, like Dude Wheres my Car and Dumb and Dumber, this film is for you. If you like movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca, you need to come from a different angle. Nevertheless, I still love this film and everything about it, even if it is a kind of “brainchild”, it is one of the few films that my friends and I could watch for years and quote when it is possible. A GREAT MOVIE. This movie should AFIs number 1, because its a damn high class. The only problem with this film is that you may have problems watching it, because it was created for a television film on a channel that no longer exists. So I do not know how to get this film, I would like to buy it for a DVD, but I can’t find it anywhere. I still have a record from the moment he was the first time, you can come if you want and see, but I can sleep. This movie is stunning, and that's all you need to know.
