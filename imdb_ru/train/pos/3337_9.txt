This is a great movie for true romantics, and for sports fans. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore plays the best in this movie. As a Drew fan, it was very nice to see her brilliance after several failures. I had doubts about Jimmy Fallon, but he fully acted as Ben, funny, madly in love with the sport. The comedy in this movie is gorgeous, there were some loud laughter. <br /> <br /> Their first date began with a crash when he appeared in her apartment with flowers, and she felt sick from eating in a new place earlier in the day. Instead of leaving, he helps to take care of her, helps her to change into her pajamas, and then removes the vomiting on her closet and bathroom, and then tells her that she is "very much like a lady ... without pieces." Everything goes perfectly between Ben and Lindsay all winter, but then the baseball season begins. Lindsay begins to understand how obsessed he is with Red Sox, and why this seemingly great guy is still not married. She tries to dismiss it and think of it as a good thing, as she has a busy schedule and she will not feel guilty for working extra hours while he plays games. She even buys all the books about Red Sox she can find, including The Curse of Bambino. <br /> <br /> Everything goes well until Lindsey has a false alarm, having missed her period. It makes them both realize how serious they are, and she begins to wonder if it wants to be the person with whom she wants to be. Very touching part in the film - after she tells him that she began to have periods, he shows how he sadly removes the Red Sox children's T-shirt, which he bought just in case she is pregnant. <br /> <br /> In the end, Ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her friends' birthday after she said, “I needed to check my calendar, and when I saw that I was Red Sox / Yankee game, I knew I would go for a deer. ” After the party, Ben tells her that it was "the best night of his life." Shortly after a friend called him to go to the game, he refused to party and told him: "THIS WAS THE BEST GAME!" Ben freaks out that he missed it, and in the end really hurts Lindsay when she says: “You said a few minutes ago that this is the best night of your life,” he says: “Well, that was a few minutes ago.” <br /> <br /> So they diverge for a while, he realizes how immature his obsession is, and decides to sell his subscriptions, which he inherited from his uncle, because if he had not done so, “ remind him too much of what he gave for them. ” Lindsay learns from a friend and decides to stop him, realizing that he is doing this for her. It ends very sweetly, showing how his childhood love of baseball was overshadowed by a completely new, deeper love, Lindsay. They still go to the games and even attend the final game of the World Series and St. Louis, and this is a happy ending around. 2 thumbs up!
