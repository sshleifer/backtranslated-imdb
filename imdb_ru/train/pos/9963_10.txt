I saw this movie when I was a little girl. And I enjoyed it every time. Of course, the graphics are a bit crappy compared to today, but back in the 70s it was great. I only saw it in the original Spanish version and thought it was wonderful. So I remember how my Christmas was with my family - magical. Santa Claus was amazing and I couldn't wait for him to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a child / children and you speak Spanish, bring them up and see this old-fashioned version of Santa Claus. This is a different version than we are used to today, but who said that there is one way? <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie to watch. He teaches children well against bad. I do not know how the English version is with subtitles or whether there is an English version, but Spanish is the best. Enjoy and happy holidays! Feliz Navidad!
