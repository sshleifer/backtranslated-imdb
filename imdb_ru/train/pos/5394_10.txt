I was completely hypnotized by this series from the moment Tom Long began to shoot - the whole thing with the “bad guy” was just exciting. <br /> <br /> The story hooked you, what will happen next - will Joey get a girl in the end, after spending 5 years in prison, and all this time thinking about her lost love, again going through her ways, finding he has a son ... Although he is a bad guy with violence, you still want to find him. <br /> <br /> Truly fascinating two partners - please show it on video!
