Like many people here, I began to find that my patience is being tested by this film. By the end, I actually shed a few tears. <br /> <br /> It seems that most of the old films stretch 7/8 in length and then light up right at the end. Older moviegoers have learned to wait patiently for their time through the slower parts, calming down, knowing that a big return is on the way. But this is not entirely accurate. You see, for an early audience, that for us "slow parts" were the main part of the story. They looked and found anecdotal and thematic interest there. The modern audience, after Spielberg, is constantly waiting, when every two minutes, when they watch old films, there is a small climax waiting for them. This is the problem of inflation of modern films. Well, that won't happen. No need to apologize for these films; you just have to adjust your expectations and personal rhythms when watching them. At the moment, the difference between Avatar and Informer is similar to the difference between Euripides and the traveling rent. Think about it for a minute or two. Do not strain at the obvious, but Euripides still deserves a hearing. <br /> <br /> The “exciting role” for most modern viewers begins from the scene of the IRA Tribunal and grows into the last couple of minutes, which, if you are aboard or even pay attention to that time, will tear up your heart. This is not some kind of high universal abstract call for forgiveness; This is a request from one stupid, and those who feel sorry for a big dummy, for a small favor. This is so personal, and this is an embarrassing nude appeal. Because after you are angry with Hypo, you get annoyed at him, thinking that this is the most stupid character of all time, you finally find yourself defeated by the scene of Hypo's ex-girlfriend, imploring another woman to persuade her man to meet him. <br /> <br /> The film may be sentimental, but sentimentality is not cheap, as some here blame. This raises the question of life and death, and while you are serious about offering one life to a client, this is sentiment, squeezed out of the most serious things. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. And the blame for not being 10 out of 10 belongs to me and to some extent yours if you read this. We all asked for more, even more, faster, faster, until we could put ourselves in 1935 - just yesterday, really - as easily as we can.
