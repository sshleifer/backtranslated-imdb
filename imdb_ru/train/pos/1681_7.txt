The Scorpion Tail Case contains all the elements necessary to create an effective film. The story is standard. When a man dies in a plane crash, his wife (Ida Galli) gets a life insurance of $ 1 million. The widow is sent to Greece for payment, but followed by a series of horrific murders. There are many suspects, including a tenacious investigator (George Hilton) from an insurance agency and a widow's lover. Director Martino continues the story at a fast pace, and the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer. Anita Strindberg (also memorable in “Your vice is a locked room, and only I have the key” and “Who saw how she died?”) Is an amazing heroine. This is one of the best Martino films.
