Not seeing the film in the original cinema, I was pleasantly surprised when the DVD appeared, as this film did not have the wide distribution it deserved. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington's directorial debut and the finished product have nothing to envy other films on the same topic of more experienced directors. The film looks very professional. This shows that Mr. Washington learned a lot from the other side of the cell. He brings a different look to this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the film is, without a doubt, the wonderful performance of Derek Luke. He is an actor who, with the right guidance, will go far, no doubt. His view of a restless young man, at this moment in his life, in turmoil and suffering because of a bad hand, was still very faithful to him. His Antwone is a beautiful portrait of a man suffering from pain, who is mostly very good and has so much to give, but no one seems to see this side of his character. <br /> <br /> At the worst of his despair, Antwone goes to Dr. Davenport, played by Mr. Washington, in a very sober, albeit muffled form. Because of the longing in Antwon, he misses the opportunity to open himself to this person who wants to help, but because of the restrictions imposed on his office, just hold three sessions and then have to dismiss his patient. <br /> Things are working out, as Antwone can convince the doctor to continue working with him. The past of Antwone is revealed in details. His ill-treatment by Mrs. Tate, his adoptive mother, is at least cruel. Attempting to incite an elderly woman in Tateâ€™s home to sexual harassment gives Antwone a bitter taste that persists with him throughout his adult life, as he suffered from the shame he brings with him. <br /> Antwone finally finds love with Cheryl, who is patient enough to make him see the other world thanks to the love she provides, and the support she provides to him. <br /> <br /> The presenters are really very good. Denzel Washington's Dr. Davenport also has his problems. He is also not a happy tourist. He can help Antwone, but he cannot help himself or his relationship with his adoring wife. <br /> <br /> The talent in the film is incredible. Joy Bryant makes lovely Cheryl. Novella Nelson, a wonderful actress, gorgeous, like Mrs. Tate, a foster adoptive mother. <br /> <br /> The reunification of Antwon with his unknown family is too sweet and sentimental, but, of course, if you believe that Fisher finally finds happiness, you must accept this part of the film.
