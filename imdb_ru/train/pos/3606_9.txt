I really liked the Girl Fight. This is what I could look again and again. The game was fantastic, and I thought that Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the film. I can say very convincingly. The film shows how women should protect what they want to do in life. She had so much compassion and at the same time so much hate. Communicating with an ignorant father did not really help her. Although he loved her, he was really hateful. Her mother died when she was younger, and it also added sadness to the role. The love story was a part that I really liked in the film. I felt the passion they had for each other. Then the drama begins again, and then she seems to choose between her boyfriend and her dream of a lifetime. I thought it ended just right. It was such an end, when you have to decide what happened in the future for them. For all of you, people who like a movie based on a sport with a good storyline, I would suggest you watch this
