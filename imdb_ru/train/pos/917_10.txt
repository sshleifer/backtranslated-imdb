I watched it in July and even found it touching and sensitive with a Christmas theme. This is not for a person with a mind of reality, as he is full of fantasies and pleasant moments that sometimes have no meaning. William Russ did a great job, like Hank. I only saw him in the long hot summer remake, where he played a weak character. But in this, the expression in his eyes everywhere, when Hank looked at what was happening to him, was wonderful and gentle. Valeria Bertinelli, as usual, was excellent and sweet and very believable in this role. And Peter Falk as Max was great and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes. There were a lot of special scenes, including the one where Hank realizes who Max really was. This is not for everyone ..... especially for those who are not fond of movies with well-being, and this is definitely! If you like everything to be perfect and make sense, avoid it. But I think it's worth reviewing, so I wrote it down. (Yes, some of us still have VCRs. :)
