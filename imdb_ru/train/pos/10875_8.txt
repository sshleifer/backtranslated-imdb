The first mainstream slasher movie in Australia hits the screen with a bang. And hit. And a piece. And a scream or two. And a lot of blood, fears, red herrings and a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is a lot of Cut first - this will be Dave Warnerâ€™s first script, although he has several other options. or in negotiations; this is the first major film by the director and former Hoodoo Guru Kimble Rendall; and this is also the first film for producer Martin Fabigny. And for a group of guys, the first time they put their fingers in this genre, they probably know their stuff. <br /> <br /> Cut tells the story of a group of Australian filmmakers who hear about the slasher movie, Hot Bloody, it was never finished because its director, Hilary (Kylie Minogue), was killed by an actor playing a psycho-killer in film. <br /> <br /> Despite their lecturer (who was an assistant director on the night Hilary died), warning them that whenever someone tries to start Hot Blooded production, someone dies again, directed by Raffi ( Jessica Napier) and producer Hester (Sarah Kants) decide to go ahead and complete the film. They put together a team and were able to get the original star, Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald), to return to Australia - in fact, to its original place - to complete "Hot Blood." 14 years after the cessation of filming. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a slasher film, a lot of bloodshed? long with lots of laughter, a few good scares and a terrific Australian soundtrack. The clipping shows that Australia can make a good, terrible film for the mass market just like Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This is a carefully thought-out function, with great special effects, a taut story and a killer - Scarman is Welcome to the ranks of Michael, Jason and Freddie.
