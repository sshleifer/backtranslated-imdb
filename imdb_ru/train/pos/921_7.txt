Probably trying to find another “Hot Property” for adaptation, the Fleisher brothers recall their very successful foray into the world of newspaper comics, releasing “POPEYE THE SAILOR” in 1933 (Fleischer Studios / Paramount). Despite the fact that she was part of the BETTY BOOP series, Miss B leaves everything else as a pilot episode for the possible appearance of a full-length series. <br /> <br /> As it has now become known, the coarse, cross-eyed, muscular sailor has become, perhaps, the most successful cartoon series in history; survived and literally survived Fleischerov and their studio, continuing to this day. <br /> <br /> Returning to the King Features for another attempt at luck, no doubt, became the reason for trying out the very popular character Henry Comics in the BETTY BOOP exit; The goal is to search for another series. The reasoning then certainly seemed reasonable. Henry was the most popular feature in the Hearst Papers lineup; speaking as a supplement to daily and Sunday color comics, PUCK, Comics WEEKLY. You know, "What fools these mortals are!" Do you remember this, Schultz? When viewing the plump, small, bald boy of the comic book “Hero” and his screen antics, both alone and in tandem with Miss Betty; we were pleasantly surprised to see how well the character handled it. The plot and director Dave Fleischer provided a lot of comic-like situations and jokes that seemed most appropriate for little Henry's character. These mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film, remaining faithful to the printed page; since the “Henry” was basically made in a 4-color “pantomime”. <br /> <br /> In the animated film titled “Betty Boop with Henry: The Funniest American Woman” (Fleischer Studios / Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935), we see that there is; basically this is one situational exercise; being interspersed with Dave Fleischer's usual multitude of rapid fire, like a machine gun. In short, Henry notices a puppy in the window of the pet shop Betty Boop. This is a kind of love at first sight, when Henry tries to buy a small puppy for the only money he had on the coins in his pocket. According to Miss Boop, he wants $ 2 to pay for a purchase in an era of depression. Tears appear when the little guy departs sadly. <br /> <br /> BUT soon there is a delay on the horizon, when Betty asks the boy to look at the store while she leaves urgently. In exchange for his services, Miss Betty promises him a little dog in exchange. Of course, they have a deal, and Betty leaves. <br /> <br /> GETTING work on cleaning the cells and feeding the livestock allows the Fleischer crew to launch a whole new series of jokes; this time with bird seed, bald henry pate and a broom. (But not all at once, of course, Schulz!) Henry's enthusiasm for mass feeding the avian population of the store through the first literal seeding of his head soon leads to a mass flight of birds; Leaving the store on an open street in a mass break in prison. <br /> <br /> Betty returns to this mind and expresses her frustration and anger at Henry’s temporary departure. All bets have been dropped, there is no dog for Henry. He starts to leave; depressed; but soon convinces the owner to give him another chance to correct the situation. His head is covered with bird seed, he manages to drive all the little feathered creatures; returning them to the pet store henhouse. Fortunately, the little guy leaves; but this time he has his little sweet puppy licking his face. <br /> <br /> NECESSARY, it was a winning combination. We have a carefree, energetic, free skating boy, Betty's kindness and emotion of the situation and the dubious result of the situation "the boy and his dog." Max and Dave Fleischer presented us with a kind of miniature masterpiece of a surrealistic comedy short film. <br /> <br /> We were very surprised that the HENRY series did not follow. Judging by the fairly correct treatment of the character, it could certainly withstand for a while. In any case, this team was in many ways the best of Betty Boop's photos. Although the first, POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer / Paramount, 1933), was the most successful (and there was hardly Betty Boop in it, with the exception of the cameo as a carnival hula dancer); Henry Short was much better than the next two “Kings” with “Beatty Boop”, “King Beatty”, “Betty Boop” and “Jimmy”, both of 1936. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
