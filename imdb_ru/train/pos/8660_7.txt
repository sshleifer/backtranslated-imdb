This is a racist film, but worthy of study and pleasure. For the first time through this natural tendency to focus on Erbe & Dad. They have a calm, placating thing when she is still at home about to finish high school, and he retired and recoiled, waiting for inspiration to do something. The second time you realize how terrible her sister's husband is rejecting her friends in a blues bar. He takes it, this is what needs to be done these days, and the critical moment passes, as if they were chatting about the weather. In the same scene, the sister's blues song is a real tear if you are less sensitive and love that kind of music. Her performance is like the culmination of a story; a history of blues with nice guys being "people of color" in their element in a deep forest, South Carolina. Meanwhile, all white people in the film lead what seems like a meaningless meaningless life, suitable only for the birth of children. It's cool if you admit this is fiction.
