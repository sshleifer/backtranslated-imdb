Despite the fact that I was far ahead of the target audience, I always had a weak spot for fiction YA, so I was naturally intrigued by Nancy Drew's return to the screen. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. The central secret, in which the long-dead actress appears, is presented in a simplified form with features of danger to the young detective. Nancy and her friends never take the threat seriously, so young viewers will not be upset. <br /> <br /> From the story I really appreciated that the end results were quite serious and significant, and Nancy seemed to understand and develop. from experience. <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is gorgeous, like Nancy Drew, and hopefully we will see her again in another riddle.
