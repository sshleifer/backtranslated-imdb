I watched this French horror movie last night, and I really liked it. The entire film takes place in a prison cell, where mostly three prisoners who find a handwritten diary in the wall from a serial killer who escaped from prison 20 years ago, somehow without leaving the cell. Looking through the diary, they discover that he delves into the black arts and the teams, which may be their way out of the cage and towards freedom. What they discover is something completely different and, at least, terrifying. I like low-budget horror films that deliver goods quite qualitatively and tell a good story. This film does exactly that, even though it takes time to get started. The result and the horror they cause are very interesting to me, and I enjoyed the trip. Not a lot of blood, but it doesn't fit the story, although her blood is pretty good.
