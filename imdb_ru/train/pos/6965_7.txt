This film answers the question of how a relationship survives when your girlfriend is addicted, clinging, in need, jealous ... and has abilities and abilities that far exceed the capabilities of mortal women? <br /> <br /> Without spoiling the film, I can safely assure you that this is not so, but along the way you will be very fun. Uma Thurman is perfect as a mercurial superhero, a super-baby mysteriously called the G-Girl, who, unlike most of her sisterhoods, is not always "committed" to truth, justice and the American way. <br /> <br /> Thurman is as believable as the idiotic, yet charming, curator of Jenny. When she is thrown for a less well-off, but more emotionally protected and well-tuned opponent, the G-Girl becomes ballistic, and what follows is not beautiful. This is ridiculous, but it is not beautiful .. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful premise, hell does not have rage, like a despised superheroine, and those who are involved in it cannot stand it, but it has its moments I think I will get a DVD. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie ..
