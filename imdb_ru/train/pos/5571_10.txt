After watching the movie "Whipped" at the distributor screen in AFM, I have to say that I was very impressed. The audience laughed all the time. Unfortunately, each territory has already been sold, so I did not have the opportunity to purchase a film, but I sincerely believe that it will be a great success both inside and outside the country. I agree with the comment that “Whipped” should not be called male “Sex and the City”, mainly because, unlike “Sex and the City”, “Whipped” is a satire about dating, which never perceives itself too Seriously. "Whipped" mocking relationships so that most sexual comedies would not dare. In addition, the film, which I showed in AFM, contained more plot and history than Swingers, Clerks and Sex and the City combined. "Whipped" never slowed down for a second and gave the audience a non-stop comedy. The performances of Amanda Pete and the rest of the cast were exceptionally good, which only made the film more impressive considering the budget.
