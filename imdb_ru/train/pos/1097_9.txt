I did not give “Mr. Blandings is building his dream home” 10/10 because of the aspect that makes us cringe a bit in the 21st century: the fact that a black person is a faithful servant (something resembling Stepin Fetchita) besides this, the film is a scream. By portraying Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Mirna Loy), a New York middle class couple trying to build a house in Connecticut, this film is something for everyone. <br /> <br /> Grant is his usual frivolous person, and Loy is very good as just a wife. But Melvin Douglas adds a bit of real laugh, like Jim's lawyer and Muriel Bill Cole, who seems to have more plans than he lets know. As for the house itself ... for most of the movie, you are likely to feel ambiguous about whether you want to live there. Builders, contractors and others also contributed their share of laughter. <br /> <br /> In general, the classic comedy. Also starring Louise Beevers, Reginald Denny, Sharin Moffet, Connie Marshall, and Jason Robards Sr.
