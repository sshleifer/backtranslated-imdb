In 2002, there was not a day when I was not harassed by the scarecrow, and I felt that this film coped well with a serious problem. <br /> <br /> He brought a lot of memories because he was so realistic. <Br /> <br /> Even today, I have nightmares about corn on the cob, and I can't even go to canned things for fear of my life. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that once in a movie that I had to turn off because he hit too close to home. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have never been attacked by stuffed animals, you can see how he treated us by watching this movie. Victims <br /> <br /> This film teaches us not to take life for granted and not to get involved in corn, believe me, I was there and I have scars <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, it's amazing and informative
