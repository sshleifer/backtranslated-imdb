Good Earth is a great movie !!! Everyone must see ... This is a jerk and warms the heart. This contributes to the formation of values ​​in relation to perseverance, humility and love for the family ... History may be associated with our life today, especially with the fact that poverty is on the threshold. How we respond to such a problem is very important, and if a person is not strong enough to face such a problem, he can remain unprotected and useless. I am very pleased that the characters justify their roles even by young actors ... Their emotions captivated the audience. Perhaps the film was shot in black and white, but the story is so exciting that you don’t want to finish. That makes it really great! There must be a remake for this very good movie.
