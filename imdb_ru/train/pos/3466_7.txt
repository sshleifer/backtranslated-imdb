it was a real sense of guilt ... I saw the trailer and all the commercials, so I thought, "Why not watch this VH1 movie?" and, as they said on TV, “I can't believe I watched it all!” Quinn and Harris were believable Beatles guys, and although the accents were kind of excessive and sometimes difficult to decipher, I also found the dialogue believable. The film dealt with len / mc's fragile relationship and showed that, deep down, they were just two guys who grew up close to each other and shared a passion for music, although they faced different problems and personal needs. You'll find that you want them to jump into the cockpit to get an improvised reunion that could knock the socks of the world, but you also get a big mark on why they didn't.
