I first saw this film as a teenager, at about the age when children start thinking about their personality. I was very affected by the scene of the man and the children he brings up as his own. The older boy scoffed at the fact that his mother was a prostitute, and none of his brothers and sisters had such a biological father (which Kurosawa makes obvious, having children who do not resemble each other). The man still convinces the boy that he is their father by the only definition that matters. A man is considered the father of all children, except one, who still prefers his brother. <br /> <br /> Each of the vignettes is also convincing in terms of its own stories and conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, even if it’s not Kurosawa’s best movie.
