Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 stars. <br /> <br /> The theme “Mr. Destiny” is repeated in many films of different years. His theme ranges from recent parodies of such plots (see “Scrooged”) to the same more serious and dramatic concept that worked in “It's a beautiful life”, and a century earlier in Scrooge’s history, as Charles Dickens told in “Christmas Song . " "This is due to the fact that an ungrateful person is taken on a tour of his life and is watching how his life could (or should have been) first-hand." <br /> <br /> In most films of this type, the Guardian Angel saves a person from ingratitude and shows him his life in retrospect, or how it could be. It should have been. Would. In this case, we are shown a businessman named Larry (James Belushi). He hates his life. He lives with an uninteresting wife (Linda Hamilton) and craves more life with more meaning. If only he had hit the ball at the state high school championship many years ago. He is convinced that his life would be better. I think he remembers this seemingly small moment of his life, because he had a great influence on his subconscious side, but I doubt that an adult person craves for one act from high school. However, it works in the film. <br /> <br /> In any case, one evening Larry drives home from work, where he and John Lovitz when he broke down the car. He goes to the bar in search of a payphone and reluctantly decides to tell the bartender (Michael Kane) about how his life is going. It is here that for the first time we see him remembering his baseball strike as a child. <br /> <br /> The bartender listens and nods, apparently without worrying about other customers. This is probably due to the fact that the bar, although old and tattered, seems to have never been occupied by any living person, except these two people. In fact, Larry even commented that he had never seen a bar before. This is most likely for a specific reason, which the public expects before Larry. <br /> <br /> So the bartender, who, like Clarence, can be the incarnated angel of God, pours Larry his own special drink, which ultimately turns Larry’s life, showing him what his life will be like as if he had hit the house all those years before. But at first, Larry had no idea of ​​any changes, just as Jimmy Stewart did not realize that Clarence had erased his life before he went to the bar and was kicked out. Larry still does not notice any changes until he goes to his house, On the street there is another lawn, and in his house there is a big man like a fighter. <br /> <br /> Soon Larry learns that his life would really change if he hit the house. Instead of marrying Linda Hamilton, he married Rene Rousseau and moved to a large mansion with children. He learns that John Lowitz is no longer his friend, but his employee. And the most surprising of all the facts is that in his new life, which Larry always wanted ... he longs for his old wife Linda Hamilton; proof that sometimes money and a great, but shallow wife do not make up everything in a man's life, like a smart wife, love and true happiness. Just as “This is a wonderful life” showed the audience that a person’s life is what he does and that every person influences people, Mr. Destiny shows us that material wealth is not the same thing as spiritual wealth , the lesson taught us again and again, but it was never so fluffy, memorable and really cute, as shown in “Mr. Destiny”. <br /> <br /> “Mr. Destiny” is never extremely funny, but this is a sweet, good-natured comedy that never takes itself too seriously. The problem with all these "wonderful lives", such as "Family Man", is that they try to be as influential and memorable as "These are wonderful lives." But there are only so many times when you can wreck a famous movie alone, and “Mr. Destiny” knows about it and actually plays. He is not trying to be something that he is not; rather, this is what he did not try to be, and this is obvious to the audience. <br /> <br />
