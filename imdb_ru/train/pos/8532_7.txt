Lupine is sent to Morocco in search of the legendary treasure. His only clue is an interesting jewel that the old man gave him. This is a great place for Lupine, with the desert and this hot exotic atmosphere. <br /> <br /> One interesting thing about this film is that Jigen plays a much smaller role than usual and is usually located elsewhere than Lupine. On the one hand, their classical dynamics together is absent, but this is a change of pace. Plus, in this way, Lupine can focus on the ladies ... <br /> <br /> Fujiko rules this. Throughout the film, she seduces Lupine and us, the audience. Then there is Lara, the maid of this particular story, and she is very pretty. This movie has more nudity than any other Lupine anime, and that's a funny difference. <br /> <br /> There is a very interesting effeminate ninja, who is the best villain in this business, and, naturally, he fights well with Goemon. and also some funny scenes with Fujiko. Inspector Zenigata, of course, is also here on the path, in excellent shape. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a relaxing trip with Lupine. The plot is average and there are some slow moments, but in general this film is a real pleasure. Enjoy.
