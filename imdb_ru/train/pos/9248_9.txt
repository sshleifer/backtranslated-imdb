Hold Your Man finds Gene Harlow, a girl from Brooklyn from the working class, who falls in love with the cheater Clark Gable and gets into a variety of troubles. The film begins as his film, but by the time it ends, the emphasis definitely switches to her character. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Gable, who plays an outdoor game with his partner, Harry Owen, and a sign shouting for the Cops. When Gable is followed by ducks in Harlow’s apartment, and he’s such a charming guy, she covers him. <br /> <br /> Soon she contacts him and, unfortunately, with his rackets. Gable, Harlow and Owen are trying to pull drunk Paul Hearst on the game of badger, but then Gable will not cope with this. Of course, when Hurst realizes that this is a fraud, he still hurts and becomes belligerent, and Gable must hit him. But then he is dead outside of Harlow’s apartment, and this platinum blond hair makes her easily recognizable. She approaches an accomplice of manslaughter. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is hers and her adaptation to prison life. Her communication with other female prisoners gives her very good scenes. I think some of the material was later used for the classic MGM Caged. <br /> <br /> Harlow also performs the title song, and it is made like a ballad in the style of a torch, very popular in those days. She speaks / sings like Sophie Tucker, and very well. <br /> <br /> Gable is well known as a fraudster who develops a conscience role he often played, especially in my favorite movie Gable Honky Thonk. <br /> <br /> Yet it is Harlow who will get the light in this film. I think this is one of the best things she did at MGM, her fans should not miss it.
