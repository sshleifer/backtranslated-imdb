The film, which dramatized the understandable reluctance to meet with the inevitable approach of the Second World War, when the Spanish Republican, who was soon sent by his overthrown government (Charles Boyer), penetrates into England in search of support for his business, trying to influence wealthy mine owners so that they do not sell coal fascists in spain. He upsets the locals, being convincingly beaten in one scene, and then in the film in the face of an angry crowd of miners who see him as yet another threat to their precarious life. Despite the socio-economic hierarchy, xenophobia and world politics, this film masterfully plunges into a dark and tense intrigue with the participation of unfaithful compatriots played by Katina Paksinu and Peter Lorre, and masterfully filmed in numerous dark scenes filmed in the gloomy hotel by James Wong Howe and manages to fall under the skin more than once.
