“Castle of Blood” (“Castle of Horrors”) is a well-designed, surprisingly creepy recording by Italian director Anthony Dawson. Exquisite black-and-white cinematography, impeccable dubbing, excellent casting, fairly logical scenarios, deliberate stimulation, and an unexpected (albeit quite relevant) final — all this stands out. Only films, sometimes hockey music and a rather sharp “love at first sight” between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivière) is a surprisingly interesting film. <br /> <br /> During a visit to England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub telling one of his ghostly stories to Earl Blackwood. Acknowledging a great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, asks for an interview with Poe. In the course of the conversation, By shows that all his stories are true. Incredibly, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Earl Blackwood proposes to argue with Alan 100 pounds that he can not survive that night at Blackwood Castle, the night after Halloween, when the dead walk. Alan can not afford a bet, so he puts his life on a 10-pound bet. <br /> <br /> Unlike the exaggerated “Black Sunday” by Mario Bava (“The Mask of Satan”), “The Castle of Blood” is rather restrained, which makes a few moments of violence even more terrible, especially surprising from the director, usually associated with these horrible Italian space films of the 60s. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the only version of this film I found is a badly damaged (and recorded) version of pan and scan. Despite this, it's worth seeing and calling out to a modern remake, possibly with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt as Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy the film, which compares well with Robert Wise's Phantom.
