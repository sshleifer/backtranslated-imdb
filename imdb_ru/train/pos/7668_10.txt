I liked this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is just great in it. Plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt. (And this is absolutely amazing.) 2) The film helped inspire me to the role-playing game “Magician: Awakening.” I showed it at various LARP parties, and it was always a big hit. <br /> <br /> D & D love and Jeff-squeeing aside, this is not quite a masterpiece, but it is well made and very pleasant. The plot moves fast and attracts with its simplicity, special effects are pretty good for such a small budget, and the script, although nothing stellar, was not too badly made, and stupid in all the right places. A good way to spend the evening.
