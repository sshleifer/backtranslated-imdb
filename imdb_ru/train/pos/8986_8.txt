Anton Newcomb makes a film, and he is the main theme. Observing how he performs the song, if not the whole album, quickly showed the guy a real talent. He thinks he is god, but so wonderful and interesting. DW is actually not that interesting in a musical or in another sense. "Hey, do you have a driver's license?" Anton says to the operator: "Well, let's lay this guitar!". Excellent use of archive / home video material. Nice to see rock documents still being created. Cool document on the creative process. If you like it, watch Nirvana Live! This night! Sales! on dvd. Good experience Anton this film. 8 out of 10
