It was in our theater in Amsterdam, and the film we wanted to see was sold out, so we went for it, knowing nothing about it, except for the documentary film about the planet. We were very pleased with our misfortune, as it was a very powerful film about life and delicate balance that we all share with the rest of the inhabitants of the Earth. This film contains some of the most exciting photographs I have ever seen in the film, and he took me from the deserts to the oceans to tropical forests and showed things that I had never seen in films, on television or in a book! “Earth” is a film that every student must see before he is exhausted. I urge my niece to watch this film, as she will inherit the planet that we are leaving. This is also a film that can be seen on the theater screen or on a large TV, because the photo is very powerful and exotic.
