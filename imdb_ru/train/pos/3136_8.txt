Strangely pleasant effort, combining respectively contrived story with the participation of Adam and Bert and the memories of the original series. Most of the memories were taken directly from Bert Wardâ€™s book Boy, Miracle: My Life in Pantyhose, and I think his book served as inspiration for the creation of this film. Like this book, fans of the original series crave more. <br /> <br /> If you missed this broadcast, you should borrow the tape from a friend who could have recorded it. I am making a copy for my children right now.
