"Someone is at the door." Ohhh, how I miss this show so much ... but we are lucky that now there is an "Invasion". Thank you, Sean Cassidy. In the American Gothic was everything. If I had to choose one thing that I liked most about the show, it must be her “unpredictable plot lines”. Favorite actor was Lucas Black. I adore this southern accent. I bought a DVD as soon as possible, and my children are also fans. There are some hot Russian doubles scenes. Some devilish too. So, if Kido will look, you can edit (fastforward / skip). He has humor at the level of Joss Wade, who is so lacking in many shows. Adult wit and adult situations that are handled with Finnish. There are some extras on the DVD, but I would like them to be a lot more. If you want to have fun and enjoy a great show, come see “American Gothic”!
