I know the snobs of the movie are sniffing. But if you are looking for an amazingly fun ride through the jungle of a B-movie, try Jake Speed <br /> <br /> Sometimes he is a little thin, but his single-line and location is more than necessary. for that. John Hurt (God loves him) seems to be having fun fulfilling his role as an ultra evil white slaver. Nemesis Crawford, Jake Speed. He adds a dimension to the film that only a professional like Hart can provide. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jakes' assistant) are a good team, although you wonder why they both put up with each other. However, together Crawford and Christopher portray a team that will be so funny that if you can overcome yourself for a moment you may find that you are behaving like a child again in situations and inherent in the unknown suspense. The delightful Karen Kopins copes well with the role of the unfortunate girl who cares more about the motives of her savior than her tormentor. <br /> <br /> I have yet to find a film that would be just as fun, not preaching, or stuck in a film, trying my best. Not every film should be the last "Citizen Kane". And believe me, Wells was the original. So let's remember that sometimes movies are for fun. No social comments or attempts to politically influence the audience. But just for the pleasure of being alive and living in a time when our hero lives in a celluloid dimension.
