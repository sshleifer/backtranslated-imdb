In the final chapter of the Hunzo-Razor trilogy, this fascinating series of samurai exploitation ends. Inoue replaces Yasuza Masumura (the Blind Beast, Red Angel, Mandji) in the director's chair, but the style is almost the same, perhaps because of Shintaro Katsu, acting as a producer, in addition to the title antihero. <br /> <br /> Hanzo discovers a female ghost who guards the treasure hidden at the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo, being Hanzo, is not embarrassed by the fact that she is a ghost, so he continues to rape ... hmm, interrogate her using a familiar rotating network device. The plot goes through a series of blind monks who are also twins as borrowers, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the necessary hacking. Hanzo's senior officer, Onishi and his two servants, provide typical comedic notes, and, as a rule, this is business as usual. <br /> <br /> Much less confusing and easier to follow than the first (which is everywhere) and a bit of confusion), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (perhaps the best in the Hanzo series), but still interesting and worthwhile on its merits. In addition to trademark training sequences, mandatory rape, sword fighting, and a riddle that Hanzo called for an investigation, this will ultimately satisfy fans.
