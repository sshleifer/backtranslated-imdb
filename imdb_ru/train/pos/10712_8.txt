This film is best described or compared with Big Fish (Tim Burton film). But this is less glamorous and more in your story. And, of course, itâ€™s not his father who tells, but his grandfather. <br /> <br /> Movie narrative also moves back and forth (so that the outlines of the story on IMDb can tell you more than you wanted to read before watching the movie). It's funny and quite fascinating, even if you go from one story to another and also experience dramatic moments. It also surprises you here and there, with things that you do not expect. Good little movie that deserves your attention, especially if you like such movies! : ABOUT)
