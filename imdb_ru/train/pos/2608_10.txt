Rosanna's final season was a crazy rollercoaster ride. This last episode does what the previous comment says, it tells us that as much as we might think that we knew characters we did not know. Roseanna returns to the first season and tells us that this show was her embodiment of her life. In this latest episode, she says that she has changed events and people as she sees fit. Scott really wasn't with Leon, but he existed. In real life, Mark and David married opposite wives, and Dan died when she made him live. Since events occurred in her life, she changed them in her letter. Don't we want us to do that. Not all of us have a moment in time when we would just like to use an eraser and change to your liking. This is what she did with the whole episode. And on another comment, I would say that I do not feel deceived, the family was real in my mind, it just changed the way events occurred in their lives. A + ends A + show !!!!
