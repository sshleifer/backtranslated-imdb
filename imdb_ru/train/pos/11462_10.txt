CAUTION, SPOILERS! This film, Zero Day, tells about the lives of two students, Andre and Calvin, who feel resentment and hatred for anyone and everything connected with this school. <br /> <br /> They continue the series of thoughtful “missions” leading to a huge mission that is a zero day. The content of the zero day is not indicated until the middle of the film. The viewer knows that he is serious and full of hatred, but he is never sure to the end. <br /> <br /> Now we all know that if the film is based on a massacre in Columbine, the end of the film is pretty obvious. And the finale is no different from any other attack movie, in the end they kill many of their fellow students. <br /> <br /> I have seen a lot of films about this attack, and this film is far my favorite and most respected. It gives the viewer and a view from the inside on the lives of these two teenagers who hate life, and, frankly, it gives the viewer a bit of insight and a terrible event. <br /> <br /> Being only 7 when the Events broke out, I never knew about the seriousness of the shooting, until an essay or story about a defining moment in our generation was written in English. Well, I knew that everyone was going to choose the twin towers, but I wanted to be different, because, of course, the twin towers were tragic and very decisive, but I did not think it was the right choice for me, because I really didn’t there was no way to relate to this, because I was only in 3rd grade, and I had no idea what it all meant. But the shooting left the effect. I remember the interview, the school’s views on the sky, and the pain and terror in the eyes of thousands of people. <br /> <br /> This film is a convincing, down-to-earth and terrifying masterpiece, and I would recommend it to anyone.
