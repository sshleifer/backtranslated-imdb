As a convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I try to learn as much as possible the history of my new religion. I was invited to the screening of this film along with my sons and other young men and women, as well as their families from our ward. <br /> <br /> On a lovely spring evening, we went to Kirtland, Ohio, to the historic village church there. We had to have reservations at the Vistor Center to view this film. Since my viewing of the film was limited to only a few church documentaries, I was intrigued. The only “full-length movies” of the church that I saw were Heritage and My Best Two Years, which, it seemed to me, were very well written and prepared. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the missionary-translator distributed the fabrics, saying that several people were deeply moved by this film. I thought, "Well ... but I need to make me cry." Imagine my surprise when I found myself crying! This is indeed a very touching and inspiring testimony from the Prophet Joseph Smith. <br /> <br /> Look at this and believe in this powerful message!
