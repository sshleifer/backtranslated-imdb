Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave all people the opportunity to love the whole world, but given that the human heart is very small, each person has that particular place that he loves more than any other. It seems to me that this could be the motto of some of the most prominent directors of our time, when they intended to profess eternal love for this particular place and depict situations in the lives of its inhabitants and visitors. The result was a remarkable collection of short films Paris je t'aime, in which our guides Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others lead us through a breathtaking walk through the Parisian districts, human feelings, aspirations and expectations. /> <br /> Always some other quarter, always some completely touching story about ordinary people who are looking for love, whether in the parking lot, in an art studio, at a subway station. And Paris je t'aime is a lot of love - love for your partner, child, parent, for those who meant peace to us, but no longer around, love that needs to be kindled, happy love for this stranger when your eyes meet or love, which simply is not destined to be ... today, and tomorrow - who knows? <br /> <br /> However, this film is not only about love, but about life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, daily ups and downs. And his most important quality is the fact that he is not so gentle at all, but rather warm and full of hope. <br /> <br /> I give this film 9, because the last section tells how some stories can continue to develop, but not all of them, and this is what I consider to be missing, and under "further development" I do not mean any specific reference to the future of the characters. As for everything else, I can only say - fascinating. Makes you want to leave everything behind, run to Paris and live these little romances yourself.
