Paul Lucas played the Russian intellectual, earning a living as a waiter in the Grand Slam director William Diterle (1933). This is an amazingly funny satyr from celebrity construction. The waiter and the girl in the Russian restaurant, played by Loretta Young, become America's mistresses as bridge partners who do not quarrel. With the help of McCann’s “Speed” publicist and ghost writer (surprisingly unperturbed Frank McHugh) they became a walking advertisement for the Stanislavsky system, the application system, whatever it was <br /> <br /> (since the stakes are not rational, there is no basis for accusing them of being stupid). <br /> <br /> A duel with a displaced bridge guru Cedric Van Dorn (sounds close to Goren, no? and I suspect that choosing the character name "Stanislavsky" was also a blow to another type of system), an inflated charlatan who is very Ferdinand Gottschalk played well, broadcast on radio stations across America, like the Roscoe Karns prize fight (another great, fast-talking comedian of the 1930s). <br /> <br /> Players on the bridge are even on a twisted square, although the public, unlike them, <br /> <br />, unlike them. in boxing "rings". <br /> <br /> A wide variety of American types anticipate Preston Sturges' comedies, albeit for Grand Slam celebrities. most remind of the two best films of the same era (before coding), in which Lee Tracy plays fast-talking publicists: “Half-naked Truth” and “Bomb”, but “Grand Slam” has <br /> <br /> moments, especially for those who played bridge with serious dots <br /> <br /> chips. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young was already a horse for clothes. (I think her face is a little long <br /> and horse too. I think one more idea about the beauty of another era ...) The film <br /> <br />, unfortunately, almost excludes Glenda Farrell who plays the forgetful girlfriend McHugh <br /> <br />.
