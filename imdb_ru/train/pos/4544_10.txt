Well, I know that I don't like this movie, but I like it. From the sweet interpretation of Pat Morita’s Japanese stereotype to Jay Leno’s annoying scream, I laughed at this movie. As long as you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world, this is a good movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is Morita talking to her boss in Tokyo, drinking for a second.
