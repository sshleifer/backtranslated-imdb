This is a film that I can watch again and again and never get tired of it, there is a lot of laughter, weapons, action films, crime, good airliners and a decent plot, with excellence, Donald Sutherland in a rather comedic role assassin. Tia Karerra looks as hot as she ever is, and can act too, Thomas Ian Griffin is great at this because the main character of “Max” DEA agent Diana is the FBI agent played by Karerra and John Lithgow of Frazier plays on television bad guy ,, Livingstone ”. The plot is centered around Max and Diana, trying to capture Livingston, while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for the relevant agencies, throw Assassinein Sutherland into the mix, who has all the good liners, this is the perfect crime privateer, There is an ordinary love story, but it is played in a completely different way than you think of Karerra and Griffith. You also added the Russian mafia, the Italian mafia and the Chinese mafia to this mix, the film was made in Boston, where you have great shots, and the locals, great photos and music in this film, this film is just the embodiment of a criminal comedy, it has everything you can ever want. Check out Sutherland's toilet in a certain scene, very unusual. this film is a rebellion and will make you laugh very strongly 10 plus for me.
