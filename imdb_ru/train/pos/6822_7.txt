Vernissage, released in 1977, is trying to become an ambitious performance. This only works in the truly amazing performance of Gena Rowlands. Her character as theater actress Myrtle is not necessarily the one we would like to love in real life. She is immersed in herself, often unpleasant, and makes life miserable for others - in other words, it is not much different from some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the verge of collapse - we are not quite sure whether the demons she fights are real or imaginary, although we also reveal the secret early. Obviously, Rowlands is lovingly led by her gifted husband, actor / director John Cassavet, who also plays a role in the film. This film is not without flaws - it is too long, and the last part of the film, in which Myrtle takes the stage in a very drunken state, seems almost cruel. “Improvisation” in some dialogs — at least on stage — lasts too long. Some of the supporting characters give good performances, especially from Ben Gazarra, who plays the vile producer Myrtle. The character Joan Blondell never fully develops, and I could never understand why she was in the film, except to reassure Myrtle. Watch this movie only for Rowlands - she is charming everywhere - and it's hard to tear her eyes away from her, although sometimes you want to.
