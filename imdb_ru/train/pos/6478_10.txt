In spite of the fact that from the British point of view, it is the best documentary film of the Second World War ever created. Presented in easily digestible (as assimilable as it can be in war) episodes, when the serious voice of Lawrence Olivier brings together many witnesses who were forced to survive the events of that terrible time. Looking forward to his appearance on DVD in the United States, the Europeans had the opportunity to release a DVD earlier this year.
