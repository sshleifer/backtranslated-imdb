One of the best films of Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers. Great music by Irving Berlin. Strong support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks and Astrid Alwin. <br /> <br /> Awesome songs include “Let Your Go Go”, “Let's Face the Music” and “Putting All”. My eggs are in one basket. "The last song is presented by Aster playing a jazz piano and then a cute dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings" Let Me Go "with Grable among the backing vocalists. <br /> <br /> Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two Lovely songs and plays Rogers' sister. "Get You Behind Me" is a song that lasts for several days. She also sings "But where are you?" This article in the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the best. Classic and amazing The beautiful finale of Let's Face The Music and Dance is one of the most famous of their numbers. Rogers wears one of the greatest dresses in the history of cinema .... a shimmering bright number that spins around her legs when she dances (weighted hem) and also shines a little. Just great. This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters recreated in "Penny from Heaven" . <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott seems like a strange choice, like Astera's boyfriend, but he also appeared in their Robert with Irene Dunn. Fortunately, he is not trying to sing or dance. It seems that in 1936, Grable and Ball would have big roles, but they have several scenes and they have little effect. Alvin plays a more important role, but only in order. <br /> <br /> Rogers has one of the best solo numbers in the series with "Let Yourself Go" .... Jazz and knock, this is a great song. <Br /> <br /> It was fun all the way, although I was tired of "We joined the fleet" after the third time ....
