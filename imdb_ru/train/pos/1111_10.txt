It's not “so bad it's good,” it's pure good! For those who do not understand why, you have the intelligence of a four-year-old child (in response to a certain comment ...). In any case, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of myself, of you and of my parody. This is the most ingenious text in the history of cinema. I have this and three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It embodies the recognition of the absurd and undermines everything that you or I call the standard. I write scripts, and this film alone opened for me the comedy genre, the like of which we have never seen. This can only be taken in portions ... it's kind of exploitative ... now I'm just trying to take at least ten lines. My comment ended some time ago. Hope it works when I ship it now.
