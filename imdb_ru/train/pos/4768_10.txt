I loved it and was so crushed that it does not make another season !!! I wish they would! it was the best show ever !!!!!! they probably have no chance to decide not to cancel the show! haha, i'd love to at least! i would be so excited !! i really would! I miss that! and was especially shocked not to know what was going on with Jason! I think they should do another one .... this I also think it is stupid that you have to write ten lines to leave a comment ... it makes your comment pull ... and no one will read it !! i really want to know what would happen between jason and nicole ... maybe they could get loose !!
