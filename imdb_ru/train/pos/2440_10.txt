WOW. I saw this film at the Irish International Film Festival in Manhattan on March 12, 2000. Both stars were present and were available for questions after. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL FILM! Although the story unfolds in Ireland against the backdrop of Catholic / Protestant antagonism, the story could have happened somewhere between any two groups of people who hate each other. The horror of how quickly people can get carried away when they are given the opportunity to express their hatred and anger, was woven beautifully with an exciting love story mixed with humor and fun. If this is not received in the United States, it will be very unfortunate. <br /> <br /> As for the stars and supporting players ... FIRST BET. I heard that they call Eagle Brady Irish Meryl Streep. In my opinion, she is BETTER than Meryl Streep. They should call Meryl an American Orla Brady! And the steady and powerful image of Liam Cunningham of a simple and private person involved in a political war was brilliant. <br /> <br /> WATCH THIS FILM.
