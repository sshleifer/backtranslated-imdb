A rather unpleasant business in which Bela Lugosi is a mad scientist (yes, an assistant like Renfield, and his mother, a dwarf and yes, a scientistâ€™s wife (actually sounds like the movie Greenaway, lol) (why are they? who knows?) so that his wife can look beautiful. He gets brides after a pretty clever trick with some orchids that causes brides to crumble on the altar. shovel, and decides to look for the story She gets all sorts of clues about orchids and Lugosi. Heaven knows where the police were. Soon she goes to Bela's lair when she meets a kind of Weird-looking doctor who may or may not be evie. - to arrange a fictitious wedding to catch a mad scientist, but the scientist seems to have X-ray vision because he interferes with her plans, Oh no! What will happen? I actually liked this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure. Lugosi is great here, his henchmen are all very, very strange, in some places the story is actually quite unpleasant, which makes it all the most noticeable. Funny little look.
