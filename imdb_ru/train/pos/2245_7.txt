Salva and his buddy Bigardo were on the verge of the law for most of their lives. We see how they are fooling around in the subway car, where their giving of donations is so lame that nobody gives them anything! Salva, who is a hardened petty criminal, does not even have redemptive qualities, that is, until he finds a reality show on television that gives him an idea of ​​what to do next. Religion and show business are a winning combination, in which Salva benefits. <br /> <br /> He and Bigardo ended up in prison after the accidental death of a priest who criticized the duet. Salva shows that it is natural for reality shows. He transforms himself into a Christlike figure that instantly succeeds in the program. Espe, who is not a meaningless woman, who is the producer of the show, cannot avoid how Salva pays her unusual attention. Ultimately, Salva became a victim of his own success. <br /> <br /> Geordi Molla, whose first directorial work in this film, achieved some success in how the film saturates the role of television. Spain, which was vulnerable to programs of this type, saw its share of the strange that, according to the director, is an attack on the audience, and wanted to show its history from the point of view of people who make luck from a naive audience. <br /> <br /> The cast has good moments in the film. Mr. Molla, like any actor who decided to make his first film, would be more effective by focusing on the picture in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons to watch a movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Jimenez Cacho, Franco Francesco Tonio, Florinda Chico and the rest have responded well to the new director.
