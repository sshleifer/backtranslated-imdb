This is one of the first films that I can remember, or maybe the first. It is such a beautiful film, which sweetly introduces the child to the world of violence and addictions in which we live. Little Baby, Casino and Constantine, itâ€™s all well mixed in a box, and we get it. I do not know if it is really appreciated for children, but I think it was very cool, very funny and interesting. I hate it when a movie (especially the box) can have a good ending and its destruction, because every character should have a happy ending, even if it sounds strange (I'm not a bitter person). But it was good, he just goes to heaven and they allow it that way. <br /> <br /> Everything is just a critic, it's a good movie, something new. very touching and i have to go
