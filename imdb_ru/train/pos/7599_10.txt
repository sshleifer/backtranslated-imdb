Before Lost, everything shown on TV was predictable. You could predict who would die or who would find something, but you could NOT predict ANYTHING in Lost. there was nothing like that until everything was so cool. I literally became addicted to this. LOST is a classic work of art. It gives you something to look forward to every week. This is a genius. The surroundings are gorgeous, the beach is quiet and warm, and in the jungle so scary. The characters are brilliant, each of them is already on the island. The killings are so dramatic that we can never predict their deaths, because they have so many things to do, and so many things that they can tell, and they have secrets that affect other people they killed.
