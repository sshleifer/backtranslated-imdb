I have to say that, looking at Hamlet from a studentâ€™s point of view, Hamlet Brann's version is definitely the best. His desire to remain true to the original text should be welcomed. This helps the play come to life on the screen, and people who hold the text while viewing it easier, as we did during its study, to track and analyze the text. <br /> <br /> One of the things that I have heard many times how the main characters of Hollywood are criticized in the play. I believe it helps viewers to more easily recognize characters, unlike actors who all look and sound the same, which helps in the confusion usually associated with Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> In addition, his memories help clarify many ambiguities in the text. For example, how far did the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia go and why did Fortinbras end up in the castle at the end. In general, this version contains not only brilliant performances of actors familiar and unfamiliar with Shakespeare. It is presented in such a way that one does not need to be a doctor of English literature in order to understand and enjoy it.
