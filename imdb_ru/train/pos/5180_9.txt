This private campsite is located in Plymouth, Massachusetts, and has existed since 1959. My grandparents were among its founders, my parents had a website that was founded in 1965, and my two brothers now have websites. <br /> <br /> (This has nothing to do with the film, be patient with me. <br /> <br /> I have been spending my summer at Blueberry Hill since I was eighteen, and it’s for people. like me, about which this film speaks: those for whom the group camp in the forest was, as my bride says, “a good and happy place.” If you have never encountered this way of life, Indian summer will probably be lost for you ; do not worry This is not a fast pace, he has no quick cuts, the plots are not in any way confused, he has no explosions, such dramatic tension there are no A-list actors, softly, there are no quick jokes just to show how smart the writers are (except, perhaps, for Kimberly Williams’s murderous line that her fiancé should not "roll his toys." last but not least, this film, The Godfather, is just a slasher, because there is a lot of dirt on the screen. <br /> <br /> But Indian Summer is the complete opposite of the godfather. read on, just do it. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a 9/10 film.
