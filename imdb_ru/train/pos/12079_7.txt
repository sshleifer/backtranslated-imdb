For those who think of Dame Mae Whitty as a kind, slightly naughty old woman from the Hitchcock Lady Fading film, this film needs to be corrected. Here she is not at all kind or batty. Instead, her son George McEredy is already insane. Just don't give him a knife, otherwise his eyes will light up, and no furniture cushion in the house will be safe. We now know what he means for the trapped Nina Foch, if he can just get out from under the imperious hand of Mother. <br /> <br /> A really dense little movie “Woman in Danger” that keeps the tension at a high level. The script never deviates from Foch’s dilemma. She is in captivity in a large old gothic house on the edge of an evil sea. They are going to kill her, but why. Her predicament does not make sense. The tension increases when she tries one way out after the other, but even strangers seem to her opponents. We begin to feel her helplessness and increasing paranoia when the world turns away from it. <br /> <br /> Directed by Joseph H. Lewis made a big step towards cult status in this film, and this is understandable. In addition, observe how Foch subtly runs through the gamut of emotions without ever moving over. Witty, too, shines like a really frightening matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can just keep her crazy son in line. My only reservation is the climax, which seems too far-fetched, given the time of events. However, this is a good, nervous way to spend just over an hour, courtesy of Columbia studios.
