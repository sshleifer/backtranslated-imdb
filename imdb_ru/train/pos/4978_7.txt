A nice short shirley temple. Child actors screaming their lines seemed the norm for that day and time. Perhaps to be "seen and not heard" had to be made up. Other than that it's fun. Given the era of cinema, there are certain aspects of this thing, from a social point of view, that seem to me very progressive and liberal. I will not go into details, I would rather not spoil it for you, but let you see for yourself and see if you notice these elements. Already in this short period of time it was easy to see the passion that had already developed for the Temple. It is worth it to see if you are a fan of the Temple. For others, it's a cool way to kill ten minutes while you wait for a glass with a warm night to warm up on the stove.
