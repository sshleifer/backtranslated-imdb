I knew about, but never saw the Gray Gardens before I saw a Broadway musical with the same name. Friends warned me that if I had not seen the film, the musical would have no meaning. This is true, but it also prompted me to rent a movie. At first, I thought it was a train wreck full of strange, screaming characters, and it was extremely difficult to watch. But the ability to stop it, digest it, and return to it made me understand why the Gray Gardens are considered an unforgettable documentary. <br /> <br /> Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable, and their complete lack of self-awareness deserves attention. They both remain beautiful, despite their age. They have a relationship that will cool any woman (and, of course, some men) and make you reconsider your relationship with your mother. In an era when reality shows and movies have become commonplace, it is interesting to observe the work of mayonnaise, created three decades ago, and to realize what impact the film should have. <br /> <br /> I repeat what other authors said: how were they allowed to slip into such misery by their family? But beyond that, how could two people living in the 1970s so completely escape reality? Or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped? I highly recommend watching this with a commentary that gave me an additional insight into the film.
