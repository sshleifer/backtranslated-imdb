Teresa Pawlinek was a popular member of the Toronto cast. She starred in numerous guest and commercials here in Canada. Finally, someone made sense to create a show for her. Auxiliary case also looks good. Now I watched the pilot several times, and I still find him refreshing. Although I'm not sure why the show is listed as "Jane's Show 2004". (I could be wrong). As far as I know, the series was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada in early 2006. fresh idea and hopefully this is good. It is a pity that this can not be paired with Corner Gas. Now I know that Corner Gaz is on CTV, but these two shows will be great companions.
