Compare with Fight Club, Matrix, AI, The Sixth Sense, among others. This film approaches the psyche as never before. The first 30 minutes creates an interesting love story between the Diaz Cruise Cruise. The rest of the film is confusing, you choose more every time you watch it (I went to the cinema to watch it 3 times)
