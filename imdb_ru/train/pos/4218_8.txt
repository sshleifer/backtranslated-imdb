I really haven't seen too many Colombo films ... in fact, I think I only watched one or two, except this one. I always liked Colombo, though, somehow, without even seeing it so much. Peter Falk has always been and remains the ideal choice for a character because of his appearance, voice and charm. Excellent proof of this is that, although the series began back in 1968, the last (and probably not the last) film was shot in 2003. It is 35 years old. And Falk was 40 years old when he did the first. The series consists of 68 films (except for my score), all of which are made for television. Everyone knows this character, although no one has ever seen a movie about him in a movie. This is a great achievement if you ask me. The plot is pretty good. The only problem I encountered is that the killer and the murder are revealed at the very beginning (although this may be the same for all Colombo films), leaving no mystery, but how Colombo solves them, making them somewhat boring (because a lot to look forward to at the end of the film). Walking is good, there is hardly any scene where you are bored. The acting is very good, especially with Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have excellent exchanges of dialogue in the film. Characters are well written and trustworthy. The dialogue and the script are unusually good for a television movie. In general, the film, yes, is surprisingly good for a television film, and definitely worth a look for any Colombo fan and / or criminal / mysterious film. 8/10
