Who ever made up a story, that one sick person. I rented it for our overnight party, and all six of us were shocked because we were all in an acting class and we know a couple of actors from the class. Besides the fact that everyone shouted all the freaky night, I had freakish nightmares. I kept thinking about God, if I got up to go to the bathroom to pee, they would kill me in the middle of a wipe or something like that. I couldn't even go to the bathroom because we watched this horrible horror movie. I also thought why all the girls are topless in this film, but we don't have boys? You have to make a horror movie, where the killer is a girl and cuts off the units. I would watch it again and again. Call it tough, soft or somehow stupid. I give this film only 9, because you have CRIMINAL ME INNER.
