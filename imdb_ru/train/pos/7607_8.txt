It's not well filmed, well written or well played, but it must be the most exciting show I have seen since the time of Twin Peaks. Each revelation is calculated so well that you need to see the next episode to get some kind of completion. They even slowed the pace of the show, where they only show a tiny amount of information per episode, but it seems that they just told you everything you wanted to know. However, some acting games are just awful, and some of the duologies are completely cruel. Some characters are very two-dimensional. More experienced actors, such as Locke and Ecko, really stand out among the actors who play Jack, Kate, Sayid, and so on. The development of the show can also be very frustrating, since the next episode may not show what the previous episode led to. Annoying side scenes have become part of a story that sometimes tells you nothing. However, the second season has evolved to such an extent that past stories reveal more information about the island than before. In general, this is a great show, but not perfect.
