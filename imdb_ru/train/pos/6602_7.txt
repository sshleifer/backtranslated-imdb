Something like Frank Miller and his Sin City comics used black and white for self-expression (and his influences on the film noir), as did Christian Volkmann with Renaissance. <br /> <br /> This is the year 2054 in Paris. In the tradition of science fiction, the future is a bright, sparkling multi-tiered pearl. It is a jewel in conditions of poverty, injustice and darkness; bright and beautiful on top with a dark belly below. One of these “bright” people at the top, a research scientist from a very large and influential global company (Avalon), has been kidnapped. The well-known and effective captain Karas (voiced by the new James Bond - Daniel Craig) is tasked with finding her. <br /> <br /> The plot and layout are not very original. He was strongly influenced by the film Noir, Gibson's Neuromant and other detective stories, as well as films such as Blade Runner, Sin City, Metropolis and Minority Report by Fritz Lang. There is a main plot surrounded by other possible auxiliary sections, which are all connected at the end. It is not difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> The strength and originality of the film lies in its vivid visual presentation. Paris is a complex set of levels and sublevels. It is based on a more primitive industrial infrastructure. As the city rises, so does its architectural complexity and luminosity. And yet, in this structure, the peak is not equated with the elevation of human ideals and behavior. Paris was intricately animated and laid out in brilliant black and white. The film is closer in spirit with Sin City (comic) than with Sin City, the film was with its original material. This is done all the more easily, because it still remains in relatively the same environment; animation. Almost the same as Scanner Dark advanced the visual aspects of storytelling, so is this. Light and dark, black and white create an atmosphere of contrasts, as well as visual ambiguity. Right and wrong, black and white can lose all meaning, at the same time they are right in front of us. The film proves that black and white can be both ambiguous and obvious. <br /> <br /> According to the spirit of the film, I can be a critic and a fan. I can love and hate in one light. This is definitely an experience that I recommend for lovers of fine art. So pour one more black and brown, enter the void and enjoy the ride.
