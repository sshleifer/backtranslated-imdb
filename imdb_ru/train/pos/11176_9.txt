Well, first I must point out the fact that when I first saw this film I was 9 years old. If I had seen it two weeks ago for the first time, I would probably have noticed that this is just another cheap horror movie with cable television with some well-made scenes. But when you're nine, you just don't care about these facts. It scared the hell out of me then, especially those aforementioned Zelda scenes (and they still do). I am currently a bit attached to this film. I should see it, perhaps once a month, and every new year's eve I watch it with 12 packets of beer and a group of friends. It's like a snack for a good party! I kind of agree with those who said that acting is rather meaningless here. Midkiff and Crosby look as though I wanted Louis and Rachel to look alike, but you don't see much loyalty or feeling on the faces of those two. Hughes and Gwynn largely save the scenes that the "faith" takes. What I really want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any resemblance to Pet Sematary, and I donâ€™t mean zombies. ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM DEFINITELY NEW AND ONE OF THE SPECIES. Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that looks like a movie with cable television, but left you in the cold compared to the best horror chillers? Well, a minute ago I broke some of the actors' balls, but I must say that all the plays at this level also perfect the overall game perfectly. But tell me, do you know any film that looks like Pet Semathary? I really would like to know ... And I do not mean the night of the living dead here ... it is much higher than in intelligence compared to this material.
