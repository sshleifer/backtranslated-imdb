Another Spanish film about the 1936 civil war. This time, they tell us the story of Carol (a beautiful play by debutant Clara Lago), a little girl who comes to live in a small Spanish village from New York. This is such an initial trip, and soon she will learn about the injustice of the human race, their stupid fights and conflicts, and their contradictions. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe shoots his best film since Dias Kontados (1994) with such a sober impulse, beautiful photography and a good script. He tries not to participate in the conflict, he just shows us some facts and allows us to decide (well, the facts are clear enough for us to decide which group we are in), and he uses the tremendous advantage of presence and the freshness of the young main role: Clara Lago and Juan Jos√© Ballesta. <br /> <br /> Well-maintained production. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10
