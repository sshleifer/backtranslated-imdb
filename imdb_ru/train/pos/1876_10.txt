Adaptation of the book "In Search of Fish." This story is about a restless young sailor, Antwon Fisher (Derek Luke), who tells about the painful history of his past to psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). The brilliant debut performance of Derek Luke and always a terrific performance by Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> This film was incredible on so many levels, and I was disappointed that I didn't get an Oscar, I think, because it was released at a bad time, so I missed it. I highly recommend this film to everyone, you will be touched by its history, and it really makes the audience feel sympathy for this young man, whose name is Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you like inspiring true stories, watch Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> Thank you
