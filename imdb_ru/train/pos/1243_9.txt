From time to time Eddie Murphy will amaze you. <br /> <br /> In the film, for example, “Golden Child”, especially. In this film, you may have a major role, maybe Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or someone else. But Eddie really works; he is clever, he is funny, he is brave, kind, polite, thrifty, clean and everything else, who should be a hero. <br /> <br /> He was chosen to protect the mystical child who holds the key to protecting the world from complete evil (embodied in the dance) Eddie travels from California to Nepal and back, while fine Ki-Nang (Lewis ) wonders if he is everything he says, and the crazy old holy man (Wong, perfect as always) knows, he is. <br /> <br /> This is exciting, exciting in some places, shocking and, of course, ridiculous. Eddie is the only action, a hero I know, who could start a movie, making rude remarks for some guy reading a porn magazine and at the end of his smart herring remarks about Ed McMahon. <br /> <br /> No problem with this "child": this is the "Golden" find. <br /> <br /> Nine stars. Viva Nepal!
