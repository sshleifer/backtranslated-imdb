Take this film for what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. This is not an epic like the original, itâ€™s rather a popcorn thriller. Visually, this is incredible. Everything else was fine. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is awesome, but I like everything Burton did. People should calm down and stop behaving as if it were the end of the world in this film. This should not have been a remake, and it is not. <br /> <br /> The ending was awesome. I took it as a parallel universe.
