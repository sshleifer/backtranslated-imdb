With the current trend of rude humor, this film is the grandfather of them all. Although some of the humor is outdated, each parody will shock, repel, or make you laugh out loud. The most memorable is the commentary on sex games and, of course, advertising VD. It doesn't always work, but it pays off when it works. I give it 7.
