You need to go and dig these holes. Holes leave only the Troll, which makes the film so good. Disney did it again. Shea LaBouf should be nominated for best male role for the role of Stanley Yelnats. He has already won the Daytime Emmys Best Actor for the comedy series (even Stevens). Holes is one of the best films of 2003.
