Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson and star Binnie Barnes in Lady X Divorce, a 1938 comedy based on the play. Olivier plays a young lawyer, Everard Logan, who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room, when the London fog is too thick for guests to go home at a costume ball. The next day, his friend, Lord Mir (Richardson), announces that his wife (Barnes) spent the night with another man in the same hotel, and he wants to divorce her. Believing that the woman is Oberon, Olivier panics. Oberon, a bachelor and granddaughter of the judge, pretends that she is the lady in question, Lady Mer, when she is really Leslie Steele. <br /> <br /> We have seen this plot or its variations dozens of times. With this composition it is amazing. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, this great team in the Wuthering Heights? Pretty special. Olivier is incredibly beautiful and copes well with the comedy, portraying a nervous, nervous lawyer. Oberon gives his role the right light touch. She looks very young here, with a lush face, Jean Harlow's eyebrows and a very different hairstyle for her. She wears beautiful street clothes, although her first dress looks like a birthday cake, and in one dress she tries on, with this hairstyle she is ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is gorgeous, like a real lady mer. <br /> <br /> The color is in this mess, and, as others have mentioned, he can really use the restoration. Definitely worth a look.
