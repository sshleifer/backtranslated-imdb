The erotic cinema of the 1970s was tame compared to modern triple games, which is good. Because around the bare rituals and sex scenes there is a good story. Of course, I would like them to have some vampire effects that they had at the time, and the floor was a bit in the way of the story. In addition, some accents were difficult to understand at certain times, but it’s worth seeing the unedited version and then the edited version called PLAYTHING THE DEVIL. But if you don’t care how many naked women dance and have sex, then this film is not for you. However, I really enjoyed it, and I give it ... 7 STARS.
