The title somewhat overestimates the content of this film, which may lead to unrealized expectations. Honestly, there is very little “panic on the streets.” In fact, throughout the film, few people know that there is a killer at large who can easily spread the plague to everyone and everyone he encounters. Having said that we have a very well-made story with a level of expectation, which still begins with a fairly high level (because, unlike people "on the streets", the viewer knows what is happening), and this director Elia Kazan builds very consciously . When the plague-infected killer is wanted, one of the most interesting things I discovered was the developing relationship between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and police captain Warren (Paul Douglas). In the beginning, these two really dislike each other, although they have to work together. Towards the end, they created a real bond of respect for each other. Kazan did a great job with this. <br /> <br /> Almost all the performances here were excellent. Widmark and Douglas were great, and I was very pleased with a very early look at Jack Palance, playing what would become his typical "heavy" role. I found very little to criticize here. Barbara Bel Geddes may have seemed as flat as Reed Nancy's wife, but her role was not really central to the story. In general, a great job. 9/10
