This criminal thriller is like a film noir, but it changes the context from postwar to cold war and can say something relatively decent about humanity. In “Pickup on South Street,” police are good guys, criminals are real guys, and the only enemies are “Communists” who ultimately differ from good guys in that they are emotionally personable, driven by real concern for their own value, like show permanent close-ups of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie revolves around characters. The characters in this film are quite unique and detailed: skip the pickpocket, able to look away from any danger, and sometimes passing through their personal belongings; Mo is an informant who just tries to save up for a spectacular funeral, but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of almost all the other characters (and spectators); Candy, an innocent girl with a bad name, who thinks she is only doing government work and does not fully understand the plot with which she is associated; and Joey, the former wicked Komdi Buddy guy who tries to hide everything from everyone and, ironically, the worst person to do it. Add some very bright support characters (such as a guy with chopsticks and policemen), and Pickup on South Street treats you with the splendor of personalities who hunt for mysterious and accidentally stolen frames for microfilms. <Br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
