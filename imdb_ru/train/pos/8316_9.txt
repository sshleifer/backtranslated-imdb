I watched this movie every time I got it, back in the seventies, when it came out by cable. It was my acquaintance with Harlem, who has since fascinated me (and Bill Clinton). I was still very young, and the film made a big impression on me. It was great to see a film about how other young girls grow up, trying to decide who they want to be, and making both bad and good choices. I was amazed at the beauty of Lonette McKee, the gorgeous dresses they ultimately had to wear, and the quick dialogue. As a person brought up by a single mother, I really could identify with these girls and their lives. Funny, these characters seem to me almost more real than Beyonce Knowles!
