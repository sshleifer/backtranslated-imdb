I didn’t come up with “Still Crazy” with any real expectation. Just another rock and roll picture, I get it ... good nostalgia for baby boomers. This film is partially the same, but much more. Brian Gibson, the director, previously led the biography of Tina Turner, and is very successful in his style. I suppose it is entirely appropriate that this was his last film. <br /> <br /> The cast is selected correctly. Bill Nyei is perfect as a group leader. The actor, directed by Bruce Robinson, appears as a washed guitarist for the band. He does an excellent job with his work, although he has not acted in films since the late 70s. If you are looking for a touching and funny movie (with a few great songs), you have found it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
