If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones or any action in general, this is a must see. This series is directed by director William Whitney and John English, starring Reed Hadley as Don Diego / Zorro! I will not bore you with the plot (who cares? Less talk, fight more); what really matters here is an excellent interpretation of the characters and tricks of Dale van Sikkel and Yakima Kanutt. <br /> <br /> *** LAST SPOILERS FOLLOW ***: *** <br /> <br /> You can see the influence of this film on Lukas and Spielberg - Zorro falls into the original version of Star Wars. A trash compactor in one chapter, trapped on the a'la Temple of Doom rope bridge to another, transfers a rider with raiders and even runs through the tunnel while the villains tilt a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind it just like the Mola Ram is doing with Indy in the Temple of Doom. In addition to all this, the whip works great, because Zorro disarms the villains, throws them to a safe place, etc. Most of the work with the sword is slop, except for the first chapter, which tells the amazing sword fight in the cantina, set by the legend of tricks with a sword / Ralph Faulkner, who rarely appears on the screen in the role of the evil Rodriguez. It was the first series I ever saw on Matin√©e in Bijou when I was a kid, and since then I've been hooked. <br /> <br /> Battle Legion Zorro delivers the goods "Z"!
