If you like Deep Cover, you might like this movie. Many of the poetic interludes that Fishburn reads in the Deep Cover are taken from the lyric script “Once in a Life,” an adaptation of the play written by Fishburn. If you love Larry as much as I do, you will love this movie, in which all Larry is all hot and completely naked. Of course, there is a game with weapons and illegal use of psychoactive substances, after all, this is a kind of gangster film, but the script is beautiful and the story is touching, even a little from the point of view of curious chicks. AMAZING movie ... dark, frightening, sexy and exciting. If you ever sneak in at night or hang out in a club house, you will get the proper effect from tight sets (metaphorically repeated in the trap of life). This film is full of ingenious omens and complex relationships, each of which is reflected in the filming and filming of cameras. GOOD JOB!
