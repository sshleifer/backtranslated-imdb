In this wonderful little film there are all the elements that made Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun: great music (one of the few, if not the only ... female composer working in the genre, Nora Orlandi), an exciting sequence of actions (and very evil for the whole day!), and BEAUTIFUL scenery and scenery (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very good story with a good tragic romantic edge to it. The actors do great work - with truly outstanding performances by Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most important role for a woman in a spaghetti western ... outside the cardinal in Leon's Once Upon a Time in the West). Without publishing any spoilers, let me say that this movie contains one of the best endings of any movie I've ever seen!
