Here is another beauty in a series of beautiful films directed by Eitan Fox. The film tells about lovers (one Israeli, one Palestinian) in modern Tel Aviv. The effectiveness of the film stems not only from the description of the interethnic conflict, but also from conflicts of a personal and political nature within ethnic groups. For example, there is a significant moment when one of the minor characters, openly gay, is visited by his boyfriend in the hospital, who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family, and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort washing across the room. Obviously, the young man is not as open as it seems, and the family is not as receptive as he would like, while the guy is confused and rejected. Great complexity packed in the fleeting moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is the master of effective packaging of emotional and psychological complexity in short sequences. The film is also effective due to the fact that it presents the mutual atrocities that the Israelis and Palestinians inflict on each other. If you are not soulless, you will cry to the last third of the film. Although the plot is melodramatic, it is so meaningfully written and acted that it reminds us of how pleasant a good melodrama can be.
