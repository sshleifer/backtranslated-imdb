This is another film “Tell It As It Is” by Madhur Bhandarkar. I'm not sure why he has such an obsessive idea of ​​showing the concept of "Baby Moles" and "g * y" to Indian cinema viewers, but some of these scenes are really disgusting! What's new? This is a good piece created by Bhandarkar, where he shows the story of a reporter who played a leading role in the famous movie “Mr. and Mrs. Ayer.” A distinctive feature of this film is that it also covers the stories of people with whom this reporter interacts or with whom he is friends, such as her neighbors, her colleagues, movie stars, models, rich people and others presented on the number 3 entertainment page in her newspaper. <br /> <br /> Noticeably: this is another good speech by Mrs. Ayer. She will probably be noticed for this role. She performs selective roles, but she shines. In this film, she is visibly not fascinated and less beautiful. But then entertainment reporters should not outshine the people they cover, right? Verdict: Madhur has come up with another good movie that very well covers social issues. However, this film loses focus, and no one is sure what the director is trying to convey. <br /> <br /> Is he trying to show us the brilliance and glamor of rich people? or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and oppose his life to a REAL criminal reporter? Is he trying to tell us how the government and rich people run the press? or he is trying to illustrate problems with abuse of children and kind people. Other concepts put forward include an unwritten rule that young women should sleep with directors or colleagues if they want to go to Bollywood. <br /> <br /> In addition, he talks about how flight attendants get sick and tired. after a while their work resorts to extreme measures, marrying many elderly people, etc. He also speaks of unhappy women and spoiled children in rich families. <br /> <br /> It was all good for me .. but it may be too difficult for an ordinary viewer who just wants to relieve the stress of everyday work
