Imagine the plight of Richard, an artist whose real passion is to fly. When we first meet him, he is seen on top of a building in London, clad in the wings of his house. In the midst of despair, he tore his canvases and other works and created a flying device for his jump. When he gets into the police protection device, he doesn’t get a scratch, but that puts him in front of a judge who orders him to do community service. Richard, whose relationship with Ann apparently ended, decides to move to the countryside, where he finds a place in the country with a large barn, which he plans to use to build his own plane. <br /> <br /> In the end, Richard was trying to help Jane Harchard reluctantly. She is a young woman suffering from ALS. or Lou Gehrig's disease and confined to an electric wheelchair. Jane is extremely clever, but has a dark side and a salty vocabulary. Sometimes she uses a handheld device to talk, because her speech is not clear. What Jane likes to do is to lose her virginity at all costs. Jane and Richard clash as they meet, but mutual tolerance soon makes them comfortable with each other. <br /> <br /> Jane, who watches porn on her computer, has a concept for finding someone like Richard Gere in American Gigolo, who will have sex with her for a fee. When Richard takes her to London, they find the right man for the job. His fee is exorbitant, but they agree. Because they don’t have money, Richard decides to rob a big bank. In the end, Richard goes for a walk to Jane on his roughly built plane. e, to experience the thrill of her life, which brings them closer when they find intimacy to each other. <br /> <br /> Peter Greengrass sent this quaint idea to a movie that represents an unusual situation. mainstream films, and yet, she has such a sweet aura about her that it’s hard not to feel her and what she is trying to achieve. Mr. Greengrass demonstrates the intimacy of Richard Hawkins material he wrote for the film. The film does not try to be nice and does not give a joyful picture of a young woman suffering from an incurable disease. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter - the main reason for watching the movie. She makes a wonderful Jane. On the other hand, Kenneth Branagh doesn’t seem too suitable for this type of comedy. For some reason he has his own problems in the way he interprets Richard. Gemma Jones has good moments when Anne is Richard's former love. <br /> <br /> “Flight Theory” shows a good director. No doubt Peter Greengrass will go for more and better.
