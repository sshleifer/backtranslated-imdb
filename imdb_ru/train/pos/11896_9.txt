I came across a re-syndication of this show a few years ago and fell in love with it. It involves Tea Leoni and Holland Taylor, and it makes me laugh, one episode after another. I guess it did not make it big, and was canceled after several seasons, but I believe it was a good run, and would suggest watching it ... if the opportunity arises.
