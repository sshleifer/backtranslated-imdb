This is the best achievement of the period of social realism of Georg Wilhelm Pabst, based on the tragedy of early 1906, which killed almost 1,100 French miners when a coal dust explosion occurred in a coal mine in Curriere in northern France after a fire. three weeks, eventually releasing a deadly gas that led to the death of people. Magnificent designer Erno Metzner creates stunning scenery that mimics the tragedy, providing a perception of reality, complemented by unparalleled sound editing, the only music created by integral orchestras during the initial and final parts of the work, for which sound effects have the same value as the spectacular visual compositions of an outstanding director . Pabst’s “invisible editing” manner, which transmits action from shot to shot through player movements, is seamlessly integrated into this landmark film, which also demonstrates sublime cinematography using cameras installed on vehicles, which allows the director to move among scenes without the need for cutting. Although the main theme of the work is related to socialist dogma, the unforgettable power of this film lies in its details, generated by Pabst's unsurpassed mastery of interweaving numerous storylines in the tapestry of cinema, which is admired by the German rescue teams of which their Fatherland consists. very proud, no less desperate for catastrophic losses for families of French victims; of course, the seed triumph, just as stimulating cinema today, as it was during its first release.
