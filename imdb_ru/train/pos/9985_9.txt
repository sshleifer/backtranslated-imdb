I have seen this film in Winnipeg recently - pertinently, given the location used. I first read the book by Lawrence back in the 70s, and for me it was always a very convincing picture of the challenges of aging in our society. It resonated when I was young, and now it resonates even more. When the movie came out, I was wondering if the story could survive. and was deeply impressed, especially by the performance of Ellen Burstyn. She manages to give us a full-fledged human being, even though the character is usually capricious and judgmental - with someone you wouldn't want to live with. It's nice to see your favorite characters so sincerely come to life.
