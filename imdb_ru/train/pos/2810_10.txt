This documentary is incredibly thought-provoking, drawing you to the life of two longtime lovers who are in the final stages of AIDS. The last shots of their more than twenty years together really bring their last moments home. <br /> <br /> If this movie does not make you feel the pain and agony of these two charming people, you cannot have a heart.
