Elvira, Mistress of Darkness, funny comedy horror comedy in which the fourth wall is broken a couple of times, and jokes often remain below the navel. And Cassandra Peterson's chest becomes their own character. <br /> <br /> Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is a stewardess of the horror show, who learns that she inherited her aunt Morgana. Therefore, she goes to the small town of Fallwell, which is ruled by the most terrible monster that ever embraces the earth: morality and politeness. Elvira's breast appearance is, of course, too much for prunes, but the children of the city enjoy its different approach to life. And, of course, there is an even more sinister evil, her uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), who is after the spellbook of Elviraâ€™s mothers. You see, Elvira is actually a real witch, she just does not know it. For now. <br /> <br /> Elvira is a pretty funny movie, although the script leaves a lot of room for improvement. Most laughter comes from the difference between Elvira and people with good morals, but there are a couple of good visual jokes. The whole direction is all right, but it never becomes something big. In general, a good, purposely, comedy. If you like these things, then it is.
