Airwolf The Movie, a variation of the original two-part pilot, but the film, although shorter, contains extra frames not seen in the two-hour pilot. The pilot is much more pilot than the film, where the pilot film is usually the same (2 participants combined) But the film is actually different from the others, there is additional material here. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing, even if you have a season 1 DVD, I would still take a copy of “Cinema.” This is still in some stores, such as “Virgin,” “Woolworth,” and the like. multimedia stores, although order is usually required, but it eliminates the need to buy online (as many of us still do not do or trust purchases on the Internet), but if you look around the air wolves in stores <br /> <br /> Airwolf really was one of the most underrated shows of the 80s. <br /> <br /> At present, Airwolf is being redesigned for the Museum of Helicopters in full size:) The information and photographs in the development process are completed at http://Airwolf.org. Also with Airwolf mods for Flashpoint and Flight Sim games. Looks like she is finally staying again :)
