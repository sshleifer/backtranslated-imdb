This is at the top of my list of the most hysterically funny shows I've ever seen. I was laughing so hard, I'm sure I missed half the jokes. This demonstrates Izzard as the brilliantly gifted comedian he is. What I particularly like is that he never seems to be “dumbfounded” by the material for his audience. His time is immaculate, and the routine is related as part of the show, and not just a series of jokes. Thumbs up.
