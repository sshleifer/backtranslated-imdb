I went to see Ashur as the 2005 Fantasy Festival. Dude, that was a great blow. The director was supposed to be in Montreal for the Canadian premiere, but for health reasons he is still in Japan ... oh, I hope that he is recovering and acting in other films. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple, but somewhat original ... demons roam Edo in Japan, and swordsmen called "demon guardians" kill them and fear the revival of Ashura, the goddess of demons, who is asleep and supposedly very hysterical. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Izumo ... some elite swordsman named "Killer of demons" and his friend Jaku, a typical jealous cruel asshole ... <br /> <br /> Seems boring? Well, now it is getting thicker .... <br /> <br /> Izumo retired from killing demons because he killed a small child because of the “impression” that he was a demon, he never knew but he killed her. Therefore, Izumo continued his life and reworked himself in the Kabuki Theater. In a boat ride on a good night, Izumo notices a girl hiding on the bridge, and this changes his life and restarts to kill the demons ... for a good cause, because of love ... and, damn it, the guy knows how handle the sword and make spectacular killings. <br /> <br /> Izumo entertains the movie until the very end of the game ... he is a complete package ... he knows how to fight (damn, yes, he knows), he is witty, he is smart, and he has this sand. You never have to shout, "NO, AMAZING, THIS TRAP." The guy already knows this, he has such common sense. He is really the perfect hero. <br /> <br /> As regards cinematography, aesthetics is quite interesting. This is the movie that most resembles manga. It is full of special effects and nothing, by any means, this film will not look realistic ... it's pretty amazing. Many colors are an "unreal" photo, except for this ... it is rather straightforward ... but, as I said, the main character carries a film that he must see, a story made by his hands
