Across the country, and especially in the political environment, people with any political ambitions must find time to watch this film. The film is called City Hall, and with a little imagination its synopsis can take place anywhere in America. It just so happens that opens in New York. Here we have a story of a popular politician named Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino), experienced enough to manage a major metropolis without much effort. His right hand is none other than Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack), an equally bright man whose ambitions are connected with his mentor, and both seemed destined for a higher position. Everything points in this direction until police shooting ignites an investigation, led by Marybeth Kogan (Bridget Fonda), who believes that the fault points to the mayor's office and the mayor. The death of a six-year-old boy and a policeman is blaming a professional criminal whose dubious freedom leads to an obvious concealment of political payments and corruption in the city with trade union leaders such as Danny Aiello, played by Frank Anselmo, corrupt court officials such as Judge Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses, such as Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franzioza), who are deeply involved. Also involved are party officials, such as Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff), who works in the probation department in New York. But this is a random shooting between the mayor and his deputy. Great car for Cusack and confident contender for the title of a classic. ****
