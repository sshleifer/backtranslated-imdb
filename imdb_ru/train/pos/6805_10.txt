I like this movie. It was so well done! Great acting and drama and historically accurate play. I love Romy Schneider films. This one is swinging, not as big as a sissy, but still swinging! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolin, she commented and said French dubbing. Well, this is originally a German film, not a French one. So yes. Secondly, there was a plot, perhaps you are not familiar with the story. Oh, and her mother played the role of her governess, not her teacher. And the plot was not really Cinderella, but Queen Victoria, maybe you missed this detail. <br /> <br /> But in any case .... yes, the story in this film is great, I love historical films, and Queen Victoria is very exciting! I love all the historical stuff. Like the guy who tried to manipulate her mom. And when she ran away and met her future husband, he showed her the "new type of dance" waltz. When waltzing was new, it was considered scandalous, because couples are dancing so closely. Yes, her governess was like oh my god! <br /> <br /> And clothes, I love clothes. The styles are great, the hoop skirts are awesome. And, of course, Romy always looks very beautiful.
