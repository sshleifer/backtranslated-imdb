“Show Marriage” is good. Perhaps not on the same level as Aqua Teen Hunger or Cosmic Ghost Coast, but he definitely has a lot of brilliant moments. Basically it follows the life of Zorak and Marriage, who live a normal life and go to school, living next door in the style of 50 'comedies. The humor and animation of this show are very similar to "Aqua Teen Hunger" (and in one episode you could see Meatwad) with bizarre situations and strange characters. But this is good, he has funny parts. Some songs are wonderful, others are not very good, but I like this show. The funniest character is Father Marriage. (this is a man, no one knows why)
