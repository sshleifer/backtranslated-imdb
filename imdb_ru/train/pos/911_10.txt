VIVAH, in my opinion, is the best film of 2006 from a director who has achieved success throughout his career. These days I am not too keen on romantic films, because I consider them “old wine in a new bottle” and so predictable. However, I have watched this movie three times already ... and believe me, this is a terrific movie. <br /> <br /> VIVAH returns to the traditional route, displaying simple characters in a meaningful and realistic travel story between engagement and marriage. The film is entertaining in all respects, as it can reflect what we are doing (or will be doing) when it comes to marriage. In this sense, Sooraj R. Barjatya performed his homework well and portrayed a very realistic story in a well-made very interesting film. <br /> <br /> Several episodes in this film will immediately interest you: <br /> <br /> * When Shahid Kapoor comes to visit his bride (Amrita Rao) - how he tries to look at her without doing it too obvious in front of him and her family. The song “Do Anjaane Ajnabi” blends well with the mood of this scene. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita, when he comes to her, that is, a shy shahid, not knowing exactly what to talk about delaying a decent conversation. Also the naïve character of Amrita, limited eye contact, shyness and a gentle answer to Shahid questions. <br /> <br /> * Emotional disorder of Amrita and her uncle (Aloka Nath) when she feeds him at Shahid's party in the form of another daughter-in-law, and not her uncle's favorite niece. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the film is entirely owned by Amrita Rao. The actress portrays the role of Poonam with such conviction that you can't imagine someone else replacing her. She looks great throughout the film and beautifully portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl. <br /> <br /> Shahid Kapoor is also brilliant. He presents a promising performance and shows that he is no less than Salman Khan when it comes to filming the Suraj R. Baryat film. In fact, Shahid and Amrita make up a cute couple on the screen, without a shadow of a doubt. Other characters are Alok Nath (excellent), Anupam Kher (great), Mohan Joshi (very good). <br /> <br /> In general, VIVAH offers what it promised, a well thought out and realistic story of two families. The film has first-class performances, an excellent story and excellent music suitable for the film, as well as the director of the fabulous Suraj R. Baryatya. This is a must see!
