First, it is IMPOSSIBLE that the remake could be as good because Japanese society is very different from ours and plays such an important role in this film as explained in the introductory narrative. It adds humor and warmth to this movie. There are many different supporting characters / personalities. Everyone involved in making this film is wonderful. This film is full of comedy, which in any case is not as vulgar as most of today's "comedies." And yet it can make you laugh out loud. The reality is that in real life you have no choice with whom to work or go to school ... etc. This film really underlines this and shows that the natural good of people can overcome small differences. Not to mention the fact that this is a great plot and most of the humor. This is a story about dance, which really has a story, and a good one. There are several past stories that are not inappropriate, but actually support the main storyline. A really well-written movie. Dancing is great too. I was a fan of any movie with dancing of any kind, for this aspect. However, this film goes beyond any other with dance, in the sense that this is the first story and is simply written about dancing in Japanese society. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
