LOL !!! The nonsense was so funny .. I was in tears. Impressions Eddie Murphise absolutely accurate. The best impression was of James Brown and Mr. T> SO FUNNY !! It’s strange how Eddie Murphy was then and how he is WELCOME now, you need to see it, but if you don’t like obscene language, don’t look, BUT AMAZING AND SO FUNNY ... I saw it 6/7 times and still urinate times .. This is Eddie Murphy in his prime, and you can see where his humor comes from and ideas from films like a psychotic professor. He also makes impressions about his family, which is very funny. <br /> <br /> If I were only there ...
