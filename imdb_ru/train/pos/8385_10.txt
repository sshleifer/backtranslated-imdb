This film seems to get bad criticism for some reason. Probably just a massive population. In any case, this is actually a very interesting film. This film is a budget science fiction film that really works thanks to an interesting storyline and well-made scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be for everyone, though. If there are science fiction fans reading this, I really recommend this film if you like good science fiction. There are crazy ideas in the movie. The settlement includes countries entering the war with gigantic machines, in which whole countries invest all their money! The world was divided into territories. Anyone can challenge anyone else to the war, or rather, “robot duel”. The method of warfare is purer than nuclear war, because now everyone is wearing these masks for breathing. Definitely a movie that makes you think. Intelligent, well written and good effects for a miserable budget. <br /> <br /> I like low budget movies that really work.
