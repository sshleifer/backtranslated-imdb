Winchester, 73, is a great story, and that's what I like about her. This is not your everyday western — it uses a rifle that transfers hands from different characters — as a mechanism for telling stories about these people. Rock Hudson plays the Indian leader, Jimmy Stewart plays a great leader with heart and strength, and Shelley Winters plays a girl who must cope with the realities of her husband and the wild west. It is important to note that for those politically correct types they kill a lot of Hindus in this film without remorse. By today's standards it is still pretty cruel. But this is a great story and worth seeing. Enjoy!
