I saw this movie some time ago, and it is still at the top of my list of favorite movies. It is surprisingly complex, and what the film really does is detailed fragments (for example, the Cafe Bustelo coffee box, which is used as a cup for washing grandchildren's hair), which people don't see because YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE IF YOU DO NOT PLAY. This is just one of those films that are very specific and culturally specific. Please do not advertise this film if you do not have prior knowledge of what foundation it is built on. I fully understand what the writer / director was striving for, and he perfectly hit the target! This film deserves a better rating.
