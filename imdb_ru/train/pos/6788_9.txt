The story and characters were some of the best I've ever seen. the graphics were good for PS, and the scenes and voice frames were amazing. I beat the game at least 3 times and loved every second. I felt that the problems the protagonist faced were believable and realistic, and I think it deserves to be continued. or at least a remake. If they remade it for PS3, I would buy the system only for this game, and maybe MGS4, this is amazing, and the idea and performance of the Dragoon system is enough to guarantee rolling and, to top it all, inventive, although sometimes it tricks the wand) The combat system of addition and plot makes this game a definite purchase.
