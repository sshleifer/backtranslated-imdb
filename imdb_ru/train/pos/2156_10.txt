This film is one of my favorite foreign films, some of them are Amili and My Life Like a Dog. The similarity with these films, as with many great foreign films, is that it takes the worldly part of life and turns it into a deep heart lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a man who is tired of his worldly life and the routine of his family life, sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio. The moment his train passes by, he is fascinated by her. But is it only her beauty, her distant look, or the connection that they both discover, they share? <br /> <br /> Shall We Dance has unforgettable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities, overcoming them through the world of dance. Breaking the traditional forms and stereotypes of Japanese society, they risk everything for the sake of happiness and discover that joy is not so far away. This is one of those films that are so magical and significant and in themselves go beyond the mundane, showing the true magic and wonder that life can be.
