Embarrassing, I just watched this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. This is a story that can relate to any father or brother ... one brother is a bit “wild”, the other brother is a typical older child. Craig Schaeffer is a little devoid of emotion, like a big brother, but Pitt is great, and Skerritt played the role of father perfectly. The fishing scenes shot in Montana are simply amazing ... I had no idea that fly fishing can be so attractive. The film is closely following the book, with a few changes, to make it more suitable for the format of the film. Unlike most stories from books in the movies, this one is appropriate in size. This is the perfect movie for those who want a good night with a powerful and somewhat emotional film.
