This film is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I was “fascinated,” I must say, and am surprised at how uniquely this was done. Cast, sequence, effects ... everything! Great! I mean, it was a love story, but what set her apart from the rest was that she was told in a fascinating, helpful manner. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a representation of a modern fairy tale. , It's like a modern Peter Pan ... simply amazing. <br /> <br /> I would surely buy this copy as soon as it appears on the market. <br /> <br /> This film is really double, MUST SEE one ... !!!! 10 stars for that!
