Once I was living with a roommate who was trying to commit suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could get a noise disturbance of fifty dollars for sneezing after midnight - so, of course, I can easily attribute him to Polanski's Lessee . <br /> <br /> But I also like the film for other reasons. I'm not sure that this works, in general - the Polanski character’s immersion into paranoia and insanity, which takes the last half hour or so, seems rather abrupt and strange. Ebert, for example, was absolutely not convinced, and he hit a movie with a vicious review of one star. But I think that the individual scenes and moments work fine, so although I don’t quite understand the whole film - like, for example, Egyptology? - I still have a general positive impression. <br /> <br /> I like, for example, the nasty friend Bernard Fresson portrays. God, how many times have I agreed to have such stupid friends, not friends at all! I love the scene in the cinema - I would say the funniest moment in the history of the film. And, man, if I love Isabelle Ajani — she’s so cunning in this film, it’s almost unbelievable. And she, as always, plays well. <br /> <br /> Polanski is also a good actor; I do not agree with the occasional dismissive remarks about his speech here. His character must be discreet and thoughtful, so his discreet game is suitable. For example, I found him completely sympathetic - although he lost me a little when he began to dress in drag without any obvious reason. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is unclear. And slowly. But it reflects the alienated quality of life in an apartment — something I did too much — so I’m digging it. It's funny that all you need is a common landmark, and suddenly such a strange film becomes so significant! Definitely worth raising for a pocket change on a DVD.
