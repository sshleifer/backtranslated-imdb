I was a kid .. crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dances ... He was and remains the greatest of all times. A few days ago a friend gave me a gift .. DVD "Moonwalker" .. I just could not believe it! So I took the time to watch the film again ... Many years later, he threw me back in time. I almost cried. Not because of Michael Jackson, but from the good old days that I remembered in the past, when I went to his concerts, enjoying music and dancing. The film gave me a different perspective than when I was a kid. You really can see a parody of the fact that Michael has passed all his life. Thank you, Michael Jackson, to bring me back to those wonderful times, to Your magnificent music and dances. It is a pity that people have forgotten you ... I did not do this, because you gave me great moments with your music ... All the best to you, wherever you are ...
