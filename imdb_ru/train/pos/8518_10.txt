I stumbled upon this film at a local video store during their annual sidewalk sale. Looking through thousands of videos in the hope of finding a few cartoons for sale, I came across this movie. I read the back of the film and knew that it was God's hand for me to buy this film. You see, I have a native group of three adopted (and soon will be adopted) children living with my family. Immediately my foster children contacted three children who were filmed in the film. The film helped them better understand their own circumstances. For the first time also, the eldest of the group of brothers and sisters (7 years / woman) decided to tell me a little about her past and the trauma she had experienced. She struggled with the whole problem of trust. This is also the first time I have seen her cry. After watching the movie, I asked her what it means to adopt a child. She replied: "It means to be happy." It is necessary to monitor families that raise children and are considering adoption. This, of course, opened lines of communication with us.
