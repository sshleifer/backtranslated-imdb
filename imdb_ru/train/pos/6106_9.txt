When it comes to the erotic genre, I was lucky to go through the first 20 minutes of the plot, without getting up and not looking for something else to watch. This film is different. Julie Davis (“I Love You, Don't Touch Me”) shot two very strong main actors - Cyrus Reed and Doug Jeffrey in this exciting thriller. Kira is convincing, like “Kim”, a dear innocent romantic romanticist who has fallen into the web of seducing beautiful stranger Doug Jeffrey. and A, depth and believability. I think this is her best performance. And the direction of Julie Davis is a great erotica gift.
