Along with the Darkwing Ducks this is unfairly reversed. Since Tarzan's time, Disney has been in decline, and we need a similar show to get Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo (sounds familiar?). The melody of the theme is also catchy. Of all the villains who are all great in their merits, Tony Jay stands out as Sher Kahn. Louis and Balu actually sound very much like a voice-over in the Jungle Book, which is not bad at all. In fact, it is very inspiring! The animation was in place, and the script had a lot of wit, which for many years was not enough for animation. Please bring this show back! 9/10. Bethany Cox
