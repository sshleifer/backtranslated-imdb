This film is a great way to finally complete the series. Peter (the boy from Puppet Master III) has grown up and is now Puppet Master. Well, this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn the secrets of Toulon, but instead she listens to the story of the puppets. Most of this movie is footage from Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, Curse of the Puppet Master and Retro Puppet Master (sorry ... But I think Paramount wouldn't let them use scenes from ). Personally, I wish Puppet Master Vs. “Demonic toys” will finally be created, but at the end of the film they say: “This is the last film in the series ...”
