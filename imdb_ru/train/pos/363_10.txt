This film is about development. People grow, people disappear, people are surprised, and people are disappointed. It has everything and even more. There is hope, disappointment, injustice, justice, love and hate. This is really a classic drama, in which there are fantastic performances of the entire cast, but especially Whoopi Goldberg in her debut role. <br /> <br /> This film made me feel very human and proud of it, and I propose that this film be compulsory every Saturday in all the prisons of the world - this concerns your compassion. Rating: 10 out of 10. PS: I recognize it: I shed a tear of joy during the final scene.
