I was forced to see this because a) I have an 11-year-old girl and b) we showed her the Bonita Granville Nacie Drew films of the 1930s, which she liked a lot. Personally, I did not think it was as funny as in the films of the 1930s, but on the other hand, it was not a nauseous offensive fluff, which I was afraid of. It was a harmless, slightly interesting film. Although I am glad that they did not try to “modernize” Nancy to the “fashionableness” of the 21st century (Veronica Mars is called “Modern Nancy Drew”), I think they made her a little too soft that they didn’t do enough to develop Nancy Drew - the movie could be called “Jane Doe, a girl detective”. I have to blame the script: I think that every actor did a good job with what they had to work with. I liked Emma Roberts in this role, but they gave her a script for a television series, not for a theatrical performance ...
