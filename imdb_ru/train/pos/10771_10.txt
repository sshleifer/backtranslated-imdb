All stars, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi, etc. were shot in this film. The trouble everyone faces when lying to protect themselves is great, and I highly recommend you watch this movie, it's worth it! John Candy is in great shape, like everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a great family movie, this is your ticket. All give star performances, great acting, great comedy and a great time, which is rarely seen in movies these days. A great plot, a great mystery, (which I love anyway) and in general, is worth the money you spend on it. So take the kids, take the popcorn, juice, tea or soda and enjoy the show !!!!
