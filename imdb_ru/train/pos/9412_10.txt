When I saw this film in the 1950s, I also wanted to be a scientist. There was something magical and useful in science. I took a girlfriend to see him a second time. I don't think she was as impressed as I am! This film was comical, but serious, at a time when synthetic fibers were quite new. The lessons from this film can be applied to the problems associated with GM experiments today.
