I thought Mr. Dreyfus was perfect for his role as an actor and dictator. His colleague in the film, Mr. Julia, played his role equally flawlessly. It was interesting to see Richard Dreyfuss reluctantly replace the dictator against his will. But over time, he became more confident and pleased with this role. Because in life everything happens for some reason, I believe that he was forced to change the dictator, because he had to stay there for more than a year, and so did he. I guess he stayed because he had to see how good his life was compared to the poverty he witnessed in Parador. I think that he took too much for granted in life, and he needed to get a serious reality check, staying in this country for as long as he did. <br /> <br /> But ......... ... anyway ........... that is why I gave this film 7 out of 10.
