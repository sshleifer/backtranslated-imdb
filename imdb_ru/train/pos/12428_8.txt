I like this movie. Unlike some of the pumped up steroid garbage, which was given out for action films, “The Game of God” is simple and realistic, with believable characters, an action that is not too good, and enough turns and turns to maintain interest until the end. <br /> <br /> A good director, a good story acted well.
