Directed by action movies, horror, science fiction, Fred Olen Ray shows that he has the talent of the director. Character actor William Smith is one of the best tough / bad guys in the industry. He belongs to the viewer with the best acting performance in his career. As for Randy Travis, he makes the best impression from Lee Van Cleef. He is not bad in the film. Smith and Travis make the film. As for the rest of the cast, none of them really stand out. Ray did an excellent job of directing this film, Smith and Travis were good, I would give this B western on a scale of one to ten (ten is the best), seven.
