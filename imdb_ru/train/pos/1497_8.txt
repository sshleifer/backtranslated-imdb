This film is a rather interesting anthology of horror film (in the spirit of stories from a crypt), written by Robert Bloch (author of the book Psycho). This is good fun for horror lovers, and he has a great cast. The film should also be watched for Doctor Who fans, as John Pertwee (the third Doctor) plays a funny role as a rough and nasty horror star!
