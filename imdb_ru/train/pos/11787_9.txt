This is a short film by David Lynch, just 8 minutes, but it has all the “Lynch ingredients”! It is mysterious, dark, inconclusive, creepy and strange; and before the blonde starts talking, it's even a bit scary! The soundtrack is exceptional to create this strange atmosphere, because it is also sinister and mysterious ?? <br /> <br /> As for the decor, it does not have “traditional” red curtains, but the walls are painted purple, which gives it the same eerie effect. a story about a girl who is locked in a dark room, and she asks for help; then comes another girl who starts to talk to her in a mysterious way, saying that she is there only through her fault ?? We do not know what happened or what will happen next? it ended up unsolved and puzzling, because a good lynch movie must end! <br /> <br /> This is great, despite some amateur game. The girls are professional actresses, but I think their game could be better in this short film.
