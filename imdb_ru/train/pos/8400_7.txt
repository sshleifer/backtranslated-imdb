I took this film in my local library. When I got acquainted with the director at the film festival at the end of last year, I was curious to “check” his work. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The film takes a fresh look at familiar topics, love, infidelity, friendship, jealousy. Sometimes it can be a little talkative, but not enough to completely immerse the film. I liked to watch a love story with characters that are obviously connected to each other, and to watch how they make conscious decisions, and not accidentally “fall” into something as important as love. <br /> <br /> The contrast between this movie and the average low-budget. Shoot the black movie quite clearly. Check this. If you're lucky, your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack, like mine. A good thing!
