Hidden Frontier is known as the longest running Star Trek fan on the Internet. While the quality of the production does not match the quality of the fans, such as Starship Exeter or New Voyages, Hidden Frontier mainly concentrates on the plot, and in this respect it is really very good. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier has no physical sets; instead, the actors are shot on a green screen, and the backgrounds are inserted in digital form. One of the greatest achievements of Hidden Frontier is the huge amount of work they have done. One way to achieve this is to insert virtual sets during the shoot, rather than in post-production. Although it saves a lot of time, it is also worth noting that the quality of the resulting material is not as high as if it was produced in post-production, although it still serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> Although Hidden Frontier may not be a cup of tea for everyone, it’s worth a try, although it’s best to start by watching the third season, as this is where producers really start to beat the pitch.
