I did not expect this film to be liked as much as before. I got it simply because I saw it on the list of the 25 most controversial films of all time. It did not look particularly cool. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the most cleverly composed films of recent memory. <br /> <br /> This is about a twenty-year-old woman who wants to know everything. She keeps every piece of information she collects in a huge archive. She is experimenting with experiences in sex, political activism and human relationships. Meanwhile, the film crew is filmed in the film, and we see their reaction to the story and each other. Nude, outspoken sex and controversial policies prevented the film from being shown in the United States, while its seizure was appealed by Customs. The film is a narration, but it is a documentary film that shows us the backstage world of filmmakers during the narration, when the fourth wall is destroyed. This film is the most direct possible way to make a film I have ever seen. The film primarily works as a temporary capsule of the psychedelic events of the 1960s, the struggle for freedom and sexual liberation. I like to think of it as something more. <br /> <br /> I didnâ€™t think I would spend my time on the blue version of this film, but in fact I really think so. This film is a buried treasure. Try it.
