As a child, I preferred the first film “Little Bear”, since this one seemed so gloomy. I always sat down and watched first. When I got older, I learned to prefer this one. I think this film is too dark for babies, but when you get older, you learn to appreciate it, because you understand it more, it doesn't seem as dark as it was in childhood. <Br /> <br /> This film, in my opinion, is better than the first, everything is much deeper. This may contradict the first movie, but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one. Cubs are just amazing, I rewind the scene "Flying my flowers." I tend to annoy everyone with singing. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is great! The big hand of Carol and Dean Parks. I love every song in this film, I downloaded them all and everything that I listen to, I listen to “Our beginning”, also known as “Remembering” at the moment. I have always preferred this soundtrack to the first, although I just really like the song Carol Kings in the first film “Care a lot”. <br /> <br /> I think the animation is great, the animation in both films is fantastic. I was surprised when I sat down and looked at it about 10 years later and saw that the animation for this time was excellent. It was really amazing. <br /> <br /> There are not many words from other people to say that this film is excellent, but it is. I do not think it is strange / weird. I think this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> In essence, this film is about how the Caring Bears appeared and defeated the Demon, Dark Heart. The end is amazing and again surpasses any “pokemon film” with the moral issues of Care Bears. It leaves an effect on you. Again, this film can teach everyone at any age morality.
