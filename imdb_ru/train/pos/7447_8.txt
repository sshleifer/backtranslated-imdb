The film may be a bit far, but if you like the show, this is what you expect. This is not a bad movie; it is actually very good. If you do not like the show, do not watch the movie. It may start a little slowly, but then it starts to rise and turns out to be quite funny. There are even a few "heartbreaking" scenes at the end. After all the main characters have gone through these scenes, I’ll really get to you. Jerry also expresses his opinion on why his show upsets people and justifies its existence. He has a pretty good point. We really care about the personal details of celebrity life, so why is it wrong that these people talk about their personal lives and on national television? If they were celebrities, we would not mind at all, we would have eaten it. Do we not like that his guest does this only because he is poor white trash, and this reminds us that in this world there is really poverty, and not just rich glamorous movie stars living in the world of “Leave it to Beaver”?
