A film recently shown on cable television begins with a declaration of non-participation in the real life of people; this in itself is striking. Yet the script and actions from the main characters are excellent, and I find myself absorbed everywhere. To a large extent to the fresh, thoughtful and interesting dialogue. The film is about a meeting for one day between two real musical "legends" that were previously composed together then separated. The film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies, in a story that offers an explanation of their original "split." What is so impressive is that the actors give such seemingly realistic images of the characters they play, flaws and everything else, that this viewer at least has remained to believe that I witnessed a real event in almost all the details. The great skill of this play lies in the fact that with insightful writing and an excellent play of the film, mainly about talking to the “two of us”, you can get an excellent picture. Worthy of at least 8 out of 10.
