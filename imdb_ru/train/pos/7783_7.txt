A young girl who survived as a prostitute. <br /> <br /> A cheap hustler who wants to get a big mark. <br /> <br /> They are found in Thailand. You might think that in the first headlines it will be a movie about violence, but it is also a love story with two people in their own struggle to get money for a better lifestyle. This film is sometimes reminiscent of an essay because of the change of images, but still refreshing. This story is also about Eros and Thanatos. “This is not an original joke, but it is well narrated,” the character says, and this also applies to this: we saw the story, but as we see it. Thailand appears in hot tones, the photo goes from one color to a colorful place. And he captures the city like a cage of this imperfect person. There is also a good use of music to dot the action.
