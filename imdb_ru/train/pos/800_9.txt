I could not be more excited; In 1983, I was only eight years old, and I was going to watch the movie "Star Wars" in the theater! The best day of my life was to come. By that time, my only experience with Star Wars was a few HBO shows of Star Wars. I have not even seen how "The Empire Strikes Back." <br /> <br /> And boy, that day helped me with less critical looks. Jubb Large rebel spaceships. The Emperor Green lightsaber! Blimey! From that magical day I had to watch this movie hundreds of times. I can not even form an accurate assessment at the moment. With these numerous views, I certainly noticed that this film - REAL Episode III - has its drawbacks. <br /> <br /> Of course, in the context of the Star Wars film, these “flaws” are more like Fads. <br /> <br /> Millions had magical days in 1977 and 1980. In May 1983, I had my day. And that was my Star Wars movie.
