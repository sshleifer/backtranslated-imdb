The endless boundaries of our inhumanity towards ourselves can never stun me. This truly amazing story of a terribly offended and largely unheard of population is convincing, well documented and infuriating. As an American, I am constantly humiliated by the behavior of my country, and this is another example from our long catalog of international humiliations. We suck. Probably, this is the first documentary film by John Pilger that I saw, but he immediately made me want to see what else he did. My only complaint, and the reason why I gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that Pilger shows us this parody and the terrifying cooperation of the US and UK governments, requires that we, the audience / citizens, be involved in our own inaction ... but does not offer how to help. I do not know about Britain, but America has made it almost impossible for citizens to participate in the affairs of their government. A gesture in the right direction can help the cause of these islanders.
