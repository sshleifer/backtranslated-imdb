James Stewart and Margaret Sallavan play colleagues in a Budapest gift shop who don’t really love each other, not knowing that they are really cute pen-pal friends who have yet to meet. <br /> <br /> A very charming romantic comedy, played by two cute stars and a very loving performing cast. The story is well written, and there is that romantic innocence in the film (I don’t know how to explain it), which is simply not in films today. This can obviously be compared with the recent “You Received Mail”, and the original wins in all respects. <br /> <br /> This is a must-see for every Christmas, I can’t think of a better way to launch Christmas. feel than this little gem.
