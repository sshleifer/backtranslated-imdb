This film - exactly what is described in its title - an attempt to get you to buy what the writers offer. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is rather curious to see Toronto in the 1996 style, which I remember with all my silly hairstyles, sunglasses, clothes and attitude. It really hasn't changed; just a pleasant, safe, cheap, provincial little town that is an excellent meeting point for international films! It's also fun to see Kenny and Spenney go to Los Angeles and find out that this is again Toronto, only with a strange assortment of beach bums, musicians, fortune-tellers and even more arrogant films. <br /> <br /> I don’t see Pitch as a film to enjoy; This is not entertainment, if the viewer does not like to watch someone's aspirations trampled. I see Pitch as a warning that power and money really belong to studio managers and producers. Potential (and “successful”) writers, musicians, and actors are still merely transient, even when they reach the Big Time. <br /> <br /> So Kenny and Spenney are trying to sell you a warning. Buy it or not, the message is still there.
