Although the title “Before the devil discovers you're dead” comes from an Irish proverb, the film sounds like a Greek tragedy. It all starts with an unsuccessful robbery and continues to spiral out of control when the two brothers try to avoid the mess they fell into. <br /> <br /> The cast is well assembled with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Itan Hawke playing the aforementioned brothers. Marked support includes Albert Finney as their father and Marisa Tomei as the wife of one brother and the lover of another. In addition to these principles, the game is nothing remarkable. <br /> <br /> The story is convincing and told with a certain degree of enthusiasm. The narrative structure makes things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent temporary shifts. At the same time, the unpredictability of the film is somewhat muffled, as it becomes early that the story is a tragedy through and through. In general, quite an impressive debut for the first screenwriter Kelly Masterson. <br /> <br /> Sydney Lumet does a good job, but I’m more impressed with the fact that he is still a director over the age of eighty. Carter Berwell’s account made less of an impression on me, but it doesn’t distract. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film turns out to be attractive, and the plot and presentation may have superficial similarities with others. Films this remains a unique experience.
