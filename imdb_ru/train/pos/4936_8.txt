When a plague of pneumonia occurs (a kind of bubonic plague), the official US health service representative, Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark), immediately quarantines everyone he knows near the body. Unfortunately, cruel people got such an opportunity, being killed, and there is a high probability that the killer will begin to spread the plague, leading to an epidemic. Enter police captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who is called upon to track down the killer as soon as possible and prevent a possible national catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Although the film “Panic on the Streets” is a quality film, it suffers from being a little out of focus and too stretched (my reason to lower the score to eight). He wanders in genres from Noar gangster to medical catastrophe, procedural actions of the police, thrillers, and even romance. <br /> <br /> This is not the best work of director Elia Kazan, but to say that it is a bit insincere. Kazan is a helmer responsible for such masterpieces as The Tram Called Desire (1951), On the Embankment (1954) and East of Eden (1955). This film precedes this, but Kazan said that it is already “untied” by the studio. Too far-reaching freedom can partly explain growth. The film takes place in New Orleans, a city where Kazan "wandered ... day and night, so I knew this well." He wanted to exploit the environment. “It's so amazing and colorful. I wanted boats, steam engines, warehouses, jazz connections — all in New Orleans. ” <br /> <br /> Kazan copes well with every genre of “Panic on the streets”, but they can be linked better. The film would benefit by remaining with only one or two of its moods. Spread in terms of customization would still work. Part of this dilemma could have been caused by the fact that “Panic in the Streets” was an attempt to combine the two stories of writers Edna and Edward Anhalt: “Quarantine” and “Someone Like Em Cold”. <br /> <br /> Gangster material, which ends on a thriller with an extended chase scene at the end of the film, is probably the highlight. Not surprisingly, Kazan said that he believes that the villains “are more colorful - I have never experienced any special affection for good guys. I don't like puritans. ” Cramped second is the only material that comes up to the name's “panic” - the detection of the plague and attempts to track down the infected, inculcate them and contain the disease. Despite the fact that during these two “moods” a lot of indecision arises, much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama with a more characteristic rhythmic movement for this genre. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is generally excellent. The stylistic difference with many modern films can hardly be more pronounced. He is intelligent, delivered quickly and well laid out by each character. Conflict is created not by “silly” decisions, but by clever actions; The events and actions of the characters are more like chess. When unusual positions are taken, such as Reed, who hides the plague from the newspapers, he gives relatively long justifications for his decisions, about which other characters argue. <br /> <br /> In light of this, it is interesting that Kazan believed that “Decency, religion, ethics and the middle class are killing us.” This idea penetrates the film through changes or deviations from the norm made by the protagonists. For example, the main gangster Blackie (Jack Palance in his first movie role) is offered the card "Get out of prison for free" if he will cooperate in the fight against the plague. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are all right, if not the exception, but the real reasons to watch are speeches, an intriguing script and a well-written dialogue.
