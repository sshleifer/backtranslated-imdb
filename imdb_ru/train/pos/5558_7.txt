This story is well known in the long cartoons about Tom and Jerry, especially in the 1940s, with the only difference that two cats instead of one threaten to be evicted if they do not catch the mouse (Jerry). Tom has an unnamed buddy in the house (“Butch?”), So this is very frustrating “Mommy's two shoes”, who cannot believe that they have a mouse, despite TWO cats in the house. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the one who catches Jerry can stay while the other gets the shoe, so the competition continues! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this is a familiar territory, I still enjoyed it, because the cartoon had enough original sights to make it entertaining. You not only competed with each other, but with Jerry in the equation, so there were enough good jokes to definitely recommend if you are a fan of Tom and Jerry.
