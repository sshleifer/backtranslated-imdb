This is one of my favorite sports films. Dennis Quaid is moving and convincing in the role of a man who abandoned his dream of becoming a pitcher for baseball when his hand fell on him. As a high school coach, he challenges his players to win the division championship, telling them that he will try for the baseball team if they do. They win (partly because of the whole practice of batting they carry out with a trainer who can travel more than 90 miles per hour), and he performs his part of the deal - and he is signed! <br /> <br /> If you ever decide to try something new and scary as an adult, the story of Jim Morris will find you have a response. It moves and inspires, and the relationship of a man seems to be true. <br /> <br /> However, inspiration is not the only reason why I shoot this. Dennis Quaid is just a purebred man, and a baseball movie with a handsome man changing a diaper is my idea of ​​paradise. Ladies, if you feel like me, check it out.
