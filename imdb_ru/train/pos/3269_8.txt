CHANSY is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman (Cybill Shepard), whose husband (Christopher MacDonald) is killed shortly after he learns that she is pregnant. Then we see how a husband in heaven lets the forces know that he was taken too early and that his wife needs him. He is told that he can return to earth, but not like himself. In anticipation of 19 years, we see how Shepard’s daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson) prepares to finish college and meets a young man (Robert Downey Jr.), who, it turns out, is her father’s reincarnation. The film is a little on the predictable side ... the story unfolds in all the places that you expect, but it is so energetically played by an energetic cast (especially Shepard and Downey) that you can't help but be passionate about the fun. The shepherd is rarely seen on the screen to gain a greater advantage, and she and Downey are supported by a talented group of characters in support roles. A beautiful and charming fantasy that will absorb and charm you.
