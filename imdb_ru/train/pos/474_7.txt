Without reading Nabokov and knowing nothing about chess, I could only watch “The Protection of Luzhin” as a film. <br /> <br /> It works very well, as one of my favorite genres of "sports romance". Chess comes to life as a tough competition, much more than, say, “Finding Bobby Fisher,” showing how hard a mental work can be a game that requires thinking, preparation, endurance and planning. I especially liked the special effects on the chessboard, as alternative games are expected. <br /> <br /> Through feminist director Maureen Gorris (from Antonia) Emily Watson with her big blue eyes is gradually strengthened thanks to her transformative relationship. with the rather scattered and energetic genius of John Turturro in one note. <br /> <br /> The settings in Italy and Hungary are beautiful. <br /> <br /> (originally written 05/27/2001)
