Actually, Goldie Hawn from Washington (Tacoma Park, Maryland), but I got distracted. This kind of Mr. Smith goes to a movie like Washington, with some variations, but the same premise. I filmed this movie from cable television several years ago because I was very in love with Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but hardly any cocktail waitress gets an important job in the government just because she saved a life. It made me laugh and at the same time made me angry. It made me laugh, because some of the situations in which she found herself were so ridiculous that I had to laugh. (POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD). I was infuriated that our government would set up an ordinary citizen in the way she arranged. And the speech she gave at the end ... is beautiful. It is unfortunate that not many people in real life have such courage.
