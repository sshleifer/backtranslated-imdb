The film shook me. Personally, I had a herd of mostly bad buzz. Well, finally, after I owned the DVD for a few months, I put it on a sleepless night. although the film did draw additional shots, it was used for the purpose of the seriousness of his passion, and his recovery after adding to the game would be less realistic if they missed any scenes. The best thing about the movie is relationship matching. There were no pop-ups or characters threatening the relationship. I mean, we usually see a girl meet a boy for some amazing twist of fate, they meet, something that we see, upsets them, and then they come back together in the last five minutes of the movie. but this film did not follow this pattern. We really experienced relationships and their shortcomings, and although the characters had moments of anti-love, they had no dramatic pauses when they left and made the montage every 15, and then united again in love. I did not feel that the film was as predictable as the other romantic films. The story was unique and true to reality, as I felt that these people in the film were the most believable of everything that I saw in the romantic film of modern times. And it didn't hurt that all the baseball games were real on the real world series, so fate was kicking a little there too. This is not “My Fair Lady”, but it is an energetic and honest film. I'll just say that I like it.
