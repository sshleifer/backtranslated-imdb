This film is very funny. The actors really make the film go away. Without giving away the plot, I would describe it as a new favorite of the princess-bride cult, which must stand the test of time. In this film you will see a completely different side of Robert De Niro! (The value of the entrance ticket is just for that!) All the elements are present here, from adventure to romance, and well-located comedy. <br /> <br /> People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents even did!) Good special effects can be scary for the little ones. Good date movie. Great for some escape. <br /> <br /> Deserves A. (I hope this is good at the checkout)
