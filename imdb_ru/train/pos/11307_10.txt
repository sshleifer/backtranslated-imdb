To get acquainted with the beauty of this film, pay special attention to the sound track, not only to the music, but also to how all sounds help to weave images. How beautifully the opening scene leading to the exile of Gino sets the theme of moral uncertainty! Pay attention to how the music represents the characters when we are married to Giovanna. Do not expect that you will find here a lot about the political life of Italy in 1943. That's not the point. On the other hand, if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds, you will fall into a word that goes beyond neorealism. By the end of the film, we have moments similar to Antonioni, a landscape that is more connected with the inner life of the characters than with real places. This is one of my favorite Visconti movies.
