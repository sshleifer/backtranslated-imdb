I saw this film in a London cinema in 1975 and have not seen since. I found it funny. I loved this originality. Rarely, when someone makes such a film - and this is also sad. <br /> <br /> I mean that once I read a book called “The Black Hotel” - and as a fan of films, I always ”picture books like movies. Something like "adapt" them, you know? But when I read it, I thought that this would make an excellent film - but, of course, it would have to be “adapted” - to such an extent that it would have little to do with the book. <br /> <br /> But then I thought, well, WHY? Of course, it could never be shown on Sundays on TV, but on condition that it was shown in cinemas for ADULTS who knew what it contained, where HARMFUL? Gosh, my civil liberties were crushed here. The director MUST be able to make a literal film version of the Black Hotel. <br /> <br /> In an ideal world, censorship of films for adults should not exist. But, unfortunately, although I agree that with REASONABLE adults, such freedom can be harmless, there are always those who do not have enough rationality to distinguish fantasy from reality, and who can be pushed to do dirty things. <br /> <However, it is difficult to understand how “La Bete” falls into this category. <br /> <br /> Appearing in England, the British censor rejected him out of control. Despite the weakening of nudity in the 69th, given the theoretical theme of the film about bestiality, if the censorship missed ANY of this, he would be looking for a new job on Monday. <br /> <br /> BUT ... in those days there was an alternative. G.L.S. It was a local city council with a department that had the opportunity to transfer the film only to London, where it was believed that the audience was more “sophisticated” than those who lived in sticks. <br /> <br /> The film was properly presented and completed. However, later it turned out that the “council” consisted of only four people - three voted, plus a “chairman”. And that day one of the voters fell ill. Thus, the remaining two voters and the chairman sat down to watch "La Bete". <br /> <br /> One of these voters, like me, thought that the film is funny and is unlikely to encourage dirty acts of anyone. Others lacked imagination, and he simply thought that the work was disgusting. And the chairman did not understand this, so he decided to err on the side of FREEDOM. <br /> <br /> When the missing voter finally saw the movie, they also thought it was disgusting, but it was TOO LATE! The film received a certificate of "X-London" and is open to mixed reactions. G.L.S. The Film Censorship Council was soon dissolved! Thus, “La Bete” opened in London only by what is best called FLAKE! But I'm glad it was. It's great! If you have not seen this, do so. This is FANTASY, and, as such, it is much less alarming than most of the things you see in the news these days ...
