I just saw "Of Human Bondage" for the first time a few days ago and WOW! What a mysterious and almost creepy movie. I loved how the music went with the pace of each step of Philip's feet. For some reason, this caused a chill ... <br /> <br /> One of the greatest aspects of this film is that you see Bette Davis entering into herself right before your eyes. She is great, not necessarily because this is her best work, but because in 1934 it was so unusual to be as mean, tough and unshakable as an actress ... I began to realize that she could be as nasty and brave as she wanted, and people would love her for it. If you're a real movie buff, it's amazing to see ... <br /> <br /> She just had a way to present the plot that made the role, and the film, for that matter, belongs to her. Like "Mass of music and fire. It's me ... old kazoo and a few Bengal lights" or "But you're Blanche, you're in this chair!" or "WITH ALL THE HEART, I LOVE LOVE THE MAN WHO I KILLED !!" ... This is from several of her films, but you know what I mean. She was so bold, bold and exotic, with such beautiful big eyes. Seeing this, I can’t believe it was redone twice ... <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard was great ... so calm and persistent, in need of love. I thought he was adorable and could not understand how everyone did not fall in love with him, but then again, everyone was ... except Mildred. He did an excellent job ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn’t like was having something to do with writing in early films. They make the character so hateful that it’s almost unbelievable that someone will really fall in love with him. The performances were great, but in real life Philip would never be interested in Mildred. This is a simple truth ... See it!
