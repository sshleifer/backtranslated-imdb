I tend to any film that paints a gorgeous picture of Italy - in my opinion, the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately, the film was rather short, unusual for the historical period and a little meager in cinematic aspect. However, a great story makes up for it. Four ladies go on a much-needed relaxing break with problems on their mind. During the film, they become aware of their problems and begin to correct them. They believe that San Salvatore, the castle in which they live, has a charming effect on people. “This is a bath of love,” says Lottie Wilkins. You can observe their gradual change from dissatisfied to abundance, as the Italian coast works on them with its magic. <br /> <br /> All their problems and their solutions are likely. The actresses were great. The background music seemed very suitable for the romantic Italian region. All in all, the movie is 10/10 for me.
