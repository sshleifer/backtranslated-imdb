I originally saw this very dark comedy around 2000 or so on cable television. What a surprise and delight! All secretly armed in this movie! Dreyfus plays the "mental" don (remember the New York don, who was supposed to be schizophrenic? Does art imitate life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin at their finest and should NOT be toys! Thus, proof that beauty and strength really go together! Then there is the big “bullshit” scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey), where they verbally act out the world’s “garbage”. This film is both thin and bald. For all filming this can be a very quiet movie. And you have the opportunity to see several actors in their final or almost final roles. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. This is not a movie for everyone. But if you like the film, in which many words, and he continues to move, without blowing up everything in sight, this film is for you. Roger Ebert makes this film. He is not right. This is a good, beautiful movie! Maybe just not one for Ebert. I regard it as 10 because of how well it is done and how much the script can be funny, although in reality it is not just a comedy film. I like it so much that I bought it on DVD, because it’s not shown very much on cable television. Now it's all mine!
