I had nowhere to go. I was on a flight to Vancouver. I probably would have missed this movie if I hadn’t chosen Air Canada. While watching the small screen in the back of the seat in front, I found it fascinating and mesmerizing. I really drifted in several places and had to go back, but I had to look until the end. Now I look forward to the release of the DVD in Europe, although I will also be stunned when I can get out the door, I have to find out! <br /> <br /> The photographic composition is amazing, and the film gives a lot of insight and “fills” the story told by the photos. <br /> <br /> Recommended (if you have time).
