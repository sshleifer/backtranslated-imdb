It was a hit at the South By Southwest Film Festival (SXSW) in Austin last year, and it includes an excellent cast, led by Gloria Ruben from E.R. and scenery set maker John Glover. Although the film is shot with a small budget in New York, the film looks and sounds amazing, and it forces us to look behind the scenes of rehearsal and editing what the actors call the Scottish play, because the link to the word Macbeth thought to incur an ancient curse plays The acting company shows all the emotions of the play itself, lust, jealousy, rage, suspicion and a bit of fun. Games begin when an experienced actor is replaced (in the title role) by a well-known “pretty face” from the soap opera’s television series to attract more people. The green-eyed monster takes over from there, and the drama unfolds nicely. Great soundtrack and good performances. The DVD contains director comments and some deleted scenes.
