Well, this film begins as a funny film for life and does not get better until it almost passes through the film. The script is full of "cheese" and "fluff", and the actors for the most part are not very well oriented. In the first half of the film, a little girl rubbed my nerves. I don't think this is one of her best acting work. The only reason I bought the film was because it was on sale and there was Ellen Burstyn in it. She is awesome, but it’s also not one of her best performances. The story is based on real events, and it helps the film. In fact, I didn’t even like the movie at first, and I felt disgusted when I saw the footage with the balloon, I mean ... let him get to the place where he should go and finish it! But everything is forgiven by the time it reaches its destination, and the story comes to an end. If it does not bring tears to your eyes, nothing will happen! It's stupid and predictable, but it also makes you feel good again in the world.
