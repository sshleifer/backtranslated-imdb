Screenwriters Perry and Randy Houz created a very interesting little story in "There Is a Chance." <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​a reincarnated man who, after years, returns to the house of his former wife, the plot takes unexpected, delightful turns. <br /> <br /> Twenty-four years old Robert Downey Jr. performs an amazing show, skillfully assisted by Sybil Shepard as a widow and Ryan O'Neill as a good friend. <br /> <br /> In this trio there is a suitable chemistry for this caper who plays gracefully with each other. I watched this film several times on TV, and every time I found it the most enjoyable.
