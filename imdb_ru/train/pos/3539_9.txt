Well: fascinating cinematic shooting, great presentation, vehicles really fun to drive, quite an attractive multiplayer mode, true to the film, and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> Bad: the main missions are a bit short. /> <br /> This game defines what a “good” third-person shooter is (not necessarily a spy game). Great skirmishes continue the story and make you want to perform EVERY single mission, and discover all the real bonuses that the game has to offer. The hype that this game had was justified, and I personally think that you should buy it, meet a couple of friends and play this game. Loads of pleasure. <br /> <br /> The sound in this game is a terrific achievement from several previous games about tying, and when you shoot a weapon you feel as if you are shooting a weapon. This is due to the fact that you are a deadly and ruthless spy. <br /> <br /> In general, this game makes you excited and feel satisfied after passing, as well as a multiplayer game that can compete with the standards of James Bond's sly game "Nightfire" for gamecube.
