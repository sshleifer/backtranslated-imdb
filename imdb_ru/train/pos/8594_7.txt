The Guardian I hoped for would be a good movie, and boy, I was right. Great story, first of all from the novel, and I thought it was the original story, but I think it is not so, and it was a very smart story. Michael Douglas is very good in this film, and Kater Sutherland is also good, but, nevertheless, it is very difficult to dismiss him in the role of Jack Bauer at 24, but in the end you cope, and in Sentinel he is very different from that he is 24. Also another person trying to dismiss his role on television, but failed. Eva Longeria. She was not so good at the movie and had a back seat in all of this. After I saw the movie, I had constant dreams about the Guard, and I could not sleep. In general, Sentinel is a good film, and I would recommend it.
