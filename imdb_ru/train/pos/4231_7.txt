After returning from a shopping trip on Christmas Eve, an offended suburban housewife (Basinger) finds herself in a struggle for survival after a dispute with a group of offenders embarks on a violent turn. <br /> <br /> Suffering from resentment, directorial debut Susan Montford may not receive the recognition she deserves. It's a shame, as the standards for writing, directing and acting are really very good and certainly surpass the quality of your average right on DVD. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger at one time shows the best results as the oppressed wife of an abusive husband (Craig Schaeffer). While Schaeffer is not really given anything more than a threatening presence, Beysinger unites in her short scenes, revealing painful vulnerability, but hints at the rage that will eventually boil in her encounters with young people. This is really a great, understated view, its transformation from a victim into an aggressor played flawlessly. <br /> <br /> Lukas Haas: At first I thought he was mistaken, because he (along with three other young people) did not seem to be a threat. However, if all four young men were more impressive, later scenes in which Beysinger turns the tables against them would not have worked at all. The fact that these four ordinary men, albeit slightly upset, is the key to why the film works just like it. <br /> <br /> In addition to several problems with the storyboard in the second half of the film and a few funny lines here and there that we have here, a great thriller that actually leaves the viewer something to think about when the movie ends. Some may be pushed back by a slow first scene recording or a sudden ending. Others at times brutal violence. I say, give him a chance, it certainly deserves your time, than I saw V.
