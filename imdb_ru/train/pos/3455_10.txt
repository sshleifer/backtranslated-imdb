Steven Spielberg (24 years old) has already shot two great episodes of the 1971 TV series Psychiatrist starring Roy Tinnes. One episode was about an emotionally worried 12-year-old boy, and the other about a bright young man (Clu Gulager at his best performance), who was dying of cancer. Both episodes were stunning, visually dissimilar to everything else on TV, emotionally complex and mature. The creators of The Psychiatrist were Richard Levinson and William Link, who created Colombo and also produced its first season. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk insisted on the first title, experienced directors for the first season of Colombo, like Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smythe. But Falk agreed with Spielberg after watching part of the episode of Psychiatrist Clu Gulager. <br /> <br /> Spielberg says on the Duel DVD that he liked Stephen Bochkoâ€™s Murder by the Book (based on Levinson / Link's story), and he tried to make the play look like a million dollar movie, though thought he had much less money for work. <br /> <br /> This Colombo episode is far more visually stylish and uses soundtrack and background music better than almost any other Colombo episode, although the main directors have always been used in the series. Spielberg manages to keep the great Falk and Cassidy from excessive fuss, but both actors are still very fun. Spielberg also receives excellent support from Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All performances have freshness and vitality. The only episode of "Colombo," which was about to be well-directed, is the episode "Early Light of Dawn" with Patrick McGuan (directed by Harvey Hart). <br /> <br /> I think that two episodes of "Psychiatrist" and this episode of "Colombo" suggest that Spielberg did not technically develop as much as the director. He was great from the very beginning. In a fight! On a DVD guest comments on the 1962 episode with starring Albert Salmi Robert Altman says that this episode was almost as good as ever as a director, maybe the same applies to Spielberg.
