Must be one of the best political satires I have ever seen, with a great performance for Chusak, Tomei and all the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> Great plot, very good location and a very good surprise to twist at the end. Scenes were well filmed and set. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Overall, I appreciate this movie. US military intervention in the Middle East is extremely critical, and therefore it may receive bad reviews from people who do not share the same political point of view, or from those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate dark and insane humor. Indeed, in some places the comedy was so close to the truth that it was a border between ridiculous and tragic.
