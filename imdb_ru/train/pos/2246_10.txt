A wonderful surprise from the Spanish cinema. I never thought that Geordie Molla could have been such a great director, after all, I really care about his choice in cinema. However, this film was absolutely fantastic and completely unpredictable ... something that I ALWAYS enjoy! He was not very popular in the press, and I really do not think that he will ever be released on the American market. We will have to be content with a DVD or VHS, even if it is ... I don’t want to talk much about the story, because I don’t want to spoil it for you, but mostly a film about a homeless drunk who becomes a new messiah just to kick and get from this little money (like, for example, “oooooooooooooooooo”), before he finds out about it, he plunges into a life for which he did not count.
