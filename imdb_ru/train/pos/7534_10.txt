I totally disagree with other reviews. Everything is mostly negative. I risked this movie and was glad I did. Glad really. I could not find anything wrong with that. Nothing special. The script is original. The actors are all nice and convincing. Dee Smart reminded me of Marcia Brady from the Brady group. But this girl can really act. The situation in the Australian outback is perfect. Incredible landscapes. Gorgeous soundtrack, for example, Paul Kelly. also here. I saw this movie twice in less than 24 hours. I will probably watch it again. It is interesting. It makes you wonder. It (was) probably better than nine tenths of the so-called Hollywood blockbusters it was also during this time. Back Of Beyond is pretty. Well photographed movie. I could not find anything wrong with that. Check this! My first review!
