Berlinson and Thornton give an outstanding performance in this film along with Dennehy. Although at first it is only about love, in fact it goes deeper. The beauty of nature captures this film, becoming one of the best I've ever seen. The horse scenes are absolutely fantastic !! Any horse lover will love this movie there! <br /> <br />
