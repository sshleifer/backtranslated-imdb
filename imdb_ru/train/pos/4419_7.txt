I saw this film and heard the writer / director Juan Gerard perform at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> All I knew about this was that it was the story of an eight year old boy during the time of the 1958 Cuban revolution and how it affects his home and family. <br /> <br /> His first scene will remind “Cinema Paradiso”. In fact, the film is filled with references to classic films: “Roulette Wheel” (Casablanca), “Chicken” (“Rebel Without a Cause”), references to Bunuel, “Touch of Evil”; You will find more. Homeless (Georg Stanford Brown) - a reference to Cuban folklore, in which the black is often used as a type of Greek choir. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is the culmination of a dream. The desire of Gerard to honor his family and movies, which he loved all his life. <br /> <br /> This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people in it, as well as the events depicted. Gerard is actually an architect and engineer (and a passionate movie lover), but his dream was to make this film. He and his wife decided to live this dream, and Harvey Keitel became the “angel” who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and star in it. Keitel powerfully holds the screen like a mysterious and secretive grandfather "Che." Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast. Iben Hale (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) offer strong support in key roles. <br /> <br /> In truth, the first half of the film suffers from a tough line feed, and some are unnecessary, but stay with it. The latter half is much better, as the events of the revolution unite for a bitter and honest climax. This is the first effort of Juan Gerard, but it is as honest as he is, and his passion and heart are really revealed in this sincere first effort. I will definitely see it again and hope that he will continue his film career. <br /> <br />
