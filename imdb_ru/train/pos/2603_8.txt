Unfortunately, director Amos Gutman passed away from AIDS-related diseases a year after the creation of this film, so we donâ€™t know how many more gay films we could get from him. I found this used DVD from Cinevista on Amazon, but it looks like none of his other work has yet been made available. Hessed Mufla (Amazing Grace) contains complete frontal male nudity, at least in magazines that turn into the desired sequence of dreams. and some drug use. This is a story about how two families managed or tried, but mothers, daughters and gay sons have their own problems that need to be clarified. Jonathan (played by Gal Heuberger) meets with his neighbor Thomas, who, of course, has his own problems. Either the translations are a bit weak, or maybe Gutman purposefully left the conversation rare for a small riddle. Watching this, I feel that we do not understand the whole story, but this is normal. Add the cute ex-lover of a gay roommate Miki (Aki Avni, who has been involved in many projects, mainly Isreali TV). Lots of smoking. Much anxiety on the part of mothers. The gorgeous blues song "All Night Long Blues", written by an unknown artist; if it is listed in the credits, unfortunately, it was not translated into English. It's nice to see how mothers, brothers and sisters treat gays with respect, like any other relationship. But on the other hand, the United States has always been a few years behind other countries. A good way to spend 98 minutes ... I wanted to see even more. Received awards at several film festivals, in accordance with IMDb and film.
