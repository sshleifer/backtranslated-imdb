I'm really addicted to Caprica, because this is a really good series of prequels for Battlestar Galactica. He has a really slow pace, but he will surely catch up soon after the release of the new episodes. <br /> <br /> I heard great news about future episodes and guest stars of the first season. <br /> This sci-fi drama will surely please us, the fans who love the combination of both genres. <br /> <br /> Eric Stolz does an excellent job with his job, as well as Polly Walker as Clarice Willow !! <br /> <br /> Worth checking out !! <br /> <br /> Catch Caprica on Fridays At 9 pm / 8 pm at the SYFY Center
