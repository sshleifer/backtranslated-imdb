Just as the new BSG was not what the fans of the original series expected, Caprica might not give what the fans of the new BSG expected (for the most part). This is a very interesting, if not independent show, or at least a pilot. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the thrill of CGI (new) BSG, you will be very disappointed. If you like the drama, you will probably find something you like, and maybe even identify yourself with it. <br /> <br /> The storyline does explore how the Cylons were designed, why Adam hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society, the Authors also manage to cope with people who “play God” and create or recreate “human” life. It will be interesting to see how this ends. <br /> <br /> I found that in some parts it can be pushed, and in others - a sermon, but on the whole it was promising. A small part of me wants (or hopes) that there may be some minor hints at BSG (except for the story I mentioned), but this will probably complicate the storyline too much. Like BSG, I’ll have to wait and see if Caprica is growing at me, but it’s too early to talk about it. <br /> <br /> It would be very easy to consider it a failure if you compare it with the previous series, but I’m ready to give it a chance. Overall, I thought it was interesting enough to see how things were going in this series before “throwing a towel in the (well-known).”
