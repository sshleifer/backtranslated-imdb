First, I will be the first to admit that the scarecrow itself is a bit excessive. A muffled, perhaps less acrobatic effigy would make this film a lot less funny. But overall, I think this is one of the best B-films. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely wonderful, not to mention incredibly beautiful. Although this film lacks an important nu-factor, there are still a few films in which you can watch it. But here she gets all the evil hotness, especially near the end, when she moves away from being enveloped in a stuffed animal. Richard Elfman also works great as a sheriff and as a drunk guy. Yes, this is a low-budget B-film. But of all the things I've seen, this is definitely one of my favorites.
