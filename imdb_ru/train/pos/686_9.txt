Ghost Story (1972 television film) was the pilot for the NBC series. The movie was well written and well played, and I thought when the 1972-73 television season began, if the series is half as good as the movie, then NBC has a winner. (I would like this movie to be available on video !!) The series was a huge disappointment - even with William Castle as the executive director. producer. However, if you have the opportunity to watch the original TV movie "Ghost Story", check it out. You will not be disappointed.
