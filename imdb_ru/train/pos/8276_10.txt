That's what I'm talking about. Finally, a low-budget horror program that uses its limitations to its advantage. Wendigo, although sometimes flawed, is a triumph of the imagination. Of course, it strongly depends on the movements of the camera in the style of EVIL DEAD because of its capriciousness, but still damn better than 99% of the direct video dross. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple: the family rests in a remote cabin and is under the threat of one particularly upset hunter. But director Larry Fessenden really knows how to create uncertainty and add layers of disturbing eeriness with the help of the mythical Wendigo. This is real? Is it all in the boy's imagination? Is it an externalization of the emotional state of the child? <br /> <br /> Some people say that the film is unsatisfactory because you decide. Do not despair of such petty rubbish. A film that makes you think should not be avoided. This is one to rejoice.
