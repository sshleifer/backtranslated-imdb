Blimey! So fun! Probably a little for normal American children, and indeed, it is quite difficult to call it a children's film, this film reminded me a lot of the Time Bandits - Terry Gilliam himself throughout the journey. While the overall narrative is fairly straightforward, Miike still adds VERY surrealistic moments and Bunuel-esquire moments. The entire first act furiously compares from scene to scene the normal family life of the main child / hero, with the spiritual world and evil, than it happens in it. And although the finale has a slightly ambiguous aspect, characteristic of Miike's work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, in particular, anti-war / anti-revenge, the news of human stupidity is damn sharp. The same manic and figuratively funny, like other great films about Miike, only instead of excessive torture and blood, he gives us an infinite number of monsters and yokai from Japanese folklore, creatively conceived with the help of computer graphics and dolls wrapped in a figurative multi-faceted adventure. , Glad, and one of the best in Miike!
