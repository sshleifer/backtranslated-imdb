Interesting film about Kung Fu, with an actor's plot, plot and battle scenes, a head taller than average choppy. All the actors are cute characters and skilled martial artists. It's funny to watch Alexander Fu-Shen's comic antics in the style of Proto-Jackie Chan, and his strict interlocutor demonstrates particularly impressive skills. For me, the only obvious drawback of the film is the size of the actors - sometimes things get a little tangled as the movie is interrupted and changed between different plots, and some of the characters are not as worked out as we would like. <br /> <br /> But a kung-fu movie should be judged primarily by the quality of the action, and the Shaolin Temple definitely does it. The culmination of the film is a battle with a large number of people, which allows each character to demonstrate their skills in front of a worthy opponent. <br /> <br /> Overall, the Shaolin Temple is a nice low-budget film about Kung Fu. Not to the quality of a good movie Jet Li, but definitely worth seeing fans of the genre. My rating: 8/10. <br /> <br /> Miscellaneous notes: The 1987 release of Warner Home Video, which I saw, was (as expected) poorly duplicated, and it lacked full actors and crew credits.
