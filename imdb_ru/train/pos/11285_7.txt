Like Tarzan the Monkey Man (1932), only more. There are most of all, more animals, more diverse African tribes and scenes in which there should be a thought, if it would be good with three or four lions, forty would be better. Tarzan struggles with crocodiles - the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin, around and around, clapping its jaws. Tarzan can kill him with his omnipresent knife if the blown saurian is standing still. Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and the ever-growing number of animals. His friends are real chimpanzees, people in big monkey costumes and elephants. In fact, they use Indian elephants - much friendlier and more trained than African ones - with costumed ears attached to their heads. Human story: another white man, worse than the others, shows up to join Holt, to go for ivory from the cemetery of elephants. Tarzan will not show them the way, so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can trace him to his deathbed. Tarzan intercepts, and the bad guy shoots him, but of course he survives and returns to save Jane. Everyone else is dying, Holt and the bad guy and each of their "boys." People are consumables, especially Africans, and there seems to be no big difference between blacks who die because they work for white people traveling around the country of taboos and those who kill them. This must have been Tarzan’s last movie before Hayes Code forced Jane to wear more clothes. There are a number of underwater scenes in which Jane swims nude, and although the light flickers from movement, and the glimpses are very attractive. Apparently, one of Weismuller’s friends from the Olympic swimming team was filmed nude, not Maureen O'Sullivan. She, however, moves through the film in the same loincloth that Weismouller wears (plus a bikini), showing a gorgeous look at the hip and thigh. They still don't need to talk much. They sleep together, hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities. No wonder they are happy.
