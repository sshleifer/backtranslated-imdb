I caught this movie late Saturday / Sunday with my brother. We drank. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. From the "luxurious" ocean liner, which is actually a ferry "ride, go down", complete with cast iron, all the way to the door with adhesive stickers labeled "staff", then you see how this door is used for something else in another scene - this movie is swinging !! Continuity is so bad that you can't help but notice it, it hits you in the face with holes. In the final scene, he jumps off the lifeboat with the ferry in the distance. The cuts to his son and new girlfriend (director of public relations, who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police, but was fired for doing his own way is true) on the ferry going very fast from the explosion. ...... Then dad hugs them. How???? Who cares, his magic. There is not one redemptive trait in this film. The casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table. when pursued by the villains there is only one place to hide, you guessed it. Enter the villains, who, instead of checking under one table, start shooting four fruit machines and a small corner bar (the corner bar in the casino is fantastic). They pass by the only shelter that allows our Casper to bypass them and "remove." <br /> <br /> Put your teammates in order, drink a few drinks, put on this film and howl.
