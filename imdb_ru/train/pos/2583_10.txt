The greatest games of Kasparov or Fisher can be a mess for a beginner. This is a great movie. There is no special agency involved in the conspiracy. This is the key! This is a PRIVATE plot, built as a PRIVATE enterprise. This is a self-destructive and self-organized plot. In conclusion, the script described the ideal professional plot: private, self-organized, self-destructive, without a trace at the end. Behind the plot can be anyone: an intelligent "director" with money. Everything can be done only by delegation. The “director” should just be a trigger. If the ordinary viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the film, the real plot is less likely to be detected. All the acting performances are well made, with some references to Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
