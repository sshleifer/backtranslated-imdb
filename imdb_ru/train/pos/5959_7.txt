Although this film will not go down in the annals of a great movie, this is a fun way to spend an hour and a half with your family. The film finally comes out on video, where it was supposed to debut first. <br /> <br /> The film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for dinners, which they called The Club of Hungry Bachelors. , George Fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate to get paid for the restaurant she wants to open. Bill Nunn plays a mysterious man who loves Cadillac, who becomes her lover. Fox gives an understated and touching presentation, and Nunn, as always, reliably talented. Michel de Barres - cry, as the supreme lawyer. The ensemble throws - made up of familiar faces - works well together to revive this stupid group of characters. This is a good rental and one of the few that you can see the whole family.
