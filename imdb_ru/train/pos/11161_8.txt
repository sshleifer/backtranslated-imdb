This is a very funny movie! I have no idea whether this translates well into other languages ​​or not. Nevertheless, I think that men all over the world can identify with “Frank” and his thoughts to some extent! These thoughts are very interesting, and women will also enjoy this film, I'm sure! <br /> <br /> All the actors played well, and this film could be a huge hit all over the world if it were shot in England. or the United States. But for those of you who are lucky enough to understand the Swedish language, you will find a treat! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
