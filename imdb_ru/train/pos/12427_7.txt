This film has a lot of raw potential. The script is accurate, the dialogue (as a rule) is excellent (although it can lose lousy voice-overs), the direction and cinematography are surprisingly quite good, although some experiments simply do not work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. Once a geek, always a geek; and the sad, simple fact is that he is not able to play anything other than Fox Mulder. He poses, he tries to be smooth, he poses, he tries to be macho. In the end, he just tries too hard. He overplays his character, he overplays his lines, and he is simply overplayed in all respects by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, who are in a class above him in terms of acting. Timothy Hutton was (as always) really good. There was a moment or two when he over-dramatized his role, but you could say that he had fun with her. He looked at the role, and he became a character both physically and atmospheric. Angelina Jolie was also very good. She did not have a special role; in fact, I thought that she could use a much stronger one ... her character was not sufficiently developed, although she did an excellent job with what she had. And the chemistry between her and Hutton was obvious (well, maybe that's why Uma left her ...;) In general, it was rough around the edges, but a serious effort from good actors and excellent supporting roles. If David Duchovny had not torn his role into pieces, it would have been much better. 7/10.
