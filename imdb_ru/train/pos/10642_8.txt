I just looked at the detention last night, and I liked what I saw. It was a cool funny movie. Dolph looked great on the bike. He also looked good in this film compared to his other recent films. Now he is in pretty good shape. The story was fine, and the other actors were also bearable. I would not call this film his best, but he is still a good film. <br /> <br /> But it also has its problems. The first was the way in which bullets flew everywhere, and even when they shot at close range, they did not hit the target. They had to show that people avoided bullets better. Another problem I encountered was how the students were cursing. I do not know in which school students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom. The third problem was that there were very few bad guys. There should have been more bad guys. The last problem was definitely the fact that the set looked silly, but it was associated with a small budget. Overall, the film was good. I like it. I would recommend others to watch it. Postscript Now you're a dead cop. (Some One-liners were cool too) <br /> <br />
