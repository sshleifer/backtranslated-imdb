Well, if you are one of those fans of the film Katans (like me), you will surely appreciate this metaphysical blood-waving samurai film Katana. <br /> <br /> Starring Tadanobu Asano (Vital, barren illusion) and Ryu Daisuke (Kagemusha). This samurai war between the Heikki clan and the Genji clan touched the zenith in the final battle on the Gojo Bridge. The number of bodies is countless. <br /> <br /> Demons, magic swords, Shinto priests against Buddhist monks and the beautiful visions provided by maestro Sogo Ishii will do the rest. <br /> <br /> Good Japanese click for a rainy summer night.
