This episode, marked by the Peabody award, is one of the highlights of season 1, when a holodeck malfunction traps Captain Picard, Beverly, Data, and Star Fleet historian named Waylan in the 1930s setting in San Francisco. This episode is a tribute to Raymond Chandler's Maltese Falcon, where Patrick Stewart plays the role of Humphrey Bogart - complete with felt and a raincoat. The office itself is an almost exact replica of the one presented in Bogey's Falcon of Malta. <br /> <br /> This episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious race of insects called Jarada, which deals mainly with the high sound of buzzing. Communication with this alien race is difficult, and Picard must communicate with this race in their own language in order for negotiations and diplomacy to finally begin. The best part of this episode, however, is the appearance of the famous Hollywood B-actor Lawrence Tierney as the gangster Cyrus Redblock. He was such a handsome man in the 1940s. Well...
