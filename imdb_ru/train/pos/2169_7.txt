Well, first of all, ignore the feedback of the last person. They admit that they fell asleep through this, so it’s not surprising that they didn’t understand what was going on !!! As for the thriller / horror, this film is not so bad, it is certainly very watchable. Right from the opening scenes, you get a general idea of ​​what will be the cause of all the madness that follows, and in the end you were right when everything became clear. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, it was pretty creepy from time to time, and as old movies go, it was bearable. Great to watch late at night! I give him a generous 7 out of 10.
