I really think that people take the wrong approach to this. First of all, I find this short film very interesting and interesting. I just understand what it is. I think that the unknown and the mystery are brilliant in their allusions to the observer. Another thing that caught my attention was that it immediately engages the viewer, even if there is no clear story, only hints, pauses and emotions that are played by characters who seem to create the impression that there is a story for everything that is. going on. No one else could have done it better than Lynch. This is the essence of Lincanism at its best. Of course, I agree with everyone that people who start looking at this with a desire to have fun without any truly creative work from the viewer will be disappointed. And in good law. Lynch is not about that. At least this side of Lynch is not. The one who helped make Lost Highway / Mulholland Dr. is here in a complete bias, and people who just expect them to be entertained, as if they were watching something else, just won’t understand what all this is about. My opinion is that the “Shaded Room” is all that interferes with your animal core, your instinctive self, giving you the means (image, sound, situation) with which you instinctively react. This is not about any pleasure, but about getting the desired reaction from you. And this, my friend, is pure art.
