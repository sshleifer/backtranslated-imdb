Judy Davis shows us why she is one of Australia’s most respected and beloved actors — her image of a lonely, aimless nomad is second to none. Teenage Claudia Karvan also gives us an idea of ​​what will make her one of the most popular actors of this country in the coming years, with future roles in “GREAT SERVICE”, “SERVICE RECEIVING”, DATING THE ENEMY, RISK and the famous TV series “Secret” LIFE USA. (By the way, as a child Karvan was a little girl whose toy Panda was stolen near the pharmacy in the 1983 drama “Leaving” with Tracy Mann.) If you like this movie, be sure to take a look! Rating: 79/100. See also: HOTEL SORRENTO, RADIANCE, VACANT POSSESSION, LANTANA.
