Perhaps there is a special reason why the Fox and the Child fell into my heart. Just saying goodbye to my new bride - oh ... once - for an unknown period of time, I was a little overwhelmed by various emotions and suffered from the loss of the bold face that she needed to see. /> <br /> I watched several films and TV shows, but my interest was based on what I left behind, on what was there and what I did not see. For this, I have to thank this movie. <br /> <br /> Being a nature lover and having heard about the film beforehand, I was sure that he would like it anyway. But I did not just like it, I liked it. <br /> <br /> The technical prowess is astounding. How do they do it? How did they catch the animals the way they did ?? This is just great. <br /> <br /> The moral of this tale is good, and although the final is about, so French and ambiguous, it is happy / sad. Again, this caught me off guard. As a person who usually keeps his emotions to himself, the end was hard as I flew a plane full of people I saw for the next 15 or so hours! Perhaps this is because the final made me remember what I left. <br /> <br /> But during these few hours on the plane I was happy to see something new and original. And this is life. Of course, there are those things that you love and feel comfortable around ... but there are a lot of mysteries in the open air. So next time I will see something unusual, being under the open sky; I am going to research it, observe it and accept it. This is exactly what is happening in this film, and this is exactly what you should do with this damn good film / nature document too. 8/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. Two months from the plane. We still do not know when to see you, but see you.
