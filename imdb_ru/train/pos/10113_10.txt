I like this movie. Not being a fan of Ed Wood, Jr., I prefer to appreciate his “boundless enthusiasm” and recognize his flaws. His films are funny, but his personal story is filled with pain. I was hoping and was glad to know that this film would be about understanding its turbulent life, and not about putting it on posthumous praise. From start to finish, this film turns from a documentary into a mythology, leaving the actors and the audience unexpectedly connected with each other and with Ed Wood, Jr. <br /> <br /> We get people who knew Ed Wood. It’s best to talk about him from all sides, positive and negative, and show us their character just like Ed. We get an idea of ​​Ed's personal and professional life: from his novels, his drinking, his sexuality, his friends, his enemies, and even his filming. <br /> <br /> The film itself was shot in a low-budget way, which seems to be made out of respect for Ed, as if using the methods of most theatrically released 1996 films would be disrespectful (such as wearing a better costume than the president). The set designer uses a sense of humor as well as great insight when comparing each cast with their background. <br /> <br /> Fans will be happy to hear a personal testimony about Ed Wood's disputes, and newcomers will be amazed that this person was real. The DVD is full of impossible to find gems (“Lorado Crossroads” and photo galleries), but the real treasure of this film is an amazingly fascinating and interconnected story. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood had a habit of identifying people, communicating with him (for better or for worse), to such an extent that one woman would go down in history as the “Pool Owner” for having once allowed him and his friends baptized in her pool. This ability to determine a person’s heritage is everywhere, as the film’s most amazing effect is not only to not only provide a comprehensive view of the man who was Ed Wood Jr., but also to give a comprehensive view of the community he created. Somehow, even without having more than one cast on the screen at the same time, the connection that Ed Wood created among different people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer is left with a great sense of belonging. <br /> Even the title hints at the B-list horror genre, but by the end we see that even this is kindness. What begins with unrelated stories of random people ends with the conclusion that the entire cast will be woven forever into an unpredictable cohesive fabric in which the story will pursue unity with the legend of Wood. <br /> <br /> In many ways, living controversy, Ed Wood Jr. cannot be reduced to a single point of view. This joint effort is closest to knowing it, which we can ever get. Being in itself a combination of topics, he is at the same time respectful, provocative, thoughtful, exciting, cheerful, sad, kind and satisfying.
