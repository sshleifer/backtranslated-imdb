The name of this film is taken from a party game called Seven Minutes in Heaven. The game was popular with my husband's friends when he was in high school in Brooklyn, New York, and he describes it as something like Spin-the-Bottle, Relaysaver Relay, and other children's kiss games. According to the rules, the name of the boy and girl were to be drawn, and the chosen ones ordered to enter the dark wardrobe together and stay there for seven minutes. At the same time, there are rumors among the party guests about whether both have the courage to hold hands, hug and / or kiss each other in the privacy of the closet. After seven minutes, the host of the game said “Time is up,” or knocked on the closet door, and the couple left the closet. After being interviewed by other guests, the couple had to admit what they did during the Seven Minutes in Heaven. Then other couples will be chosen to enter the closet until all the guests have participated. The couple that recognized what they are doing the most will be the winner of the game. <br /> <br /> These games serve as social icebreakers for children and teenagers, but they can confuse and intimidate shy people. The film received this name because it deals with the first teen experience with falling in love and romantic love.
