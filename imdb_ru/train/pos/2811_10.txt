Silverlake Life, the view from here, is an absolutely amazing movie about AIDS, as well as a gay love relationship. Some images are really very difficult to do, especially when someone is gay or afraid of AIDS, and probably for any sensitive person who is watching him. It is not easy to make a film about such a terrible disease and its consequences not only for one, but also for the lives of two people. This film teaches how to care for each other in such difficult times, but it never becomes too painful, it still shows life at any time, reminding you that life goes on outside the theater or your room, regardless of the fate of some people. . people can be. Characters are incredibly nice, while we observe their proximity in frames that never go beyond a very strict limit, never revealing anything too personal or offensive. Children, of course, should not watch this film, but adults, regardless of whether they encounter such situations or not, should do this, and will not regret the tears they shed.
