I finally watched these episodes in 2008, and I had to constantly go back and check when they were really shot. They are absolutely terrible in joking with what will happen in the future. Either Parker and Stone lived in Texas and witnessed Gov Bush’s idiocy, or those strange, creepy people who pay attention to things. Boo, scary! Are Bush’s brother brothers invading the White House, dressed like Arabs with rifles? Did Bush "accidentally" execute someone? (No, wait. He sort of did it like a governor.) At that time it might have seemed like a failure as a comedy series, but now it should be seen as a brilliant, though frightening, prediction.
