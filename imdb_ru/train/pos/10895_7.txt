Surviving Christmas is an amazingly funny movie, especially given the poor publicity when it was first released. Ben Affleck is funny as a nasty millionaire who pays a family that occupies his childhood home to be his family at Christmas. Then he drives his family crazy with pampering at Christmas. I have not been a fan of Ben Affleck in the past (although I liked Daredevil and Peychek), but here he played well in this role. I also like Christina Applegate as a daughter in a family that initially does not tolerate the character of Affleck. Of course, you can see where this film is going, but you don't care. Do not pay attention to what the critics say, and rent this movie, because it is funnier than many Christmas movies.
