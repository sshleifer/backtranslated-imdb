I would not hesitate to place this adaptation of the “Death Trap” in the top 5 best adaptations from the scene to the film. Kane and Reeves (an underestimated actor who never managed to do more than boring romances and “Superman”) play very well here with each other. Even Diane Cannon, whom I don’t usually worry about, played a great role, which uses her value of irritation as an actress. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that comparisons of “Deathtrap” with “Sleuth” - another brilliant step-by-step adaptation involving Michael Kane - are true or even fair. Yes, these two stories have a lot in common. But “Sleuth” is as important about class war as it is about the battle of minds, and the house in “Slite” is at least the same character in the film as the two actors - the house really has no equivalent in the “Death Trap” . “This is not so much a battle of wits as a sharp vignette that people are not damn good (and never as smart as they think) and deserve everything they get. I will simply say that both films are excellent examples of the genre, and they are worth your time and money. After all, this is America. You do not need to choose! <br /> <br /> I won’t give out plot twists, but I don’t think it matters anyway. I watched a DVD eight or nine times in a dozen years, and still enjoyed the chemistry, the timing and the terrible moments when everything became pear-shaped. Everything is done so well that the trip becomes more important than the actual destination. <br /> <br /> Anyone who likes evil comedy and indecision in the style of Hitchcock’s filmmaking will surely get great pleasure from the “Deadly Trap”.
