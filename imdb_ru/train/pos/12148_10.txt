There is a lot of comedy in this film, not darkness, and Gordon Liu shines in it. He shows his comic side, and it was really strange to see him being beaten. His training is "unorthodox," and who would have thought that tying knots could be so deadly ?? A lot of great tricks and choreography. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wan to the mix and youâ€™ll get a terrific final match! Do not mess with the Manchurian goons; they are ruthless!
