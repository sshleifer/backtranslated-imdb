This is one of those films that you would not want to see before - so that you can see it again for the first time. Books Van Dyne still bring pleasure, but many call them excessively floral. This film is by far the best adaptation of his work. William Powell - this is William Powell - don't say more. The plot is intricate. The story is moving too fast, because you want it to continue. Enjoy.
