This film is a must for all people who love football as an art. The first thing that catches your eye in this film about the World Cup is the way it was shot. In addition to watching the play, similar to television broadcasting, there are also videos on the tracks of individual players in games. This evokes the emotions and situations that these people go through trying to achieve fame. The current style of television broadcasting, so different from the style of 1986, is still inferior in quality compared to this film. <br /> <br /> Players are not the only stars. Spectators, judges, journalists covering matches, and the situation itself play a central role in the development of what is history today. In this film you can see how all these factors play together in a very explicit way. In this regard, the modern style of television broadcasting has not yet reached such a level of quality, although now it is much closer than before. <br /> <br /> There are several dedicated players: Maradona (Argentina), Elkyayer and Laudrup (Denmark). ), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Lineker (England), Rummenigge (Germany), Butrag # o (Spain), Socrates (Brazil) and Sanchez (Mexico). <br /> <br /> This film is not a collection of the best football moves of Mexico in 1986, although most of them are well covered. All films emphasize the presentation of several aspects of the game and the competition itself, based on the progress of these players and teams, even at the cost of skipping the corresponding games in the games themselves. This is what makes this film so interesting and unique. <br /> <br /> Because of what happened because of the judges in Mexico in 1986, many comments about this film and the World Cup are extremely biased towards Maradona. Many of these comments do not take into account that there is a judge and two linear players, that they are the same people as the players, and that all of the above make mistakes, one way or another. Football rules do not allow judges to use replays on television for decision-making, so for the most part judges have to decide what they perceive. As a result, judges play an active role in the design of the game. Their influence can be seen in several parts of this film. <br /> <br /> The sequel to the 1990 World Cup movie, by comparison, is only a source of bitter disappointment. This is largely due to the fact that he has become too involved in the game, while this film tells things from a more distant, unbiased point of view.
