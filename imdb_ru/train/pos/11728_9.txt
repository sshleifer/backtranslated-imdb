There are two things that I like about Elvira, and they are both more than she, and she keeps them secret: her wit and her talent. The film is the best thing to show how fun it can be or how it attracts attention. Looking like the combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith, she inherits the property of a distant relative only to discover that she is indeed the heir of the occult. The comedy in this film is the best thing in it, but it could be much more frightening and frightening. This is basically a field fare with as many bad horror films as, for example, a rebellious rebellion or a fleeing heroine who stumbles and stumbles on her heels. My favorite part is when she uses her wondrous abilities to break the chains, keeping her locked in a graveyard. The ending is sweet-sweet, as if it were written by Bradis, but the Las Vegas act at the end seems too grand for this type of film.
