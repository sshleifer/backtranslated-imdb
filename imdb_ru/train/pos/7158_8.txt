Holes (2003, director Andrew Davis) <br /> <br /> When Stanley Yelnatz IV was wrongfully convicted of theft, he is sent to Green Lake Camp. In this camp, the boss and her two minions, Mr. Sir and Dr. Pendanski, order classmates to dig holes for hole for hole. But for what reason? Stanley plans to find out. <br /> <br /> I never had the intention to watch Holes, and I must admit, I did watch the film because I am such a fan of Shea LaBouf, but even if you are not a fan of it, it doesnâ€™t matter. Holes is one of those Disney films that the whole family can enjoy. The story is beautifully written and includes a great idea on how to incorporate memories into the past. It does not distract and really gives an excellent story. All the actors are great. Young stars are doing well, and the addition of John Voight and Sigourney Weaver pleases. Shia LaBouf shows that even at the age of 17 he can act without any flaws. This is one Disney movie that you would definitely like with the whole family. <br /> <br /> "I learn from failures." - Stanley Yelnatz III (Henry Winkler)
