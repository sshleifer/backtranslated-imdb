This one will get reviews all over the map because it is not suitable for any form. It's terrible - but not spray. This is equally as Suspense, and the Horror - but without the usual Hollywood cries and jerky camera. <br /> <br /> The feeling of the film is rather scanty and devoid of any special effects, because I think you should listen and watch the characters' faces. <br /> <br /> Forget that Brendan is a graduate of the Buffy universe. This is a red herring. He acts here. “Camp” is a misinterpretation of the tone of this story. Adrienne Barbeau shows excellent results - so she must believe that the script has something to say. We all know excuses when the actors clearly don't care, and they just wait for the director to click Cut and get his paycheck. This is not the point. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the fact that the bodies begin to fall with almost insane regularity. I don't think the intention was humorous — but to keep you balanced. <br /> <br /> Think about it, not so much as “Horror Film”, as much as “Horror” on the stage - this is a decrepit whitewashed house. Then you may see that this is really paranoia, fear and growing insanity that occurs in some isolated place, the United States. <br /> <br /> And this is perverted. Time travel, Mind Control, secret experiments and the Nazis, who can NOT be dead. .yet <br /> <br /> I say: take it for rent and try it if you are set up for something a little brainwave. It would be a good choice for a midnight Saturday village.
