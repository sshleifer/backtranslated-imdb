Outside the family is another world, and the family struggles to overcome the line between the power of the popes and their hopes and dreams. <br /> <br /> This period is captured; Switches of bakelite illumination, Georgian floor, rails for paintings, wallpaper, short skirts, cheeky guys, mini van, shiny modern braziers .... <br /> <br /> The place is captured; A rugged glacier carved a stony landscape, walls of local stone, community, freedom. <br /> <br /> But there is much more; Childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, power, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense), love, struggle, sexual maturity, naivety, morality, trust, faith, deception, courage, manners, maturity, loss, poverty , sacrifice, horror, acceptance, revelation, comedy and fatherhood are all there. (And in no particular order!). <br /> <br /> This film is a richly woven expression of family tension, which is as relevant today as it was before. The fact that some of them are not considered directly is in itself a testament to today's attitude, but the fact that they are all present here is evidence of acting, history and direction. <br /> <br /> If there’s something bad in this film, it’s that all this deep-rooted and wonderfully induced tension is swept away too easily to the end. Maybe I misunderstand - the doom and gloom experienced by many adolescents really disappear, if they cope with it (**) - perhaps the film is trying to send even this message - what is worth doing. <br /> <br /> What is the movie trying to say? Children: parents were also young, parents also fight, everyone makes mistakes, everything learns, everything changes, the struggle can end well. Parents: do not try! Try to remember that your support is the key to their well-being. <br /> <br /> That sounds easy, isn't it? Sometimes the film seems the same, but then you notice how much is challenged and revealed. <br /> <br /> Classic movie. <br /> <br /> (**) - no problem on their own.
