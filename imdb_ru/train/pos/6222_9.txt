This is a really great movie. Some songs have become an immortal classic, and Fred's and Ginger's dances are some of the best. But basically all the films of Fred and Ginger are the same. After singing and dancing, the other characters in the film make the film work. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His love affair with Harriet Hilliard and the plot of the film is the reason why I watch it again and again. He adds to this film, he does not detract from it. He has a winning personality and a great smile. Randy is in my top ten for all time favorites. Nice to see him with something other than a cowboy. Well, so he is not really a great actor, but, like many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Metri, etc., He was very handsome and could in some cases climb to the top. All the films of Fred and Ginger had scenes that depended on other actors to fill the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the film would have to be reduced by about half an hour. I just want more people to appreciate Randy, and I felt the need to stand up for him.
