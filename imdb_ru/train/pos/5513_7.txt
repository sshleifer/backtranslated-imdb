From what I read, many people were disappointed with this film, compared to part 1. Initially, I could understand it, but after thinking about it, I think that they are wrong. Soderberberg continues his historical narration about the life of Che, which he began in the first part. The first part told the story of the revolution, which went from a hopeless beginning to a finally successful conclusion. Part 2 tells the story of a revolution that goes from a hopeless beginning to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderberg’s fault that these 2 parts of Che’s life had completely different results. He boldly decides to tell both in a rather simple way. The viewer may feel much better after leaving the cinema after the first part than the second, but this is the reality of Che’s life, and not, in my opinion, any director’s fault. The film is far from perfect. This is probably too long. At least in the first part, we saw various aspects of the war, since the partisans were successful. In the second part, they cannot take a break, and we see that their number is constantly decreasing as a result of death and capture. With capture and death, Che is treated well. The film is greatly enhanced through dialogue in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is again excellent as a charismatic Argentinian. So, if you saw part 1, you will see a very similar story of a completely different story in the second part.
