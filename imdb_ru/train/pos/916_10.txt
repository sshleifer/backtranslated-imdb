My comments for VIVAH: - This is a charming, idealistic love story with Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film brings us back to small pleasures, such as the families of the bride and groom, sleeping on the floor, playing games together, their friendly banter and mutual respect. Vivah about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of obligations between two people. Yes, the central novel is naively visualized. But crept into romantic moments between a to-be-married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern marriage games makes you crave for idealism. The film predictably ends in marriage, and the bridegroom tells his new bride who suffers from burns on his wedding night: “Come on, let me get dressed” <br /> <br /> VIVA - shows a lot of good things - the beauty of organized marriage, the beauty of Indian culture, the beauty of an Indian woman, and last but not least: IDEALISM of the future couple waiting for the wedding ... playing by the rules! Simple but beautiful; Such a simple story ... no plot ... no villain - as is the case with most Suraj Barjatya films. Suraj Sir is back to what he does best. He made the film with complete conviction. This is a very cute film that teaches the current generation of many good things about an arranged marriage and the Union of 2 families. I think AMRITA RAO looks very good and she acted very well. She has most of the good scenes - although I thought that the last half hour was completely for Shahid Kapoor - which, for a change, does amazingly discreet work. I also liked the game of everyone else, for example. Choti, that is, Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, brother and sister of Shahid. It seemed almost as real and recognizable as it could have been. Sooraj Sir got another good family movie in his honor after Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain. The chemistry between Shahid and Amrita is AMAZING. <br /> <br /> Things like holiness in marriage / relationships, avoiding courtship, mutual respect, care and space, waiting for marriage "officially", prayer / sacrifice for a woman you love - all this and more is SHOWN IN Vivah. There is still a good audience that enjoys this film. Some people / viewers are already excited to see what they think about an arranged marriage :) This is a success if you ask me. It seems AMRITA RAO - our actress from Vivah {Result for a good performance} was awarded the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE award in 2006 !! I take off my hat to her for this achievement, Chalo, although Vivah, Shahid or Amrita did not receive any payment for travel to the cinema, or other awards; @ at least this is news to cheer! Congratulations to AMRITA RAO - for showing us the visual image of the Indian bride in its purest form, and, of course, for Suraj Bardjatya for portraying her in the best possible way :) Do not forget about Shahid Kapoor and all the others who make Viva sweet and legendary like today !! Imagine, to share the same pedestal, as the legendary Dilip Kumar .......... This is a considerable achievement !! Congratulations to Amrita Rao for the fact that thanks to this award she raised her career to a new level .... I personally think that she should continue to make films only with Shahid Kapoor !! They make a cute couple, and their screen chemistry reminds me of {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla} ................. <br /> <br /> Some of the points that I noticed are just some of the elements: - # 1 If you notice carefully, Amrita Rao looks so good because she always wears traditional dresses. In this film, she reveals all the essences of an Indian woman! Shahid Kapoor’s ideal landing number 2 is similar to most of us - not quite ready for marriage or early marriage ... but PREM attentively listens to its dad's step-by-step lecture - with full faith in Anupam Kher. In the end, “Honesty” and “Trust” are the key words that he reflects in his first conversation with Amrita. Most people think that such a first meeting with a complete stranger for a limited time is never enough to judge a person. But according to what I saw in this film, I have a feeling that two people who are made for each other can also connect in the 1st meeting, it is possible !!! # 3 Throughout the film - mostly 4 or 5 episodes where Shahid and Amrita are together - or shown to be together. Unlike most other romantic / wedding films, where Hero & Heroine is always singing / dancing or today, they do cheap things. But the beauty of each of these 5 sequences: - Characterized by restraint, innocence and respect for others! # 4 I really enjoyed the relationship between Chacha ALOK NATH and Amrita Rao. These films should show the indifference shown by daughters / girls in some parts of India. # 5 Romantic scenes between a married couple are shot very beautifully - no cheap scenes, the songs are beautifully depicted !! Words like "Jal", "praarthana" e.t.c. going to be fashionable buzzwords for all the girls who liked this movie :) Personally, I really like a lot of the dialogue in this movie. # 6 Last but not least, the whole hospital scene where Shahid puts Sindhur to Amrita when she fights for Life is amazing. These dialogues between the couple are so touching, and you feel that I LOVE / I can't do without you; This is a hats-off feeling !!! <br /> <br /> *** In many ways, VIVAH reminded me of Maine Pyar Kiya, DDLJ, Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - about the freshness / screen chemistry of the LEAD pair:) :) *** IF You ask me: - Along with films such as Rang De Basanti, Lage Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE and Kabul Express, VIVAH is one of the best films of 2006. view / business than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all these films about temporary / fuzzy / style / shit !!
