When I was little, my parents got this film for me to watch. I really liked it, and I watched it over and over. Even when I was in third grade, I still watched it from time to time. I recently watched it again, simply because of nostalgia, and although the show was not intended for my age group (I am already a little more), I still found it interesting and informative. This show teaches good lessons about imagination and gets along well with others. Some parts I found quite interesting. In addition, there is no bad content in this show, so you can leave the children alone with this show and not worry that they will catch some bad language or something. I would recommend this.
