Oh, noir. My favorite genre: Continuing Otto Preminger in the film "Laura" is the film Noir, filmed in post-war New York, where corruption and violence flourish. Dana Andrews plays the role of Sergeant Mark Dixon, a detective whose brutal tactics provoked him in hot water with his superiors. <br /> <br /> When he accidentally kills a murder suspect, Dixon tries to put the blame on the crime boss of Tommy Scalis. Dixon is close to achieving his goal when he becomes associated with the dead man's wife, the beautiful Morgan Taylor. Of course, in a typical noir style, everything quickly goes uphill. <br /> <br /> Although the film does nothing interesting in terms of camera or narration, it still has a constant tone of fear and gloom. Like most great noirs, it also walks amazingly, drawing the viewer in from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> However, like most films that look like Preminger's films, I will not watch it again. He lacks Wilder's verbal wit, Hitchcock's visual brightness, or Wells's space experiments. As in Lang’s later work, “The Pavement” feels to a large extent a “clone” of what noir should be, and not something truly artistically authentic. <br /> <br /> There is nothing special about thematically in the film. We are talking about a policeman, who gradually becomes a criminal. In one scene, Dixon explains that his father himself was a little deceiver, the film flirts with the concept of predestination, but this scene is so far from Otto or dares to accept his ideas. <br /> <br /> Camera work is also disappointing. There is no intelligence in Otto's cell. No effort is made to assign a camera to anything. It does not play with space or architecture or enhances step-by-step police procedural action. It's just a tripod, in which the cart is inserted from time to time. It makes no sense, although most people do not care about these things. <br /> <br /> There is, however, one good shot where our hero is locked in a car full of gangsters (noir-cage), which itself sits in the transport elevator (another cage) and gets into the main gangster. the lair. Like Lynch's Blue Velvet, Otto repeatedly excuses the film, constantly likening hell to the top. It works well, but the scenery cannot enhance it. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - It seems that Otto is pleased with what noir is, following the Hawks pattern rather than toys with features in which noir can go. For example, “Circumvention”, “Night in the City”, “Scarlet Street”, “In a Lonely Place”, “Act of Violence”, “Bomberang” and “Johnny Eager”, “Where the Pavement ends”. made a second-level film noir. It is competent and attractive, but it lacks this extra special magic.
