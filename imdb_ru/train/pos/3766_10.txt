Visual creative epic with an inimitable style. <br /> <br /> In this film there can be neither the most alternative drama, nor the most artistic actor's play. But who dares say that this film is not art? I am not in favor of the idea that an important film should be serious, non-commercial, or bother me with questions. There are even a lot of films matching these features that I like. <br /> <br /> A fake trip, of course, not one of these films. What you get is pure, excessive creativity with a very positively charged children's energy. This film does not reflect reality. His friendly naive and utopian. Imagine the world of the future described by Rufus - for me it would be a good combination of time and place! Except for this music; -) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney is very well made. I always liked the cinematography and screenplays of this film. Especially at this point, Bogus Journey heads up his prequel to date. The effects are also good, and I think most of them are made without CGI. I generally prefer the good old effects in big budget films. I am sure that this is “just another Hollywood film” in the eyes of some people. But I think it is very charismatic. <br /> <br /> The short word to the soundtrack: the whole band and orchestral music fit very well into the film. Also, sound design has no shortage. I'm not a big fan of rock music, but I needed to get this track from Winger from the stage, where the “station” builds up an account and uses Ted's robots in the van. I love unorthodox camera work from the start. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I want to say the following: <br /> <br /> This film is very naive and very creative! It is much better than Pzeruskin, Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre than God’s anger. He is absolutely superior to citizen Kane, the Apocalypse now or Chris Markers without Soleil ... ... is it even better than Total Recall ... For nothing!? Yes of course! <br /> <br /> Bill and Ted's Fake Journey is simply the best movie ever. <br /> <br /> Whoever dares to disagree is guilty of “artistic behavior” or loves Terminator Salvation (which is more slander) <br /> <br /> PS: part 1 is not the best movie. So Bogus Jorney is an excellent sequel. Even Terminator 2 is not an excellent continuation! Is not!
