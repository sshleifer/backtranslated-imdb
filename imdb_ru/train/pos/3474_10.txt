This film is worth seeing one for the outstanding image of Jared Harris John Lennon. It doesn’t matter that Harris isn’t quite like Lennon; his manners, expressions, position, accent and attitude are pure Lennon. Best Stage: Lennon in a local cafe, verbally sparring with a stuttering fan, about whether Paul McCartney and Wings deserve "Stupid Love Songs" of status 1 in America.
