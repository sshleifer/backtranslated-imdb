Rich alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with the secretary Lauren Bacall. He marries her and is so happy that he quits drinking. However, Bacall is secretly loved by Stack Rock Hudsonâ€™s best friend. And the nymphomaniac Stefle, Dorothy Malone, longs for Rock. Add a few complications, and the film gets out of control (in a good sense of the word). <br /> <br /> A very glossy film in beautiful Technicolor with stunning fashion and furniture (first see the Bacall hotel room). They all look perfect and are dressed in beautiful, tight clothes. Basically this is a soap opera with class A production values. The story itself is very funny, and some of the dialogues are fun in the beginning. Playing Hudson, Stack and Bacall is not very good, but seeing them so young and glamorous is great ... especially Stack ... when he smiled, my knees were weak! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is fantastic - she deservedly won the best supporting actress for her role. She is sexy, brutal, vicious and responsive ... everything is convincing. <br /> <br /> Cheerful, glossy trash. Do not miss!
