I'm a big fan of John Denver. I have a large collection of his music on vinyl. I saw this Christmas special when it was originally on TV, and I liked it. I have the original vinyl album and CD. I have an original CD and a later release. A later release skips a few songs though. I see that it was released this year with all the original songs. To my surprise, I found an original CD for sale for $ 75. WOW - think that a Christmas disk would cost so much. For me, no amount worth selling this treasure. This is my favorite Christmas CD. I never managed to find it on a VHS or DVD. I would like to have any version. If anyone has one, please let me know. thank
