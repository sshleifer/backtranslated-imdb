I watched this movie about a year ago and found it completely funny. In my opinion, the real winner. It emphasized a silly comedy, but in fact there was a plot. In fact, very similar to the popular comedy, Elf. There were some serious moments, sandwiched between fun. When Stiller shot Black's horse, usually a sober moment, you laughed at his awkward antics. In fact, you can find a common language there, as I am sure that many people did something that I wouldn’t want a friend to know about it, so that your friendship would not end. <br /> <br /> When I found out how much people didn’t like this film, I was completely stunned. The fact that such terrible films like Napoleon Dynamite had a rating higher than makes me think about the sanity of people on IMDb. Take my advice and rent it. If you laugh at least once, I will refund your rent. = D
