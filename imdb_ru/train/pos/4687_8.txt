“Love crimes” by Lizzie Borden is an important film about the dark side of female sexuality (including full frontal female nudity, which undoubtedly surpasses the male). He flirts with sadomasochism and a prisoner in love with the invader theory. <br /> <br /> This attitude towards female libido is sometimes superficial and abrupt, but Borden overcomes much more than the feminist dogma about women gaining strength due to their insatiable lust. <br /> <br /> One striking scene exposes a female fetish on horseback when an antagonist, a counterfeit fashion photographer, seduces an elderly woman in breeches, asking her to show how she is riding a horse. He thrusts horse riding between her legs, pressing her against the crotch, and this greatly increases her excitement. <br /> <br /> Then he suddenly leaves her house, and she curses abruptly at the closed door. <br /> <Patrick Bergin plays a crook, and although he falls far from a handsome man, he clings to simple Jaynes and has enough screen presence to make him believe that women can swallow his line. Judging by all reports, Sean Young is a strange man, and she is hardly beautiful. Yet in this film, as a district attorney, her intense face and slender body with long limbs and underlined hips and occasionally severed movement alchemize into an erotic charm. Her performance is powerful and complex. <br /> <br /> Borden has an intriguing worldview, and I really appreciate the fact that he is in conflict with today's mediocre spirit of the times.
