Dumland is not for everyone. In fact, Dumbland can be for anyone except Lynch, and that makes him a funny and collective cartoon. Violent? Yes. Indecent? Yes. Absurd? Yes. A piece of trash? Never. Dumland is a wonderful picture of some Americans who have no brains and who beat their wife and children for fun. From Mexico I can say that I like it! My favorite episodes: 1. My teeth are bleeding, all the noise around and violence makes me want to scream and put me behind the bed. 2- Take a stick! Yes, baby, take this and learn a lesson: some people will never be grateful for your actions. 3- Ants. Especially Lynch episode of everything, music, surrealism and a very sweet revenge ...
