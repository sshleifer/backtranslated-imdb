Thereâ€™s been a lot of shit out of Hollywood lately. <br /> <br /> A friend, from time to time, sends me films, surprisingly enough. <br /> <br /> I turned it on and couldn't stop watching, this is drama, but with a strange twist. Imagine that Romeo, like Shekpir, had a superpower. It is sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood should pay attention to the new Russian cinema, they tell stories that are not about big explosions and cgi. It takes a simple basic premise and tells a story, without spectacle. It is very similar to an Asian film with a dark Russian twist. Of course, this is not perfect, but nothing happens. You know what power is, but it is never explained and not fully understood until the end. This becomes secondary to the emotions of the story. I do not want to see a remake, it is too cool, the Hollywood system, as usual, will spoil it. Act at the highest level all around. Directing and working with the camera is much higher than most crap. Kudos to all involved, and I will convey many people to this independent epic. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find me, look it up.
