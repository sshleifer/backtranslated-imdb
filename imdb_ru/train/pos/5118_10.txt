******** Spoilers - careful ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I am biased when it comes to Urban Cowboy. I love it and watch it countless times - and usually I find out something new about it with every view. <br /> <br /> I like this: Urban Cowboy is people from the working class. not rich people who live in Los Angeles or New York. Well, that's true, except for Pam. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays Bud, a little boy from Texas who moves to Houston to work on oil fields. And it was then that Travolta actually played in good dramatic films, such as Saturday Night Fever, instead of playing stereotypical bad guys / good guys in big budget films. This is a really good movie - mechanical bull riding and two-stage dancing can be silly, but you have to enjoy it for what it is. <br /> <br /> Bad meets Sissy (played by Debra Winger with slutty brilliance) - and soon after that they are married and live in the trailer of their dreams. But their relationship turns into a real battle of the sexes. Bad wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be with a real cowboy. But nowadays, male roles are not so clear. Where can Bad prove that he is a real man? He can do his dangerous work during the day and ride at night on a mechanical bull — he can be a “city cowboy.” But Sissy wants to drive her pickup, and she also wants to ride a mechanical bull. So where does this leave Bud? When Sissy declares her independence, she lies about riding the bull and flirting with the former felon and rodeo prison star - a real bull rider - Wes (who Scott Glenn played incredibly bold). Badu is threatened, and Bad and Sissy break up. <br /> <br /> Sissy lingered with Wes, who insults her. Continuing to lose weight, Bad becomes a toy boy, Pam, a rich girl, whose dad is in oil and everything connected with him. Sissy comes to the trailer to clean it - Pam does nothing of the kind. She writes a letter with a fake Bud, but the evil Pam breaks it and takes responsibility for Sissy's homework. <br /> <br /> Uncle Buda Bob tragically dies at work when strikes and causes an explosion. Bad and Sissy have a chance of reconciliation, but they are too stubborn. Later, the mechanical bull rides are held by Gilly, and you know that Bad wins. Pam realizes that Bud doesn't love her, but Sissy - he did it for her. Wes is trying to rob Gillis, but don't you know that the urban cowboy, Bud, saves the day and plays the woman he loves? <br /> <br /> Of course, you can ask yourself why Bad and Sissy will go to Gillis about every night and live like pigs. Maybe it contributed to their bad marriage. Or why Bad didn't stay with Pam - she wasn't so bad and had money. Or why they should have killed Uncle Bob. Or why did Bud and Sissi have such stupid friends like Marshall and Jesse who always tried to separate them: Marshall says to Bud: “She (Sissi) rides this bull better than you!” But part of the fun from Urban Cowboy makes a bit this - and says, isn’t Bonnie Reitt on stage!
