I was too young to ever know a lot about a prince, but in the past few years I have seen a lot of Purple Rain T-shirts and I thought they were cool, but I didnâ€™t want to buy a shirt I didn't know about. So, once on Saturday, he appeared on a fuse, and I decided to watch it. I did not know what the film would be about before I watched it, but it was great when I found out about it. In the film, the prince was known not as a prince, but as a "child." All the performances in which I liked, but my favorite was Purple Rain, Darling Nicki, and I will die for you. All the songs related to what happened in the film, when his mother and father always struggled with the song, when the pigeons were crying, they described what he felt. I also like how clever the prince was in the way he flirted with Apallonia. I liked it when Prince and Appallonia first met at the club, and he stood behind her, and then, when she turned around, he disappeared! great movie and now i can't even find one of these t-shirts :(
