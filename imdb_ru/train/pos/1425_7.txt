Directed by Alastair Photogill and Mark Linfield also remind us that Al Gore struck us with his painfully honest and slyly presented documentary The Inconvenient Truth and reminded us that the time had come to improve our way of life in order to save our beautiful planet. "Planet Earth" is also a warning signal that the global warming of our planet has disastrous consequences for all living creatures around the world. Al Gore showed us the grim future of planet Earth, presenting irrefutable facts, supported by documented examples, with the help of long, but always interesting monologues. The creators of this documentary choose another, but no less powerful way to do it. They do not give us a future idea of ​​what can happen to our planet if we do not radically change things around, but they rather show us the true beauty of planet Earth in all its amazing glory. We see places that we knew existed, but never thought they could be so beautiful. In this film, we see many of the most unusual places, such as abandoned deserts, gigantic forests, full of fauna and flora and ice landscapes, as far as the eye could see. And in all these very different environments we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive. <br /> <br /> This is exactly the film that had to be made, in conjunction with the film from Al Gore, in order to make us understand that our planet is too precious to interfere. Patrick Stewart's voiceover is always relaxing and therefore very well done, although at first it sounded like I was watching the movie “X-Men” instead! Cinematography is perhaps the most wonderful thing about this documentary. From time to time: what you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that the man with the camera really had to shoot all these amazing shots. <br /> <br /> In short: it is certainly necessary for everyone as it applies to every person on this beautiful planet Earth! The truth is, I never thought that our planet was so amazingly beautiful!
