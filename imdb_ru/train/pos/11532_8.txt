Well, it was one of those films that I accidentally made, and it was good enough for me to record when it will appear next time ... If, like me, you like many 80s horror films that branch out a bit from the norm (that is, not just another abundance of common sequels), then I think you can enjoy it. When the bad guy finally arrives, he is definitely not the one I expected to see! In general, I would not give up on this, but if you like this genre, look at it, if it appears, and you have an hour and a half to kill, I think. I would give 6.5 out of 10.
