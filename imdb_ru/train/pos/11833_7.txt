The white man + progress + industrialization = BAD. First nations + nature + animals = OK. Simple formula. In fact, in the past, the same propaganda was used to defend the status quo; Now he is used to attack him. However, as they say, I think that the film really overcomes the hackneyed politicization, because it plays on themes of freedom and originality in a way that attracts everyone. You may not be apart from the trash revisionism of a film about how the West was won and lost. But anyone can feel a sense of longing for the days when horses could freely run on the western plains. (The film also conveniently circumvents the fact that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there). Anyway, I liked it. The quality of the animation - especially the first frame - is incredible.
