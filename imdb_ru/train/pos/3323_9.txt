I got this movie about a month ago, and now I'm a fanatic Drew Barrymore. I love a happy ending, and this film gives a brilliant film with the truth of the Red Sox! This is a math teacher who takes promising children on a math trip to a company where successful Lindsay (Drew) shows them some information. This then leads to Ben (teacher) and Lindsey dating. But it's not that simple when he admits that he is a big fan of the Red Sox. <br /> <br /> First of all, everything is fine, but then his baseball interferes with Lindsey's life. In the end, everything is fine, and it took one shot to make Drew run across the field !! I got it for two pounds in blockbusters, so I was happy. If you like these movies, I suggest you watch some more Drew's work, such as Charlie's Angels and 50 first dates, or even her new film with Hugh Grant in Music and Lyrics.
