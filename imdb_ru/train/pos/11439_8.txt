Good - as far as 2 versions of this film. The creation involved 2 people - John Corti and Bill Cowtery (George was just a producer - he really could not say anything like that in the film - just helped with money) - an adult version of Bill Cuteri became possible. John Corti did not like and did not approve this version (as was done behind his back). Due to the failure of Ladd's films, they did not advertise this film and threw all their advertising money at The Right Stuff, hoping that it would pull them; ... and this did not happen. So, this movie never had a chance. When Twice did it via cable (HBO), they showed videos from Bill’s version, and John threatened to sue if he was shown more (did you notice that the “adult” version wasn’t turned on for a very long time?). Showtime received a “clean” version. The version on videotape and laser disc is a version approved by John (which has more power than Bill). It is a pity, because the “adult” version is actually better and makes more sense. But it is VERY doubtful that he will ever be released in this version on DVD (or in any format other than bootleg). Sorry to disappoint everyone. I know all this information, since I was the president of Twice Upon A Time fan club (numerous materials from the film are still stored - he used to have an adult version in his mailbox, but it was stolen - only to have a partial copy of HBO now ). 8 stars for the "adult" version - 5 for the "clean" version. Any other questions just ask.
