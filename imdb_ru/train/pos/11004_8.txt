In the near future, an ordinary suspicious person in the suburb of Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) will be hired by the huge Digicorp corporation, which will be appointed as a spy and steals secrets from its competitors, Sunways. While training, Morgan is brainwashed, he takes on a new personality from Jack Terby and travels to boring lectures. In one of them, the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu) approaches him, who advises him that everything is not as it seems. Morgan recognizes a new reality in which he does not know who to trust. <br /> <br /> Unknown Cypher was a big surprise for me. This film was not released in Brazil, but the exciting and exciting story is quite complex, with a lot of plot moments, with an excellent script, directing and performances. In the very last corner, I remembered Arnold Schwarzenegger's Total Recall. This film certainly deserves to be watched more than once, and I really did not like the last scene, when an independent spy has a controversial disc in the sea. Known only director Vicenzo Natalie from the fantastic "Cuba", and this second work, which I see, is also amazing. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): not available
