The classic Otto Preminger noir works almost like the back side of LAURA ... while this film was brilliant and shows off the popular Clifton Webb, this film looks much worse. Dana Andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to permanently associate him with the father of his girlfriend. Preminger allows you to move quickly, so that errors in logic are easily overlooked. With Andrews, everything is in order (much less wooden than he was in the past), and stunningly beautiful Jean Tirney is amazingly beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays a hapless victim. WHERE THE END OF VEHICLES is a must-have and terrific addition to the equally sinister WHIRLPOOL Preminger (also with Tierney in the lead role).
