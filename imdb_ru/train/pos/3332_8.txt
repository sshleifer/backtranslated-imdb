Yes, a commitment. Suppose Fever Pitch can make you believe that this is a baseball movie. <br /> <br /> But no, you don’t have to be a baseball fan to truly enjoy this picture from Farrelly Brothers. But, of course, if you are alone, you will enjoy it even more; with all the references (I would say, fairly accurate) to the Boston Red Sox and its bittersweet story; from the Bambino Curse and everything attributed to him, including those two words that you CAN'T say to a Boston fan: Bill Buckner. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon portray two people who usually have a second thought about getting into a relationship: a successful workaholic who is also rich in meeting a schoolteacher? The fact is that the Fallon character wins the heart of Barrymore, being funny, caring, sweet and completely flawless. But her friends ask her a logical question: if he is such a keeper, why is he still on the market? Enter the Boston Red Sox. He has been so committed to his team since his uncle handed him tickets for the season to the Sox; he never missed the Red Sox home game at Fenway Park for a long time. <br /> <br /> And this delicate balance, how much a workaholic is ready to pay for the obsession of his boyfriend; and as far as this crazy baseball teacher is willing to compromise, to save ANOTHER love of his life, what the whole movie is about. <br /> <br /> At first you might think that the sports obsession of the movie is exaggerated for comic relief. Well, I am sad to admit that it is not. I, as a staunch fan of the Houston Astros, I can say that they are all true. I would try in every possible way to see every Stros game; listen to them on the radio or follow them online. I read the sports section of the Chronicles every day. And yes, my room looks like The Shed, a gift shop Minute Maid Park; with a wardrobe full of Astros gear, including 5 jerseys, 20 T-shirts and everything else you know. Fallon’s character even has a MasterCard Red Sox MBNA. <br /> <br /> Fallon was fairly believable as a fanatical supporter of the Red Sox, even though he could handle it without becoming a cartoon (thank God, Adam Sandler wasn't in it); and the plot revolved around how the couple tried to cope with each other’s passions. <br /> <br /> I would say that it will be a classic romantic comedy. It is not enough to be among the best films in history; but it certainly breaks down the genre and attracts both men and women.
