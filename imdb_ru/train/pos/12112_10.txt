The premise of this anime series is about bread, about all the things on which the plot is built! I really laughed. The main character has a special power for making bread, with which he was born, and he goes to the school of bread baking. I would like it to be available on DVD, and it doesn’t matter if it is subtitled or dubbed - it’s so good. Even the song itself is funny. At some point in the theme song there is an African-Japanese man with an afro on horseback, wielding a French baguette, as if it were a samurai sword. These images will not make sense if you do not see the anime. You will laugh as long as your parties do not hurt. This is definitely the most unique anime I've ever seen.
