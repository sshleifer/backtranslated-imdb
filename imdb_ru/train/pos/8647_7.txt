If it is assumed that this is an image of an American serial killer, then it looks like a clearly average one. <br /> <br /> A journalist [Spiritual] travels across the country to California to document America’s most famous killers, not knowing that one of his white trailer satellites [Pitt] is a serial killer himself. <br /> <br /> Predictably everywhere, there are moments of action, and Pitt and Lewis paint their roles well, but I wouldn’t watch it again.
