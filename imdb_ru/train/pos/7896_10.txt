This is a GREAT example of the early talent of Bette Davis. Production is above average for the period of 1936. I can not understand why the owners of the rights to this film did not put it on DVD. Owners, PLEASE, PLEASE, release. I would buy it immediately. I have not seen him for more than thirty years on TV, but I remember well.
