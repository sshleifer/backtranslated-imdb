This film took a lot of space. It was scheduled by critics when it came out and was blamed for destroying Nicholas Cage’s career. I do not think that people understand that this is not an epic film, claiming to be Oscar in the film, but simply some kind of brilliant action “Bruke-baster” at its best. Fast cars, fast editing and a great soundtrack - this is exactly what is written on the tin can. In addition, for those who love cars, this is pure pleasure. Everything is here: Ferrari, Mercs, Hummer and let's not forget Eleanor! I think that it will be difficult for you to find the best fighter, and personally the best movie in general !! Again, maybe it's just me!
