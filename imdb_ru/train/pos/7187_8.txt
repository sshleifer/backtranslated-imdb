The series was a short story, originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film, which was associated with the serialization of fiction in the magazine "Pulp". Known as “chapters,” they were extended films broken up into several segments called “chapters” or “episodes.” Each chapter will be shown in the same theater for one week. The series would have ended as a cliffhanger, since the hero and heroine would be in the last dangerous situation from which there was no way out. <br /> <br /> The audience had to return next week to see how the hero and heroine would run away again and fight the villain. TV shows were especially popular with children, and for many children in the first half of the 20th century, typical Saturday films included at least one series, as well as cartoons, newsreels, and two feature films. <Br /> <br /> The golden age for serials was 1936-1945. It was one of the best in the era. <br /> <br /> Zorro has been seen in many films, but Reed Hadley (“Rocket Squad”, “Immortal Brain”) coped well with the role. <br /> <The action is permanent, and we lead chapter after chapter to the final goal, where we will know the identity of the villain. <br /> <br /> Zorro triumphs, as always.
