Love Rosario Dawson, think that she is one of the best actresses of the modern era. <br /> <br /> It seems that the descent is more about self-confidence than anything else. This is a consistent subtext throughout the film. The dialogue is flat, the characters seem intentionally soft and one-sided. The only sequence is the representation of self-confidence in the characters and the way of Rosario from self-confidence to the loss of inspiration and back. <br /> <br /> Serving this as a classic of rape is inappropriate, and it’s probably why so many people don’t enjoy the movie. The standard audience of "rape" will not like this film, or maybe this is the essence? The film asks more questions than it answers, and it faces a target audience, whether they like it or not. There is a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience, and although the film does not slap the viewers with self-assured audacity, it attracts the viewer for one reason or another, for all the wrong reasons. <Br /> <br /> Descent is a good film, which, in his opinion, is greatly underestimated.
