I just saw it at the Toronto Film Festival, and I hope it gets widespread because I want to see it again! This is a character-driven movie, and Andrew and David are more than up to the task. Any discussion of the plot can be considered as spoilers, so I’ll just say that the storyline is clever, great game and amazing effects. Well shot and with good speed. One of the best films I've seen in recent years, and very refreshing in this boring summer of <br /> <br /> films. The audience laughed all the time. See if you can. (I especially liked the “Candy bar! Candy bar!” Scene.)
