The stack should have won an Oscar for this performance, period. This is a crime that he did not. It's amazing how he humanizes a rich, worthless character. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone did receive an Oscar deserved for her work. In fact, all the action in this film is excellent. <br /> <br /> The plot begins with a trip by taxi, then by plane, and then continues on an emotional trip that will interest you in everything. You will be entertained! <br /> <br /> However, this is just a frank soap opera. One-dimensional, one hundred percent. You might call it absolute dull, because the action so thoroughly conquers the material. He acted perfectly, well directed, but strictly in his soap genre. I would not even call it a melodrama (for example, "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of life"). Without denying the immense entertainment value of this film, you can only imagine what this talented actor and director could achieve with a more substantial theme.
