... but I still enjoyed the show. I read some comments that previous reviewers had to say about this show, and itâ€™s hard for me to completely nullify all the criticism in my head (except one thing: that the show was outdated; this program was NOTHING but not fresh). Many things people argue with about this show are about money: pretentious; forced; excited; desperately need attention; self-satisfied; annoying ubiquitous narrative. But you know what? I really liked it. It was different, it was original, it really, really TRIED; and this compensated for all the disadvantages. The show was bright, verbal, fast, witty, interesting, interesting to watch ... you know, it was only once a week, I could take it once a week, look forward to and enjoy it. I will mourn his passing. But I think no one will bring it back to life.
