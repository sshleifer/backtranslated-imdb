Every time I watch this film, Iâ€™m more impressed with the whole production. I came to the conclusion that this is the best romantic comedy in history. All participants are perfect; script, action, direction, recruiting, and editing. Although James Stewart can always rely on a good performance, and the cast is great, Margaret Sullavan shows what actress she was underestimated. Her tragic personal life makes her performer's sharpness, which is not easy to achieve comedic skills. Lyubich managed to get the best, and he obviously did his best. Watch for the number of scenes that were made in one take - breathtaking.
