First, speaking not as a fan of the genre, Bourne's Ultimatum is an exciting, virtuoso, excellent action movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this is stupid malaria from cartoon superheroes. <br /> Thirdly, the film contains a complex, important point about how crime fighters turn into criminals themselves. No reference is made to Abu Ghraib or to outrageous internal atrocities on the part of the executive branch of constitutional rights; this is not necessary. <br /> <br /> So, the last of the Bourne series in the hands of Paul Greengrass (from The Bourne Supremacy 2004 and last year’s United 93) is a significant achievement that may be held back, but in fact does not decrease due to the inevitable excesses of the genre. <br /> <br /> Above, “Awesome Spirit” is meant as a welcoming adjective and description of physical sensation: for more than an hour after the first frame, the viewer seems to hold his breath, starting from the chair by the force of an unrelenting rushing around the globe, completely suspended action. There is no frustration, no change in the rhythm and strength of the film, and yet it never becomes monotonous and tedious, as some related music videos do in just a couple of minutes. <br /> <br /> Inliver Wood The cinema “your face” best uses the script by Tony Gilroy from the 1990 novel by Robert Ludlum (which doesn’t fit well with Bourne's Identity, written a decade earlier). <br /> <br /> One day, Matt Damon was again the inevitable, irreplaceable Born, the most lethal of the agents of the CIA Fantasy, this time capturing the entire agency in search of his personality, his past, and the mysterious agency program that turned him into a killing machine. Nothing like his quiet hero Edward R. Marrow, always the bewildering David Strathairn, a nasty high-ranking official of the agency who spoke out against Bourne in an attempt to hide some kind of illegal policy of "take without captives" and cruel procedures. <br /> <br /> Joan Allen plays what seems like a good cop, against the bad Strathrain. And Julia Styles as an agent, again came to the aid of Born; The combination of Greengrass direction and Stiles' actions leads to the surprising influence of a mostly silent character, her lack of communication and vague expression is more intriguing than melee dialogue. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum is so good that it comes off the old bit of “one man against the world,” this time stretched to ridiculous excesses because Born challenges the limitations of geography, time, gravity ... and physics generally. (Can you fly in the opposite direction by car from the top of the building? Why not - it looks great.) <br /> <br /> All this "real" magic jumps from country to country in seconds, to arrive at some unknown place, in the same way as when and how necessary - surpasses incredible effects with special effects and superheroes. And yet, only an ignorant pedant would allow “facts” to interfere with the entertainment-based ecstasy of the Bourne fantasy.
