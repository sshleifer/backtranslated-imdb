I must say, this film gave me a dual personality. I was told again and again "CLOSE" and start talking like a normal person. But it is very hard ... no Van. Did you find it disgusting and disrespectful? Well, the mood is much greater. This movie is just dirty! This is not a movie to show your grandparents, but you have to show it to a teenager or an immature guy in your workplace. Anyway, back to the vocal manners. Fortunately, there is a Lady on this site (someone in the studio noticed that there must be an apostrophe (?) Between e and s), so you can always say something nice to your boss or policeman. I have a sheet in my wallet.
