Soulful movie. The usual great game of John Tay, which recently passed. A man who has always been so humble. He was one of Englandâ€™s top 10 actors, of course, of my time. <br /> <br /> He can be remembered for his famous role as Inspector Morse. Like Jack Regan in the popular 1970 television series Sweeney and as a lawyer in Cavana QC. Be sure to look for the whole family and a great DVD for my collection. Filming will remind people who remember Britain in wartime and, of course, those who were evacuated from London to avoid German bombings. The interaction between the two main characters. Tom and boy William really acted well and faithful to the book by Michelle Magorian.
