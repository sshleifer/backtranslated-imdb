I was 16 years old when I first saw the film, and he was always my HUGE favorite. Of course, you can not deny the attractiveness of Christofferson in the film - HOW WELL IS THIS MAN ???????????? Sheesh. He is still there. He is a bad boy who every woman secretly wants. His game is flawless. He played a drunk / drug addict just in the way that someone who actually went through it could - and he did - in 76 he finally got into the wagon, so it was all very real. <br /> <br /> Music is GREAT, and although in later years I thought that Streisand was not the right person for him in terms of physical beauty, I think this is more of a problem for male viewers than for women. We girls just look at Chris - and, naturally, the guys look at women's interest - my husband can't watch a movie about her - he doesn't like her looks. But I made him sit only at the red Ferrari stage on the road near the end, so that he could see how well it was done - the camera work was so perfect, and you were completely in the car with him with amazing music - you should see it on my 50-inch plasma is WOW !!!! And finally, the transmission quality was GREAT — the widescreen anamorphic image was really sharp, with excellent color and very low noise, except for dark areas, which is normal for the entire film. <br /> <br /> Having returned to me wonderful memories that my mother and I loved this film very much, I bought a copy for her for Christmas. I would really like to see her with her last night. <br /> <br /> I’m trying to discuss the original with Judy Garland, but I think having seen it first, I just can’t get into an earlier era. Viewing all the concert frames in the 76 version was so similar to the fact that I lived in time. <br /> <br /> I’m working on Streisand’s comments, but she seems to be talking only about herself and Ongs, so far she has barely mentioned Chris or details about the scenes in the film. Her voice sounds exactly the same as then. <br /> <br /> Look, if you grew up in the same era as me (born in 1960), you will like it. <br /> <br /> Wendy
