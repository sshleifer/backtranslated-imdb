Well, after a long wait after watching a few clips on Bravo's “100 most terrible movie moments”, I waited a long time to see this movie. The plot was simple, beautiful model Alison Parker (Christina Raines) moved to a residential building, which is the gateway to hell. "Sentinel" is a terrible downward film, even if it is a little slow. This is a mix of "Signs and Rosemary." The game is good, and there are some really disturbing bits, such as the awkward orgy scene with a dead father and a plump woman in the middle of an orgy eating a cake and laughing. The end is a strange mixture of deformed people and cannibals. It's very strange, but in the end, I really believe in a great movie! One of my favorites from the 70s, even if there is nothing particularly original about it. This is strange and very creepy! Probably one of my favorites for all time. 9/10
