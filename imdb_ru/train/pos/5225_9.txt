I think this film is a very funny film and one of the best films about National Lampoon's, it also has a very catchy title, which basically sums up what the whole movie is about ... People in white !!!! This story is a fake of many films, including Will Smith’s movie, you guessed it, People in Black. I will not give an end, but he has a very good end, very funny (Leslie Nielsen-style humor) from beginning to end, especially a little closer to the beginning, when you are outside, collecting garbage cans (garbage cans). In addition, in this scene they also have a pretty cool truck with a trash can (garbage truck). Acting is not great, in fact, it is not very good, but this is what makes the movie funny, it's a comedy, relax !! I like the storyline, partly because it is so far-fetched, and partly because it is interesting to see how thin (or should not be thin) they tear down all the other films. I'm a big fan of frivolous fake movies, but I'm also a fan of real things, and with these films it’s hard to decide which is better, the film that it mostly breaks (mentioned earlier in this review) or the movie itself, but when you shoot comedy films, it is even more difficult, but this film successfully copes. Two scavengers are so funny, it reminds me of a television sketch show in the UK called Little Britain. This film is a must-have for your collection and is one of the best, most entertaining, funny, best storylines of the National Lampoon movie to date !!
