Dick Tracy is the best comic strip movie ever made. The film is like a comic strip, staying true to the color scheme. Batman series rose, fell, rose again and fell. Dick Tracy has true endurance, which can be enjoyed by both adults and children. The good guys triumph over evil, without blood and blood, in order to understand the essence. Al Pacino copes with his own adaptation of the “Big Boy Caprice”, and Madonna is remembered as “Breath”. But the best work to date is Warren Beatty, who embodies Dick Tracy just as he did with Clyde Burrows. I can't wait for it to be released on DVD on April 2, 2002, my tape is exhausted.
