When I first learned that Brian Krause would be in this film, I wanted to watch. It took me weeks to realize that I had seen the original of it and loved it. So I had even more reasons to watch. Well, I watched. It was actually better than most sequels for television films. I hate what happens to Brian's character (you can find out for yourself), and I didn't like most of the characters, including Brian. But the film needed funny, annoying and twitchy characters to make Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine again. In the end, I rooted for Stanley and his own happy ending. If you liked the original “Lake Hut” or if you like horror movies without blood, I would advise you to watch it.
