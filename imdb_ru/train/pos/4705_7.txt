All those who voted for less than 5 are obviously not fans of pure, mocking humor. Keaton is great in this - as in most of his works. This is not a blockbuster, it's more life. This is an extraordinary humorous humor, played by some of the best (and very versatile) actors in Hollywood. Piscopo was equally at altitude, as was the best dog that once loved. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the most ridiculous attempt not damned, ever filmed, you should see how Dmitri made his work as Morone. <Br /> <br /> I gave him 7.
