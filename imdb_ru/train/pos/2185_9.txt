Poor Basil Rathbone, a selfish composer who lost his muse. He faked it for some time, buying his lyrics and music from various sources. The problem is that two sources (Bing Crosby's music) and (Mary Martin's words) meet and fall in love by chance. And then they discover what they are doing. Complications begin, but in the end everything is corrected. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin sing horribly. Mary signed a contract with Paramount and at the same time doubled as a regular member of the Krosby Kraft Music Hall radio show. For reasons that I don’t understand, the film’s viewers didn’t accept it, so she returned to Broadway and did One Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. <br /> <br /> Vasily Rathbone once played a comedy in one of the few times he does it very well. His ego is constantly discouraged by his assistant Oscar Levant, and again I am surprised that they did not make more films together. <br /> <br /> As with most Crosby Paramount cars, there are no large episodes, but I agree with the previous reviewer about the title melody as an improvised jam session at a pawnshop. Good job everyone. <br /> <br /> Amazingly original plot and great entertainment.
