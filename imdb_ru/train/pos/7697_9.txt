This is another great movie that I was lucky to see on the big screen for the first time (thanks to Rick Baker and others). Back in the late 80s I was a relative newcomer to the genre and only really new in the big three of JC, SH & YB. I was not sure what to expect when I paid my hard-earned money to see it in the “Triple Score Classics” in the old Scala. I don't have to worry, I was suffocated by this film. If you are a fan of a Hong Kong action movie / kung fu and have not seen this movie, do it now!
