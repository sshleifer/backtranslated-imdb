Some people claim that in the 11th season in South Park, there was a tendency to leave their politically biting satire for minor parodies; but it could not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> Although this episode fakes the Living Dead series, there are others. This is a satire about how people relate to the homeless. Characters say things like “They pretend to be like us” or “They want to be human.” This episode attacks the culture of people who ignore the lower classes, who are often just losers. <br /> <br /> So yes, this is still a satire, as well as a great deception. What else do you want?
