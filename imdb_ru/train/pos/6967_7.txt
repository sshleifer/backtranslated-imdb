A prequel to the new series Battlestar Galactica, from the same creative team of Ronald D. Moore and David Eyck, as well as from the creator of the new series Remy Obubon. Caprica is located in twelve colonies about 58 years before the events of Battlestar Galactica. The new series, in addition to the human drama, also describes the key steps in the development of what will become the Cylon race. <br /> <br /> The pilot and the series must follow two families; Graystone includes Daniel (Eric Stolz), a computer genius and corporate tycoon, and his equally brilliant, but rebellious daughter, Zoya (Alessandra Torreson), while Adama is composed of Joseph (Esai Morales), a lawyer, and his son William, the future admiral of Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica, the series features some great experienced actors Eric Stolz, Esai Morales and Polly Walker, as well as some very talented relatively new actors, including Alessandra Torreson and Magda Apanovich. <br /> <br /> For Battlestar Gallactica fans, there are similarities and continuity with this series, but it is also very different. In the experiment, at least, there are elements of science fiction, but they constitute a smaller part of this series. Scenes on Caprica, reflecting a more technologically advanced society, also have a retro feeling, this is achieved through some architecture, costumes and the way they are shot. <br /> <br /> Although the look and feel of the two shows some significant differences in the series, some of the themes will seem very familiar, religion is very important here again, while the racial theme, rarely addressed in BG, is much more important. We are also concerned with terrorism, having a soul and having a car, as well as issues related to crime and government. <br /> <br /> The pilot was released directly on DVD in an extended version and un-rated before being broadcast on television, the series should start in 2010. <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica, this series is filmed in Vancouver.
