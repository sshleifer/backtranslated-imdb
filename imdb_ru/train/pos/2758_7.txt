This film is about an incredible friendship between a businessman and a man with Down syndrome. <br /> <br /> Character development in this film is excellent. We believe that Harry is a businessman who neglects his family, and Georges is an innocent person who longs for love and care from a “normal” society. Acting well, and the award for the best male role in Cannes is well deserved. <br /> <br /> The fantasy scenes in the film underline the fact that Georges is suffering because of his rejection of the family and wants to be treated like a normal person. A song that is replayed also reinforces this message. The film shows that people with mental disabilities are good-natured. We treated them with discrimination and disregard - a fact that is emphasized by the scene where Georges gives a gift to the waitress in the kitchen). If we can understand and share the world of these people, both we and the mentally retarded can become very happy. <br /> <br /> I was so passionate about the film and the emotional experiences of the characters. This is a touching film for good-natured souls.
