Someone who whined that this film was shit or that it had no plot was probably looking for Jean de Florette. HELLO! this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves the plot in any form or form. I would also like to remind these whiners that if you are going to snatch the shit out of this film, they seem to be missing the point. This film is clearly created for people who do not appreciate the so-called "American humor", which seems to me just a bunch of dirty crap. The bottom line is that everyone has their own opinion, and you should be a little more grateful if some people have a sense of humor that doesnâ€™t coincide with your own before you brush it off. <br /> <br />
