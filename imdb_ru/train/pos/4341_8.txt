Who has no unresolved problems with their parents? And which parents do not have unresolved problems with each other? <br /> <br /> I know it sounds hard. But it is played for laughter in a film that makes both comedy better and drama better. I always liked Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a little worried that their star qualities might be too great for a small film, I was fascinated from the very first scene. <br /> <br /> Particularly interesting were the discoveries that the son makes about his father as a person. And Peter Falk's monologue about being hardworking, sacrificing father and husband, was the perfect balance. If this scene were not so good, the film would have seemed much less nuanced, and the character much less interesting. <br /> <br /> Great, Paul and Peter!
