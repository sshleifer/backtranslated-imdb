My Take: dumb but creative mess. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves (yes! This is Keanu Reeves) and Alex Winter return as two idiots of punk rock in this sequel of the adventure comedy “Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,” now a cult classic. In this sequel, Bill and Ted give a lot more than travel through time. With the same success they can travel to heaven and hell! At the beginning of this sequel, Bill and Ted are preparing for the Battle of Groups competition, which can make them more famous than ever. Meanwhile, for many years in a futuristic civilization, the wizard of time from the first film (always watchable George Carlin) directs the university, praising the names of Bill and Ted. There the evil tyrant (Joss Ackland, from THE HUNT FOR RED October) plans to get rid of two stupid rock stars once and for all. Therefore, he sends two identical copies of the android (according to Bill and Ted: Robot Usa) to do the dirty work. <br /> <br /> After that, Bill and Ted survive death and must find their way through hell, residents who include the worst memories of a duet, and then through heaven in an attempt to return to earth to save their girlfriends .. and their shows. In this tormented journey, they play board games with only Death (William Sadler, from DIE HARD 2), reminiscent of a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film “SEVENTH SEAL”, help from a pair of intelligent alien creatures and much more. <br /> <br /> BOGUS JOURNEY’s plethora of tricks with special effects do not meet modern standards, and even some of the humor and modern look are somewhat outdated. To be honest, the film also seems to be released in the wrong year, even in the 90s). But with a considerable lack of imagination and a lively turn both in performances and in direction, BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is fun, creative and yes, false. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 of 5
