I first saw this film in my childhood and recently purchased it on DVD. <br /> <br /> James Stewart talks very deeply about the role of Chip Hardest, the hard-working and dedicated FBI agent. His life in the Bureau intersects with his family life, which is not so rosy. His wife (beautiful image of Faith Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his work, and they even part for a while; Chip's best friend and colleague Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) died in a shootout; Chip's son, Mike, was enrolled in the Marines during World War II. Despite all this, the family continues with courage and dignity. <br /> <br /> The sequence of actions is quite fascinating, and the semi-documentary style of the film works effectively. And the music of Max Steiner speaks about everything; Loyalty, courage and honesty. <br /> <br /> This country is very indebted to the men and women of the FBI and, of course, to J. Edgar Hoover. If Mr. Hooverâ€™s vigilance had been observed, we could have been spared 9/11, a surge of crimes against children and many corrupt politicians with whom we had to put up with his death.
