According to critics and spectators, BIRTHDAY should have been a big fat clinker. However, since I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent it last night. It turned out to be quite worthy to watch. Of course, this is not your mainstream American comedy, and you don't need to be a genius to understand that this is a very British film, but that is why I liked it. It was a change from all the other films around, a breath of fresh air. Of course, there were some holes in the plot, but on the whole it worked. First, Kidman was again great in a completely different, not very showy, but still quite sexual role. She just goes on to prove that she is one of the best talents in Hollywood. Not only is her Russian accent, when she speaks English, effective, but there are cases when she has long conversations in Russian, and if you didn't know that it was Nicole Kidman, you would never question her authenticity. Harrison Ford was supposed to take note of the K-19. In general, a small small film that works, despite the terrible noise.
