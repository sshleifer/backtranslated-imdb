I saw True Crime when it was first released in the mid-nineties, and since then I have watched it many times. This is a great mystery about Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school girl from a California city, and a younger sister of a classmate who was tortured and killed by an unknown killer. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police cadet who sees how smart she is, and they decide to work together to find the killer. <br /> <br /> There are many suspects in this. True crime seems to me very "true" or real. I read a review of a newsgroup where someone wrote that there is a complete suspension of disbelief, and this is so true. Alicia Silverstone does an excellent job with this role, and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do an excellent job, like the other actors. The places are right on the spot, and writer / director Pat Verducci truly reflects some of the realities of Mary’s teen life and loneliness (see Scene where Mary wakes up from a dream sequence after seeing Tony’s photos that she took) I would like Verducci to make more films. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any other movie like True Crime. 10/10
