Most people miss the point of view of Hollywood. If the hero can stimulate heroic deeds in the child’s mind, within the law, I approve of the lessons taught by Doc Savage. <br /> <br /> At all times of conflict or war, the public and the government are looking for heroes to decorate. The film industry displays characters that people can identify with, such as Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doc Savage remembered more than one generation as the “best of the best” before James Bond, Superman, or anyone else. All the others who follow Doc Savage are only part of the character, not “The Man of Bronze”.
