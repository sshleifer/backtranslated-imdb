Watching this early work of DeMille, I was once again convinced that the early DeMille is far superior to the late DeMille. His attention to the use of light in scenes is wonderful. His rhythm is very good, which allows you to tell a lot for an hour or so. It is a pity that he was not so intuitive in the style of his later sound films, as it seemed in his silent films. <br /> <br /> This was the first film I saw in Cleo Ridgley. She was wonderful, rather restrained and yet conveyed a wide range of emotions. <br /> <br /> The ending is wonderful.
