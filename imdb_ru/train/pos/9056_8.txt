So we compromise. It was a pretty charming film, I liked the artistic direction (it seemed much more “real” than in most of the children's films), and the costumes were not very pleasant. The children of the actors were nice to watch (adult performances tended to be damp). It was wonderful that they showed how a bullied child was bullying others as well as children opposing bullying. <br /> <br /> I don’t know how many adults would like to see it themselves, but it’s a great movie to take a child. And since the Stockyard, apparently, was attended by more than 100 children at the same time, I am REALLY glad that instead we chose to show “worms” with a limited number of visits.
