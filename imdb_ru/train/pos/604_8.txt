Saturday, June 3, 6:30 p.m. Neptune. <br /> <br /> Monday, June 5, 16:30. Neptune. <br /> <br /> Several celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity are as powerful as the brilliant interpretation by Carlos Sauri of Isaac Albenis's Iberia masterpiece. On the eve of his century, Saura gathered the unprecedented wealth of talents of the Spanish performing arts community to create this typical love song for his homeland. The twelve “impressions” of the plot are presented without narration in a harsh environment, which allows you to explode the power of each performance in front of Saur’s camera. The creative use of large apartments and mirrors that are moved throughout the entire set, in combination with screens, shadows, fire, rain and back projection, adds magnificent dramatic effects to the diverse choice of song, dance and instrumental performance. Albeniz's photographs reappear throughout the program, combining the passion of music with its great creator. Saura embraces all the Spaniards on his stage, from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costumes to children dancing joyfully with their instructors.
