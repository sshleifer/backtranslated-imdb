- Tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions in New York, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) finds property for his wife and children in the country. He hopes to find a simple life. But building a house is not easy at all. As headaches and bills start to pile up, so does laughter. Will Mr. Blanding get his dream home? <br /> <br /> - Three main actors are Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas. Any one of the three is able to make a film of their own, so when you combine your talents, almost every scene is special. Grant has always been my favorite in this role. He plays so well on her husband. Loy is always a pleasure to watch. The Thin Man movies she shot with William Powell are almost perfect. And Douglas has become my favorite in the last two or three years. Douglas also appeared in the Old Dark House, one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> - The film is definitely a product of its time. I enjoy the fact that I represent the time when you could build a two-story house with three bedrooms and four bathrooms with an income of $ 15,000 a year. Add to this the fact that your two children attend a private school, and you have a maid, and it becomes almost fantastic. <br /> <br /> However, for anyone who bought or built a house, in many situations and the difficulties that Blending found themselves in can easily be compared with today. And this is where the comedy begins. How many people have done some stupid things that the couple does in this film, only to end up costing more money than expected? - The biggest complaint about Mr. Blandings is the plot “Wife is in love with best friend.” It is really not necessary for the plot and feels out of place and very uncomfortable, as presented.
