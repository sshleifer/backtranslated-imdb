I first saw this film on TV a few years ago, and, frankly, I liked it. Charles Dans is one of the worst villains you can imagine. His sophistication is so different from the rude good hero. I have never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy, but I find his annoying image here the winner: a bit of Axel Foley through the looking glass. Charlotte Lewis, if I may say so, uses a rubber stamp, but the only applicable, brilliantly gorgeous. Some scenes are wonderfully created: a sequence of dreams, a bird, scenes of silly struggle, and climate opposition. Through it all, Murphy is a modern man, suddenly plunged into Eastern myth, a dazed and quieter version of Kurt Russell in his eastern fantasy of fantasy. As in this film, we have James Hong, an incomparable actor, whose scenes, albeit short, raise the quality of even Derek. Since 1955, Hong has identified an excellent supporting actor, a “class act” of his profession. The “golden child” is stupid; it is not perfect; but it has so many useful features that it’s a pleasant and fun fantasy worth seeing. Four years later, I saw the Golden Child again; I liked it even more! It really is a lot of fun.
