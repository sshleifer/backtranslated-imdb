Charlton Heston had one, James Francis had one, but Mark Wahlberg preferred not to wear a traditional loincloth. I hope no one leaves him as Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first two films about the Planet, but Estrella Warren barely shows cleavage - her hair is always in the way. Tim Burton could share this Simian saga and give adults in the audience something to look at. Even the chaste Helena Bonham Carter never comes out of her costume, which looks like a big curtain. She's cute, but all the love things are limited to anxious looks and a little kiss at the end. As in artificial intelligence, which discusses interspecific sex between robots and humans, but never gives - Planet of the Apes hints at interspecific romance between humans and monkeys, but only hints. Lisa Marie is the only monkey that dares to be sexy. In this film, three great actors, Tim Roth, Miss Carter and Paul Giamatti, are experiencing the scenery as a trio of monkeys and are fun to watch. Excellent makeup (a certain Oscar) costumes, scenery, music make this film a summer hit of 2001.
