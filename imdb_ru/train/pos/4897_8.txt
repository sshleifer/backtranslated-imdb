This film pulled you from the very beginning, because it draws our attention, recognizing, yes, that this story begins with a cliché ?? the funeral. <br /> <br /> In other hands besides Judy, I would not give 8, since this material is repeated again and again: A magnificent reunion of the once famous, please select the team, Military platoon, theatrical group, singers, the group . <br /> <br /> But this film never falls to cheap sentimentalization, and when you think that it goes, it flies in another direction. As an example, the flowers that the fan sends Judy. <br /> <br /> Group members are an interesting group that also rides over the cliché. Someone in prison, someone found a religion, someone drunk, and someone fell into dementia. But the joy of life, rediscovered by Judy, set on fire by the interests of her granddaughter, takes us forward and causes us to lose sight of the sometimes simplified nature of the plot. <br /> <br /> Starring “Who's Who,” Leslie Caron, the incomparable jazz player Cleo Lane with her amazing high notes, Joan Sims' last talk, Joan Brava, as cute as the button of a flirtatious Ian Holm playing the ball, and Olimpia Dukakis, like making money, living in the highlands of Scotland with Gilli and her whiskey, is the final scene - the standard Hollywood fare, children staring in condemning fun fans, old lovers reunite, young people are absorbed by the music of old timers. Life should be so simple. But I would watch it again and get together with my own granddaughter. For in the right hands, sometimes these arrogant old clichés just like it. 8 out of 10.
