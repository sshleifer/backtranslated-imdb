Twenty-five years ago I showed this film in some children's entomology classes and I still remember the excitement of children; they were fascinated! It is not only about termites that have been built and live in “clay locks”, but also about other animals that are used by mounds. There is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights with a lizard, and a mongoose colony watches. This is useful not only for entomology classes, but also for environmental education, as it talks so much about the interactions between termites and other organisms and the whole ecology of all organisms that live in and around the mounds. <br /> <br /> I would like it to be available on DVD so that I can watch it again and show it to others.
