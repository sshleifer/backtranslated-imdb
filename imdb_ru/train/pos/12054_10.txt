I first saw this film here in the UK, in December 1989, when it was broadcast by Central Television. I still have a videotape, although it is worn out (for many years, many friends and family members borrowed it and froze too!). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I remember that I came home that night, took a Christmas drink, turned off the lights and looked at what was advertised as “The Christmas Ghost Story”. Even now, I remember some scenes in which the hair on my neck is still standing on end ... <br /> <br /> I saw some comments on the film, which said that it was not this or that ... I I think these people were scared by Friday the 13th and the like, stem and slash, which are ridiculous. This is a “traditional” ghost story; there are no big budget actions or special effects ... neither abuse, nor blood, nor useless sex scenes, nor chainsaws, nor pistols, etc ... As it refreshes !!!! It is atmospheric. If you like scary horror, well written, well played and with a really scary atmosphere, this film is for you. I like the original horrors; Only last night I saw the original film "Ghosts", and this is a great movie. It's very atmospheric again - like The Woman In Black. The end of the film is different from the book, but still very good. I recommend it. Try it ... you * will love it * if you like traditional ghost stories ... SO ... turn off the lights, turn on the fire, lock the doors, grab a drink ... and enjoy ...:)
