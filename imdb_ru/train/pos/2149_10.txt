Everything in the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko, are those we know in everyday life. They were so natural, and Sugiyama's transformation is incredibly plausible. The bill is so touching, it brought me to tears. The choreography was beautiful, did not look sporty. The graceful dances and charm of Maya made me goosebumps. Tamako is such an amazingly adorable character. You can almost see the enchanted schoolgirl on her face when she remembers seeing the "King and me." Aoki's character is both cheerful and pathetic. Masako is as natural as a bewildered wife, you almost want to hug her, to assure her that everything will be fine. <br /> <br /> This film is really a keeper.
