One of the ten best comedies ever. <br /> <br /> This comedy seems so fun and easy to sing. Keaton’s comedies are normal, harmonious, reasonably ordered, thought out. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully fun, deliberately delightful and ingenious, THREE AGES would have to be included in the draft of the first ten comedies, if I drew one. The triple love story enchants viewers; I want to bring this approach - Keaton's comedy - as Lang's FATE upside down, or REVOURCE. Again, the couple crosses the waters of times and epochs in the Stone Age, in Rome and in the times of Keaton in a Muslim country, in the Renaissance in Italy and in China. The same device works in both films: a dark, terrible melodrama; - another, light, masterly developing comedy. In Keaton, this is essentially the same pair; and maybe the same with Lang. The baby that Buster and Bury want is good. I found THREE AGES well written and clever, without being ostentatiously tempted; the plot is mostly very drink, as if the child is a piece of furniture, the only characters are two male opponents - Keaton and Beerie. <br /> <br /> Keaton’s film is just incredibly cute, and it could be argued that it looks like ambitious fun, but it’sn’t, but it’s great fun, great fun, enough fun. And Wallace Beery makes a great nemesis.
