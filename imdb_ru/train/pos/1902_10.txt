Let's start with this song that Christopher Cross sings. The song "If you get caught between the Moon and New York." This is a great theme and song, even after all these years, it never tires. This is really a great song about New York. Anyway, the great Dudley Moore plays in the CBE a spoiled drunken millionaire engaged to the character Jill Eikenberry in the film. Jill will later play a major role in Los Angeles. In any case, he is served by his wonderful British butler, Sir John Gilgud OM, who won an Oscar for his role in the film as Best Supporting Actor. Arthur falls in love with Liza Minnelli's character, who is flawless in this film, in addition to her role as Oscar in Cabaret. No, Lisa can't sing. She plays a diner waitress. In any case, I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as the matriarch of the Bach family, who decides the fate of the family. In any case, she is gorgeous and should have been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Barney Martin, best known as Jerry's dad in Seinfeld, plays Lisa's dad. He's great too. The film was well written, acted and delivered to an audience that wanted more.
