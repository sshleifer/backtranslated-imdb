I was amazed at the rethought Battlestar Galactica, a show that always made me wonder and led me to tears more than once. A stupefied science fiction fan, I like to think that I can choose good things from BS, and that was good. <br /> <br /> Thus, when I first heard about the prospect of a series of prequels a few months ago, my stomach ached. I was afraid that the formula that would make Battlestar so successful would be reused in Caprica, that it wouldn't work at all. The story of BSG about the sad, ragged group of survivors, trapped aboard decaying star ships and led by prophetic vision and a string of pseudo-miracles, was beautifully complemented by extraordinary music and the best cast. <br /> <br /> Caprica feels different. Where BSG occurs after the fall of a great civilization, Caprica portrays this civilization in its cold and decadent flourishing. The general impression I received from Caprica was the same as in the “Report on Minorities”, with the exception of excessive and counterproductive theatricality. In the present form of BSG, Caprica, in the very first hours of programming, was already engaged in questions of religious freedom, racism, the morality of the game of God and the nature of the human soul. <br /> <br /> Castration for Caprica is great too. Each character is unique and deep, from an obsessive and distant scientist who has become an entrepreneur, to his troubled and masterful daughter, each actor and actress throws herself into her respective roles. <br /> <br /> The music that was used so powerfully in BSG also plays a significant role in Caprica. Battlestar's powerful spinning reels and mournful duduks served its themes very well. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound, which gives the show a special feeling, different from its predecessors. <br /> <br /> New Caprica is definitely your own show, which gets the Battlestar franchise as much as it needs. I look forward to the full series.
