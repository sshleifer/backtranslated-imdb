Have you heard the story of reluctant heroes whom the king hired to kill a dragon? Oh, do you have? Was it installed in a world entirely composed of small islands floating above the clouds, and should the heroes make dangerous jumps from one island to another on their journey? The water flowed up, and the remnants of great cities rose on the horizon? I did not think so. <br /> <br /> I accidentally stumbled upon this film and I am very glad that I did it! This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. Like the Pixar films, this is a work of computer animation, which is possible only in the modern world. The animators put thoughts into almost everything that appears on the screen, and this attention to detail is stunning (the scene where mushrooms in the foreground spew green smoke, while the characters, not paying attention, walk in the background, is one of ). Monsters are also fully implemented and enjoyable to watch in action. <br /> <br /> Although the plot may not be entirely unique, the film has enough charm for you to watch. Our main characters are cute and interesting, ensuring that the audience is behind their almost impossible desire to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon, which otherwise could have devoured everything in its path. Of course, Hector is the character that most falls in love with. A small blue creature with a mad smile and inclination to speak a mixture of nonsense and English, Hector provides comedic relief in a way that Jar Jar Binks could only dream of. <br /> <br /> In general, I would recommend watching Dragon Hunters if you have the opportunity. Look at the incredible animation, breathtaking battle scenes and look into the world, unlike all that you saw on the screen of a movie or television. At least it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - it doesn't matter if you are nine or twenty-nine (and actually I)!
