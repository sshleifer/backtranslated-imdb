I thought “The River of Souls” is a very good film Babylon 5, with some exceptional performances by Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian McShane. If it were an episode of the series (without humor), it would probably be one of my favorite individual stories of the series. <br /> <br /> Personally, I always preferred Scoggins to Christian, although I provided JMS for not writing it for most of the series either, and she really had to endure the Byron / Telepath plot. If you choose dirty humor about a brothel and "poorer" actors in these scenes, then this film is solid material. Probably my third favorite movie of four, but by no means a bad one.
