Not seeing the films before (and not keeping up Matt Damon), I reluctantly went to see Bourne’s ultimatum when we were asked to watch it for AS Film Studies. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a movie with Damon in it can be enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Fast battle scenes, crazy motorcycle chases and BIG explosions - that made you leave your place at TBU. Practical errors between the CIA and Born did not give you peace of mind and entertained. <br /> <br /> However, some things really rubbed my cheese. <br /> <br /> First, the fact that the film was just a series of Born, CIA, Born, CIA, Born, CIA. This sequence has become repetitive and ultimately boring. Although Damon really entertained us and always seemed to be a step ahead of the CIA, I was a little annoyed at the constant survival of Bourne. He crashed the car and went out as if he had knocked on it or something! Very unreal. <br /> <br /> And secondly (inevitably) - NECK CAMERA. It was so shaky that it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even the mentors) get sick with seasickness. The instructors told us that if we ever use this in the film that we did in class, it would automatically be wrong, and we would be told to use a tripod. It’s fair that Greengrass wanted it to look as if we were watching Damon and Stiles talking, but of course we won’t shake our heads so vigorously! <br /> <br /> But overall, TBU is a nice movie and worth seeing. But I did not think that it was the best film of the year, despite the fact that he is an entertaining cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
