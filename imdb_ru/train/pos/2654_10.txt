Everyone should see this movie completely! It's damn scary, but it doesn't resort to lame things "jump-on-you-just-surprise-you-and-miss-it-like-scary." It's really cool. Watch this awesome movie !!! Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the greatest director who ever lived. Each of his films is a masterpiece, including this one. Radiance talks about this family, who goes to a hotel in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado as caretakers for the winter and gets snow. Well, the house is haunting. Baby psychic. Her husband was easily influenced by evil haunted hotels, and ... well ... fun causes !!!! Not really. It becomes this exciting thriller, where things are thrown at the viewer from all sides, and it becomes scary. Not just the classic "Here is Johnny" scene. It is memorable, but I can not speak for the whole movie. This is one of those things where words don't explain it adequately, and you just have to see it. So go on Netflix, and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
