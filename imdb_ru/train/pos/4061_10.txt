This is the best dub I've ever heard from Disney, as well as the best adaptation since the biggest insult for the soundtrack, themes, characters, dialogues in the Kiki Delivery Service. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> This has a different atmosphere, especially a deviation from the common heroine. It has both a hero and a heroine (although I really do not support the use of a hero and heroine here, since Miyazaki is beyond the stereotype and the general theme). As usual, after he was presented with Spirit away, he was amazed at Mononoke, concerned about the Firefly Tomb and deeply moved by Maggio no Takkubin, this one begins with a little doubt on my part. I wonder if this will be Gibie's first strike? Well, in the end, like “Just yesterday” and “Heart whisper”, I received 10 ratings. I would give a rating of 9.8, but there is an additional 0.2 to share a good feeling, encouraging people to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILER For some reason I see it as a sad film, people die in it, a Lonely robot, an abandoned place, and it ends in destruction. As if humankind really cannot live with too much force. The collapsing scene gave me the spots of the end of Metropolis. Just sad somehow. The plot is obvious in most reviews and in the rules of the soundtrack (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to the caliber of Heemats, Kanno, Williams. People who can bring to life a movie, a game, an event, even amazing compositions. <br /> <br /> This is a good mood film that was part of American cinema on classic days (“It's a beautiful life,” etc.). Well, everything changes ....
