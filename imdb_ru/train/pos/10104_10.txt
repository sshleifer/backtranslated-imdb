The speeches of Om Puri, Smiths Patil and Sadashiva Amrapurkar and all chemistry are well combined with a minimalist approach to storytelling and directed by Govinda Nihlani. The dialogues of Vijay Tendulkar are great too. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any such film. This is one piece, each piece fits so well into the plot. You can not be impressed by this film. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri is removed as a powerful husband and Om Puri's baap. Om Puri is a young man who finds himself between a sense of duty and an inability to deal with the system. Sadhashiv in the role of Rama Shett gives almost the right touch to the film with his smiling and quiet villain. Anand Velankar’s first meeting with Rama Shetty at Sadhashev is awesome. Smith Patil does not play a major role, but her role also does not distract from the main plot. <br /> <br /> And on top of that, Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a policeman who has come to terms with the system and its work. Say the right things in the right places and know how to avoid trouble. He is also the “guru” of Om Puri and helps him whenever he has problems. <br /> <br /> The film tells not only about the difficulties faced by a policeman trying to do his duty, but also about others. side of police brutality. Om Puri captures the hopelessness and ardent desire to break free in this exceptional performance in Ardha Satya. <br /> <br /> Pleasure for all avid fans of Indian cinema.
