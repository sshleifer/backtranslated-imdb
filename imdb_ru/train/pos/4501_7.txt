This group of English pros is a pleasure to watch. The supporting cast can make a series of their own. It was a love coup between the head of the surgery, his wife and the new resident of the surgery of a cute boy. Only the excellent acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and the sexual Robson Green bring it up from the rubbish category into a very pleasant "romp". The only remark is that it is difficult to agree that the smoldering Francesca Annis will fall in love and will marry Michael Kitchen, who, like me, is hardly an international or even British sex symbol. You can easily understand why Robson Green lit his fire by apologizing to the "Doors". The guy who almost steals the show with a great "calm" performance is Owen's father David Bradley. See it in “How We Live Now” in a completely different play to understand its range. Daniela Nardini as secretary of the Kitchen, sometimes sex toys, is hard to forget, like a rejected mistress who regrets that Kitchen has ever looked at her big body. Conor Mullen and Julian Rind-Tutt, as Green's surgery buddies, as I said, can have their own series. They are so good. All this is very fun, and I wholeheartedly recommend it, and thanks imdbman for giving the opportunity to paying customers to express their opinion in this exciting place.
