Never heard of the Man on the Moon until I saw him last night on THIS HDTV channel. Look, my taste is like any other, eclectic. My favorite works are from Blue Velvet to Doctor Strenglova, Phantom and Mrs. Muir through The Wizard of Oz and Beloved, Eraser, Repo and Spy Inside. <br /> <br /> The Man on the Moon is a magnificently made, tender, joyful and tragic film, beautifully made, in which the actors really live in the moment, not the actor. This sweet tale will soon be in our private library. This beautiful story of life in the far best epoch in rural Louisiana literally takes you to its pastoral environment. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to remain steadfast in the last moments of the film, especially when a young girl is in sizes older than her Sister Heart, burning personal pains and forgiving everything. <br /> <br /> Instead of spoiling pleasure or bothering you with my boring prose, we end up with this sentence of someone who loves films that speak from our hearts to ours. . <br /> <br /> If you are not buying another film, please purchase Man on the Moon. This is a touching story that you will enjoy again and again. This is a joy and a gem, a film that is too small in this world of fierce hearts. <br /> <br /> The simple virtues shown in "Man on the Moon" are a joy to contemplate. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zekkino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida <br /> <br /> April 5, 2009
