The first edition of this notorious horror series depicts a woman abducted by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her. She is brutally beaten, twisted endlessly in a chair, her nails are pulled out, an animal gut is thrown at her, hot boiling water is poured onto her, and finally her eyeball is pierced with a needle (really sick and unpleasant scene). The creators of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible, and for me this is one of them closest to the snuff film, which can be obtained without committing murder on film. Of course, some of the special effects are pretty meager, but the idea of ​​making snuff is pretty awful. I also saw “Flowers of flesh and blood” which is more horrible and sadistic, but less alarming. In any case, it is necessary to see the horror fans!
