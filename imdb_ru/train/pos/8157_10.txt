Rated R for strong language, aggressive content and some nudity. Quebec rating: 13+ Canadian home video rating: 14A <br /> <br /> “Fear of the black hat” is one of the funniest, most original comedies I've ever seen. This is basically the gangsta rap version of the film “It Spin” Tap. As a matter of fact, not many people have heard of this gem of the film. If you manage to find this movie anywhere, feel free to buy it, even if you don’t like rap music. There are not many comedy films that I give the perfect 10/10. The only thing I can think about at the moment is the film “Clerks,” “The World According to Garp,” “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” and “Chasing Amy.” This film is a funny stereotype of gangster rap. Culture The film tells about a woman named Nina Blackburn who makes a documentary about the fictional rap group NWH (N **** z with hats). In fact, this is a stereotype of a rap group that creates a lot of controversial rap songs about killing and Being a gangster. Fear Of A Black Hat is a great comedy movie, and I recommend it, even if you're not a fan of the gangster rap scene. It is a pity that this film is not included in the top 250. <br /> <br /> Duration: 88 minutes <br /> <br /> 10/10
