This film is dedicated to the crime in Derry 30 years ago, which is widely known as Bloody Sunday. <br /> <br /> The film is well researched, drawn and directed. He is as close to the truth as we know before the results of the investigation of Saville. The film puts the atrocity in the context of time. It also shows the savagery of soldiers on the day of the atrocity. The disgraceful "white laundry", which was the Vigier Tribunal, is also dealt with. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great drama that excites and shocks. When Savilleâ€™s report comes out, watch this movie again to see how close it is to the truth.
