This is an important movie. It challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention. There is something to love. The director seems interested in sorting out some of the more tired cinema conventions. Unlike many recent American cinemas, this film is interested in exactly what it means to make a movie in the first place. The DVD includes many bonus features, and there are two comments that explain the film to viewers who are still confused after the initial viewing. When the film was shown on Sundance, many viewers felt embarrassed and angry. This is Sunday morning coffee, not an evening party on Friday. For the faithful viewer, this is a treasure trove.
