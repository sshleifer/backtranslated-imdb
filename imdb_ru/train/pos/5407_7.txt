I always liked Pokémon movies. Yes, I know, they are all very banal, mediocre in certain specific areas and are confident that, although they are aimed at small children, they are too old in some areas to be able to defend them with a statement: "but, among other things, aren't they good fun? In my opinion, they are, and I really like them. This one is as pleasant as the previous three, and, of course, nicer. It has some really sweet and touching moments since this is an introduction This is not the best Pokémon movie, but I like it more than the third release, although the third one is not bad, but the whole series is just entertaining, harmless, family popcorn, and it should not be considered neither more nor less This film has some high marks for intensity and interest, especially around the climax / end, like all the parties, and the characters, although a little duller than the previous three, I thought, are still pleasant and humorous. This film is the lowest rated and most criticized of the four full-length adaptations, and it does not deserve it.
