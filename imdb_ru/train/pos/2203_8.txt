I also really liked this show when I was a kid. In 1952 I was 5 years old, and my family always watched this show. My favorite character was Marion Lorne, playing a rather stuttering, awkward and very sweet person like Aunt. I can still remember her comments like “ubba bubba um um” as she would try to say something important. And then, when she returned and played Aunt Clara in Bewitched, it was a great casting! <br /> <br /> For the first time, I can remember Walter Mattaw, whose career I pursued for many years. <br /> <br /> I have a question, can anyone verify: the title or the final credits of the music “Swedish Rhapsody” by Hugo Alfven? Every time I hear him play on my classic radio station here in Southern California, he recalls how Mr. Pipers was leaving with his back to the camera. I'm not even sure if this image is correct in my imagination.
