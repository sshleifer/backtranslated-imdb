I first saw this film when I was about seven years old, and then he was completely fascinated by it, but for many years I could not understand what this film was called. I'm twenty-one now, and I stumbled across a movie about two weeks ago and bought a copy. Although my memory of the film was a bit hazy, I was by no means disappointed with what I saw. the animation in this film is gorgeous to conjure up a whole world that is so believable and so animated that you yourself are drawn to the film. But this film also has a plot that enchants and entertains adults and children. with a floating island, a mad general, a friendly pirate grandmother and a well-built love story, this film won't let you down, I would recommend this film to anyone.
