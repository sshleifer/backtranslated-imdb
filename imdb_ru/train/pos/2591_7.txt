An extraordinary and quite interesting sleeper for two completely different brothers, both of whom are not only the so-called “igniters of fire” (think of Stephen King's snore with the eponymous book), but also forever differ in relations with each other over a woman the habit of being a pyromaniac! Good special effects (especially towards the end), fancy performances from a rather talented trio of actors and crowned with a really interesting and strangely suitable soundtrack ultimately make Wilder Napalm a unique movie to watch ... if you can find it that is ! As for me, I was lucky that I tore it (so to speak) out of the two-dollar bin in my local video rental store. (*** outside *****)
