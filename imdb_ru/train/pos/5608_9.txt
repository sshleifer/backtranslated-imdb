Of course, he quickly became uneven after this film, but from “The Knife in the Water” to the “Tenant” by Roman Polanski you could always count on delivering something exciting and unique. Despite the many running themes (alienation, paranoia), there are not two of his films that are truly similar. The story of this is somewhat similar to his own "Repulsion" ten years earlier, but the tone is completely different. The "tenant" manages to balance the darker than the dark absurd (I doubt a little, calling it humor, even though the bizarre behavior and dialogues of the main characters are sometimes funny) with some really disturbing paranoia. Polanski has always been a master in building anxiety, and the moments in this film are almost unbearably terrible. The general oddity of the film is also a plus. <br /> <br /> In addition to the refined, as usual, direction of Polanski, the other actors and the film crew offer a great contribution. Actor Polanski is often overshadowed by director Polanski, but his performance here truly reflects his clumsiness and outcast feeling. The themes of social discrimination make this film not just weird for the sake of weirdness. The rest of the cast offers strong performances as well, especially Isabelle Adjani’s sympathetic turn, and accordingly annoying Melin Douglas and Shelley Winters. The Tenant is often underestimated due to the fact that he is ready to praise both Disgust and Baby Rosemary, but he is as magnificent as any of these classics. (9/10)
