This is truly a classic film in its history, acting and film. Wonderful actors abound throughout the film, Miss Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart are the main characters. In real life, she was very admired and loved by Jimmy, and she really gave him her mostly first acting roles and helped him to be more relaxed with his appearance on the set. The "chemistry" between them has always been obvious, and so warm and pleasant to look at. She was so beautiful, young woman and so cute in her personality. The story of these two young people and how they end up coming together is fascinating, and this is just magical entertainment. In this remarkable story / film, other supporting actors also give warm presentations. From the bottom of my heart, I give Miss Sullivan a fine ten in this film, The Golden Age, which is especially attractive for all generations. Must see for everyone!
