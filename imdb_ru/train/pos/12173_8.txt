First quick shut up! to those who say this movie stinks. You can not go to each movie, waiting for "Citizen Kane." It was a really funny movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only flaw in this film is that I donâ€™t think there was enough chemistry between Lee and Julia Stiles. They should dwell on this in more detail. In addition, the film is very fun. Selma Blair should eat something. She bothers me. But she still looks beautiful. So yes, I recommend this movie for a date or light Saturday fun. Go to. <br /> <br /> RATING: ** 1/2 of ****
