I saw it only once. It happened in 1952, I was seven years old, film 13. <br /> <br /> We were so young ... But I always remembered the strong moments of the victim Gungi. <br /> <br /> I realized that time, how many people can hardly be imagined and used by other people. In these historical circumstances, in the film, personal friendships, a kind of friendship that ignores itself, arise between people who share everyday life, who see each other’s faces, know each other’s names, but belong to different worlds. , can only make appears. Then, at the most critical moments, an alarming question arises: “Who do we, firstly, have to be loyal?” What kind of people, family, homeland, person you know are close to you? You do not have time to give the perfect answer, there is urgency, and this is for life or death. Gunga-Din gives his answer by sacrificing himself. Somewhere, in confusion, the problem remains unresolved, emotions grow with the rhythm of the film until someone dies, only one life, nothing compared to many other inventions or realities that we can see today, because death, this unique disappearance. The life I lived, I shared with my child an unconditional friendship. This was the viewer that I was. That day I lost Gung-Din forever. When I left, later, to my beautiful childhood, since I left so many of the worlds in which I lived. I left it all forever, and these lines today are a short visit, which I did not expect to make this morning when I got up.
