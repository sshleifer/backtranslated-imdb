I hate reading reviews that say something like: “Don't waste your time, this film stinks on ice.” This makes this reviewer still for me, he may have some sort of naive charm. If you like other films from the Whistler series, this one will be watchable. If you like Nouir movies from the 40s, this one will be watchable. <br /> <br /> This film, in my opinion, is not as good as any of the earlier series, in which Richard Dix played a major role. It is much slower, and the plot is banal. You have seen the same narrative device used in many other films, and usually better. <br /> <br /> But the game is as good as the lighting and the dialogue. He simply does not have enough energy, and you will probably understand exactly what is happening and how it will all end, no more than a quarter of the way. <br /> <br /> The Whistler series is a semi-noir, and there character, mood, lighting, camera movement and perspectives are more important than the story itself. But this film is no noir. It is too light weight and Hollywood is innocent for that. Neither the character of Richard Dix, nor the characters from his ladies in previous films had to end. You just never knew until the end. <br /> <br /> But, nevertheless, I recommend this one for at least one viewing. I watched it at least twice by myself and got a reasonable amount of pleasure from it both times.
