“De vierde man” (“The Fourth Man”, 1984) is considered one of the best European picot-thrillers of the eighties. This latest work by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his home country before he moved to Hollywood to become a big star in films such as Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Starship Troopers, about a psychopathic and disappointed author ( Jeroen Krabbe) food at sea for recovery. There he meets a mysterious femme fatale (René Soultendik) and begins a femme romance affair with her. He becomes dependent on her heart and soul and learns that all of her three previous husbands died under mysterious circumstances ... <br /> <br /> The old Hollywood cinema and psycho thrillers Alfred Hitchcock and Orson strongly influenced Wells. Creating a dark and exciting atmosphere takes a long time, and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right influence to move the story forward. The wait is sometimes almost unbearable, and sometimes reminds of the work of the Italian cult director Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> The cast is also outstanding, especially the performance of Krabbe as a mentally agitated writer who opened the door for his international film career (“Living Day Lights”, “The Fugitive”). If you have the opportunity to watch this great psycho-thriller on TV, video or DVD, do not miss it!
