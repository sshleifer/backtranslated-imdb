I am a fan of Hal Hartley's films, especially the 1997 Henry the Fool. Fay Grim is a continuation of this film and has a similar style and sense of humor. The plot, however, is completely different. Fei Grim (brilliantly played by the famous Parker Posey) tries to track down her missing husband's notebooks and finds himself among conspiracies and espionage. The cast (most people from the first movie, as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burroughs and the long-awaited return from the favorite indie of the 90s Elina Lowensson) are excellent, and the film has many surprises. The director claims that this is part of a trilogy, similar to "Star Wars", acting as "The Empire Strikes Back" in the series. If this is true, I can not wait to see the third issue! I just hope that I donâ€™t have to wait another 10 years.
