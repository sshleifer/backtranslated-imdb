Debut? Wow - Cross-Eyed is one of the most enjoyable indie films that I watched last year, making it hard to believe that Cross Eyed is the debut film of the author. I mean - I logged on IMDb to find more films by this author ... because the Cross of Eyes has this unique signature - you want to see what more this author can say. A film that is well written, well directed, well edited and well played is rarely seen these days. For me, Cross Eyed encompasses what the film should be about, combining the best of all the elements of a film to create a clever, artistic and sharp tale. More please.
