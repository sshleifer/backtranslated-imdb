I swear, when I first saw this movie, I was crying my eyes! “STARS BORN” is a film that lets you know what love really is, despite the obstacles that John Norman (Chris Christofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You also experience how it is to lose love by the end of the film. Streisand and Christopherson have such wonderful chemistry, and the music is fantastic! When Streisand sings with another look at you / Look carefully, it's just magic! This film made the evergreen song one of my favorites, and Queen Bee is such a fun song. I also like the 70s fashion (except for Streisand Afro. In addition, she is beautiful). “Star is born” - my favorite movie number one. This film is a pleasure to watch and in the end heartbreaking.
