The true story of the real revolution, April 25; the revolution against the repressive regime of 41 years, which imposed a colonial war on its military to preserve the empire (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, S. Tome and Principe; the first and last of the great colonial empires of Europe) 600 years, starting with the conquest Ceuta in 1415; revolution by the army for the people and for democratic Portugal; the most surprising fact in this revolution is that there were no killed people in it (except those who died in the hands of the political police of the PIDE state during a brutal shelling against an unarmed crowd, protesting in front of its headquarters on April 25, 1974 of the year, they showed it in the film.) And all revolutions have their own heroes, one of them was captain Salgueiro Maya, a soldier returned from the war, whose conviction along with the rest of the army was that they were waging (since 1961) a hopeless war, and sometimes come to the soldier Xia disobey their country.
