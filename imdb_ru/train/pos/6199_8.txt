As a person who has seen and followed Hartley’s public work for several years, I think that much of what was once a fantasy told in real stories has turned into incomprehensible philosophical intellectual games. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Fay Grim is another character step in Henry the Fool’s mind, where the film reflects the quality of the object in the film itself. In Henry the Fool, an object is a memoir ... In the Fay Grim, an object is an encrypted memoir that has itself been stolen, tampered with and transformed into something so obscure that it really can't make any sense — that is, the script process the modern age - where most blockbusters are - is nothing but a cluster of the past. That is, in a philosophical sense, what is Fay Grim. Perhaps this is the tragedy that the shock has now become cliché and boring (as hinted at the opening scenes in the office of the publishing house). <br /> <br /> Many of the best moments of the film are lost if you don’t understand the character of Henry and the meaning of the wanted memoirs. Henry is a slightly veiled devil who first visited Simon as a modern Faust, etc. Without an understanding of how tragic the character of Henry is, much of the quality of the plot and story of Fay Grim is lost. <br /> <br /> And there is not enough “details” expressed through verbal memories - knowledge of the plot of Henry the Fool cannot be compared with the “feeling” of character quality, as in “Henry the Fool”, and therefore I think that whoever enters this cold film has about 10 minutes. “So what?” - responses to a complex dialogue, that's all. <br /> <br /> However, Henry the Fool was my unloved film Hartley, until I realized that he was bad — putrid and infected — precisely because the film was Henry the Fool. confessions were bad ... not just rude or dirty, but inevitably disturbed. Henry cannot even be a real villain - and this is perhaps the tragic flaw that makes him most charming ... like Gollum in Tolkien's works, Henry is pathetic. <br /> <br /> This is not found in Fei Dark, although Henry's dialogue is excellent. What is found is that the entire film is built as encryption - a kind of formation of another plot around what ends with another bad story to add to Henry's confessions. This is an interesting twist, but it cannot be digested without watching the first movie. Perhaps showing Henry more in the early stages would be better than if the publisher described the main storyline of the first film - although in fact this story is not exactly what the first film was about - if only one of them is not a casual observer. <br /> <br /> Part of encryption? It's hard to say ... a little disappointed in the sexual tricks though. Cheese.
