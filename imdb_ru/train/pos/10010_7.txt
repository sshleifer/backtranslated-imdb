There are many illnesses born in the mind of man that have received life in our time. Constant vigilance or accumulated information in the field of psychosis led to the fact that psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists were busy working enough to serve them for decades. Sometimes some of these psychic phenomena are discovered by those who do not know about their medicine, or even about their existence. This is the premise of the movie called "Night Listner". He tells the story of a popular radio host named Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams), who spends the evening captivating his viewers with vivid stories about gay life. Perhaps because his show loses its true appearance, which makes Noon admit that he is no longer himself. Feeling abandoned both by his beloved Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his best friend (Joe Morton), he seeks refuge in his deepening despair and isolation. It is here that the mysterious voice of the night asks him for help. Noon should feel useful and reach out to a desperate voice that belongs to a 14-year-old boy named Peter (Rory Culkin). Reading the boy's heartbreaking manuscript, which portrays youth and sexual abuse by his cruel parents, Noon is captivated and wants to help. However, things are not as they seem, and soon Noon is wrapped up in an elusive and strange story torn from a medical nightmare. This film is pure Robin Williams, and if it were not for Tony Collett, who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh, as Anna, and John Callum, as pop, it can be funny. Instead, this may be one of Williamâ€™s most serious speeches. ***
