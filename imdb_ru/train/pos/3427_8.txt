This film illustrates the worst part of a surviving war, the memories. For many soldiers, both men and women, returning home can be the beginning of real problems. I am reminded of the return of my father and his brothers from the Second World War. For one of my uncles, the war never ended. He survived the invasion of the Day, something like the first 20 minutes of rescuing Private Ryan. For him, the memories not only lingered, but also tortured him. He became an alcoholic, as were several of my cousins, his sons. Jump forward 60 years and put the soldiers in another war, in another country, the result is the same. When I saw this at the KC FilmFest, I was reminded that there is something about a war that will never change. Idealistic young men and women were not spared the emotional torment of what happened in Iraq, and especially if you are against the war, you will show more compassion for those soldiers who are trying to do what they think is right. <br /> <br /> The tagline from the Vietnam War film speaks for itself. "The first victim of war is innocence."
