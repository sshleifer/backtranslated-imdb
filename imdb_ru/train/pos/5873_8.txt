This would be a classic fire class if they chose MORE ANY OTHER for John Abraham. This guy is a terrible actor. Be it comedy, drama, tears, etc. He stinks. It seemed that at some point Priyadarshan realized this, and pretty much made him jump like a monkey to make his solo scenes a little funny. <br /> <br /> He is the only noticeable flaw in a couple more annoying pieces) ABSOLUTELY funny film otherwise. The best comedy in Bollywood since the time of the Hungama, IMO. Like “Wenham”, this is a situational comedy, which is taken on the shoulders of a brilliant script and, of course, Akshaya Kumar. This is probably his best performance to date. Better to be a substitute for the best comedian at each awards ceremony. A.K. was always good at comedy, but he raises it to another level. Body language, facial expressions and just the way it delivers each line. This is a brilliant presentation. The movie theater was full of drug addicts throughout the entire film, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in the USA. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala does not do this; there is one “leading” heroine. Stars 3 are incredibly hot + Beautiful girls who, it seemed to me, did a pretty good job Sure, they all make their debut. Paresh Rawal is hard as usual, although his routine wears out after a while. Rajpal Yadav - his typical annoying "I" (tired of his excessive playing in every film). Rimi Sen has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> All in all, definitely worth the deho. I would say that it is funnier than without entering, and that says a lot. It could be even better if they chose someone more competent than John Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
