The wonderful film again tells about the trials and tribulations of the 11th World War of England. What makes this film so good is the touch of the human element. This film is definitely in the tradition of such British classics of the line as “Mrs. Miniver” and “Hope and Glory”. As is the case with this film, we see the despair of people during the war. <br /> <br /> The performances here are outstanding, especially embittered John Tou, who is assigned a child who was evacuated from the London bombing. <br /> <br /> We will soon see why this child is urinating in his bed. He comes from a crazy mother who brutally abused him. <br /> <br /> The old man is fond of the child and brings happiness to his sad life. When the child is returned to his mother, the old man goes to London and searches for him, only to find tragedy. He literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince the eldest that the child is better off with him than being in the boy’s house. <br /> <br /> The picture is so good because it deals and builds on excellent relationships.
