Unqualified "10". The level of writing and acting in this Australian film resembles the very best of “old” Hollywood. Sam Neal and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neil compares Stripe with line after line and take on taking - this is one of the best showcases of his amazing acting talent, and he is at his best and sexy best, despite the intensity of his role. This exciting movie is a treat for any movie fan who loves the exciting drama of the courtroom, depicted in the most human, but unsentimental terms. The film, which received several top awards in Australia, boasts not only an excellent cast and director, but also wonderful and authentic Australian locations. This proves that people are the same all over the world. And after all these years, people are still happy to repeat the famous line of the Strip, the accent and all that: "Dingo ate my child!" Including this demon "Elaine Benis" in "Seinfeld".
