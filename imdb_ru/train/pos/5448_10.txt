This film is probably my favorite movie of all time. Miriam Flynn is superb as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzbi in the role of Delores - a brilliant comedian. The rest of the cast is amazing and the film is really really fun. A definite satire of horror films, with a frantic turn. If you like a fun, comedy-filled evening, then go and rent this classic. You will laugh until the end!
