Rod Serling was, of course, a genius, and his wonderful, playful, creative mind left something from the period in which he lived, and examples of television in this state of development. Now there are no such shows, but rather “housewives”, sluts like Eva Longoria or Terry Hatcher, or miserable blows of humor and witty banter that litter our high tech screens. an episode with such acting accuracy and his usual insanity that I can't help but think that Rod Serling created the show of that long week around Elam, even though he was auxiliary to the flow of history. This episode, as usual, ends with a twist, but shock and humor mingle with a particularly clever Serling manner. <br /> <br /> Rex Lewis Field
