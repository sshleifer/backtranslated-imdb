This film does not suit some, but it must be watched. I am glad that someone finally brought up to discuss the realities of HOW African American couples worked to make a name in communities and how many of them felt trying to stay there when the “other” African Americans moved in. <br /> <br /> (Minor spoilers) <br /> <br /> This little movie “Showtime” is almost like “Spike Lee Joint” ... you have an African American man (Danny Glover) who was steadily making his way through the traditionally white positions of lawyers in the 1970s. As ANY American, he made his family compatible with his mobile status, but he forgot that there are still a lot of problems. The only blacks at the time were maids. Who owns the house? Wow. <br /> <br /> Then the merger began. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) is told to “interfere,” so she does the same as all the other women in her area. And only when a person thinks that he and his family are “in,” another African American comes right next door, who entered because they won “lotto” (Mo'nique), and, in his opinion, he does not want to have with them nothing in common because he does not want the neighborhood to think that they are alike. He is, of course, the best caliber, his new neighbor "ghetto" should not be there! Who has a problem now? <br /> <br /> This film shows how much it is needed for this family to fit in and how they lose themselves in the process. It makes you wonder where racism begins and ends ... and with whom. It shows that no matter what color you are and how much money you have, you can still isolate yourself from the real world and help others. It also shows how these African-American children, “mingling” with neighbors like these, fall into the trap of changing themselves according to culture (with blond hair and blue eyes, notice!) Around them. They laugh with jokes, not knowing that they are jokes, and not knowing ... why. <br /> <br /> But in general, this film is about people. No matter what race you are, this film tells you how terrible you can be towards your neighbor and each other ... all to fit in ... all because you feel that you have more money than others, so automatically you get better - and you forget about the struggle that you had, and those who stood behind you. <br /> <br /> Again, NOT for everyone. But look and judge for yourself. <br /> <br />
