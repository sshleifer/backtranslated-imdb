I really liked this thriller! I wanted to see it again as soon as it ended. The cast was excellent, the plot was tense and entertaining, and it was just a nice movie! I would rate it as one of the best thrillers I've ever seen! The girls in it were also very cute, especially Denise Richards. She was very angry throughout the film and gave her hero a little OOMPH!
