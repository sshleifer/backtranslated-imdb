All Dogs Go To Heaven is a movie that I always liked. When I was a kid, I watched it every other day. It is underestimated if you look at its IMDb rating and the comments of many people in general. This is not a bad movie, as many say, this is a very good movie. This is good, and your children will probably enjoy it. Even though it is rated by G, some parents may find it a bit cruel. In fact, this is a rather dark story, where dogs look like gangsters who participate in gambling, extortion and even cold-blooded murders. The film tells about a dog named Charlie, who escaped from the pound, killed by his old friend, goes to heaven, but eventually returns to earth. Many younger children watching this film may feel like they are watching a big children's film. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that may scare young children, but I’m sure they will be fine. Every time I watch this movie, it reminds me of when I was a little kid. I'm sure everyone has a film that reminds them when they were younger, this is a film that makes me feel that way. The performances by Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are great, and this is the last film in which there was a little girl named Judith Barcy. Unfortunately, she was killed at a young age, which is a shame, because she had so much potential, and she didn’t deserve what happened. Now that I know her story, I can't watch this movie anymore, because her voice sounds so sad. <br /> <br /> The animation in this film is great, the voice acting is great, and the story is good, but a little different from many other children's films. It was popular at the time of its release, but was overshadowed by the mega-popular Disney Little Mermaid. This is a film that is not thought of by adults, but if you are a child, or you grew up with this film as a child, then I am sure that you will like it.
