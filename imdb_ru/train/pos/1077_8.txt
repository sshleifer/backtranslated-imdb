This is a comedy, as it once was, and a comparison of it with two remakes, "MONEY" and "WE MADE?" Only indicates how the creators of the 40s film had a talent for a comedy that was lost with regret. <br /> <br /> I was 15 years old when I first saw it, and even at this tender age I could laugh at many things. Now, of course, being familiar with the disappointments of adults, I see a lot of things that I lacked in my youth. <br /> <br /> Three main actors ... Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas ... interacted well. But the film is based on disappointments when it comes to achieving a dream. It is never as simple and without unforeseen complications as you can imagine. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a classic comedy that still stands above the attempts to remake it.
