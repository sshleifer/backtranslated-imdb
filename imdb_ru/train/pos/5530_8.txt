Be sure to look for anyone who loves photography. awesome and breathtaking, leaves you in the ore. seen twice in the movie, and now on DVD. it holds well on DVD, but on the big screen it was something else. <br /> <br /> Took my two daughters to see it, and they liked it, my eldest cried at the end. to see it again tonight, when she saw it in the video store. it simply tells about the childâ€™s love for nature and, in particular, for the fox. to some extent it reminded me of a bear in his story telling, not a documentary format. which works for kids very well. it's not very important to preach, you decide. <br /> <br /> But the star of this film is the filmmakers, as they did what they did. amazing just amazing.
