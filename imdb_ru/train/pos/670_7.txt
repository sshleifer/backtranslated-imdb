THE LAST WAVE will never prevail over the main audience. This is a slow, but fascinating film for those who are willing to agree with him. An Australian real estate attorney is asked to bring up the case of five Aborigines accused of killing one of them. Soon, all sorts of omens and omens appear, since the death of a person is associated with a tribal problem that is not intended for the white manâ€™s court, and rather soon the lawyer has problems that distinguish reality from fantasy. It seems that the end of the world may be at hand, and he and the aborigines may know this, but no one else knows. Richard Chamberlain as a lawyer is here at the peak. David Guptil, a familiar face from several other Australian films and a decent actor, is one of five convicted Aborigines. The LAST WAVE is simply not for everyone, more than MAGNOLIA (both have strange things that fall from the sky). Check it out on a slow Saturday night.
