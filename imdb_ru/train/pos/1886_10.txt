I have loved this film since its debut in 1981! I lost count of how many times I saw it! It never makes me laugh or cheer me up if I feel depressed. Three excerpts are fantastic, and the script is priceless, and how do you not feel nostalgic about listening to a song? I think I quote this movie without realizing it. I basically know the whole script, so when someone watches it for the first time, I have to hold back by saying something about how funny the next line is. I can't even narrow it down, though, Sir John's character probably gets the most memorable. The famous "I will notify the media," when Arthur announces his intention to take a bath, is still priceless, but the list is really endless. The scene is that Arthur will soon become the bride's father's house - a scream, especially his interaction with elks. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
