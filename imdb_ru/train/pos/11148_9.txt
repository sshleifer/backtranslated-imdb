Midnight Cowboy received an X rating with the original release back in 1969. There are a few scenes where you can understand this, just a little. A film about Joe Buck (Jon Voight), who came from Texas to New York to become a bully, is sometimes a little disturbing. Dressed as a cowboy, he tries to live like a hustler, earning money in a love act. It won't work as he planned. After a guy named Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) first deceived him and stole some money, they became friends. They live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Then Ratso fell ill, and Joe should try to make some money. <br /> <br /> The film was probably assigned an X rating on the main theme, but on the way we see some strange things. Editing in this movie is great. We see sequences of dreams from Joe and Ratso, interrupted by the real world in a pleasant and sometimes amusing way. Dustin Hoffman, John Voight and supporting actors give excellent performances. Especially Hoffman supplies some beautiful famous lines. The score is made by John Barry and sounds great. All this makes this film great, won the Academy Award in the nomination "Best Film".
