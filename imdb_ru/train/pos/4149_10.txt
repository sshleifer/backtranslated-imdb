Reading some of the comments on the bulletin boards here, I expected this film to be a complete disappointment - but when I watched it, I could not stop laughing! He officially became my new favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I don’t know what all this hatred is about, perhaps because there has never been such a film. I find it difficult to name another comedy completely led by a woman. In many comedies, one or two actresses will play a major role, but there will be many supporting male characters. This one was almost ALL women — with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and Will Arnett’s brief appearance — and it worked. All the actresses have put on very funny performances (especially Missy Pyle) from a bizarre and engaging script. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the charm of this film lies in his subtle feminist message: to accept who you are female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendship and the breaking of gender roles. Despite the recklessness, each of the main characters is faced with a problem, because their attempts to be more "funny" contradict their feminist values ​​and who they know themselves. <br /> <br /> Missy Pyle proposed that this film skip the theatrical release due to its all-female cast and the absence of a famous actor to get the studio behind it, and I have to agree. Everyone to whom I recommended this film liked this film, and, unfortunately, it is a pity that the comedy devoted to female nonsense was not widely accepted and successful. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone with a film. mind or love of female comedy.
