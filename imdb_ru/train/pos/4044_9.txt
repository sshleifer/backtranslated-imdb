I found this film very dynamic. The idea is quite original, and as a spectator I was carried away by the development of characters. For those who like to think, the storyboard is done very well - itâ€™s enough that it is hidden from the viewer at an early stage and questions continue to arise that are answered later, creating a well thought out and very pleasant film, both from the brain and from the action . <br /> <br /> It seems that some people were looking for a non-stop roller coaster ride with this film - one of those coming out of the gate. It would be more analogous to one of those coasters, which at first slowly lift you up the hill - creating a wonderful sense of anticipation - and ultimately, in my opinion, more useful for the foundation laid. <br /> <br /> Great movie.
