Of all the breakdance / hip-hop films released between 1983 and 1986, the 1984 Beat Street film is undoubtedly the best. The story tells of a DJ, his breakdance junior marriage, a graffiti artist and one who wants to become a promoter of show business during one winter, in which they try to break out of the ghetto using their “street” talent. Acting is not always up to par, and the characters are not fully drawn out, but they are more than compensated for by a mundane dialogue, a believable story, fantastic dance episodes and a perpetual hip-hop soundtrack. It should be noted that this film was made at the birthplace of break dance (“This is not New York, this is the Bronx!”), And fathers of break dance, the dance troupe Rock Steady Crew and rapper Afrika Bambaata are involved in it. Rock Steady Crew is the best scene in the film when they dominate the dance battle at the breakdancing club of the early 80s, Roxy. Be sure to look for hip-hop lovers.
