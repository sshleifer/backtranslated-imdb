In general, the on-screen game in most films from Turkey is not enough, but GEN has the best shots that need to be said "perfect." And the transitions are really excellent. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, “Gen” has a great theme that affects everyone. Especially a woman who wants to become a psychiatrist in a sanatorium has a mother who is habitual madness. The main causes and psychological consequences are given in Gen. The only thing you need to do is combine all the hints. <br /> <br /> Doga Rutkai and Sahan Gokbakar played an impressive role of aggression. This performance may be more realistic than “Irreversible (Monica Bellucci)”. <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is “Watch this movie, you're confused
