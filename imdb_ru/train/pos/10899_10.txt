I laughed so hard during this movie, my face hurt. Ben Affleck was cheerful and reminded me of the cute boy Jack Black in this role. Gandolfini gives his typical performance. The whole cast is funny, the plot is pretty good, and the comic moments are awesome. I entered this film, not expecting much, so perhaps that is why I was so surprised when I left the film completely satisfied and exhausted on my face. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves comedy, can identify with loneliness during the holidays and / or tolerate loved ones. The best part of this film (for me anyway) was thin bits of humor that caught me off guard and made me laugh for a long time after the rest of the audience stopped. Namely, the scene with the lighting of the Christmas tree. Go take a look and laugh!
