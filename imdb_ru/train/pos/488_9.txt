Part of the pleasure I gained from this film stemmed from the fact that I did not know anything more about him than the fact that John Turturro and Emily Watson (2 reasons sufficient for watching) were in it, was a historical play which involved chess. Everything that developed before me was completely unexpected. Therefore, I will not give much more. Suffice it to say that Turturro is great as an eccentric, possessed and deeply vulnerable chess genius, and Em compares him step by step like a strong woman who is drawn to him. This is about love and obsession, not about a revered board game, and after I gradually dragged me in for the first half hour, it became completely irresistible. And I can't guess the ending for anyone.
