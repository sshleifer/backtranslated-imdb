I noticed that this film was broken long before it appeared in cinemas, and I also didn’t have high hopes for it. I thought it was another movie like “You Received a Ministry” with some good dance moves and a terrible game. I was in the theater and chose between this and acquaintance with the Spartans and chose it. To my surprise, acting was not bad at all, and the film was actually quite good. The fact that he has a lower rating than You Got Served is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the rubbish posted here, I recommend watching the morning show of this film so you don’t spend too much. I think you will be pleasantly surprised at how everyone was wrong about this. When it comes to dance films, this is definitely one of the best films with a much superior acting game than many others. Go see the movie and judge for yourself. We hope that the rating will increase after it is released on DVD, and more and more people will check the film, and will not judge it by comments until its release. <br /> <br /> edit The film is now approaching the correct rating. Over 1000 people gave him a rating of 9, which is too much, but at least it helps to compensate for the ridiculous voices 1.
