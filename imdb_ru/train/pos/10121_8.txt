Although not as wild and distant as in some later Takashi Miike films, this is a very good crime drama. <br /> <br /> The main story is the story of a Japanese policeman with Chinese parents trying to destroy the upcoming Chinese gangster. The difficulty is that his younger brother acts as a lawyer for the villain and his gang. The film is actually much more complicated than the one, with several difficulties that make things interesting and distract things from the main plot. It is this complication and loss of the way for about an hour in the film that makes it a less than excellent film. (This is a very very good movie) This is definitely worth seeing, especially if you don't mind the insane tempo. /> <br /> Warning: violence when it occurs, explosive and contrary. There are also semi-graphic images of same-sex sex. If this is not your cup of tea, proceed with caution. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 out of 10.
