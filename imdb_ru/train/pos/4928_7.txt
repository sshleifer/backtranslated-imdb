Given its release time, the story that unfolds in the 1950s thriller “Panic in the Streets” was hardly a surprise. The corpse of a mysterious illegal was found and extradited to anyone until further inspection by the public health inspector, who claims that the corpse carries the strain of bubonic plague. And yet, given the current drama in the modern world, this strangely helps this film look trustworthy for today's viewers. The cast and crew are impeccable. Richard Widmark in his first role after his breakthrough performance in Nights and the City, Jack Palans in his debut in a scary movie, starring also played by Paul Douglas and the young (and pretty) Barbara Bel Geddes. A number of non-credit, non-professional actors (typically for a Kazan director) fill the remaining seats. Director Eliya Kazan makes films of Joe MacDonald (he will later work again with Richard Widmark in the much superior pickup on South Street 1953), and the great Alfred Newman received it. Almost all the participants here have done the best work, however, “Panic on the streets” is a very useful time. Especially for film fan-enthusiast.
