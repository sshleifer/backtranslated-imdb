The previous reviewer said it for sure. I saw it once, I was fascinated, I saw it the second time when it was retransmitted within a week or two after the first show. I still remember some scenes. The settlement is the discovery of the 20th century, the war mentioned in the title is World War I. One of the scenes was set in the section for women only in a public place, which was an interesting historical note. The moment when one of the women touches the other for the first time is one of my most wonderful moments in the movie. I don’t think of it as a “gay movie”, it’s an interesting and tender love story from a period when the two leaders are women. I would like to see this movie again; I would buy this if it ever came out on DVD.
