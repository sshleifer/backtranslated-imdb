Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such plausibility that I just cried. The role of Glenn Close as Ruth showed that she wants to deal with the situation, but she was under the authority of her husband. “Let him think about what he did,” said Robert Duvall's character Joe firmly. The story portrayed a rural family that dealt with the accidental death of a son from his brother, called "The Stone Boy", meaning that he was so distraught and stunned by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. Then, near the end, when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, passed it all on to a stranger, I was so upset about him that I even thought about some horrible things I had done in my life. I personalized and identified myself with his character. The roles of Frederick Forrest and Gale Youngs did not add anything to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played the antagonistic, effeminate brother of Ruth Andy, like a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, behaved like a madman, slapping Arnold because of disappointment with her own problems, without pity and blaming him for her troubles. I am not very sorry for these two. Although Lou tried to keep his marriage together, she failed. Both failed to cope effectively with their problems. They really did not do anything for the film and were completely ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley’s insignificant role as a grandfather was touching, because he was the only character who showed Arnold any attention. I felt that his role had to be developed. Players just did what they thought was adequate and sufficient. However, I really liked the final, I actually smiled and cried with joy. I felt good. Gillermans are family again. I really wanted to be part of this family. They were so realistic.
