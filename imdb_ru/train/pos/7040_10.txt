This film was excellent for the following reasons: 1) It contained excellent backgrounds and scenery. 2) He showed the discrepancy between the war-torn environment along with the technological one. 3) John Cusack's game was awesome. He portrayed longing very well. 4) He showed everyone’s vulnerability in a war-torn situation. 5) He gave us a picture of what might happen in the future in many ways. I was also impressed with the acting for the most part. I found that actress Hilary was the most untidy. The moral and values ​​of anyone in a war-torn situation can be seized. A liberal journalist and a conservative businessman can do anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable. Quality goods. PSP
