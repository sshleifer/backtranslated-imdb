I'm not even sure what to say about this movie. This is one of the few films ever made that I consider romantic. trying to talk about the plot or performance or technical details about this film would be Frank Zapp's "Like a Dance About Architecture" words. He absolutely hits the nail right in the head, as he captures those fleeting moments in life that move us, and then run away from us, so that we never experience it again. It’s like a movie in which the character from the movie “Adaptation” wanted to write Charlie Kaufman. the end remains open and ambiguous, there is no happy end, only a mystery. no deep life lessons, just a couple of excited and intelligent children exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unreal feelings ...... romantic love. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 people watch this with their special lady and recommend it to a stranger ................
