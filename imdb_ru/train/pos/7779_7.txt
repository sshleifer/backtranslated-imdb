The irony is that in the 50s, when Douglas Sirk was the most successful in terms of attractiveness of the audience, he was almost ignored by critics ?? However, now he is considered the director of an enormous intellect who has achieved his best work in melodrama. <br /> <br /> “Written in the wind” - about the fall of the oil dynasty of Texans, surrounded by a negligible reputation, alcoholism and nymphomania ?? We are talking about perverted, fatal connections between sex, power and money ... <br /> <br /> Stack draws a convincing portrait of an exhausted drunk, destroyed by frustration, arrogance, jealousy, madness and some deep insecurity? ? <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone succeeds as an attractive woman with excessive sexual appetite, humiliating herself for Hudson and other guys in the city ?? Her best phrase: "I'm dirty." In one crazy scene, we see how she trembles, trembles and sweats before provocative mambo ?? In another lonely crying example of an oil rig at his father's table - a symbol of excessive wealth and male tyranny ?? <br /> <br /> Is the insane atmosphere at the same time pleasant and enhanced by Sirk’s excellent use of colors, lights and the careful use of mirrors ??
