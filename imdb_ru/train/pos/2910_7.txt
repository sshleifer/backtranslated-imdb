This is a great movie for fans of McCartney and the Beatles! Great time guaranteed for everyone. The audience (the feat of some celebrities, such as Nicholson, Kuzak, Michael Douglas), is, as always, rather amazing: from young children to old campaigners. Sixties. They know the words to all the songs by heart, and some of them cry when Paul breaks into the blackbird “yesterday,” “all my love” and all the treasures of his catalog (which, apart from John Lennon and Dylan, can claim such a repertoire ?) There are two particularly touching moments: <br /> <br /> - Double tribute to Lennon and Harrison: the first “here today” performed a solo (the name was included in “Tug of war”) in 1982 and was his best track, then “what “when” Paul used the ukulele. <br /> <br /> - “A long and winding road”, the key moment when Paul’s voice breaks when he moves into tears in the eyes of the members of the tourist team in front of the stage. <br /> <br /> I remember in the early seventies, when people scorned Paul. Because he was not involved in politics, like his former partner. They had to change their minds because Paul is a dedicated artist: "Glory is great because it allows you to do charity work." The film shows various aspects of the activities of Paul, an artist who is not selfish.
