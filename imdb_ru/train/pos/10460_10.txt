It was a good movie with a powerful message of love and redemption. I loved the transformation of the brother and the consequences of a terrible disease for the family. Well acting and directed. If there were any flaws, I would say that the story again showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties. What about all people of all cultures? I would like to watch a film where all these cultures are shown - as in real life. However, the film took off in terms of its values ​​and understanding how a disease can bring someone closer to its creator. Loved the movie and it caused tears in my eyes
