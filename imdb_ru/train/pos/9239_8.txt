As I said in my comment about the first part: these two films are better than most science fiction fans admit. <br /> <br /> The script for the second film is not so touching, since we donâ€™t see the destruction of human civilization, but subsequently thousands of refugees run into tiny space banks protected by only one powerful spaceship. <br /> <br /> But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story heats up, bringing the battle back to the Cylon planets. Okay, there is a bit of Mad Max in it, because all they are fighting for is fuel for their spaceships to travel to find a distant Earth, but it works for me. This is an exciting sci-fi entertainment with the participation of great actors and decent special effects (although they tend to repeat, if not more :-)). <br /> <br /> I would have liked the sequel to Starbuck and Apollo on the board. Instead, we got a second sequel without personal characters, which proved that the story worked before, especially because the character characters were so well chosen ... <br /> <br /> So the thumbs up for the 1980 productions, but the finger up for two films since 1978.
