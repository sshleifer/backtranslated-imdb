I saw the original English version on video. The Disney choice of voice actors looks very promising. Can't believe what I'm saying. The story of a young boy who meets a girl with a story that intertwines with his own. These two are thrown into one of the most amusing and intriguing plot lines in any animated film. The quality of the animation is great! If you've seen Disney work at Kiki's delivery service, you can see the quality of their production. He almost redeems them for stealing the story of Kimba, the white lion. (but not really!) Finally, Miyazaki films are being released properly! I can't wait to see the English version of Nausicaa!
