While I was a video store, I was looking through one-dollar rentals and came across this little gem. I don't know what it was about this, but I just had an instinctive intuition, and wow, I was right. <br /> <br /> The story tells about two girls who have just gone through school shooting. One of the girls is Alice, a teenage joke who is the only witness to a full attack, and the other is Deanna, another survivor who miraculously survived a bullet in the head. Killed by fate, they slowly begin to painfully and beautifully demonstrate healing and move on. <br /> <br /> I just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks. Because wow, what a play Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen, not to mention the other actors! My only complaint is that the DVD lacks special features. Oh, and some of the jumps in the film were pretty nasty. But overall a great movie.
