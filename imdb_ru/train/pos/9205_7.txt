This grew up on me. I love the music of RD Berman and, despite the coarse elements of this story, I found myself very touched as I continue to revise the film. I thought brother-sister storyline is very strong; there are also more likely obligatory things, such as bar fights, bad criminal history, etc., that simply distract. (Although, from a certain point of view, this is not funny.) In addition, the English translation was definitely made by someone for whom it was a bit tight, and no matter how crazy he was, I am grateful to him for that. <br /> As in many of the Bollywood films I have seen, this melodramatic and operatic, including here, first of all, is a song, sung first by a little boy, to cheer up on his humiliated and unhappy sister, and then the same song, sung 12 or a few years later, the man who went to Kathmandu, trying to reunite with this girl, grew up and was concerned (she was told that her brother and mother had died), anesthetizing her with drugs. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this 1971 film is that itâ€™s about the hippie movement that led the crowd of seekers to India, from the Indian point of view, who view them as people exiled to India by spiritual hunger caused by the flaws of their own societies, but nonetheless, in India, living only for the pleasures of the moment. Hippie scenes, singing, dancing, drugs are really wonderful and accurate in their tone (I'm old enough to remember), and I am sure that the masses of young white zoned children are real hippie stats, as I recall. hear about children in a caravan in the east, receiving such work in Bollywood. <br /> <br /> (This is not about the true movement of Hare Krishna, although the hippies from the film sing Krishna-krim Rama, as well as a group of real Indian non-hippie devotees in the opening scene of the film.) <br /> <br /> ~ virginia
