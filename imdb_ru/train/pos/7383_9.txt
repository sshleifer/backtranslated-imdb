Extremely intense thriller unfolds in the urban chaos of São Paulo, the third world's worst and ugliest nightmare in Brazilian urbanism. In order to facilitate the task of anyone who is interested in this intriguing and truly well-made film, it has a Mexican feature "Amores Perros" with a character not too far from Max Cady, from both Cape Fears, although this is not The case is not a film about the psychopath. Two partners (Alexander Borges and Marco Ricca) in a construction company pay killer Anisio (Miklos) for their third partner (and majority shareholder) in the specified construction equipment. The city is blamed for the murder, but everything starts to look very dark when Anisio’s witty and charismatic walking nightmare decides that he wants to be around very nervous accomplices of the crime, not only violating, but more importantly, destroying the strict social codes that make up Brazilian society. Anisio turns poverty into a relationship, and he wants to enter. Looks almost completely portable, grainy, the performances are outstanding in everything, especially with regard to the new actor (and a member of the classic Brazilian pop group 'Titãs'), Paulo Miklos, dazzles and upsets the Spectator with his rather funny social terror. <br /> <br /> I saw the film at the Brazilian Film Festival in November 2001. Since then, he has gone very well in Sundance and Berlin. Kleber Mendonça Filho
