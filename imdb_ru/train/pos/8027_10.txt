When I saw it for the first time, I was very impressed. The director created such a mysterious atmosphere, especially at the end. Throughout history, viewers can expect Richard to actually kill Thomas, or he will do it first. But ... the main thing is not the conflict, but friendship! Elderly and mature prayed to save the youngest, who has all life Life. It's amazing. Every time I watch it, I enjoy! Of course, he is rather cruel, like any action movie, but I think that is acceptable. Many thanks to Luis Lios and Tom Berenger! Awesome movie! I advise everyone to watch it. I am sure that people will not regret and have a really good time.
