The cast was good, and I thought it was a good performance by Christopher Lloyd, whom I love from previous films. This movie was a great family movie. Nothing that would make you worry to show it to younger children, a good storyline, lots of laughter, carefree and pleasant. If you want to entertain children, not bored to tears, it meets all the requirements. The baby is pleasant, and the parent is easy to watch.
