By the early seventies, the British horror film was in decline, but out of the darkness came three films that were some of the best produced on our island. Wickerman, the Blood on the Claws of Satan and the House that shed blood, made the future seem cloudless, although many people knew that by this time it would not be. THTDB has such a cast of actors who can easily make a wish list, if it was not actually assembled, in the gloomy outback of 2008 you can well expect to wake up. Waxworks is the most underrated of the four stories, and, of course, my favorite, Cushing's life and art are closely related, so you can't tell where the show ends and the pain begins. One can only guess how this role affected such a tender, sensitive person. Death and Virgo. Rest in peace, Peter.
