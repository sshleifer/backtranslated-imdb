As part of the celebration of the release of Casino Royale, this film was shown with the new Bond in the lead role from director Roger Michelle (Notting Hill). I almost turned it off for being a bit boring, but I'm glad I was stuck with it. In fact, Mae (Ann Reed) is a single mother, Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones), who hardly sees anyone and does not have a boyfriend for many years. Her daughter says she may want to marry her new boyfriend Darren (of course, Daniel Craig). Having only known each other for a few days, May and Darren have a secret affair. And at her age, with 30 with something, and with the new Bond ?! In any case, they clearly want to keep it a secret, but May regrets and wonders if Helen will find out. When she does, Darren gets less trouble than May. In fact, Elena asks her permission to hit her. Also starring Peter Vaughn as Toots, Danira Govic as Au Pair, Harry Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell as Rosie and Johnny English as Oliver Ford Davis as Bruce. Fine!
