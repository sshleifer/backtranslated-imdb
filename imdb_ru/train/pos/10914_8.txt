I saw the Thin Man series - Powell and Loy are certainly great, but there is something terribly sweet in this film about Powell and Arthur's chemistry. Gene Arthur shines when she looks at Powell. Between them the hidden current unmistakably buzzes. This film may not have the wit of the Thin Man series, but will undoubtedly compensate for this with charm. While I was watching him, I definitely thought that Powell was having an off-screen romance with Arthur. My friends thought the same. This is one film in which I would like to step back in time (to talk and cuddle up to Powell!) There seems to be no end to his sweet, playful smirks! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably the closest thing to the "perfect man." Well, that sounds too soft, but I can't help it.
