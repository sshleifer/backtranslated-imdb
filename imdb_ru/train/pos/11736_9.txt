Those who are not familiar with Cassandra Peterson's alter ego - Elvira - this is a good place to start. <br /> <br /> "Elvira, Lady of Darkness" begins with our heroine, who gets boobs that challenge gravity. message. It seems that her great-aunt died, and that she must be present to read the will. Seeking to raise money for the show, which she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to go in the hope of getting a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the place where she should go is the city of Falwell, Massachusetts. Due to the fact that her car broke down, she discovered that her great-aunt had left her three things: a house, a dog, and a cookbook. Residents of the city have a mixed reaction: teenagers love her, women hate her, and men crave for her (although they try to remain moral pillars of society). Her worst problem is her great uncle Vincent (V. Morgan Sheppard), because he wants her cookbook. Looks like a cookbook is a spellbook that will make it a more powerful warlock. <br /> <br /> The film is actually quite funny: Peterson, who is also Elvira, uses her “talent” and sexuality as a joke ( see two-headed things. ") not her boobs, of course).
