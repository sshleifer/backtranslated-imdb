This film began me with hitting Nick Cage. This is a story full of turns - a film about motives and moves. Of course, Dennis Hopper was a ham, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flynn Boyle are the perfect couple to catch the unsuspecting man who fell into their net. Everything in this film is good - cinematography, the pace of the plot and, most importantly, the end. Cage succeeds in what he does best - it is not to be a hero of action, but to be an ordinary person trapped in life.
