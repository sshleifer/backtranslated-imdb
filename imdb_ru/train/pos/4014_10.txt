Spoiler for those lucky enough to see this movie (so it really is not a spoiler). I saw this film when it was released and I still remember parts of it. This is all in a small town in the west or what's left of this city. It is more like a ghost town with a small number of inhabitants. Among them are a couple, where the wife is especially angry. She allows her man to die at the end of the film and leaves the city, but is forced to cross the desert. We never know what will happen to her next time, but just before she left her dying, she shoots her and deliberately does not beat her, but instead supplies water. She does not know that soon she will be very thirsty. Mark Damon kills a couple of bad guys in a funny manor - but that's another story I don’t remember very well. The remaining impression of the film was that it was the first time I saw a really evil woman in a film who pretends to be nothing more than evil — she cannot be compared to the witch in Snow White, which, in comparison with easy to recognize. Very tough western with a few main characters and still exciting.
