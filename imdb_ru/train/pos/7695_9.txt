Good Times was an innovative comedy about the first black family living in Chicago projects. Regardless of whether you live in central cities, ghettos, suburbs, or rural areas, this show is still a treasure to watch and watch as the family is just a family, not a show about a poor black family. But they do not dwell on it. They find humor and have strong family values ​​and morals. Despite the behind-the-scenes story, this show was worth keeping on the air, except that I didn’t like that they were killing my father, with whom I agreed with Esther Roll, who tried her best to save the family. But despite all the fights behind the scenes, Good Times was a family show. We all loved JJ dynamite and its antics. We watched as Penny Janet Jackson grew a little. This show was innovative to show despair in drugs, gangs and alcoholism. Without preaching, Evans always tried to do the right thing and not do something bad to get out of the ghetto.
