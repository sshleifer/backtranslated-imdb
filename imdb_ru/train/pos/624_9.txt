The summer was so full of blockbusters and film returns, and not to mention some of the frustrations of these returns, that I wished I could find a film that could just sit down and enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you don’t want to read further at the bottom of the page (there are no spoilers), I’ll summarize: he is more mature than Ella Enchanted (there are some doubtfully cruel) parts, a lot of death and a handful of scenes with a small amount of blood, not for small children), but does not try to be overly trivial or go beyond. Think of it as a more serious, slightly more magical princess Bride, and you will be there. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ ------------------- <br /> <br /> I may not be such a terrific movie buff as the others ... Maybe once or twice a month if i feel active i'm also a big fan of fiction and fantasy. I’m fed up with reworked recurring plot lines and movies with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this film is a diamond in a diamond. <br /> <br /> By the end here (August), I was tired of shattered expectations from big hits, which I avoided seeing the Bourne Ultimatum in favor of Stardust. When my transformers did not justify my hopes for an addiction to fiction, the Stardust preview seemed attractive, but I, of course, was on my guard. <br /> <br /> Like many others, I was surprised. I thought to watch another common fantasy movie that got out of here for breakfast. Do not be fooled, this is definitely a fairy tale, and there are indeed witches in it, magic, and it is absolutely necessary to suspend disbelief ... But the most refreshing thing I discovered is that it is NOT based on something that I "I saw or I've been reading for the last 15 years, and this is a really good film. <br /> <br /> ((Unlike 90% of other films that seem to constantly appear like spikes in their sides, perhaps a sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas? I could read a book this year, and in two years the film will be released as another “Epic Fiction a fairy tale like LotR and others, as the New York Times says, and the like, doubts.)) <br /> <br /> “Star dust” didn't make me hang out in my seat because of the crowded traffic at every turn, neither did I sweat from the bullets due to the hooking behind the hook, threatening to break the sharp tension from each other and echo throughout the theater into a loud boom. He did not even use huge beeps to draw my attention to what was happening on the screen (Transformers, I look at you). This is not an attempt to show the latest CGI methods, nor did it insult my intellect by muffled dialogues and subject lines that are simple enough, I could understand them in 3rd grade (boy, I hate them). <br /> <br /> I just ... watched. I watched and enjoyed the refreshingly CREATIVE storyline unfolding before my eyes. Of course, I could have known what was going to happen for most of the movie, but it makes you forget about it. It even made my heart beat in some places, but the most important aspect that I noticed was that I left the theater, feeling better than when I entered. <br /> <br /> This is really a gem. After such a rush this summer with so many remakes and films that didn’t meet my expectations, it was like a cold, sweet cup of tea to throw away all the hard work I did, sitting among others, trying to get out of them with the value of my money. <br /> <br /> This is probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you like fantasy movies that stand the test of time (Princess Bride, Black Cauldron, Dark Crystal, etc.), then you really should watch this movie. This little diamond gets into my DVD collection the moment it hits stores, you can trust me on this. <br /> <br /> Just great.
