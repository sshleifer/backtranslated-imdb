I believe I got this movie when I was young. I remembered watching it in my childhood, but I could not find the film. I remembered the good Reggie Ann, Andy, Babette, the Greedy, King Ku Koo. I searched high and low for this movie and still have no luck. But one day, when I was leaving my childhood home, I found him. We were reunited. I am now 17 years old. I still watch it. All the time really. This is one of the funniest and most touching films I've ever seen and enjoyed at the same time. And personally, I think they should make a sequel. Mm, yes, the sequel is valid. Now I even look at the captain bird tattoo somewhere on my body!
