A great movie. Great game of Mary Alice, Philip M. Thomas and young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in his role as an atlas. This film was one of the last mostly “black” films of the 70s, and unlike the films of “blissploation” of that era, this film really had a plot, and it was very well made. The soundtrack for the film, sung by Aretha Franklin, was popular in the R & B charts at the time.
