From the first scene I was very excited. "I can say it will be great!" I thought. The game was so good that I felt like hanging around the lives of these people. The music was also amazingly disturbing. The plot began with a sudden event, and then shifted (it was possible to feel) to some irrevocable fate. The assembly was slow, but I personally like these things, as long as calm tension persists and doesn’t go off the rails until it is ready to pay off. <br /> <br /> So everything goes well, and then the fireworks start, and before you know it, the loans roll. "WHAT KIND?!!!" that was all that I and my companion from the movie could say. If you understand the director's intentions, a blunt ending makes sense (for those of you who have already seen the movie, watch a very exciting and fun interview with Larry Fessenden on filmcritic.com), but I can't help but say it was not quite right. <br /> <br /> This could probably be solved in just ten minutes of the material before the climax. In any case, this is very bad. These ten minutes could change the world for the better. (But for those of you who do not write and do not make films, you should know that creating a plot with the proper time is a HUGE pain in the ass, and I certainly will not criticize it from any pedestal!) <Br / > <br /> Wendigo seems to me a masterpiece that was abandoned before it was completed. But, damn it, I would take any blunted masterpiece every day because of the overproduced piece of dog poop, over-compensated by too many digital effects (like most horror films these days). <br /> <br /> Another comment, Some scenes with monsters did not let me know if I should be afraid or laugh. I don’t know how to explain this, but Monty Python was very clear about this monster in its more explicit “monster” forms. Although it may sound like terrible criticism for a horror film - I don’t know, it still worked somehow awry for me. I will never again look at the horns of a deer in the same way! :)
