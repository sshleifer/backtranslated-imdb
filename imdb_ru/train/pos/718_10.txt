Rock and Roll High School was one of the best films ever made! I think the only reason it was so great was because of The Ramones! You could not make the same movie and put something like the Sex Pistols or The Clash instead of The Ramones, it just wouldn't be the same. Day Young, Clint Howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Voronov, Paul Barthel and Monters Hall, just added to the film. The whole movie about the Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone showed up when they saw rock and roll high school if you are a big fan of real punk. Not shitty new shit ... but loud and fast. The kind that only The Ramones could do. R.I.P (Rest in Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Di Di Ramone 1952-2002!
