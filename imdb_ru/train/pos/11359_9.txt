"Citizen X" tells about the real drama about the search for a serial killer, called "Rostov the Ripper." This magnificent film shows the long journey it took to try to catch the killer. The film shows how politics can prevent a murderer from running amok for more than 12 years. (Possibly more than 50 victims, mostly women and children) Stephen Reaâ€™s speeches as lead detective and Donald Sutherland as lead investigators were excellent. Jeffrey Demann as the Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is a type of film that hypnotizes you and immediately makes you explore the real world on the Internet. This movie is not to be missed. It debuted, I believe in HBO and never received a theatrical release to my understanding. Great movie
