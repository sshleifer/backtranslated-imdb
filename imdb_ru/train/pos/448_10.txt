I think this film is absolutely beautiful. And I mean not only breathtaking landscapes. We are talking about two unfortunate English housewives, who decided to rent an Italian castle to relax from their not very happy family life. As a result, four women together remove this place, all with different personalities and different reasons for staying there. In this magically beautiful place they all find peace to which they aspire, and what is interesting, the world comes from inner thoughts and decisions, more than without. I also find it wonderful because of the relationships that develop out of kindness and understanding. Action is the joy of watching yourself. I especially like the characters Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
