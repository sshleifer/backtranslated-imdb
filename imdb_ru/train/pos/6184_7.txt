Since this is Black History Month, and I look at the achievements of many African Americans in movies in chronological order, I received this film on VHS from the library because Duke Ellington and his Orchestra were present. Their jazz version of Ferenc Liszt's Rhapsody was the highlight of this overly enigmatic musical-musical comedy. Many other numbers I liked were especially Kitty's Sweet Marijuana, Cocktails for Two by Carl Brisson, as well as his duet with Carlyle this time, and those that Gertrude Michael, who is gorgeous as the woman you love to hate . Jack Okey and Victor McLaglen will probably last too long with their love and hate as a producer and detective story, but they are growing on you. And Toby Wing is Nancy's sexy, idiotic teaser who tries to say something to Oka, but every time he receives “Not Now” from him. While many characters have a motive for the killings that occur, I was not surprised by the discovery of who did this. And get an idea of ​​how naked women are here (although, of course, their breasts are covered with hands or some kind of fragile top). It was very obvious before the code. It is worth looking for any movie lover who is interested in such things. Postscript As a longtime resident of Louisiana, I like to celebrate when someone was born here, because Carlisle was a native of New Orleans.
