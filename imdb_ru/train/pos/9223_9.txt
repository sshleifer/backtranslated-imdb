Ashanti is a 70s film (to be exact, 1979). In a sense, it reminded me of the "Wild Geese" (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore in a mission in Africa). This is also a very good film, and I really liked it. <br /> <br /> David (Michael Kane), a doctor working in Africa, is married to a beautiful Ashanti woman named Anans (Beverly Johnson) who studied medicine in America, as well as a doctor. While they were treating, one day she was captured by slave traders working for an Arab slave trader named Suleiman (Peter Ustinov played well from all the people). The rest of the film is David trying to get her back. <br /> <br /> Michael Kane is, of course, a brilliant actor, he plays a character who is very determined and ready to do everything to get his wife back, but rather hopelessly with weapons and things. He is helped first by the Englishman leading the campaign against the slave trade, which no one recognizes (Rex Harrison!), Then briefly the pilot of the helicopter (William Holden), and then the Arab named Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has an account to negotiate with Suleiman (he is very intense, very interesting character), and so he travels with David to find him and return to Anans - this includes a wonderful scene in which David falls miserably on his camel. <br /> <br /> Then there are many adventures. There are also many questions about morality. The progress of this story is a bit predictable from now on, and there are several freedoms taken with the plot to promote things faster, but all this is quite forgivable. The question is, will David get to Ananas before Peter Ustinov sells it to Omar Sharif (yes, of course, he has Omar Sharif in it!)?
