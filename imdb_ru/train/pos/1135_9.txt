I first saw it at the cinema when it came out, and the crowd was really fascinated by the film, which made this experience even more exciting. This is a great set of characters, there are a lot of big names in it, some of which were not as recognizable then as they are now. I think it's a good idea if you follow any of these actors or like them in other films to add to your watch list. Some scenes actually remind me of a well-made comedy, for example, in “Cage with birds” or even “Clue”, about some strange comedy that appears spontaneously, with the truly professional participation of these favorite actors. The film did a great job, giving you some insight, perhaps even a very realistic one, about the culture of day soap.
