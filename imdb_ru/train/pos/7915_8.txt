This is the "odisess through time" with the help of computer animation, supposedly the work of more than 300 artists. Made in the late 80s and released in 1990, it was an ultramodern material for the day. I thought it was good and quite interesting in some places. <br /> <br /> Most of the short scenes didn’t make sense, just shapes that go into other shapes, but it was interesting to watch. It's all about visual effects, not about any story. There were some strange sequences in which strange looking men danced around with overheard birds. All this - computer animation, which was then new. Even the term "computer animation" was not well known. <br /> <br /> It’s just an opportunity to showcase this new technology in short, cartoon-like episodes with beautiful colors and original scenes. No words, only pictures with electronic music. Stoners must have enjoyed it very much. <br /> <br /> These are pleasant, intriguing 40 minutes of "eye candies" and "head candies". Because of today's effects of computer graphics, this may be lost, but I think you will still have fun with it.
