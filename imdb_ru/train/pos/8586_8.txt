Welcome back, Kiefer Sutherland. It’s been a long time since you were in the movie and what kind of movie it was, was it 24 no, but very intriguing, especially with a professional like Michael Douglas as the main secret service agent. The character of Kiefer is haunted by Michael Douglas the whole film, Kiefer’s partner, Eva Longoria, Desperate Housewife. wow, she really can play besides flirting all day and look good, although I would like Kim Bassinger to play a more important role, but other than that, I really think the whole movie was a blast from beginning to end. This film is what I consider to be a political thriller, everyone played a part in it. nothing was found in the film so that you would always guess. and I really think Kiefer did a great job here in this film, but in my opinion Michael Douglas was the best representative of the day, by a large margin.
