To my surprise, I really liked the latest animated release of Disney. The film had its flaws, but overall, I felt that the story was strong, and it was easy to communicate with the characters. It was also nice to see Disney's animated film, which was not a musical. I was almost driven to the limit with Tarzan. Fortunately, they gave the music a rest. Another nice feature of the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbfounded (a la Hercules), rather thin, so it still made the kids laugh, not causing adults dizziness or just nonsense. One disappointment was the animation. With all the great animated films taking place outside of Disney's studios, you might think that they would move on and catch up a little. There is something that can be said about tradition, but imagine possibilities with the history of Atlantis! In general, the film was interesting, and definitely worth a visit multiplex. <br /> <br />
