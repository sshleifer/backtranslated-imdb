Many of the reviews and commentaries that I read about this movie say that this is a rather stale movie and a performance by Clara Bow. Although the storyline was rather typical of Clara’s late silence, I still find it somewhat exhilarating and incredibly fun. Clara plays a happy Hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves ... not to mention that this man is married! Clara’s lack of modesty was a shocking day, but I believe it gives sweetness and general fun to the film. Although this film is definitely not a brilliant storyline (in fact, quite typical), it is a good demonstration of Clara's ability to make the audience laugh.
