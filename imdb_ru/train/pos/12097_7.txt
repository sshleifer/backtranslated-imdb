This complex story begins quite simply: an English journalist accepts bets from Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood that he cannot spend the night in a haunted castle in Blackwood. Once there, the writer wanders through dusty rooms and corridors until the music and a glimpse of the waltzing pair lead him into an empty room. He sits down at the harpsichord and starts playing the melody he heard, and is surprised when the strikingly beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood pats him. She informs him in an ambiguous charming / creepy way that she prepared his room upstairs and that someone is always waiting for this night ... The night of the dead. So begins an amazing series of supernatural events that perplex the journalist for the rest of the night. Spoiler ahead: probably not too many viewers will be surprised to learn that dear Elizabeth is really a ghost. This does not prevent her from falling in love with a journalist, but complicates the situation for them than for an ordinary couple. This is a funny movie that has absolutely everything: ghosts, a creepy castle, repetitive visions of past events, sex and violence (although both were softened in the version that most Americans have seen over the years). The charming, charming Barbara Steele is the main reason to see this. She has a strange charisma, unlike everyone you've ever seen in movies. Featured!
