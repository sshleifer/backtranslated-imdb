This 1939 film directed by John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti tells a fictional story about young lawyer Abraham Lincoln, his or her trials (literally) and his misfortunes. This is a sentimental film, shot well enough, but hardly breathtaking. Casting Henry Fonda in the role of Lincoln seems to be a mistake, because although the actor had the right sad qualities for the role, even with a few inches of makeup and a false nose, he is too handsome for Honest Abe, who was coolly domestic. This is a good attempt at Funds, which is nothing if not sincere, but its blunders cast off the entire film. However, the cast is great and includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Mick. But Ford is too respectful in his treatment of Lincoln, who is considered to be just a shy saint, and in the final scene the film goes far beyond.
