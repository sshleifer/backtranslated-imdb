I just came back from the show a couple of hours ago, and I was very pleased with the movie when I left it. It is very intense, and the closest thing I cried to the cinema after a while. This is the merit of Adam Sandler, who has shown excellent results on many levels and who probably deserves an Oscar nomination if he did not come out so early this year. Don Cheadle demonstrates his usual superb performance by performing a straightforward treatment of the agitated Adam. <br /> <br /> There is some humor, but in most cases itâ€™s really fun compared to the tear moments, as Adam deals with his loss and Don struggles to help him. Adam plays very well on two levels ... when he is mentally stable, he is funny and pleasant, but when he is, well, less stable, he is strong and dark. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who loves intense spiritual dramas about difficult friendship and loss.
