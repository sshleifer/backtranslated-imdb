It's nice to see a film that you think will end well, like almost any other American film, and then be surprised when this does not happen. I like the happy ending just like the next guy, but sometimes it’s better to portray things in a more realistic way, and I thought that Brokedown Palace did it very well. <br /> <br /> The end, mostly sacrificing with one friend for the sake of another, thus redeeming her former bad behavior, which first of all involved them in the situation, was very touching. I would almost prefer to do without the last line, which would prove that she didn’t really do what she admitted, because it would have made the film more about friendship between the two girls, and not about crime. She did it or not is not so important. <br /> <br /> The story itself clouded with clichés, but the actresses kept my attention with their magnificent views. Very realistic, very exciting. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
