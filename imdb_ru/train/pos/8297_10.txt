Cool film in two directions. In his favor, it is directed by Wes Craven. On the other hand, the budget of television films shows that there could be much more with a large budget. This is promoted when Susan Lucci draws Robert Urichemeli into his paws and tries to convince him of the secret of his health club. His latest invention, a spacesuit that can analyze people or things, becomes unexpectedly useful in his new area. Anyone who sees this should pay attention to Susan Lucci. Her appearance and performance had unexpected consequences a few years later. Actor, scientist and parapsychologist Stephen Armour is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film. Lucci became the subject of his portrait, which served as the basis for the work of a nanny named Ekaterina. The portrait of Lucci and Barbara Steele in Black Sunday was used as a reference to the portraits of Catherine, which were immediately removed by Armour. Probably due to the personal nature of the artist and Catherine. Thus, having seen both films, we can get an idea of ​​another story and the appearance of an unknown woman who will make an interesting film.
