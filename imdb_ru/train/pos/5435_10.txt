I saw this picture in 1940 for $ 11, and I would like to receive a DVD in 2006. The film was the greatest adventure of that time and, like all epic films, still remains a miracle of entertainment (b / w and all). a real friendship in chemistry between the actors and the speeches of Sam Jaffe and Eduardo Cianelli are outstanding "The Untouchable" Today they do not make films of this character. The only cast that is still alive is Joan Fontaine.
