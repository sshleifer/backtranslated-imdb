I am amazed at how this movie (and most others have an average of 5 stars and below, when on IMDb there are crappy movies, an average of 7 to 10 stars). The fan mentality is striking again. When this movie came out, almost everyone hit it. Even my Former Girl said that this film is dubious. Years later, I sat down to watch this movie, and I really liked it. Even a little laugh. This and the "Killer to replace" - these are films in which people called the director Antoine Fuqua black Michael Bay. I don’t understand how most Fukui films are smarter than anything Michael Bay invented. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Story: Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) - a former convict, Used by Treasury agent Edgar (David Mors) as a pawn to catch a killer named Bristol (Doug Hutchinson). Every movement of Alvin is tracked by an error implanted in his jaw after an accident. As long as these agents follow Bristol, Bristol, after the gold bricks that were taken in the robbery, went awry. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is as cheerful as Alvin Sanders. Alvin quickly speaks, he is much smarter than he allows. Doug Hutchinson is fine, like Bristol. He may be excessive sometimes in his behavior of John Malkovich. Here he was better than Looney Bean Jim in the Punisher: Military Zone game. David Morse is good as a treasury agent. Even Mike Epps is funny, like Alvin's brother, Stevie. Both he and Jamie had some funny moments on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only drawback of the film is that some thriller attempts failed. The scenario on the track for racing is too complicated, but I could not look away. The director did his best to get points for this. In addition, the scene of a bomb blast with a treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator was lying on the door was pretty elegant. <br /> <br /> In general, “Bait” ​​is a good film when viewed far away. It's never boring, it's always fun, and I haven't checked my watch every minute. That should mean something. Lure is one of the most underrated films of the 2000 period. <br /> <br /> PS: to a reviewer who claimed that this film is too cruel ... How long have you been living under a rock? I'm sure you saw the Die Hard series and EVERYONE Quentin Tarantino film. But these films are not cruel, right? Weirdo.
