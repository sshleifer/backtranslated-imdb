Now this show is like most other shows of this type since the mid-90s, but the only thing about it is that it’s different, they use a lot of comedy and action in this and maybe a little drama. also. I personally thought it was a good show, I can't understand why they canceled it. It's good that the fans of this show are still alive since 1997. <br /> <br /> I hope that the WB will return the show or even make a film that I know is going to be impossible, but hey, it’s not painful to dream, is it? <br /> <br /> In any case, I would recommend, if you hadn’t seen it, find the DVD of all 13 episodes, because the characters are wonderful, the plot lines are good, the comedy is good and good, the whole show is just great.
