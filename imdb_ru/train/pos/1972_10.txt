I do not understand your objection to this film. This is a tight, exciting continuation of the character created in the "Basic Instinct". The only part of the story that is least unrealistic is the fact that the character Sharon Stone is still alive and not in prison at this late date. <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILER: As the film progresses, three theories of what is happening are presented: 1) the character Sharon Stone kills all these people because she is crazy (Risk Addicted); 2) Curve cop David Theulis kills these people to substitute the character Sharon Stone; 3) David Morrissey, the analyst, kills these people for the sake of revenge. What grieves most people in the film is that none of these theories has ever been explained as a “real” story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric hospital for the murder of a policeman; the only murder that takes place on the screen.) Who cares what is real? The blonde is really crazy, the cop is really crooked, and the analyst really wants revenge. The interaction between these and other characters in the story is important. As in real life, everything is more complicated than anyone thinks, and reality is more complicated than cinema. Get over it!
