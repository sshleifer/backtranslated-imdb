One of my favorite shows in the 80s. After the first season, he began to descend when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to the cast. Deborah Pratt was wonderful, and it was fun to watch her and Ernest Borgnine's character face each other. The last episode in which she appeared was one of my favorites in the second season. Unfortunately, in those days, Black did not last long on television shows. In some episodes of the second season, everything was in order, but in the third season it was more about human characters than about Airwolf, and it was not shown almost until the end of the show. When it went to the USA, it was disgusting !!!
