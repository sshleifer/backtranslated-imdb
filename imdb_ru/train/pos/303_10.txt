From the day I watched this film, when it was released in 1981, it was one of my three favorites. The announcement I wrote for Amazon is shown below, and I'm just glad that it will finally be released on DVD 10/17/06 - the 25th anniversary of the film. <br /> <br /> The last credit in this film explains his appeal - “Thank you to the people of Manhattan, on whose island it was filmed.” A charming and witty romantic comedy is a love story written by New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich - a native) who can define every place (West 12th Street, Ansonia, old FAO Schwarz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Bridget, and the limits of the city that was country and western club). It seems that the entire cast is clicked off-screen as well as on the screen, and this proximity is clearly conveyed. I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS. It was not only an ode to Dorothy Stratten, but Audrey Hepburn's last appearance (she had a cameo role after this film), and her inner beauty was leaking from the screen. Buy it, make a large bowl of popcorn and roll up with your loved one.
