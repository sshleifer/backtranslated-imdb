Itâ€™s wonderful to put together ... I wish that after this documentary there was a continuation of the lives of some and a celebration of the lives of others who died ... there must be a second part ... a real one. It was great .. the film was not long enough ... I would like to know why the filmmaker did not follow !! this is so important for the community period ... well, if you are reading this, please think about making another documentary of this kind ... I'm very tired of hearing from naive authors like AIDS and men go together when they they do not; in fact, this is hetero, which we need to study ... in this film it was not even mentioned HIV or AIDS, and I was very happy for that ... I really appreciated decays and definitions. Thank you very much for allowing this film to exist.
