The best show since the time of Seinfeld. She is really very funny. Her absolute self-centeredness, gay's huge neighbors, excerpts in songs or cartoons make this the most recent show on television. One of the few performances that I watch. The scene with the wise old black lady in the pharmacy (“oh, wait now that you are near, you look old” turns her face with her finger and leaves) so stupid, it's just a lot of fun. The weak points of the show are her sister and only the police because they are damn normal !! I really can't wait for the next show, something that I haven’t felt for a long time.
