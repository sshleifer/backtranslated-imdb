For me, this is the most perfect film of Ealing Studio - just as fresh and relevant half a century later as it was on the day it was released. <br /> <br /> As a satire about the economic concepts of “growth” and commercial necessity, embedded obsolescence, it can hardly be more relevant. And what other movie can we say that the hero literally carries the plot? <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, there are parallels with the Jurassic Park, in which mixing with the environment will literally turn around and bite you. But Spielberg dodged the brilliant central vanity of the book in order to tackle some nonsense about "children." Hmmm <br /> <br /> In the film “A Man in a White Suit”, Alec Guinness plays a young idealist scientist who comes up with clothes that never get dirty and do not wear out. Suddenly, workers and capital in the northern English mill, where he works, unite, more than ever before, to protect their livelihoods. <br /> <br /> Of course, being Eling, this is a comedy, but this should not be. The complex interaction of self-serving (should this fit?) Interests unfolds perfectly, because one after another, all parties understand that “progress” is a threat, and accessibility and waste are what make the looms rotate. <br /> <br /> But yes, this is a comedy - albeit a sharpened one - and amidst political irony there are amazing performances and some kindly old-fashioned laughter. <br /> <br /> However, this biting satire that endures is dazzling and white.
