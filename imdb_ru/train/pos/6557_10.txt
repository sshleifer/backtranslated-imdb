I'm a 53 year old college professor. I went with my wife and 12-year-old daughter. We all liked the movie. The film is original, witty, dynamic and absolutely charming. The plot was easy enough for a 10-year-old to follow, but winding enough to interest an adult. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job and the rest of the cast was just fine. My only criticism was that the sets in Los Angeles were not as interesting as they should have been. They were functional, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were excellent. Overall, I thought it was an absolutely enjoyable experience. I am disappointed that professional critics (almost all adult men) brutally attacked the film. Apparently, they have something against films that depict strong, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings reveal more about their own sexist nature than anything about this wonderful family film. I highly recommend this to every child and every parent.
