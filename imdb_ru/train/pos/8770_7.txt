I meant GOOD, believe me. It is a fact of life, it is not. The whole thing Oyrish becomes quite thick, but you really enjoy the cast here - Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Froley, etc. Everything is fine. I also liked to see Mike Mazurka. Of course, he played a boxer, what else? Typical forties cartoons, teeming with familiar faces and booming scenes, one after another. <br /> <br /> Flynn is fine, like Gentleman Jim, you probably never go through a one-dimensional look at him or others here, but everything is fine, this is a caricature and intended for pleasure, that's all. The boxing scenes were pretty good, Ward Bond's logging was a riot, and you couldnâ€™t wait to see all these bobby billy clubs rush to the stage several times. <br /> <br /> Really a lot of fun, Flynn was on the roll at the time, and it's clear why viewers loved him. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
