I was very touched when I watched the movie. How could Johnny have kept such hope, and faith was terrific. so many people only care about what they want, and fuss about what they don't have. and they are such little things as dudes, money for a new car. I saw people in tears because of vice. This film brings everything to the basics. love, rely on the beauty of simple but very important things in life. This makes our everyday problems visible, because they are small and really unimportant. You are watching this boy, and you understand that while you were blessed with food, a roof over your head and your loved ones. You are truly blessed. I know that Johnny will see this, and I want to thank him for sharing with me such faith, strength and humor.
