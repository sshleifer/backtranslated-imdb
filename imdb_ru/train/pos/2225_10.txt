I am completely shocked that this show was canceled. It lasted only one year. I just recently started watching it, and I like it. This is a show that could go as far as Friends. It was humorous and extremely pleasant. <br /> <br /> About 2 brothers and 2 sisters live under the same roof without parents. Kurt (Joey Lawrence) plays the role of an older brother and plays a more paternal role. <br /> <br /> This should last much more than a year since it was fantastic. Awesome show with all the best actors. <br /> <br /> 10/10
