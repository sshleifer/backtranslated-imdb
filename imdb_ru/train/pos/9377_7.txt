Surprise-thriller with a large number of turns and double crosses than for scribbles. A great cast, mixing it with an intriguing plot, controlled by the influence of Twin Peaks in director Dahl. Nicolas Cage is a very underrated actor who demonstrates a magnificent image of a man in a stalemate searching for the right things. J.T. Walsh (RIP for a great actor) is always a wonderful villain, as is Dennis Hopper. This is such a shame that he never did for a higher profile in business. I am sure he has followers. Overall, this is a great movie that shows you that you don't need a big bang or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining movie.
