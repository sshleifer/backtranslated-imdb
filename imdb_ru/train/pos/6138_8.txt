This is an old-fashioned, surprisingly cheerful children's film, in which, undoubtedly, is the most attractive newcomer in history. Unlike many modern stories that seem to revel in dark witchcraft, this is just a fairy tale about a focal point, sweet, thoughtless and charming. <br /> <br /> The story takes place back in 1940 in an English village of Peppering Eye, where three Cockney children, Charlie, Carrie and Paul Rollins, are evacuated due to the danger of air raids during World War II. They are mistakenly sent to live with Eglantine Price, who studies by correspondence to become a witch's student. Eglantine and a trio of kids use the magic bed pen to travel to London on their flying bed. Here they run into Emilius Brown, the fraudulent director of Miss Price’s home study school. Miss Price begins work on spells designed to animate inanimate objects. Meanwhile, they also have to deal with a dark character, who is called the Bookman and his partner, Swinburne. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury is certainly amazingly lovely, like an eccentric witch in training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Brown, the director of the defunct school of witchcraft, which has now become a street magician. This actor previously starred in the role of father of children in the film Mary Poppins. In fact, this film is a story rather reminiscent of the earlier Mary Poppins, both wonderful fantastic stories for children. Perhaps in this film there is no such memorable music as “Chim-Chim-Sherry”, but there are some attractive little melodies in it. Some of them were critical, but the film has great special effects. In general, the story fascinates the whole family. It is a pity that modern children are too sophisticated for this cute and charming story, which should please the child in all of us.
