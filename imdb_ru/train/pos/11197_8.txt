Another silent film about Hitchcock's love triangle is not a mystery, but very English, very dynamic and photographed. Sleek boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) recruits Jack Sander’s "One Round" circus boxer (Karl Brisson) to be his sparring partner, partly to keep handsome but fickle Mabel (Lillian Hall-Davis) nearby. At the wedding of Jack and Mabel many actors and grotesques, and those who stand in the church aisle, are shocked to see very tall and very short men, a fat lady, Siamese twins, who, of course, argue about which side of the passage to sit, and the wedding feast is amusing. In the rest of the film, Jack loses Mabel and returns to her heart, or something like that. It was a completely different era, when the audience was in evening dresses, and the boxers also changed clothes when they entered the ring. The camera angles, tempo, use of symbols, clipping are all very stylish and expert. Working with the camera and editing the last match is very exciting. Brisson's appearance is well used in this; his smile doesn’t forget so much about what is happening around him, how he plays in the Hitchcock film Manxman, and is therefore not annoying. But can boxers have such dimples?
