"Family matter" takes us back to a less complicated time in America. Soberly see how it was otherwise. It was a more innocent era in our country, and we observe how the “functional” family deals together. The film also marks the beginning of a series about the Hardy family. <br /> <br /> The film, made by George Zeitz, is based on a successful play. Judge James Hardy and his wife Emily face an internal crisis that needs to be overcome. Married daughter Joan returns home after making a social mistake, and her husband finds her responsible. At the same time, another daughter, Marion, brings home a beautiful woman, who, obviously, will face her father. The happy teenage teenager Andy seems to be the only one who has no problems, until his mother makes him accompany Polly to dance, which he does not want to do. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, Judge Hardy will prove why he knows this best of all, because he implements the plan to bring everyone together. In the end, he is a man who understands not only the law, but also how to deal with those external forces that threaten his position in society and what will make his family happy. <br /> <br /> Lionel Barrymore plays the judge Hardy with conviction. He is the glue that holds everything together. In the spring, Byington is visible as Emily, the mother. Mickey Rooney has a small role in this film, but, as always, it's fun to watch. Cecilia Parker and Julie Heydon appeared as daughters Marion and Joanne. Sarah Hayden and Margaret Marquis also appear in the film as Aunt Millie and Polly, a girl who surprises Andy with her beauty. <br /> <br /> “Family matter” is a good way to see our past through a positive image drawn from an American family.
