I don’t think about it at all, but my friend said that the first thing he thought when he heard the name “Midnight Cowboy” was gay porn. At that moment, all I knew about it was the mention of it in the Seinfeld episode, in which Jerry tried to take Cramer to Florida on this bus, and Kramer was sick and had a nosebleed. <br /> <br /> The film was gorgeous and surprisingly optimistic, and not all are as pretentious and pretentiously pessimistic as some films that I don’t even remember because they are all crap. <br /> <br /> The plot basically consisted of the naive young cowboy Joe Buck in New York trying to be a bully (mostly a male prostitute), thinking it would be easy to choose, just hit the brick wall when the woman will finish pushing him, accusing him of having sex. <br /> <br /> Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, who everyone calls Ratso, and the cute gay guys who constantly laugh at him. You think of him as a villain, but attractive (like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian), and it's amazing that he and Joe become friends, and the film is so cute and heartbreaking, watching them be friendlier and the like. Rizzo shows himself to be a sad, miserable man who is very sick, very depressed and shy, hates being called Ratso and wants to go to Florida, where he thinks that life will be much better and all his problems will be resolved and he will learn to be a cook and become famous there. <br /> <br /> It’s terrible to see Joe doing everything he does to take them both to Florida, along with many fun moments (for example, Ratso tries to steal). the food at that hippie party was caught by a woman who said, “Gee, it's free. You don't need to steal it, ”and he says,“ Well, if it's free, then I didn't steal it, ”and this classic moment, completely unrecorded and unplanned, when Hoffman almost gets hit by this taxi, he shouts:“ Hey I go here! I go here! “), and the game is so believable, you would never have believed that Joe Buck would grow into an outstanding and respected actor John Voight, and Ratso Rizzo grow into legendary and beloved Dustin Hoffman. This is not the first time they work together in leading roles, but the chemistry is so thick and intense. <br /> <br /> Then there is the sad part, which I think is rather an exaggeration to call it “depressed.” Ratso Rizzo falls apart throughout the film, can barely walk, barely eat, coughs a lot gets sick and gets head in a bus by a put to Florida. He has a lot of pain, and only a few miles from Miami, he finally dies on the bus. The bus driver assures everyone that it’s okay, and continues. Sad, but not in a way that would make you go home, cry and sit back as if you just lost your dog for 13 years. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a great movie, and the soundtrack largely consists of "Everybody's Talking", played throughout the film at the right time. A strange but great move, as the song is good and fits perfectly with the tone of the film. Go look, it's great, go buy it
