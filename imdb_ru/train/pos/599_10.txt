I really liked this film, because in action was sincere sincerity. The letter was top notch. James Arness is a great actor, and he showed it here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davey Crockett, and can anyone really play Davy apart from Thess Parker? <br /> <br /> Another great actor in this movement was Raul Julia, who gave depth to Santa Anna, a vain and complicated person who led Mexico in turbulent times. <br /> <br /> Although some may think that the film is slowly turning around, a battle unfolded in it, when a lot of tedious action unfolded, followed by a couple of hours of terrible horror. <br /> <br /> What struck me most in this film is that it made you think about the reason and how some people are willing to die for what they believe. In our time, when no one supports anything, I found it refreshing, think that there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how you feel about the politics of that time.
