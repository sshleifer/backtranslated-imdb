I've already seen it about 10 times, so it must be something in it that I like! <br /> <br /> American science fiction films of the 50s were largely a mixed bunch: they were either intellectually made and / or thought provocation or cheap and funny cheese. "Forbidden Planet" - in some way, and then, and more, but in this rarity for the genre - color. <br /> <br /> She also had a start with the script - although Shakespeare may not have recognized him, he was based on his timeless play and, therefore, guaranteed a certain amount of longevity if everything was done well. <br /> <br /> This is a story of a murderous man, artificially enlarged infinitely by machines, on which a dead race remained, which was included 200,000 years ago. Along the way, the plot is replete with stereotypes of the 50s and corn so pure that sometimes you wonder why you watch it, but always do. This thing of the love triangle ... yuc! Disney cartoons still hold on well, and cartoons backgrounds directly from the covers of Galaxy magazine, etc. Look good even after 50 years. Robbie driving a car in the desert in the far distance is a scream! <br /> <br /> In general, with all the flaws, the best of its kind, and we should be grateful that such a pristine imprint has been preserved.
