Think, Pierce Brosnan, and you think courteous, cheerful, intelligent James Bond. In this film, Brosnan plays against the font - and he has a lot of fun (as well as the audience). This film is about a hired killer who is friends with a worried businessman ... and it works! <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie with very good scenes (exciting, on the edge of Brosnan and Good, compliant, Kinnear has some good features). The only thing that bothers me is that Hope Davis, who plays such a tolerant wife (“Can I see your gun?”), Does not appear more often: she could be an amazing foil for these people. <br /> /> This film looks like a matador: he plays with the audience, and “kills”. The ending is awesome because the storyline appears (with a positive moral!): This is a crazy, insane and funny movie that deserves a wide audience.
