The VAN is a simple picture for teenagers, created especially for driving, which does everything possible to make you feel comfortable, providing many opportunities to laugh and cry with friends. Danny DeVito plays a small but numerous role as a car wash manager and almost steals the show! All the leading roles are well developed, the characters are complex and the direction is quite competent for this type of pictures. Crown International Release.
