Stories ?? Whether written, visual or poetic epic ?? Generally try to avoid too many characters; In the end, readers and viewers may be too overwhelmed, trying to track down who is who. This is especially true in the cinema, I think, simply because we cannot easily return to refresh our memory in the cinema. For viewers like me, there is no such problem, because we see all our films on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> A year ago, I was introduced to Audrey Tothou, a French actress, whom I first saw in Ameli Poulain’s fairy tale (2001), and then in A Very Long Engagement (2004), both of which were elaborate and complex stories with lots of characters. This early offering transcends others in both directions: more characters and more complexity. <br /> <br /> Now other directors have already used these techniques: Robert Altman with The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001), and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer made it in 1963 in "Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World", a comedy of almost epic proportions. The difference with this film is that, firstly, the director allows us to “see” in the head of some characters, and secondly, some scenes are repeated as a means to refresh the memory of the viewer when the story turns over at different periods of time. /> <br /> Highlights ?? core so to speak ?? This story concerns a young woman, Irene (Tothou), whom one of the commuter train passengers said she would meet her true love that day. This happens in the first few minutes of the movie. The clever irony is that Irene does not realize that the young man on the contrary (Gilbert Robin) can be this "only true love." And at the same time he ... <br /> <br /> They follow different paths, not realizing the potential significance of their close acquaintance. However, chaos occurs during the rest of the day, not only for two young people, but also for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of artfully constructed and interwoven vignettes that seem to lead nowhere, and yet ... < br /> <br /> If the story were just like that, it could be boring and even quite predictable. Not this way. The script and the director justify our expectations with a multitude of innovative scenes that are too ordinary, but turn into believable, unusual events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again. For example, when the next time some bird from heaven falls on your book or paper, think about your alternatives; the two characters make the obvious choice, which must happen before Irene and her fate meet again. Or how about a stone crumb flying on your windshield? Think again what will happen ... <br /> <br /> All this is quite interesting. What was more interesting for me was the assessment of every new person who came and tried to decide whether this guy was ONE for Irina, or was it actually a young man on the train. It made me guess for a while. <br /> <br /> I'll let you think about it if you see this amazing prank. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
