** Possible spoiler *** Adam Sandler usually plays a role in a comedy, but in the movie "Reign" gives a very touching presentation. Although there are people who showed courage facing the post of September 11, 2001, Sandler plays Fineman, a widower who is lonely. and "lost in their own world." Johnson (Cheadle), a practicing dentist, meets his old college friend (Sandler) and wants to catch up in the “old days”. We see how in “Rain Man” (Dustin Hoffman), Feinman He also becomes emotional and detached in stressful situations. Music in the style of Aldis, apparently, is a consolation and "psychological" support for him. <br /> <br /> Johnson is looking to Fineman for something of a certain pleasure and ease that his family lacks. He also feels unhappy and dissatisfied with his work. At the same time, he also wants to make sure that his friend does not fall through social “cracks”. I left this film, with a different look and more sympathetic to Compassion for grieving families.
