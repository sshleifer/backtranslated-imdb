The first thing I thought after watching “Mysterious People” was how could this film be so unpopular? I found this film so delightful and funny that its status as a bomb defies logic. Well, I hope that in the future it will become a cult hit, and you can count me among his fans. <br /> <br /> Simply put, and without giving away too much, this film does for comics what “The Princess Bride” for fairy tales and “Who Framed Roger Rabbit?” did for classic cartoons. That should give you more an exact idea of ​​the tone of the film than of the marketing committee, to which he unfortunately signed up (this is one of such cases as “Iron Giant”, when the studio had no idea what he had in his hands). its next time you have a mood for something a little unusual. You are great You will not listen to BeeGees in the same light.
