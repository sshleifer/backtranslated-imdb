When I first saw this movie on cable, it immediately became one of my favorite movies. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film paints an accurate picture of the South and racist sentiment. Most of the views came from Sall, the old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor. Soll is what makes the move, his funny conversations give us an idea of ​​how the South was then. I believe that if Soll lived today, he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, his attitude towards the little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex. Although he has racist views, he grew up to trust some convicts who are all black. The two prisoners he trusts most of all are Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). Conversations between Ben and Soll are the best in the film, they contain real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both, but also in excellent performances, and in the role of Hass. <br /> <br /> This film was supposed to become more famous. However, it is on DVD and costs money. <br /> <br /> Raivin
