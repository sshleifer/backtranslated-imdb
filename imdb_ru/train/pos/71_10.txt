I could not believe the comments on the film. <br /> <br /> When I read horrible opinions about the film, I wondered if you actually watched the same movie as me. <br /> <br /> What I saw was incredible! I think the actresses and the director did a fantastic job in the film. <br /> <br /> I used to have no pleasure to see any of the actresses, and I could not be more disappointed with the incredible work that they did. <br /> <br /> What I donâ€™t see is why everyone has such a problem with choosing the drug Dinah in an attempt to commit a suicide scene. Judging by the comments, it sounds like it's a choice of actresses and her stupid choice. What I do not understand is a film written by someone else and directed by someone else, since this may be a mistake of actresses that I do not see. I think it was a really believable film that I would like to watch again and recommend. Opinions are that which is, and it is very bad that many of them are so near. I hope to see one of the actors soon, and I think that everyone played excellent roles. <br /> <br /> The busy Phillips will someday become the highest paid actress, and I hope that she will be able to laugh in front of all who criticized her! You go, girl!
