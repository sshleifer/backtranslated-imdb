This move actually made me jump out of the chair, waiting for what the actors are going to do! Acting was the best, Farra should have won an Oscar, for that she was incredible. James Rousseau was so good that I hated him, he was a villain and he played it wonderful. There are not so many films that would chain me to this. The cast was great, Alfie looked shocked with those big eyes, Farra looked like a victim, and you experienced her horror again when she went through it. Farrah made you feel that you were there and felt the same anger that she felt, that you wanted her to hurt him, but you also knew that it was wrong. In the film, you skated on a roller coaster, and you walked back and forth with each scene.
