Reda is a young Frenchman of Moroccan origin. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is very French in relationships and values. Suddenly, his father announces that Reda will take him on a hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca - that Reda is not interested, but agrees only because of obligations. As a result, from the very beginning Reda is angry, but, being a traditional Muslim, it is difficult to talk or discuss his fears with his father. Both father and son seem very tough and inflexible - and very ironic when dad tells his son that he should not be so stubborn. <br /> <br /> When I read a resume, it tells you how many characters grew up and began to get to know each other. However, I really do not think they did, and this is the exciting and sad aspect of the film. Of course, there were times of mutual understanding, but so often there were hidden manifestations of hostility and repression. I really liked it, and I realized that there was no full resolution of it - no matter how false it might seem. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is well-played and entertaining, giving Westerners an unusual understanding of Islam. and hajj. It also provides an exciting juxtaposition of traditional Islam and the secular young generation. Although the slow pace and lack of clarity in the relationship throughout the film can annoy some, I think it gave the film an intense realism and made it look like a movie about people, not like some kind of formula. Good and unusual movie.
