I was 15 years old when the premiere of this film took place on television. Being brought up in Texas, I realized the boredom and monotony of teenage life there. This film touched my impressionable youthful heart, and I have fondly remembered it for the past 12 years. I recently saw him for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time thanks to the LOVE channel. I'm still crying because the film reaches and touches my inner embarrassed teenager.
