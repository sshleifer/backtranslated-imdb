In fact, I never bought metal satanic and stuff, but this film, as it were, played on this idea. Although this is, of course, not a film that needs to be taken seriously or evaluated truly high, it serves its purpose in what it entertains during the game. In this story, a metal band is burned to death in their hotel, one of their fans dreams about it and said that the band starts killing from behind the grave. So yes, a bit of the story "A Nightmare on Elm Street" is going on here. Of course, Freddie had never bothered a girl in a car before. There was another movie with a heavy metal band, but it was very different from the way it was played, since it had a band that captured the city of children and drove them crazy. It just has one fan of the group who helps the assassin spirit first and then tries to stop it. There is nothing terrible about this, since I do not remember all these numerous bloody murders. Frankly, the scene I remember the most is the scene when a girl puts on headphones and then is abused by some kind of band incarnation. Nothing special, but a pleasant pastime.
