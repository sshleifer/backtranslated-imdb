Can I be so simple and primitive in my assessments, just to say: “I liked it”? It's pretty funny bit by bit, it has wonderful stars, and it's nice to look at it. The songs (there are about two of them, which are then repeated) can be forgotten, but they get a healthy ironic interpretation (for example, the terribly beautiful Mr. Fairbanks, who explodes into a mad Wagner version of the delicate ballad Miss Grable just made) there are not many dances with all the crinolines of 1861 draped around Miss Grable, and the comedy can be a bit heavy, but the result is still very encouraging. The photo (including real shots on the street that make you thrill) is awesome, playing with different shades of lush heavy gold. Miss Grable is a bit behind her heyday, but still fresh and comfortable in this continental comedy "Old World". This is pretty much like the “Down to Earth” line with Rita Hayworth, and many don't like it. So I suppose that several people will find that Lady in Hermine obsolete and sultry. But this is a fairy tale, and in any case they tend to move along with a certain paste. My suggestion is to simply enjoy the artwork, costumes, witty script and everything else this film has to offer, and stop complaining. The film was released on DVD in Germany with German and English soundtracks.
