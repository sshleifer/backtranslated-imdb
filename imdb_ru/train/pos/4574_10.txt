Let me say from the beginning that I have cerebral palsy, and I entered this film, expecting him to take the lead role into account. I left the theater, almost convinced that they played an actor with cerebral palsy, although I knew that it was not. The performances were generally excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (I think that was his name) in the role of young Christy Brown. Christie is a talented, daring, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and irritable, in other words, person. This film, along with Gaby: The True Story and the King Gimp documentary, are great ways to live with CP. Not a complete portrait, but wonderful examples of people with disabilities. Most recommended.
