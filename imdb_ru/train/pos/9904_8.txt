Slaughter High about a boy named Marty. He was chased and taken to high school. A group of children played a few jokes with him, and these jokes were REALLY bad. The last joke ended tragically. <br /> <br /> Example 5 years later. A gang of children are meeting again for reunification. One of them created it in high school. The school is currently abandoned, and they should break in. For some reason, the Janitor is still there, but he tells them to go ahead and have fun, because they give him a beer. <br /> <br /> They start parties, and look at their old lockers, and they see something from Marty. One girl feels sorry for Marty, but another reassures her. <br /> <br /> As soon as the killing begins, it's great. Every kill is creative and bloody. We see a figure in a jester's mask, hunting one after the other throughout the school. Looks like Marty is back to exact revenge. After the first person is killed, they find out that they are locked in school. They start looking for a way out. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of illogical things in this movie. First of all, I do not know anyone who has a 5-year reunion. Secondly, after the death of the first child, the girl gets blood. They all run away in panic, but she runs to the bathroom and finds a bath. Hrr friend just killed, and she decides to take a bath !? More importantly, why is there a bath in the school bathroom? In any case, it seems that the bath is not working ... and she is dying a terrible death, this is a film from the 80s. This is a terrible slasher. Who cares if he has any illogical parts. I, for example, no. In this film, really big deaths. The ending .... there is a twist. Having recently seen the Haute Tension, I can compare them. The only way they look like is that there is a twist that seemed to leave me disappointed ..... THEN right after the turn in the film a big, if not better, killing happens. <br /> <br /> After the last kill, the killer looks at the screen and does something crazy, and it was the perfect way to finish the movie. It makes me go "wow ..."
