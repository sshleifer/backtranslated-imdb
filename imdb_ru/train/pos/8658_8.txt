This is a killer road movie on board. Brian Kessler (David Duchovny), a sophisticated, polite writer, wants to conduct field studies of American serial killers. But neither he, nor his girlfriend, Carrie (Michelle Forbes), has the money to travel to the homicide sites over rough terrain, so they advertise someone who will share the cost of the trip. They end up with a young couple, Early Grace (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend, Adele (Juliette Lewis), two of the best examples of “poor white trash” that you will never find in all cinemas. <br /> <br /> Indeed, Early and Adele make this film so interesting because they babble, giggle, trust, meditate, meditate, drool and behave like I have not seen since the Beverly Hillbillis repetitions. California's early idea: “People think faster because of all this warm weather; the cold weather makes people stupid. " This is enough to convince Adele: "I think this explains why there are so many stupid people here." To which, Early, proudly replies: "It is for sure." She continues to instruct Adele about California: “You will never have to buy fruit, because it's all on the trees ... and they have no speed limits, and I heard that your first month's fee is free, state law." <br /> <br /> But poor Early has some, well, mental problems that are becoming more and more obvious to Brian and Carrie when four travelers head west through the US when they enter the desert to the south west, with its beautiful sharp landscape. California is becoming more and more like The Hitcher (1986), and Early becomes more and more like John Ryder, the manic hitchhiker whose horror seemed so insurmountable. <br /> <br /> In California, acting is uneven. The performance of Duchovny is flat. Brad Pitt is surprisingly effective, despite the fact that he replays from time to time. Michel Forbes is great as avant-garde photographer and photographer. But my choice in favor of the best performance belongs to Juliette Lewis. With her nasal voice and powerful southern accent, she is amazing as a naive, very lively, childish Adele. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, the film gains a sense of the Twilight zone when our travelers enter the nuclear ground in Nevada with a dilapidated old house full of test dummies. The plot rather randomly splits into unnecessary and ridiculous violence, a final that is somewhat disappointing. <br /> <br /> In general, however, “California” is an entertaining film, thanks to a well-conceived concept, magnificent landscapes, especially in the second half, good cinematography, excellent dialogue and this wonderful performance by Juliette Lewis.
