Rated E (Contains Violence). <br /> <br /> I had an original PC spider game for a couple of years. I still have not broken it, because on Windows XP there is a failure on one level, which I cannot win because of this. So be careful if you have XP. But for those who do not have XP, try this game. This is a fun clean family action game and great for any spider fan. In the game you play Spiderman, and you beat different criminals who commit crimes. Spiderman is a fun little game, and I recommend it to any spiderman fan or parent who wants fun and pure play for their children. <br /> <br /> 8/10
