Time Itch is one of a number of Bob Clampett's home hits for WB in the early 1940s, including Horton Hatches The Egg and Turtoise Wins By A Hare. Immersed in manic time and exaggerated chaos, this is basically a flea saga that is busy breaking through to a new home, and a dog whose land is being destroyed. Since Master Elmer will give him a terrible flea bath, if he scratches hard, the unfortunate canine will have to endure an upward spiral of torment, since the home flea uses picks and power tools to clear the ground. In the end, the little monster ignites a fuse on a small mountain of explosives, which he laid on the back of his victim! A huge explosion, and the wicked pooch closes his eyes when his back flashes on the bright display of the Fourth of July! It really should hurt, and the dog flies away, but soon he stops the action and says with a cheerful smile: "Guys, you had better stop it, because I think I start to like it!" For many years this strange confession has been subjected censored, but the current prints have restored the clip, so that viewers can now enjoy it in its original devilish glory. Nevertheless, there is still a closing gag in which the cat knocks itself off after it laments: “Now I have seen it all!” It was a common anger in WB, but since then it has been cleared of this cartoon and a few others, including Horton.
