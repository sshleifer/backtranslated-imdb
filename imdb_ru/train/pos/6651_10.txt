The great Gandhi: <br /> <br /> The greatness in the world is associated with people like the great Alexander and Ashoka the Great, because their greatness lay in the fact that they are glorified more than people. Gandhi is called great because it is not really Great, but more humane, because I always believe that the greatness of human existence lies in bringing up humanity in us. Gandhi was a man with humanity and one who sought humanity ready to sacrifice himself. in the battle for humanity, but not its enemies. Now let me go to the movie review. <br /> <br /> About Gandhi, my father: <br /> <br /> Gandhi My father - the film is not about Gandhi, but about his son Harilale Gandhi. I tell the story of a son, whose father was one of the greatest people who walked this land, the director succeeds in portraying this story. The film tells about the deceiving son of his father, who leads people to greatness. The film is called criticizing the failure of Gandhi as a father to his son, I would rather say that this is the sacrifice that Gandhi brought as father of his son to do justice as the father of the nation. <br /> <br /> I would like the essence of this film to prevail not only in India, the country of Gandhi, but also in the hearts of all the people of this world. <br /> <br /> Gandhi is a real man. Jai Hind.
