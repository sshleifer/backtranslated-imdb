First of all, let me say that I wanted to see this film for a year, because I knew that Angelina Jolie was in it, and I love her. But my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion about the film. In any case, no video store carried it, but low, and so the local library did. I watched it and absolutely loved it. Yes, there were Italian stereotypes, but it was done well and fun. This was by no means humiliating. <br /> <br /> Every actor and actress did a great job. I really laughed at the sexual humor. In general, I think this film is worth seeing if you can find it. It's amazing and just fun to watch. I rarely rate films as 10, but I give it 10! <br /> <br /> Go and see!
