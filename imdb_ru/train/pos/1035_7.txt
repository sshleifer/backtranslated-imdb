This film was nominated for the best picture, but lost to Casablanca, but Paul Lucas defeated Humphrey Bogart for the best male role. I don't understand why Lucille Watson was nominated for the best male supporting role, I just don't think she did a great job. Bette Davis, Paul Lucas and their three children leave Mexico and go to the United States on the first scene of the film. They are traveling by train to the house of Davis's relatives. Davis and Lucas were in the underground to stop the Nazis, so they are very tired and need rest. But when they come home, they are Nazis there, and they can do little about it. It turns out that the Nazi cares only about money and is ready to make a deal with Lucas. This is more of a plot, but you can find out for yourself.
