You would be forgiven for thinking that the Finnish director from Helsinki will not cope with the management of the American horror film (especially the film, which is completely located in the American prison) - look to prove that you are wrong! In the end, it was shot in the 80s, and the film was made with a budget that was more appropriate for a modern DIY TV advertising company (I think that today someone will really notice that almost everyone is used to a budget of 100 million US dollars + +, unfortunately, dominant in action movies). industrial mind!) - Mr. Harlin's first large-scale production and, at least, what is considered stellar today. I still think that much of the Nordic contribution to the film industry is generally related to the appearance on screen of Stellan Stargaard (not to mention the overvalued directorial efforts of Mr. Bergman) - at least for all female viewers - but this film is really proves that there are true cinematic talents outside of the United States and Hollywood to make us watch a movie while waiting. Try watching this movie, even if you are not a horror lover, IMO is definitely worth it!
