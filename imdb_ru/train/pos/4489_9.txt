This film is NOT about the cat-and-mouse battle, as stated in another comment. This is a cat that has spent 8 of its 9 lives and now lives in fear of losing its last. The cat is always scared and scared to death, hence the name "cat-predator." Fraidy Cat's previous lives haunt him like ghosts from different eras who constantly try to kill him, but he is most afraid of the ninth life, which is represented as a cloud in the form of the number 9 and spits out the light. the bolts. very old now, but it will still be fun for children if you get a copy. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie almost every day in my childhood: o)
