As I noted in many IMDb comments, some reviewers seem to demand that every movie they see should have smugly intelligent plots that are buried in their own intelligence. I am not one of those people. If I watch an action movie, I want to see explosions, shooting, and heroism. If I watch a comedy, I want tears of laughter in my eyes. You get the idea. Therefore, watching a horror movie, I first want to get scared. The Grudge is a very scary film, both in its well-executed "jump" scenes, and in its creepy images. I have been a fan of horror films for many years, and I’m talking about artists like Dario Argento, and not the directors of some horror films for teens on a treadmill that are released these days. If you want to get scared, watch this movie. Much worse than the original Japanese “Ring” (which I also consider an excellent film).
