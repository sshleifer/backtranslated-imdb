This is a stage game adapted for the screen. 95% of the film takes place in the magnificent home of playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Kane). He is the author of an incredibly successful Broadway play, but his last 4 attempts failed - terribly. <br /> <br /> The impetuous playwright Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who attended a master class on writing plays, given by Sydney, sent him a copy of the play he wrote. Syd tells his wife Myra (Diane Cannon) that the game is incredible - an unmistakable hit. But is it enough to die for? Time will tell. <br /> <br /> Intelligent dialogue and numerous plot twists make this film entertaining from start to finish. The whole cast seems to have a good time. It reminds one more funny riddle of Michael Kane: Sleuth. Worth seeing. <br /> <br />
