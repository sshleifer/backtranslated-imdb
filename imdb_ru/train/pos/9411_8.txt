Sydney Stratton is having problems keeping jobs in various textile mills, mainly because of his experiments in textile laboratories. Stratton is experimenting with the formula of a new fabric, which will create an unsurpassed fabric that never gets dirty, does not wrinkle and does not wear out. When Stratton eventually creates fabric, he creates enemies among all textile workers (who lose their jobs) and owners (who lose money because one factory has exclusive rights), so Stratton in his white suit becomes the most haunted man in England . The film is perfect, and only Ealing could do it like this. Guinnessâ€™s play (and a great cast, such as Greenwood, Teziger and Parker) and directing Mackendrick make the movie amazing, but the real hero is history itself, a good satire about business and industry with additional elements of drama, romance and suspense. Rating, 8.
