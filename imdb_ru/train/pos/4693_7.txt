Johnny Dangerously falls into the category of hits or misses with his bloated gags and the complete absence of a comprehensive script or story that makes ANY sense. But that's the point, right? <br /> <br /> The cast is pretty; Michael Keaton was a great comic book performer, before he took himself too seriously, as the years went by. Griffin Dunn, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito are enthusiastic and at least get a lot of laughter from me. But the full thief of the scene here is Richard Dimitri (penetrating the word “Ice Holes” in the history of cinema) like a gangster who kills English the best. <br /> <br /> I associate many childhood memories with this film, as I watched it quite often, so maybe I tend to enjoy it more than many others. Johnny Danger - this is at least the completely innocent cheater of gangster films, in which there are even reports about the dangers of smoking (and sex). <br /> <br /> I like it, but it's hard to recommend. <br /> <7 out of 10
