Richard Widmark is a spoiled character in this film. He is a professional pickpocket. He was in prison three times, but at the beginning of the film he tries to make it four. Thelma Ritter is a busy organization selling information to almost everyone. Gene Peters is amazing when the girl broke out at Widmark. <br /> <br /> This is a historical play of the McCarthy era, when Red Panic ruled politics and fairly well fit into this plot. What is unusual in this film is that Peters and Ritter are victims of brutal beatings in an era when women were rarely more than sexy objects in movies. This is what makes this film a noir, because women often get different roles in this type of film. <br /> <br /> The film lasts only 87 minutes and was obviously made by Fox as an additional card for double functions in the theater. The sets show that this is a limited budget movie. The script drove J. Edgar Hoover crazy, because patriotism is short-lived. Hoover wanted him to change. <br /> <br /> Instead, it became an image like “B under the map,” which became a sleeper hit in 1953. The scenario and the action in it is better than other important functions of that year.
