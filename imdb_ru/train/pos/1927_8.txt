With the death of GEORGE NADER, on February 4, 2002, I thought about this most interesting program, which, despite the fact that it was short, was a terrific idea with good storylines. As a rule, invisible for over 40 years, it is worth seeing again. The opening credits showed many different images, one of which was a fragment of Colonel JOHN POLA STAPP, riding on the famous rocket sleigh, at a time when he was often called "the fastest living person."
