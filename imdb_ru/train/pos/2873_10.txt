In my opinion, this is one of the top five Disney animation features. Cinderella was a wonderful return to a full-length feature film (as opposed to pre-production films from the 40s), and the dear depth due to the multiplane camera does not return the film. Although Disney adapts the story somewhat liberally, you collect the idea of ​​an era with dress and styling — a clear time period when the story takes place. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is more mature than Snow White and a multidimensional character. In fact, all the characters are somewhat well developed, with the exception of the Prince - left flatest - we know that he has a sense of humor and a great smile, but that is all. Like Snow White, Disney has a constant influence on history in popular culture — in most versions of Cinderella, half-sisters are attractive, but not as beautiful as Cinderella, and their character deprives them of their attractive appearance. <Br /> <br /> Favorite Disney add-ons: mice! Also appreciated the continuity - Cinderella always loses her shoes throughout the film. Adding a homemade dress as well as the following attack from the step sisters was always terrible when I was a kid - I remember how View Master showed it with a black background and a big red light on it! Broken slipper shows the reluctance of the evil Lady Tremaine to abandon Cinderella's possession and admit defeat - Audley will continue to characterize the most evil of all Disney villains, the satanic witch Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty.
