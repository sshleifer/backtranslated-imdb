I work with children from 0 ?? 6 years, and they all love Doodlebops. Doodlebops are energetic, bright and attractive. As soon as they start singing: “We are Doodlebops, We are Doodlebops, We are Doodlebops Oh, yes, join in the fun, because we laugh and sing all day,” it's almost impossible not to join them in the song. Doodlebops bring the viewer to the world of color and fun. Every show is an adventure, Doodlebops do not try to change the world with preaching messages, all they do is have fun, dealing with everyday life problems that a young child faces may be. Doodlebops is a refreshing, active alternative to regular children's television programs.
