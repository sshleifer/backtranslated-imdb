First of all, I would like to say that Edison Chen is very hot and Sam Lee looks much better than before XD! This is probably one of the most original films I've ever seen; Shows poor cambodian lifestyle. Cambodian (Edison aka Pang) kills people to survive itself; did it throughout his life. The duty of Sam Lee (Wai) - to capture the Cambodian forever. There are many violent acts, but there is a good story. The film shows the struggle between these two characters; They both beat each other like angry dogs. GO AND SEE PPL ... HIGHLY PROPOSED !!! (GO HK FILMS)
