I was so impressed with the Dane McGrath version of Jane Austen's Emma, ​​and I liked Rachel Portman’s music so much that when I once went to the video store and found that they came together again, "Nicholas Nickleby:" other considerations. <br /> <br /> I read the book, and for those overly critical fans of this adaptation of Jane Austen, I don’t know what else McGrath could have done to more accurately convey the spirit and main elements of the Miss Austin plot, (which some have complained that it is too long!). As for the accent of Gwen Paltrow, I must admit that I was not too familiar with her when I first saw it in the theater, and I was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an English actress! <br /> <I’m stunned by those who criticized the film for its magnificent scenery. This is one of those things that I like, and I look forward to seeing them in historical works set in an English village. Beautiful backgrounds of the film - the main contribution to its attractiveness and success. If your idea of ​​a meal with escapists is more dismal, then perhaps you should rent something like “Death Wish III!” <br /> <br /> English country settings are as attractive and charming as the actors, and Combine with the story and the soundtrack for entertainment, which does not get tired of repeating the views. McGrath is surprised when he puts together the interaction of subtle expressions that are so important for conveying the complex romantic intrigue that arises in this story. <br /> <br /> This refreshing movie can also be a clinic about how enjoyable a movie can be minus sex, violence or even a villainous antagonist. The story is often funny, sweet, and sometimes touching. <br /> <br /> I have seen many literate adaptations of Jane Austen’s books, but this is without a doubt my favorite.
