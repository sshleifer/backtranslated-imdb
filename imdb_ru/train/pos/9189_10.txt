Let me first say that after watching this episode for the first time on DVD at 10 pm. One night I could not fall asleep until about 3:00. <br /> <br /> This overview may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I’m a longtime fan of The Sopranos and I can safely say that this is the best episode I've ever seen. I'm not saying that everyone should feel that way, but I feel it. This episode is identical to the days off that I spent with my family, watching my father, who was in a comatose state in the intensive care unit before his passing. <br /> <br /> The episode begins with Tony in an alternate reality: he is a salesperson who has been mistaken for a person by the name of Kevin Finnerty. <br /> <br /> By the time ten minutes passed, I knew that Tony was asleep, or I was watching some other show. It was not like a normal soprano, and I liked it. <br /> <br /> Variant 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or “Kevin”) looks at the “helicopter searchlight” at the sky, and we see him breaking through it, a doctor with a flashlight. We only see this for a moment, and the sequence continues until we return to real life in a situation similar to the one I just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Tony left the coma for just a moment. His boys take A.J. House and Carmella, covered by stress, break down in the corridor: a momentous moment in the episode. <br /> <br /> In the remainder of the episode, we cross the real world: a family with a potential negative result of this coma and Tony's alternative reality, which is parallel to what happens in his mind and in the real world around him. <br /> <br /> Then the star point in the episode begins: after AJ finishes telling his mother that he’d finished school, she comes in to see Meadow sitting next to Anthony. <br /> <br /> She walks over to Tony and says the best line of the episode: “Anthony, can you hear us?” In Tony’s world, he enters a dark hotel room and turns on the light. He takes off his shoes and goes to the phone. He is trying to get through, but he cannot - as if he is trying to say something to Carmella, but he cannot physically force himself to do it. Not yet. <br /> <br /> He sits down and looks out the window. The flickering light that reappeared throughout the entire episode now seems to be calling it from the other side of the city. <br /> <br /> “When it's cold, I would like to die” Mobi combines perfectly with these latest photos and helps in creating an emotional rollercoaster episode. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. PS / PS: Watch the next episode. You will know what light is. It is wonderful.
