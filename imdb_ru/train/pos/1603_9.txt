I am really surprised that this film did not get a higher IMDB rating. This is one of those films that can easily get to someone, but for the romantic comedy "Moonstruck" is really in class. This setting and ethnic charm are things that people take for granted. One cast makes it almost perfect. Few films in the 1980s were as good as Moonstruck, and thatâ€™s fun too. **** outside *****
