I knew this as a program similar to Jackass, and I saw one or two episodes in Freeview, and this is the same thing, only more extreme. Basically, three Welsh and one crazy Brit were united by the love of skateboarding and total disregard / masochistic pleasure to harm themselves, their health and safety. They were vomiting, eating pubic pizza, jumping into nettles, exposing paint, joking at a little guy during a strong sleep / snoring, tricks in the workplace, for example. army, cowboys and many other insane stunts that cause bruises, blows, blood and vomiting, perhaps not only for themselves. Starring Matthew Pritchard, who does almost everything, Lee Dainton also for almost anything, Dan Joyce (British), who barely does physical work and has an impressive laugh, and Pancho (Mike Locke), who is much, but more popular for being short, fat and lazy. It was the number of something for the 100 greatest fun moments. Fine!
