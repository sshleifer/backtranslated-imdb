This movie is sofmoric. But it's funny how everyone gets out. It shows the boys' locker room mentality, played by the "other side." It's nice to see that such tides have changed and how stupid they are. But this is probably not news for most women, because (just ask one), "they heard them all before." <br /> <br /> Watch this with a small group or a batch of mixed sexes and 97.3% of the room will laugh for 2 hours in a row. And the remaining 2.7% ... can you ever please them?
