Clever, undeniably entertaining romp starring Peter Ustinov in a squander career with his eye on the US conglomerate in London. He is abetted by the cunning (and deceptively sharp) Maggie Smith, and he is threatened by exposure by a jealous man from the company of Bob Newhart. This is a robbery movie with a lot of brains. Ustinov is exceptional, like Smith, and Newhart is quite funny. The real surprise is Carl Malden, like the pill of the “executive vice president”. Malden was rarely so free. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley appear in some funny cameos. A great musical score is Laurie Johnson. The direction of Eric Till is lively, and the script of Ustinov and Ira Wallach is first class and very clever. Great pastime!
