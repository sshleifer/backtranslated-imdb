"Pecker" by John Water (Pink Flamingos ...) is the best movie I've ever seen. It gives the viewer a surrealistic lifestyle in Baltimore (I live in nearby Washington, DC), using colors like Warhol, exaggerated movements and emotions. Pecker is becoming more than his city can bear, and his art-loving man is separated from his family (including sexual Ricci). The picture left a refreshing taste in its mouth - like fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day - and although this taste was rather flat and simplistic, it only made everything more deep and critical. This is a celebration of life, freedom and the right to bear arms ... and everything else that this country means. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
