Does anyone know where I can watch or download the 4th season of "What I like about you" on the Internet? Because I will die to see them, and here, in Germany, there will not be shown on TV. Please help me. I want to see season 4 episodes bad. I have already seen episodes 4 and 18 on YouTube. But I could not find more episodes of season 4. Maybe there is a website where I can watch episodes? Because I read some comments on forums from Germany, and there were people who had already seen episodes of season 4, although they were not shown on television in Germany. I am pleased with every information that I can get. Thank you Kate
