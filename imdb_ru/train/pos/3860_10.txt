In Holland, a gay writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) lectures. He stays overnight with beautiful woman Christina (Rene Suthendeyk) and has sex with her (imagining that she is a boy). He plans to leave the next day, but sees a photo of a happy guy Christina Herman (Tom Hoffman) and decides to stay to try it. Then everything becomes strange. <br /> <br /> The Great American Art House in 1983 became a hit in the United States. Why was he rated for X? Let's see ... there is a strangulation, full frontal male and female nudity, castration, mutilation, sex simulation, a scene in the church with a cross that will shake most people, a gay sex scene in a crypt ... and that's all a comedy !!!! ! Paul Verhoeven did it after the Spetters. Critics attacked Spetters for his extreme sexual encounters and called it rubbish. So, Verhoeven filled this film with very obvious symbolism, thinking that critics would think it was an art and praise it. He was right! Critics loved the movie, not realizing that Verhoeven was playing a big joke with them. However, this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is beautifully shot by Jan de Bont (now he is the director himself), and there is so much symbolism and obvious "hidden" layers in the dialogue that you will never be bored. All acting skills are great - Krabbe plays a completely disgusting character, but (somehow) you support him; Sawtanduke is just amazing to watch, and she plays her part to perfection - the faint smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her, frightening; Hoffman is incredibly handsome with a gorgeous body - he deserves praise for completing the church sequence and going with Krabbe in the crypt. <br /> <br /> This is not for people who are easily offended or weakened, but if you like extreme movies that playfully challenge you (like me), this is for you! 10 fully.
