The film was a long-awaited release, which was a little disappointing because of the expectations that I set up. Looking at it again, I must say that it is really quite good. First of all, this is very true for the original story (of course, not completely) and as such is done only to preserve the right to the film. The history of modesty in childhood is shown and very true to the original. Perhaps acting is not the best, and the plot is a bit thin, but if you compare it with the Vitti film of 1966, it is much better just because he is not trying to be a musical. In general, I would recommend it only to Modesty Blaise fans or to those who accidentally caught it on TV.
