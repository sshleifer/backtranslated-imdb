All dogs go to heaven - this is one of the best films I've ever seen. I first saw him when I was about 3. Now I am 12 years old, and I took it off, it makes me think about things and brings back so many memories, these were "days." I love music, I love when Charlie arrives in heaven, I love the song "Let me be surprised." I like the way Charlie looks and his voice, Burt Reynolds could only play Charlie's great voice. I like this film, the first one is the best, because it is so original and excellent. It really brings back memories that no one can describe, even me. If only I could get back in those days. I love characters. If this is how memories come back when I am 12, imagine what I will feel when I am 19, I hope I can see it when I get older. When I first saw it, I never knew that I would really look back and feel it, I hope it will be available for viewing. I am so happy that this film was shot, and an amazing idea came to mind. On a scale from 1 to 10, I would give 10 points. This is a terrific movie. It is very difficult to explain this feeling when I get older, and if I have children, I hope that they can experience this feeling.
