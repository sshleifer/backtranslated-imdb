I was pleasantly surprised, I really liked this movie. Witty writing (some “inside” jokes that I got, others I didn't get - maybe because of the actors speaking each other), great acting (especially John Cassini), excellent cameos, interesting and unique directors. I rented it to see Jeffrey Mick (very disappointed that he was so short in him, blink, and you'll miss him!), But I found the film surprisingly interesting. I will actually look at it again before sending it back to Netflix. I think the actors and future actors will greatly enjoy this film. The ending is somewhat expected, but I would like them to do something different (and more positive). It is a pity that the film was not adopted better, except in the "festival" market. I offer this to anyone who loves the acting business.
