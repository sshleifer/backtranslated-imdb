"The Night Stalker", first shown in America in 1972, became the most popular for T.V. film in history. Based on Jeff Rice's unpublished novel, he told how a fearless investigative reporter named Karl Kolchak (late Darren McGavin) discovered the existence of a vampire in modern Las Vegas. When it appeared on British television four years later, it did not have the same influence, but my friends talked about it on Monday morning at school, like me. We all agreed that this is one of the most exciting things we have seen. <br /> <br /> I did not know about the existence of the “Night Strangler” until it appeared almost ten years later. I.T., who showed the films "Kolchak", apparently decided to pass an additional series; they felt that "Barnaby Jones" with Buddy Ebsen in the lead role was more of a draw, and in any case the audience might confuse "Kolchak" with "Kozhak"! For many years, my only source of information about the show was an article in the magazine Fangoria. I couldn't even buy the novels of Jeff Rice. <br /> <br /> Then something wonderful happened. In 1990, B.B.C.-2 released the show as part of a Friday night series devoted to the supernatural, called the Mystery Train, led by Richard O'Brien. Kolchak found himself communicating with such as Brain Eaters and Earth vs. Spider. The initial headlines were cut off, removing Kolchak's whistle, and the final credits ... well, there weren't any. <br /> <br /> The first episode shown was “Werewolf”. I can not say that I was too impressed, but stuck with it, and I'm glad I did it! <br /> <br /> I really would like me to see it in 1974. My twelve year old I would love it. Creepy, with a sense of humor, exciting, not surprising that this caused the imagination of Chris Carter. <br /> <br /> McGavin was the biggest asset of the show. Unlike the recent Kolchak, the original was an ordinary figure, eccentrically dressed, rather conservative. For the supernatural, he was the same as the “Colombo” for the crime. The late Simon Auckland was as great as Kolchak's evil boss Tony Vincenzo. Scenarios are filled with an amazing, dry mind. I found myself enjoying the program more for humor than horror. When the twenty episodes ended, I felt lost. <br /> <br /> The X-Files appeared a few years later and filled the void, but only to some extent. I wanted to return Kolchak and Vincenzo. I am glad that the show has not been restored. Without Auckland it would not be so. <br /> <br /> I have books about Rice, and I read them several times. I was very surprised when Stephen King called the first (in his book “Danse Macabre”) as good as everything he wrote. <br /> <br /> Good, so some monsters were hardly modern, but so what? The new "Kolchak" completely missed the point of the original. What you do not see is sometimes worse than what you are doing ... <br /> <br /> The best episode is “Horror on the heights”
