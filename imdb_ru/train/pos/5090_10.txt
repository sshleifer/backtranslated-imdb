I like this movie. Great storyline and cast and good movie sets. He told the story so that I could easily understand and pay attention to it without falling asleep. I would like to know where I could get the soundtrack. I can't find it anywhere. Please email me if you know where I could get the soundtrack. Besides the fact that I could not find the soundtrack, I thought the movie was exciting. Swayze did a great job. I think this is one of his best works. His past films were fine, but this one really told a story for a change. It will go down in history as one of the best television films ever broadcast. Congratulations to the producers and writers of such a wonderful job.
