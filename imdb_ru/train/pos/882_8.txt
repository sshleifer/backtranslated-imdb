I took it on a whim from the library, and was very pleasantly surprised. A lot of tough, expressionistic camera work, an equally difficult script and two excellent actors - all together to make one very beautiful piece of the film Not for the brain of reptiles, but for the true connoisseurs of cinema. If Hollywood ever gets his dirty hands, I'm sure it will destroy him. Choice treats all around. Other posters here are more than enough sang, so I do not need to duplicate their words; just take their advice, and mine, and don't miss this gem. Call it what you will; I call it two hours of entertainment well spent. Read my lips: do not miss it.
