Sitting on the front porch of his home in Burbank, Ted Mapes told me that he and Reed Hadley wore the same size in all garments except for a hat. <br /> <br /> Ted, one of the greatest stuntmen, said that every time Zorro put on a mask, he was the one on the screen. <br /> <br /> This was a bit of an exaggeration: there were times when Zorro was obviously Reed Hadley, but in tricks we can be happy that it was Ted at work. <br /> <br /> And what tricks! “The Battle Legion of Zorro,” as evidenced by the comments, is one of the greatest TV series. It is exciting and is usually very well done. <br /> <br /> Reed Hadley was a good actor, and, as someone else commented, he made a very good movie. <br /> <br /> But, admittedly, this action makes this film so wonderful. <br /> <br /> And what else can you expect under the leadership of this wonderful team, Whitney and English, with great music from the wonderfully prolific William Lava (the list here says that he was uncredited, but this is not true: other composers listed here , really were not accredited, and I don’t know if they wrote any music - it sounds like Lava), and with the atrocity, among others, the great Charles King, and with dozens of bit parts? <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that the villain played by radio Tarzan Jim Pierce, son-in-law of Edgar Rice Burroughs. (I encourage you to read his mini-bio.) <br /> <br /> There is one chapter that depressingly slows things down, but damn, it's only a few minutes (maybe 20), and when you make your way through her. Well, you are delighted again. <br /> <br /> Turner Classic Movies deserves a big THANK YOU for presenting this great show, and we should ask TCM to bring us more. <br /> <br /> And we have to thank everyone who participated in this, that we see it as a series or a series, and not as a repeated function.
