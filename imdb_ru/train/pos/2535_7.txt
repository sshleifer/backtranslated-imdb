Professor Janos Ruch (Boris Karloff) discovers Radium X - a powerful force for nuclear energy. Unfortunately, Ruh was contaminated by Radium and begins to glow in the dark - and his touch causes instant death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) is developing an antidote - but Ruch begins to go crazy because of radium and antidote and intends to kill everyone who, in his opinion, has offended him. The “effects” that make Karloff glow in the dark are ridiculous, but it's still a funny little chiller. He moves fast, has a great atmosphere (note the “house” of Rukh, and the film begins on a dark and rainy night), and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give excellent performances. Frank Drake (as Rukh’s wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (as his mother) also play well. So everything is in order, but one step below all other Karloff / Lugosi films. The plot is too implausible for me to swallow. However, I did. I give him 7.
