There are some exciting, stunningly beautiful photos of various landscapes and animals, from arctic to tropical and everything in between. Camera techniques are varied and visible from close-ups to aerial work. Editing is huge, and the comment is also in place, only with the right tone and some dramatic and telling facts about our world. The film falls a little in an attempt to cover and unite four themes â€” seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal histories, and hunter / hunter interactions in different environments. In the end, everything becomes a bit tiny and incoherent. In general, it is worth seeing, especially in view of the issues raised, but do not expect Oscar material.
