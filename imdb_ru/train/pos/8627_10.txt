Oh my God ! Bootgereit's masterpiece is one of the best films I've ever seen. Closer to the films of Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard, this film is really exciting, but not terrible, like Necromancy. All the little stories have a deep philosophical interest, and the direction is completely inventive, despite the lack of money (see sketch of the “bridge”). Highly recommended!
