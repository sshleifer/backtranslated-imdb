CITY HALL - mixed bag. Partly the vignettes of the political life of New York and partly moralizing tales. Al Pacino, a Dukakis-inspired boss with presidential dreams, often performs with a sullen or depressed performance. There are a couple of times when he chews landscapes, and in the case of CITY HALL, where he shines. John Cusack gives a subdued and, as a rule, flawless presentation, without going into a caricature of the New Orleans dialect and without plunging into melodrama during the climax of the films. Danny Aiello, as Burrough’s political leader, is also very good. I also love shows. <br /> <br /> The main problem of CITY HALL, and in many ways a good movie, is the general feeling of a lack of momentum. It's more like a documentary than a movie. We see the action or follow the story from the outside, and, of course, the viewer does not participate. When the viewer does not participate to a certain extent, he becomes indifferent to the characters and, ultimately, to the plot. <br /> <br /> This tends to repel, and that should have been an exciting, revealing finale. Said, "Hmmm ... uh ... okay." They say that you “cannot fight the mayor’s office,” as the worn out stamp says. However, this still cannot prevent you from thinking about what might have happened if they only strengthened the script and tempo of this film.
