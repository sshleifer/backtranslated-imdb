Stupid, cheerful, tragic, sad, inevitable. <br /> <br /> A group of losers is combined with an “experienced” rogue to break out of poverty. Great idea ... if you ignore the failure factor. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see George Clooney doing something really funny for a change. Casting is perfect, and current standards are very high. Although it can be said that the subject of the motley team is not new, I think this film handles it in an interesting and unique way. It is enough that it stood out from what it was before. <br /> <br /> Very good guys.
