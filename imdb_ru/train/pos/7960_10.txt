In the past, there have been countless films about talking animals, most of which are either with animal mouthpieces with digital animation almost identical to the voice acting or ridiculously amateur. “The Road Home: An Incredible Journey” is neither one nor the other. <br /> <br /> This film does not need to add moving dog lips or gesticulating cats' limbs. He has the ability to make you believe that animals sincerely talk to each other, and you can become emotionally attached to them at heart (as all wonderful movies about boys and dogs should do). <br /> <br /> “Homeward Bound” is the epitome of all the family fussy animals that can boast of me and boast excellent cinematography, an inspiring soundtrack (from the genius of Bruce Broughton) and an impressive cast ... <br /> < br /> Michael J. Fox ... Chance <br /> <br /> Sally Field ... Sassy <br /> <br /> Don Amech ... Shadow <br /> <br /> Frank Welker ( Voice of God) ... Miscellaneous <br /> <br /> This is an upgraded version of the classic children's artwork "Incredible Journey", which Disney made a long time ago in 1963 in a semi-documentary Ilm. The sequel (“Lost in San Francisco”) is not as good as the film, but it expands the adventures of my favorite furry friends and is a fun urban twist on the theme of grand outdoor adventures. Do you want to entertain your children with a witty, cute, heart-rending mini-epic, without the idiotic and often completely ridiculous comedy of modern children's cinema? Parents, buy all three films for your children - now! Thank you, Disney, for bringing tears to me every time I watch this classic from the early 90s!
