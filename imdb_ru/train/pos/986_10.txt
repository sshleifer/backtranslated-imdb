If you like Jamie Foxx, (Alvin Sanders), "Date From Hell", '01, you will like his playing as a guy who never gets an even break in his life and eventually tinkers with Shrimp (Jumbo Size) and same time many gold bars. Alvin Sanders has a lot of FBI eyes watching him, and eventually he hits the brick in the jaw, and David Morse (Edgar Clentin), the 2002 hacking television series, decides to focus on poor Alvin and use it as a so-called Fish Hook to attract criminals. There are a lot of laughter, drama, cold-blooded murders and great places to shoot films, as well as many expensive cars sent to the Vault. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were outstanding actors in this film, and it was great entertainment in the whole picture.
