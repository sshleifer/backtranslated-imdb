<br /> <br /> This is definitely a “must-see” for those who sometimes smoke a refrigerator in their secret shelter, trying not to be caught by their parents, teachers, police, etc. The main character is a woman of about forty, living in his mansion, breeding orchids, and completely unaware that her so-called rich and truthful husband actually went bankrupt and deceived her. When he dies suddenly, she faces the truth. The bailiff comes to tell her that she has a huge debt. She does not know what to do until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in Britain. After much thought, she decides to get rid of her flowers and instead start planting a pot ... The story is quite original, outstanding performances! I can only remember a few films that made me laugh more than this one. However, a melodramatic touch is present. The film is typical British: jokes are not vulgar, there is no violence in this. It should not be mentioned that before viewing the “Rescue of Grace” it is recommended to make several checkers. It will be much more fun! Especially the scene with the two old women in their tea shop is fun. I thought my jaws would break. 9/10
