First of all, let me say that the director has a wonderful use of names in his installation frames. I really enjoyed them. I really liked this movie, but I have to say that Greg Kinir is rather dim next to Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan fits so well with this character that it is very difficult to remember that this is the same guy who played the bond. It also shows his range and depth as an actor. This is a kind of indie film, and it was really nice to see it, especially with all the popular films that fill films at this time of year. I found that the characters were well crafted. I felt that the turn in the middle was especially good. I also liked how the characters come off realistically. So many times we filmed these caricatures of people who are not really characters, but walking stereotypes ... I like the different approaches that this film uses. I think sideways when I think about this film, but I think it is a more watchable and better film overall ...
