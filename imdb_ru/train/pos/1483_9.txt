A sophisticated modern fable about the stresses that work to weaken and, ultimately, unravel the marriage vows. The main content of the narrative derives from the “sermon”, which the country's priest speaks after the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from Milan. It prescribes the future course of marriage, which gradually wears out from the stresses of modern life. The “morality” of this story in history is that in order for a marriage to take shape both now and in the past, it is necessary that this relationship be destroyed by family and friends. This film was a relative blockbuster by domestic Italian standards. It is a pity that this film is not available on DVD or VHS.
