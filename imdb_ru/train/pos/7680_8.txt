Holly is a problem-based film, but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental. In essence, this is a character-driven film that would not have been almost so successful without the portraits of Patrick (Ron Livingstone) emerging into the light, a lost soul with a gradually awakening conscience and Holly (Tui Nguyen) a strong-willed, but ultimately sorted out young Vietnamese girl. From bright locations and photos to effective editing - everything is clear and high quality. A contemporary classical score may at first slightly push away, but it is a first-class composition that emphasizes the remarkable restraint that is everywhere. This film, which raises many questions, but gives few clear answers, ultimately helps to raise awareness and compassion for Holly and the many who share her plight. Kudos to those who managed to do this.
