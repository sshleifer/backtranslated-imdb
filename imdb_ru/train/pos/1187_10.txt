The last hunt is a forgotten Hollywood classic western. The theme of genocide with killing buffalo is present in other films, but never so brutally. The role of Robert Taylor in the role of an obsessed buffalo and an Indian assassin is his best performance. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s, your mother dropped you and your friends on a Saturday matinee, usually with a western or comedy. But then and now it was wrong to allow the boy to watch such psychodrams as “The Seekers” and “The Last Hunt”. Have the children wait a few years before showing them films of depressed sexual sadism and intense racial hatred. <br /> <br /> Why mom could not censor these films? Because they were "safe" Hollywood stars such as Taylor and John Wayne. But the climatic scene in The Last Hunt is as terrible as the Vincent Price mutation in The Fly. <br /> <br /> The mythology of the white buffalo, which is part of the texture of this film, was later disrupted by other films. including White Buffalo, starring Charles Bronson as Wild Bill Hickok. The laugh here is that Bronson played the Indians. <br /> <br /> Today, a large herd of bison lives in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. In winter, due to famine, surplus animals are taken from the park to Montana, where they are sometimes collected by Indians from Idaho from Nez Perce province in accordance with the US treaty that preceded the Lincoln presidency. Linklon signed an act of Congress that sanctioned the Continental Railway and began the slaughter of buffaloes.
