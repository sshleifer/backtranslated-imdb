Soprano is perhaps the greatest show in the history of dramatic television. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to come up with another series that can boast such great intelligence, sublime writing or first-class performances. <br /> <br /> Through it all, the Epic Sphere releases fresh and iconic characters with a constant level of high quality. Concentrating around the life of one Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is an ordinary wife and two children from a nuclear family, the other is a huge mafia group in New Jersey, of which he is the head. Played by James Gandolfini from Real Romance and Mexican Glory, Tony is an amazing, scary, but nice guy. Gandolfini should be commended for turning a truly recognizable and perfect leader into a woman and a terribly aggressive beast. In contemporary American drama, there has never been such an exciting and iconic figure as Tony. <br /> <br /> The cast of hundreds can never boast a flat performance, and such outstanding characters as Poly Nuts and Ralph Sifaretto will forever remain in your memory. <br /> <br /> The real genius of this story, however, is the courage and revolutionism of the creator and writer in the traditional drama series. Twenty-minute sequences of dreams, powerful and original use of symbols and metaphorical images and truly shocking scenes of violence. And yet, this whole style is met by truly touching themes of love, honor, and respect for the family. The series never becomes cold-blooded or unreasonable. <br /> <br /> With television, which is now competitive and often poor, the Soprano stands above the rest as America’s most original and compelling drama. Forget about family again. This is television again.
