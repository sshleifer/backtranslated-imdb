I really liked this movie. The story jumps back and forth quite a bit, and it is not easy to follow. There is no permission in this story, and you can only wonder at what actually happened. Since I like this movie, I enjoyed it. I especially like dating scenes between boys, and I was involved in their lives. And, of course, any film with naked Stafan Rideau will get a couple of extra points. ;-)
