The brilliance of this film is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary. This is one of the main fears of man. This film is a nightmare that every child in the waiting room must go through. Corbin Bernsen demonstrates amazingly flawless work as a crazy dentist who, I think, is trying to kill people, but he only works on their teeth, so this doesn't really work. In a particularly horrific scene, we see that such an actor, Earl Ben, completely destroyed his teeth with exercise and much more, which I suppose is the worst thing you can do when you become a dentist's killer. This is a typical situation with Brian Yuzna, not well written, but there is blood. The plot is crappy, and sometimes it seems that it was made on the spot, but hey, this is a killer film of a dentist, we all thought about it, but they did it first.
