This animated film is a masterpiece! Narration, music, animation and storyline, where everything is wonderful. My friend and I saw it again the second time, and we got more insight from it. We invited a couple of friends to see the Spirit with us, and they really enjoyed it. When I asked them to come see it, they thought it was a film about horses, but then they realized that it was something more. I liked Esperanza, Spirit, Raine, and Lil-Creek, which remind me of Nathan, the haunting horse, who smiles a lot in dancing with wolves. Spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that I find inspiring and inspirational. <br /> <br /> I saw the Spirit a third time and want to see it again. I really liked The Spirit, because his image of American Indians is realistic, dignified and not stereotypical, unlike the movie Road to Eldorado, which was a complete farce because he portrayed American Indians disrespectful and stereotypical. But Dreamworks has redeemed itself by making Spirit a great movie that I consider acceptable! I hope that they will continue to make more animated films, such as Spirit, and I would like to see the continuation or side effect of Spirit, if it is done with respect and without stereotyping American Indians. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this to others who have a frank mind to go and pay to see the Spirit: Cimarron Stallion.
