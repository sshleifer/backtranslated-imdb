The minute I started watching this, I realized that I was watching quality products, so I was not surprised to find that the script was written by Andrew Davis and producer Sue Birtwistle, and both of them brought us an excellent production of 1995! So my only complaint is that Emma didnâ€™t have 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes, such as Pride and Prejudice. The game was great, I think Prunella is great at Miss Bates, but I also loved Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong. Language is a pleasure to listen to, can you imagine that nowadays and in our time he has the right to swear at someone without even uttering a curse? Samantha Morton was gorgeous, as Miss Smith was actually casting in much the same way as in Pride and Prejudice. I liked it so much that I watched it twice in two days !! So thanks again to the BBC for another quality piece of television. I saw the Paltrow version, and that's fine, but I think the BBC version is much better. Excellent production, which I am very happy to have on DVD !!!
