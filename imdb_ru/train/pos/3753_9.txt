This short film, which inspired the release of the full-length film “Spatula Madness,” is a fun piece that combats similar cartoons involving several authors. The stars of the short film are Edward Spatula, who, after his dismissal from work, joins the fight against evil spoons. This premise allows some fun content at the beginning, but is barely present for the rest of the function. The 15-minute time of this film is absorbed by some strange comedy and a small musical number. Unfortunately, not much lies below. The plot that is set up, really does not have time to show. But he certainly follows the story better than many big-budget Hollywood movies. This film is worth watching at least a few times. Take it as it is, and do not expect a deep story.
