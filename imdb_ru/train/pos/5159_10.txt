This is definitely one of my favorite episodes of the track. There is so much going on in this movie that itâ€™s insanely awesome. First, the guys are heading down to an alien planet that is about to explode. They meet a bizarre librarian dude (very well played). Then Kirk manages to return to what is very similar to the land of the 16th century. McCoy and Spock try to follow, but instead almost freeze on the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years ago. Kirk manages to lock himself up and accuse him of witchcraft, while Spock spends some time with a sexy cave girl who was defeated in this frozen, horrible world by some bad guy. <br /> <br /> Spock decides that he is happy where he gives McCoy the royal meeting, when he is bothering when they need to find a way out. Anyway, they all finally run away, leaving the poor cave girl behind. It takes a ton of conviction before Spock finally gives up and leaves. You can literally feel the sadness at the end. Leaving the cave girl alone in her frozen desert seems cruel and very touching. Spock must have been out of his mind, leaving behind his greatest hope for love and being human. Although this is not a very good area! <br /> <br /> In any case, in this episode you get so much money for your dollar .... Love story, tests for the Salem witch, Spock as a man, despair of being left in complete isolation ... abandoned , and three completely different places on an alien planet. Amazingly, they managed to squeeze it all into one fifty-minute film. This is a classic, don't miss it .... I want it on a Ferraure DVD volcanoes !!!!!!
