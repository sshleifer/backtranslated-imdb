If you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue and imagination - without having to break into a song every twelve minutes - then this is the Disney movie for you! My sons liked every minute of this film, and I must admit that I laughed many times throughout the film. There are no juicy songs that could interfere with the wonderfully told story, and all the characters are attractive and recognizable in their own right. It should be one of Disney's “classics” because of its beautifully illustrated landscape and its non-stop excitement!
