I saw this film at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival, and this is a film, not a film, since it was obviously shot by HBO for display on their cable network sometime this year. In this film, Paige is portrayed as a bondage and fetish movie star and B & D stag actress who has enough talent to become a real actress. Page was a bit bigger, and the film touches on some of her other roles in modeling, but not enough to balance the career of the icon of the 50s. This film is supposedly based on Richard Foster's The Real Betty Page. This is shot in black and white for this nostalgia of the 1950s. I have a book called Betty Page. Life of a movie star legend, in which there are many wonderful photos telling about Page's career, and I must say that this film is played on a film with Gretchen Maul as Page, many of these famous photos are very accurate. Mole with Betty Page in a black wig and brown contact lenses - Betty Page. Not only does she look like Betty Page, but she has the smile and personality traits that went perfectly through the camera. And her body is as close to the copy of Page. Awesome casting. This story is quite thin and tabloid, and certainly could be much better. But this is a pretty good TV movie. I would rate it as 7.0 on a 10-point scale and would recommend viewing it when it is shown on TV.
