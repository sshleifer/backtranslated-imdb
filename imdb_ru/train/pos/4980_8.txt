While browsing the internet for previous sale prices, I stumbled upon these comments. Why are they all so serious? This is just a movie, and it is not pornographic. I purchased this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been delighted with it. I showed it to many of my friends, and they all liked it too. I feel privileged to enjoy this original 1932 Shimley silent 8mm film before it became popular or famous. After reading the other comments, I agree that this film is “colorful”. Big deal! I just wanted it to be longer. It seems I should be the only person who owns one of these originals, at least for sale, so I wonder how much it costs?
