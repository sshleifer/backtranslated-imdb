and laughing out loud is funny in many scenes. <br /> <br /> The main plot of the film is well recorded, the history of opposites, trying to find a way to survive in each other in close proximity. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the best film of Lemmon and Matto in the role of a colleague, and the negligent Oscar and OKD Felix’s classic interaction. <br /> <br /> The scene where Oscar lined up for a double date, leaves the room for a while, and returns to find Felix and the two girls who are all crying are pricelessly funny. <br /> <br /> For any fan of the clever comedies “Odd couple” - the film “Get out of the way to see it.”
