Although Chris Kristofferson is good at this role, who wouldn't want to see Elvis Pressley instead? With drug addiction and the fall of higher glory, the agent Elvis may have scared off to separate from the film, this was a mistake. It would be the perfect movie for Elvis. Although the soundtrack is far from overwhelming, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand are decently working on creating the original soundtrack for this “historical” play / musical. Something like a love story, it’s rather a drama about the fall and the gift of redemption. Like most tragedies, the hero of this story began to die. In addition, Gary Busey is again perfect in a not so perfect role.
