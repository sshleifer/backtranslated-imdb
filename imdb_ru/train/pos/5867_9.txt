Jacknif is a masterpiece of the 80s. This is a film that breathes an amazing acting and a very interesting directing touch. In Jacknif, both lovers of European and American cinema can find something to connect to. The script is very convincing and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris gives one of the greatest views to date. He portrays his alcoholic hero superbly, making us feel his broken heart in every line, in every movement. Robert De Niro makes us think again of him as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest, but also the most realistic performances in his career. Jacknif is never bored, as he shows his heroes the pure elements of any typical Hollywood character. After the war, no one is a hero. All the losers, and this film is about that simple truth. No one can repair parts of it after the war, like the characters in this film. Jacknif on the diseases of the soul that creates war. Just a great movie.
