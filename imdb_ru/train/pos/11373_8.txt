Here's a strange thing: a modern film about a serial killer who has no fight scenes, no one has seen the dying, no car chases and no loud noises ..... and this is happening in Russia. There are only two short action scenes, but they are terrible. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is detective work, and how much bureaucracy the poor detective had to go through to solve the murders. This is a very dark movie, and the “dark” best describes the personality of the hero (Stephen Rea). Nevertheless, the story is not depressing, and it is very interesting throughout. <br /> <br /> Rea is an outstanding, determined, horrified-looking detective. Jeffrey Demann is just as scary as a killer. Donald Sutherland's Russian accent is suspicious, but he plays the only character in this film who has some warmth. <br /> <br /> Once again, the story is littered with liberal agendas, here and there, not with one, but with two references to bias towards gays, the full justice of secular psychology, police and government officials, boorish / rude / fanatical, poison, poison, poison. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a clever and refreshing humble crime movie. This is a somewhat unique film, which is probably not very famous, but appeals to people who have seen it. Since it is based on a true killer story, it becomes even more frightening. Do not miss it just because you have nothing about it.
