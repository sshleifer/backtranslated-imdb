I have never met a single person (out of hundreds) who hated this film. I bet that anyone who votes against is a petty saboteur or his victim. This film has it all. Ask yourself: “Are you a fan ...?” Then watch the movie “Laputa”. <br /> <br /> This is not my favorite movie, but my favorite movie directed by the same person (Hayao Miyazaki). In any case, this is one of my top five. And I saw a lot of movies.
