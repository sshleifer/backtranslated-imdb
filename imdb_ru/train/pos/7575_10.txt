Resident Evil: code veronica is a great, well-made video game, great graphics, very convenient controls, great storyline and fun factor. The plot of this story - Claire Redfield is sent to the island for penetration into the territory of Umbrella and capture. In search of her brother, they are in the main laboratory. Veronica's graphics are very good, the effects of fire and rain are great. The controls are convenient, but the button template is not suitable for the Dreamcast control, which makes it difficult to use. It's still fun walking through a strange, disturbing place, shooting at zombies' guts. Code: veronica also has a bit of "romance" between the two main characters. You can also play for Chris Redfield from Resident Evil 1. The sound in this game is better than ever, for example, even though I hate a new feature, when giant spiders crawl, their legs make a disturbing sound, and the instruments sound a lot more realistic. Excellent graphics, outstanding history, easy operation and reality. Resistant sound makes Resident Evil Code: Veronica definitely loved. I give him 10 out of 10.
