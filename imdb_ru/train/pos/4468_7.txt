On vacation, two sailors - the lady Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and the shy innocent Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet the beautiful Susan Abbott (Katherine Grayson) and both fall in love with her. There is one more thing, but you probably guessed it. <br /> <br /> History (even for a musical of the 1940s) is ridiculous, and everything is so pleasant and useful - it becomes rather annoying. Also this movie is too long. It's 140 minutes, and it's too much for such a stupid story. There are also some boring numbers by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra. However, it is worth catching. <br /> <br /> When Kelly dances, or Sinatra or Grayson sings, it becomes magical. None of the songs will be particularly memorable, but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice that you wouldn't care. It is made in rich Technicolor with all the brilliance of MGM. With acting, everything is in order - Kelly is in order (although, seeing him as a lady pushing her), Sinatra is just gorgeous (although seeing him as a shy guy, she is also pushing her!). Grayson has nothing to do, but it looks incredibly beautiful. Some of her pictures literally took my breath! There are many highlights here: Sinatra and Kellyâ€™s big dance and vocals; Sinatra sings something; Two songs of Grayson and a fairly famous animation sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry - an animated mouse! Tom also makes a funny cameo. There is also a little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene he is in. <br /> <br /> So this is too long, and the plot just does not stand up, but it is still worth catching. It was a huge success in due time.
