People who scold this film are those who do not understand the film from the very beginning. These are people who love cinema blockbusters and oppose any film that does not have a star, Leonardo DiCaprio. "Wilder Napalm" is a neat little film that at first glance may seem strange and perhaps even silly, but it lacks a plot, it more than compensates for the content. <br /> <br /> One feature of the film - It struck me that it is the use of music that plays a big role. Those who study film music will notice how important the music is in the film, both in the life of Kinds and Wilder, and in the background. Wilder's theme, the theme of Kinds and the theme of Wallace - all this is heard in the opening sequence, and it's funny how some verses are played out. For example, in a scene where men sing "The Duke of the Count", Vida and Wilder when men sing something like "She's my girlfriend", and then she goes to Wallace to give him something when men sing Lyrics will be my girl, ‚Äùdeftly showing the tension between the two brothers. There are many small tricks in the film, and although it may look like a failure from the outside, a real student of the film will notice how well this film really is.
