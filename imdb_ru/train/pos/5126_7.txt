For urban cowboy, John Travolta plays one of the most powerful alpha males ever depicted on the big screen. He is a decent enough young man who leaves his parents' home and goes to the big city of Dallas, where his uncle Barry Corbin promised to find him a job in the petrochemical industry. In 1980, it began to grow rapidly, and Texas, of course, became a growing place in the United States. <br /> <br /> Travolta does a good job, forcing us viewers to take care of its character. He meets and marries Debra Winger, who is of the same origin, but she has some ideas that women should not be the shadow of their men. And when she hits him in mechanical bull Gilley, in the men's game, it's all for him. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn, a former convict, works in Gilly, and this film became his main role. He is a real serpent in Urban Cowboy, he just looks at Travolta the goat and approaches Winger. Travolta, in turn, meets a rich girl, Madolin Smith Osborne, who naunts Gilly. <br /> <br /> Despite the characters, Urban Cowboy was really a giant commercial for the world's biggest self-proclaimed honkeyk. Jilly no longer exists in the suburban Texan Pasadena community, but the memories continue to live. And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the great country / western song that was featured in the film. I'm not sure that some of the songs were written specifically for Urban Cowboy, but this is the only reason I can think of why the Film Academy ignored the musical aspects of this film. I especially liked the movie "In Search of Love" by Johnny Lee, if it was specifically written for this film, then it is a shame that he was not nominated for "Best Song". <br /> <br /> I liked Debra Wingerâ€™s character most of all in this movie. She does not lose track of femininity, but confronts Travolte and makes it stylish. And this review is dedicated to this as yet unknown woman who will one day become the first female racer in Professional Bull Riders.
