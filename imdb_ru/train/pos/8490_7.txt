I recently saw this film in my class of international business. I didn’t expect anything other than another boring documentary (not to mention the fact that I don’t like a documentary, I was just unlucky with films in this class). Imagine my surprise when this film appeared, actually a film. <br /> <br /> This film covers all the cultural differences in the workplace and how they need to work together to get anywhere. The clash of culture shows how different the world is and how differently we perceive ourselves, until someone comes and wakes us up. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who does business, or to those who just want to laugh, because yes, it's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, that's it! Hooray
