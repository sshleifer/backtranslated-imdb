Vonnegut's words are best perceived on paper. Fairy tales that he weaves are gossemara, silk threads of words and expressions that are not easy to translate into the world of Marilyn Manson or Jerry Bruckheimer's explosions. His words were well considered once, in the wonderful Slaughterhouse-5. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Mother's Night is one of three novels that Vonnegut wrote on a desert island, along with Slaughterhouse 5 and Bluebeard. <br /> <br /> The film version deserves 10, but the books are so constantly part of my inner landscape that I just can't do it ... some scenes left outside the film are part of my memory ...
