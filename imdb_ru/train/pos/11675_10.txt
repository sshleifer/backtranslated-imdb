I always follow Dakar, so when my husband bought Charlie's “Race to Dakar” DVD, I couldn't wait to watch it! Of course, we saw the broadcast of the race when the real race began, but it never gives the background and specific teams. <br /> <br /> If you watched the Long Way Round, you won’t be surprised by a language that frankly seems to me more fun than offensive. <br /> <br /> I think the only thing that annoyed me on the DVD was Charlie's hair, but it was styled before Dakar, so my female need for tidiness was relaxed; Although, I could live without “flaming” panties LOL. As with the LWR, the preparation was as interesting as the race itself. I almost cried when Charlie broke his arm and shuddered at every bruise he received during a workout ... and, of course, Andy Caldicott's death ... it was a terrible tragedy, but something happens every year. <br /> <br /> Russ drives me crazy, although his attitude has improved a thousand times compared to the well-argued cynic he was in the LWR. Nice to see that he gets along so well with Charlie. <br /> <br /> I learned from this odyssey that: 1. Never let Scorpio prepare your car for ANYTHING! - they had months to prepare the X5, and yet the day before the team left for Lisbon, Scorpion did only half of what needed to be done, and the car was a pain throughout the race; 2. Dakar organizers need to put much more effort into their racetrack / driver search plan, leaving Matt (and, apparently, a large number of other racers / drivers to dry up what they did was nothing more than guilty negligence; 3 Charlie is very enthusiastic about the “rough and difficult” adventures, but he has a lot to do in order for him to really perform as he wants, and finally 4. Charlie and Ewan are planning another one of these epics called “ Long Way Down "in 2007, and I can't wait to get get your hands on it !: D If you like bikes and / or really good guys who want to try, you have to watch it, I guarantee you like it. It is very interesting. <br /> <br /> In conclusion Simon Pavey - you, sir, hero, I was so impressed with your manner of "quiet achievement" and the fact that you actually finished ... it's just incredible considering that this is a monumentally difficult race. And Charlie, Matt and the rest of the team - a full assessment for what they did. To think that a relatively green team can have achieved so much is truly admirable. You are all wonderful.
