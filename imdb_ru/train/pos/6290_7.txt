Using Buster Keaton at the twilight of his career was an interesting choice. Perhaps he was the most talented comedian of the era of silence. This gives him the chance to show these talents in a small history of time travel. He is associated with a guy living in the modern era, and it becomes obvious that we can best stay in our own time, Keaton is able to fulfill his sights very well. I heard his voice before. I think he made some of these films at a beach party, playing a few empty characters to earn a few dollars. Serling seemed to respect him and portray him in that way. This is not a bad story. It shows how a person reacts when we want something that we donâ€™t have, and we get this desire.
