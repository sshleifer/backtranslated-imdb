This movie must be burned to DVD. It was so funny, and I liked it. Indeed, very cute and funny. Not realistic, but should not be. The only thing I didnâ€™t like about it was a girl who relied too much on the guy. This represents a time of thinking. I tried to get this film for so long, and it was unavailable for the American format only in the UK and will not be played on American DVD players. Unfortunately, this is an overrated classic movie! Believe it or not, this film can easily become a cult favorite for all ages. It is a pity that we did not legalize some things that could really save small countries or our own. Lindy is an unsinkable, positive character who makes lemonade from lemons. She is cheerful and charming. She stole the show!
