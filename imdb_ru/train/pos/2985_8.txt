The whole point of creating this film, one of the earliest and best international color releases of the cinematographic opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it succeeded perfectly. The general public would not stop at a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt, if they played the typical 300 pounds for 40 tenors and soprano with vocal equipment for the proper singing of glorious music. Hence the visual replacement of great directors (young Loren, beautiful Della Marra and charming Miss Maxwell), who make the story much more believable, giving those who are not familiar with the plot or music more likely to enter the world . In general, a charming introduction to one of the great works of Verdi. I remember seeing it when I was in high school, and it certainly aroused my interest in opera, a form with which I was not well acquainted. I still treat this film with love and highly recommend it to those who can appreciate the excellent music, accompanied by better than usual visual effects. Luciano Della Marra was an outstanding performer in the role of Radames, and, unfortunately, for the audience did not appear in any other films.
