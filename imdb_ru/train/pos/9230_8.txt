There is so much to say about this movie. This is not your typical non-proliferation. Of course, there is nudity and sex with nuns, but this is almost a coincidence for the story. <br /> <br /> This is a 15th-century Italy, during the martyrdom of 800 Christians in Otranto. The battle between Muslims and Christians takes up most of the film. It was interesting when everyone ran away from a Muslim, and the head of the mother asked: “Why are you afraid of Muslims, will they not do anything that Christians have done to you?” Of course, there was enough torture on both sides. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia (Florinda Balkan) goes to a convent for challenging her father. However, she observes and experiences many things: the stallion's gelding, the rape of a local woman by a new duke, the torture of a nun, which she overcame while visiting the tarantula sect, and whipping herself when she ran off with a Jew. The torture was especially disgusting when hot wax was poured on the nun and her nipples were cut off. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia will inevitably run into problems when she questions the society in which the male in whom she lives dominates. She even asks Jesus why father, son and holy spirit are all men. <br /> <br /> In the end, she joins the Muslim leader and becomes his lover, and they dismiss the monastery. Here you see more flesh than you can enjoy at once. But tragedy lies ahead. She manages to take revenge on everyone, including the duke and her father, but discovers that the Muslim lover treats her the same way. She is a woman, and that is all that needs to be done. <br /> <br /> I will not describe what the holy people of the church did to this heretic at the end, but this precedes the torture of Pyla or the Hostel for decades. <br /> <br /> Fans will be happy with the treats, but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest.
