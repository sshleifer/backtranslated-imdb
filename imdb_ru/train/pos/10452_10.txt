I want Celine and Jesse to go further in their relationship, I want to tell them that they are made for each other, that in many moments of the film we want them to die for each other. Their story is what we have ever wanted, and probably most of us never reached. It's about love, but not about stupid things like Notting Hills or similar movies. This is life, and I believed in them, I believed that they fall ... It was so clever and touching. I just finished looking at it a minute ago, and I'm still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible again. <br /> <br /> I have to say that now I was becoming a misanthrope and felt as if love was just a fake concept, but with this film I realized that maybe sometimes Sometimes and sometimes when that something can really happen. <br /> <br /> I’m French and didn’t know July Delpi very well, despite the fact that Keslowski is “three colors: white” ... Now I have to see her different. It works because it looks like an angel and got a great game. <br /> <br /> I saw "before sunset" (continued in Paris) a few days before I saw "before the sun rises", and this does not matter. They are both masterpieces. proof that you don’t need to amaze your eyes with technology to get pure feelings. I apologize for my English, which I try best. <br /> <br /> Franck in France
