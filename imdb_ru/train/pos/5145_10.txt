<br /> <br /> An old man works as a cleaner in a mental hospital to be near his wife who is there and try to pull her out. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the era of silence and strangeness in the history of Japanese cinema. Without thinking for a long time, in the 70s an imprint was found and a musical soundtrack was added, which perfectly matches the images. This could have been influenced by the office of Dr. Caligari (director Kinugasa stated that he had never watched a German film). However, it is superior in style and more convincing (and cold) image of the internal mental state of prisoners in the shelter. To achieve this, the film uses every available technique of the film: multiple exposures and unfocused subjective point of view, camera angles at an angle, fast and slow movement, expressionist lighting and overlap. It is also a very difficult movie to watch, as there are no interruptions. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a montage of shots of rain falling on the windows of the hospital, wind, shaking trees and thunder. Alarming weather metaphors the patients mental state and represents one of them: a former dancer. The combination of the sounds produced by rain, wind and thunder, serves as music that impels the dancer to plunge into a mad, almost hypnotic dance. In another episode, where the same patient is participating in another rabid dance, other prisoners are watching her. Multiple shows of the dancer reflect the viewpoint of the patients and their intricate "view" of the world. <br /> <br /> These are just two examples from this amazing film, trying to portray the patients â€™subconscious and ideas about them. "Healthy" world. <br /> <br /> In three words MUST SEE.
