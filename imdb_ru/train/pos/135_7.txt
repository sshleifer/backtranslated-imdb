It was a great piece for a puppet show, because this film showed all the series, from one to seven. And it was about one woman trying to stop the new puppeteer, because I would never have guessed that the puppets would be hurt. In addition, he showed some of the puppet master series that I did not see, and I think it is as bad as the second part. This showed the appearance of the Torch, which can turn things and people, which is cool, and showed the puppet master's return from the first part. He also showed the little aliens from the fourth part, which was also cool, he showed other people's episodes that could be useful to them, and that was the case. So thanks to this Puppet Master there will be a great success.
