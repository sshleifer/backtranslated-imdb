This is one of the best TV series with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (or Biohazard: Last Escape). The game has a very nice storyline in which you play as Claire Redfield in search of her brother Chris Redfield (Who you probably know from the original Resident Evil). Itâ€™s as scary as the other Resident Evil, and contains many cut scenes. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** of ***** Stars (Rating based on comparison with other video games)
