The storyline was quite interesting, but the characters were rather flat and sometimes too extreme in their thoughts / behavior. More extreme than necessary. Also, I think something went wrong in the casting. John Turtrore doesnâ€™t really satisfy me by playing with a semi-amateur chess player, not to mention an Italian player. Motives are also not very outlined. <br /> <br />
