Always loved this movie from the cover of the video. In the end, they got to the purchase for the top five on sale and for the film which one. Just an amazing presentation from the whole affair, and it was shot so beautifully. Even sometimes at a distance, so you barely hear what dialogue is, as if you really are at that distance, collecting pieces of history. It is really touching, often funny and very watchable. Not a lot of dialogue, but filmed in such a way that you feel so much. 9/10 from me. Must see.
