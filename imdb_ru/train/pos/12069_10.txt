Yes, this is incorrect, especially if you like Hollywood movies that require a lot of effects, purely entertaining or fantastic stories or stories, and you cannot think for yourself. <br /> <br /> Roag’s films for an intelligent moviegoer, and Stranger is a great example. <br /> <br /> The characteristics are brilliant, the story is excellent, but, like in all Nick Rogue films, at every level you think about aspects of reality that you would never see. His films always make you think, and I personally like it in the film. <br /> <br /> So don’t expect to get away from watching this movie and feel happy, because you’re probably frustrated. <br /> <br /> But I think this is great.
