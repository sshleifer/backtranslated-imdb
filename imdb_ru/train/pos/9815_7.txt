Being the first feature film with Robert De Niro (although not released many years later), itâ€™s worth seeing. De Niro's role is not huge, but funny, because one of two friends first tries to prevent his marriage with other friends, and then follows him in order to get him to take part. Any devotee fan of De Niro will enjoy an early performance, perhaps the best actor today.
