Dressed to Kill is Brian DePalma's best movie, an absolute thrilling ride with tension, humor and style that remains unsurpassed today. DePalma has a naked rap in Hollywood, as most people claim he is ripping off Alfred Hitchcock. He is not. Hitchcock could only dream about what DePalma shows in his thrillers. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the original uncut version of "Dressed to Kill" is no longer available on video. The current copy, released Goodtimes, is an abbreviation approved by Jack Valenti R. But some copies of the original version of DePalma still exist. It is distributed by Warner Home Video in a green cardboard box with Angie Dickinson on the cover or in a black clamshell case with a theatrical poster on a silver lining. These are the ones that you can get if you can find a copy. I have a green one and it is among my treasured possessions. <br /> <br /> In any case, back to the story. Dickinson plays Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated wife who is treated by Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Kane) for her obsessive fantasies. During a trip to the museum (a real trip for DePalma in terms of camera work and waiting), Miller was picked up by a stranger. You can pretty much guess what is going on with it, since the ads and the decorations give out the story. But there are several complications. The prostitute (Nancy Allen) is the only witness to the murder. Son Kate Miller Peter (Keith Gordon) - the genius of a teenager who decided to solve a crime. And on Dr. Elliott's answering machine, there is a definite message ... about the missing razor ... <br /> <br /> I don’t indulge you with the film at all, since what I described above occurs inside the first half hour of discovery and the biggest surprises DePalma reserved for the last hour. However, this film is enough for Valenti (head of the MPAA) to demand a film cut. What surprises me is the cuts he wanted. A few cuts in the opening shower and one or two cutting scenes and some dialogues by Nancy Allen (Valenti wanted the rooster to change to a bulging one). This is a very cruel and bloody film, but there are still objections to sexual content. I would really like to hear Valenti's explanation of how to see two women in a tender love scene in “The Lost and Crazy” is somehow more harmful for the young mind than Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is carrying people with a chain gun. This is simply unfair. <br /> <br /> What makes “Dressed to kill” so good that not only first-class technical loans, but also very good performance. Michael Caine, who was in big shit during this time period, gives one of his best performances as a doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than usual, perhaps because she actually plays an important role here. Nancy Allen adds this to her play, which is considered one of the most underrated and undervalued actresses in the world. Keith Gordon is great as a genius, and I loved all his inventions. <br /> <br /> DePalma is one of our best directors who has never received the recognition he deserved. A recent joke from the list of the best thrillers AFI 100 showed that in fact very few people know what a thriller is. If they really opened their eyes this time, they would see that DePalma made his career in thrillers and in fact is the best master. This is even better than "Psycho." It is a pity that very few actually know this. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
