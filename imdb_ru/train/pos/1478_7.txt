I liked this movie, although halfway I could tell who was his secret admirer. <br /> <br /> I also wonder if it is based on a true story, because it was about “real” people. at the end of the movie. I think I will have to investigate this and inform you. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember the condition in which this happened? I believe that they moved to North Carolina, if I am not mistaken. <br /> <br /> Of course, states could be changed to protect innocents. <br /> <br /> You might think that this person understood it as easily as I did. Was he stupid or what?
