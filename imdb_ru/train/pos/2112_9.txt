In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (as Clara Novak) gets a job as a clerk in a gift shop; there she quarrels with colleague James Stewart (as Alfred Kralik). These two do not get along at work, because everyone fell in love with an invisible pen pal. Observing how Ernst Lubicch directs these stars through the inevitable, predictably satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> Even better is the story of the owner of the store, Frank Morgan (as Hugo Matushek), who suspects that his wife has an affair. By hiring a private investigator, Morgan confirms that his 22-year-old wife is having sex with one of his younger employees. Morgan, painfully aware: "She just did not want to grow old with me," and the secondary characters - that is what keeps this film from aging. Shop around the corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubich ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Shildkraut
