“Hot Millions” is a well-written, well-played story about embezzlement that steals (scream! Is too low a word for embezzlement, according to the main character Peter Ustinov) “hot million” from the London branch of an American corporation, creating dummy corporations on the continent and using a supposedly secure computer firm to transfer funds to them. (Remember, the police spoiler is a comedy, not a mystery.) <br /> <br /> Since 1968, the image of computers in this film may seem naive to a more modern computer population; but as someone who has worked with computers since this film was released, I would argue that even then, it looks like it was written by computer illiterates and, for them, probably with the aim of enhancing the comic aspects of this British the movie. <br /> <br /> If someone doesn’t have a special taste for this kind of entertainment, then the film may seem to be dragged out. Fortunately, it has a well-finished finish; Unfortunately, the end credits do not give an indication of the classical music used in them - the symphonic piece at the end and the duet of the piano flute in the middle - only the song performed by Lulu, which I don’t remember at all.
