Remember these two stories with love, and in the first one, set in the near future, we see a young boy preparing for the exam day, state test i.q. The boy is a little puzzled by his parents' anxiety, as some of his friends have already done so and are finally sent for testing. On arrival, he is given an injection, and he wonders why. The examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure that he is telling the truth. The boy asks, puzzled again, why not? Later, parents are anxiously sitting and waiting at the screen when a message appears stating that the state regrets, but their son’s level i.q has exceeded the national coefficient, and politely asked if they would like to arrange a personal burial. Corker final scene! The “Message of Mercy” was a heartbreaking story about a happy emotional connection between a girl from the past and a boy from the present. Which looms in the strange history of accusations of witchcraft in the past and delve into the pages of history in the present. A good story with an emotional conclusion.
