First of all, for this film I have only one word: “wow”. This is probably one of the best films that touched me, from his story to his performances, which Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni played so wonderfully. I was very impressed with this last one, because it really brought depth to the character, because it was a very difficult role. Nevertheless, two of them formed a couple, which surprised me from beginning to end, showing friendship along the way, filled with love, which develops throughout the day, settled in the film. The narrative takes some time, as familiarity with the characters is long, but in the end we get a beautiful story about love and humanity. If you have such an opportunity, watch it, because it is a film that will remain in your memory for a long time. Just amazing - 9/10.
