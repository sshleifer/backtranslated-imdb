I first came across Linda Feferman's “Seven Minutes in Heaven” when I was 14, and I worked in a video store, and I liked it. I recently watched the movie again and realized that it was a lost treasure. Movie stars Jennifer Connelly, almost twenty years before she wins an Oscar for Perfect Mind, like Nathalie Becker. Byron Thames plays his best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. This film is definitely a softer, prettier and softer version of the movie “Pretty in Pink” and “A Little Amazing” of the 1980s, and that is why it is so good. This is fair and not coerced, as in these films, and parents will enjoy watching this film with their children. <br /> <br /> When Natalie's dad leaves home for a business trip, Jeff convinces her that he should move because his home life is crap. With the support of her friend Nathalie Polley, played by Maddie Corman, she lets him. But this film is not about putting children in such situations and seeing what they get away with. Three passages are so natural, and the script, surprisingly, is so honest that what is best shown in their speeches is heartbreaking. These characters really care about each other. This is an excellent film that can be shown to children who have reached adolescence <br /> <br />
