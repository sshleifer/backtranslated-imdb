This film is based on the art of Frank Frazetta, the mythical illustrator of fantasy. Some of the characters are directly from his paintings (the best example is Death Merchant). Surprisingly, the animation manages to preserve the feeling of original art. Bakshi is well known for his heavy use of the rotoscope (live action sequence tracking technique), and this film is no exception. However, since the plot of the film is quite realistic (all the characters are people), this works quite well. <br /> <br /> But I really like the plot: this time we have a story with interesting characters. and good action movies, a really disgusting villain and a great kid. This film feels the best of Conanâ€™s comics, which is not surprising, because Roy Thomas is the author of the Marvel series of our favorite Cimmerian! This is far from stupid live action Conan, not to mention all the B-movies of this genre. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommended!
