I never saw it when I was a child, so it was visible with fresh eyes. I have never heard of this and rented it for my 5 year old daughter. Plus, the idea that Christopher Walken sings and dances makes me curious. Special fx are cheesy, and singing and dancing are mediocre. But the story is great. My daughter was fascinated. I liked to see how Walken in this role thinks about what awaits him in the future. It's very funny to see him dancing! And if the songs were not good, at least they were not the over-produced sugar sweetness of Disney. The ogre scene at the beginning was a bit scary for her, and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end, but it was mostly mild. But by remaining true to almost every aspect, Walkenâ€™s game made it believable. Great pleasure. I would watch it again with my daughter.
