"The 40-year-old virgin" tells about Andy Stitzer, a forty-year-old man who works in an electronic store that has no particular social life, and he is very clumsy in relation to women. Some of his employees at the store invite him one night, and they discover that Andy is still a virgin, so they plan to help him lose his virginity. Once in the store, Andy meets a woman named Trish, who gives him his phone number, and, in the end, Andy is gaining enough courage to go on a date with her, and they begin to really love each other, but Andy is still very embarrassed, when it comes to sex, and he will have to tell Trish about it, much to his embarrassment, if he can really have the courage to tell her before everything becomes embarrassing. "The 40-year-old virgin" has good leadership, a good script, good comedy performances of the whole cast, good cinematography and good film editing. The stars of the film and his coauthor Steve Carell, who makes a very good comedic breakthrough, and his screenplay for the film is also very good. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film. It's cute, fun, interesting, fun, pleasant, clever, good-natured and having a good time. This film is as good as this year's Wedding Crashers, and both are two of the best comedies I've ever seen. "The 40-year-old virgin" actually demonstrates a lot of talents, and it finds good use, it works like a comedy and romance, and it's cute and very fun. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
