This is the second short film Animatrix, and the first one, which can be called "artistic." It contains many references, metaphors and symbols in a dense amount of material, especially with a duration of 9 minutes. I have heard some complaints that this is “anti-human” or is trying to direct hatred towards a person for their “sins against the machine”. I do not think this is true; he simply uses robots to show us that, as humans, we are not particularly susceptible or unbiased towards anyone other than ourselves. I would say that he does an excellent job with this. The plot is good ... it plays like a historical document telling about what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy. Thus, it contains clips from fictional news and the like. The voice is very good, if it is not much. The animation is good, and the use of color, despite the usually realistic drawing style, makes it more open to smooth transitions and other surreal images. It has several chunks of violent violence and disturbing visual effects, as well as some nudity. The disc has a comment, but not in English, but with subtitles, which is worth listening / reading. There is also a well-made and informative creation based on both parts, so I would advise seeing it after viewing the next one. I recommend this to anyone who loves the Matrix universe and / or science fiction in general. 8/10
