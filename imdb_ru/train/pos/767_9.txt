As I am a true product of the hip-hop generation and electronic dance music, this is without a doubt one of my favorite films of all time. “Beat Street”, although not as “authentic” in some respects as Wild Style, is a film that is sure to draw the hearts of those who are proud of the culture of urban sampling / DJ music and the culture of electric clubs. br /> <br /> Although I admit that sometimes the dialogues sound a bit silly, you can't help but feel the characters and, ultimately, “want you to be there”, to start a hip-hop culture in New York . City in the early eighties. The b-boy battle scene at the Roxy nightclub (a real-time competition between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and NYC Breakers) is just as important to the archives of hip hop fans as any classic album. Watch some switch movements in slow motion, if possible, to truly appreciate the sporting and stylistic experience of an experienced B-boy / B-girl. All praise thanks to the Zulu nation !!!
