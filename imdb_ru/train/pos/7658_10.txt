<br /> <br /> I have seen this movie many times. At least a dozen. But, unfortunately, not lately. However, in my memory, the scene in which Mickey Rooney, “Mirs's Killer”, knows that he must be executed, and it comes close to the moment of truth, He dances, cries and laughs, he ranges from Hesteria to euphoria and controls the eternal gambit of emotions. I have never seen such a brilliant performance of any living or dead actor, past or present. Then I knew for sure that Mickey Rooney, yes, Andy Hardy was and remains an actor of a great genius. No matter how much I think about this over the years, I must be alone in this view. About 15 years after I watched this movie for the last time on TV, I accidentally read the old question and answer section in the Los Angeles Times. The question was asked to Laurence Olivier, and the question was: “Mr. Olivier. You are considered one of the greatest actors of all time, whom you consider to be one of the greatest actors? ”His answer was:“ Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney, ”I was stunned, but not surprised. I immediately flashed back to his “Killer Mears”, and I felt very good seeing this great ability in him, and now, when my view was supported by another, whose work I admired ... Later, of course, was “Bill” and many other moments with Micah Rooney. This film, Last Mile, should be seen by all the cast. Honestly, I can't remember much about the film after all these years, but Mr. Rooney in it will never leave me. If anyone out there remembers this film just like me? I would be interested to hear from you. For this picture, captured in my heart, I gave her 10 points in the face of his speech.
