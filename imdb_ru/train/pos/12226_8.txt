This is the best movie for all time! I say this because I'm a big fan of Silverstone? Partially, but even without it, I still see it. I'm a fan of serial killer films and I think this is a great entry in this category. In addition, Mary Giordano is easily included in the top five characters of Alicia. Totally memorable - as if it really exists. I would also be on her side if there was a riddle that needs to be solved. She plays a character, as in real life, with full confidence in everything she does. It seems sweet, honest, sweet ... like in real life. So does this work? Yes, indeed, she is again like a rebel. This time she’s not bad, she’s too good and a little afraid to do things that seem above the law. But she doesn’t do what a normal teenager would do. Instead, she spends time reading the detective magazines and uncovers crimes. A cliché abound: she kind of avenged the death of her father differently than in the style of alertness. At that time, Alicia seemed to play the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without parents, alone. It happens here, but this time it is a bit boring. It does not matter; she's still cool as a nerd. Check it out soon, otherwise Giordano will investigate why you are not ...
