> Contrary to most of the reviews that I read, I did not feel that it followed any other rock film (“Spinal Tap”, etc.). The story was more unique, although I feel that most people wanted to see "sex", the vices of drugs and rock and roll, which the group referred to. <br /> <br />> As an American, I knew several actors — Spolla, Connelly, and Rea. Surprised to learn that "Brian" / Bruce Robinson was in the classic "Romeo and Juliet" Ziffredi (<sp?). I think I will have to rent it next time. <br /> <br />> “The flame is still burning” - my wife, originally from Mexico, didn’t know English / British very well, missed some of the jokes (which I dutifully explained), but she cried out at the concert stage . Now she really likes this song. <br /> <br />> It's funny that Amazon.com has a soundtrack for $ 30 or more when I bought a DVD in the trash can at Wal-Mart for $ 5.50. Despite the price, I saw it for the first time on a late night cable and since then I really wanted to find it.
