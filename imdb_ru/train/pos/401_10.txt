I just returned from Hong Kong for the summer holidays and saw the “Legend of memory”. I thought it kicked * s! It was so creative and unique. This is the Hidden Dragon of the Stalking Tiger with much less drama. Even if some people think that there were too many special effects (yes!), You can't complain about the cast. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are so good !!! Legend of ZU ..... kicks * s !!!!!!!!
