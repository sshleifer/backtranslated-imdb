This film has a very simple but clever premise - an unemployed man trying to steal him from a convenience store, and the store salesman catches him on the spot ... the thief runs off with the seller right behind him. All this time, the seller has problems with the gangster Yakuza. In pursuit of the thief, they catch the eye of the yakuza, who was looking for a seller in the store. Then the story goes to the very height in the form of Tom and Jerry (cat and mouse), but is added with a dog stalking the cat. The entire 2nd act of D.A.N.G.A.N. The runner (can be translated into English as “PINBALL RUNES”) is about the chase, and the chase continues to such an extent that by the end of the 2nd act the homeless man forgets why he is running away, and don Yakuza does not remember which of the two guys he is chasing, nor does he remember why they run away from him. <br /> <br /> As in the subsequent SABU film “POSTMAN BLUES”, the main part of the film is simply pursued. and action, with lots of physical comedy and dark humor, introduced to keep the audience involved. What fails is the end to which the persecution stops when three people exhaust themselves and to one of the most chaotic Mexican standoffs you see in the film, which looks almost like Sabu pays homage to Tony Scott. REAL ROMANCE (by Quentin Tarantino).
