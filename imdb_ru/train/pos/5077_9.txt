Indian cinema is the police of two broad categories: they are either honest or bad guys. Honest guys always scream at the top of their voices and fight the system, while the bad cops get the most pleasure, but they suffer at the end. <br /> <br /> This film at least violates this usual formula and gives a refreshing look to the police and their lives. Direction looks from the inside at the life of a young ambitious policeman. The music is interesting, and editing is a trend setter for Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> From time to time, the film is slow, and the dilemma Anbu faces when it comes to Maya is sometimes overestimated. But I would still give it 9/10 simply because there are a lot of first assets in it.
