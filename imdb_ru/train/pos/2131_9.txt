This is a movie that gets better every time I see it. There are so many nuances in it. William Tracy, like Pepi, is a delight, bringing a sharp comic relief. Joseph Shildkraut in the role of Wadas is the only “villain” in the film, and his oil spells are well used here. Frank Morgan is amazing as the owner of the title shop Mr. Matushek, and his usual manner is well used here. I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressar as Pirovich. Very plausible in all aspects of his role. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are equally successful, Margaret Sullivan does an excellent job of depicting a slightly desperate, neurotic, but charming and attractive woman. <br /> This film is owned by Jimmy Stewart, though. The film is presented from his point of view, the action revolves around it. Mr. Stuart more than copes with the task of making a film with a stunning performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just look at Stuart when he is fired from his job due to a misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that the event is so traumatic, so beautiful. In my opinion, James Stewart is without a doubt the greatest film actor in the history of a medium. There is no one who has ever been captured in a film that could so fully convey what it feels to the audience. At the time he starred in this film, he had a big part of his career ahead of him, but he was completely master of his work. This is one of the best Jimmy Stewarts films, as well as one of the sweetest, most pleasant romantic comedies you will find. I highly recommend this film, especially for those who appreciate the work of Stuart.
