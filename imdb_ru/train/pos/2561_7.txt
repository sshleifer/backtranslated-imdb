Released in December 1957, Sayonara earned 8 Oscar nominations and scored 4 wins. Red Buttons won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in the role of pilot Joe Kelly, who fell in love with a Japanese woman while in Kobe during the Korean War. Oscar nominated for Best Leading Actor, Marlon Brando plays Major Lloyd Grover, an ace flying from the Korean War, moved to Japan, who strongly supported the resistance of military marriages between American troops and Japanese women and unsuccessfully trying to dissuade his friend Joe Kelly to marry. Ironically, the character of Marlon Brandos soon finds his own love in a woman of Japanese descent. This film highlights the prejudices and cultural differences of the time. Filmed in beautiful colors and with a stunning background, I found this film that is worth seeing only for these effects. Good movie, give me more ... GimmeClassics
