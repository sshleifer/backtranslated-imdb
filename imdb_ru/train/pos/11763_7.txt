I think everyone should be back at some point. And this is exactly what the embarrassed Taft resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) intends to do in the “Best Time”. Yes, the man who went crazy with the radio in Good Morning Vietnam plays football. In this case, he seeks to reproduce the game, which was worth his high school prestigious title. But former team mate Renault Hightower (Kurt Russell) will not just put up with it. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not the best movie for both. But Williams and Russell are actually a very good comedy team. And some of the names in this movie probably give you a giggle (to say the least). Check this.
