I love this movie / short thing. Jason Steele is awesome! My favorite parts are “French song” and in the introductory title, when the spat soldier shouts “SPOONS!” I crack every time. I would recommend this movie to Knox Klaymation fans and people who like other Jason Steele films. His animation style is very original. It takes several views to notice detailed backgrounds. His humor is also cheerful, and definitely not what you heard before. Like Max - a deformed spatula, which has a sound and light system in his head, which radiates bright lights and cheerful music whenever he talks about his unhappy life. This is an excellent animation for viewing anytime and anywhere.
