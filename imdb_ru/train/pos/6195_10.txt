After watching this film a few months ago, he continues to jump back into my mind, and I feel that I should buy it or at least see it again, although I watched it at least 3 times when I was shooting it at that moment . <br /> <I fell in love with director Hal Hartley many years ago - I found that these films can make me laugh in a place that is rarely entertained. This strange feeling is a matter of course, and I guess most people really just don’t understand it, or it makes them feel embarrassed and somewhat uncomfortable - I think, I just really understand - it’s as if these films were made for me . <br /> <br /> Although I don’t remember if I laughed out loud during this film, it remains one of the funniest films I've seen in years. If you don’t see the humor from the grocery bag that Fay takes from the street to the church, to the editorial office of her brother, to the office of the director of her son, you may not be smart enough to be impressed by this film. The bag itself is a silent character, dragged around the motherhood icon, which is usually carried by the cheeky stern Parker Posey, before the international intrigue of the rest of the film takes possession of it. <br /> <br /> I think Henry the Fool is my least favorite Hartley movie. I honestly don’t remember it very well - I think the character itself was so disgusting that I found it tedious. Hartley's strength seems to be the development of a female character. <br /> <br /> Aside from the brilliance of Posey, it was great to see Elina Lowenson, one of my favorite actresses, again. Her extravagant naivety is perfect for the leadership of Hartley. His ability to make outrageous seem trivial helps define his style as delightful chronic irony everywhere. <br /> <br /> This film breaks out in a very important international intriguing story explaining the political situations in Afghanistan. It is never suspected at the beginning. The complexity of the development of this film is unmatched. <br /> <br /> This is the embodiment of "independent" continuation. The less you know about Henry the Fool, the more secrets are uncovered around him, the less you expect him to appear by the end of the film - like a machine for filing complaints about smoking of alcoholic beverages, hurling insults at your Islamic ranger, who somehow seems , respects him, It's like finding out that Santa Claus is actually a 12-year-old school bully. <br /> <br /> Although I was impressed and satisfied with Hartley’s other recent films “The Girl from Monday” and “Nothing Like It,” “Fay Grim” goes far beyond what I expected, with a sense of humor and originality, about which no Oscar winner dares.
