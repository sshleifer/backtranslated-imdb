It is very difficult to say what happened to the Lady from Shanghai and that the film could have been without studio intervention. At this point, Orson Welles’s main interest in the film was to raise money for his theater; in fact, financing his own projects was what made him look for acting work. He made the “Lady of Shanghai” for his future ex-wife Rita Hayworth. Harry Cohn feared for the image of Rita and kept the release of this film for one year. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns the Irish sailor Michael O'Hara, who falls in love with the Rest (Hayworth, stunning short blonde hair). Her husband is a renowned criminal lawyer, Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloan), who is also mutilated inside and out. He hires O'Hara to work on his yacht, and there O'Hara is sinking deeper and deeper into the network of murder and deception. <br /> <br /> The Lady from Shanghai is moving at the speed of a snail, although I agree with one of the posters that today films are being criticized for taking the time to build a plot. However, this film is addictive. The scene in the fun house is fantastic - Wells wanted it without music, and I think the studio cut it. It's a shame. Photography everywhere is awesome, atmospheric, bold and very stylish. <br /> <br /> Wells was a great actor, handsome in his youth, charismatic and with a great voice and technique, but in many films it is almost as if he doesn’t trust himself or spend time on character development. Instead, he relies on external factors such as accents and fake noses. One of the few times when he did not do this was “Tomorrow Forever,” where the director gets an excellent, deeply tangible work. Compare this with “Coercion”, where he shows that he is a master of purely technical acting, when he is on the phone in his performance. Here Wells performs quadruple duty - as a director, star, co-author and narrator. Highlighting a completely unnecessary accent and intense appearance is a quick path to characterization. However, it is always irresistible. <br /> <br /> Supporting players are excellent, including Sloan and Glenn Anders. Hayworth, gorgeous and with a soft voice (her singing was again dubbed by Anita Ellis), as usual, a complete goddess and one of the great screen presences. What a sad life for such a bright beauty. <br /> <br /> Any film that was shot by Orson Welles is worth seeing, and “The Lady from Shanghai” is no exception. But it leaves the viewer disappointed, as well as the “Magnificent Ambersons” - like any work that Wells did in the studio system. He was a great artist who should have been given freer power; he was not He had a strange dichotomy - he needed more freedom, but, as some of his later works show, he needed a studio structure. Alas, he could not have both.
