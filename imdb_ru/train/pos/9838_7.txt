Born Again is a good episode of the first season. In my opinion, reincarnation is awesome. The more I watch it, the more I like it, but it will never rise above “Very Good” for me. Although it is not very memorable, I will always remember it as an episode of reincarnation. In any case, now I will say what is good and bad in this episode, <br /> <br /> The Good: Oragami. Oh yeah! <br /> <br /> This aquarium was good. =] <br /> <br /> Thrown out of the window. Very stylish x] <br /> <br /> The Bad: marry your best friend's wife!? O_O <br /> <br /> What a random choice to reincarnate. <br /> <br /> Why didn't the guy who died entangled in the scarf try to take off the scarf instead? <Br /> <br /> Conclusion: good, the episode is not very memorable. 7/10
