Pride's Father was the best new show to hit TV since Family Guy. It was another masterpiece from talented people from Dreamworks Animation. Like the Simpsons, the show centers around the nuclear family (white lions, in this case). It also contains many memorable characters, including the orangutan Roger, the Italian and American flamingos of Vincent, the eccentric white tigers of Blake and Victoria, the artfully patriotic brothers-stigmas and the Chathney elephant. Other stars of the show are Sigfrade and Roy. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything grandly, making the most mundane activities interesting. The combination of cute animal characters with a very adult dialogue and controversial issues (drugs, prejudices, etc.) is the source of the brilliance of the program. <br /> <br /> The guilt of failing this show lies with NBC. They decided to broadcast the episodes not in a certain order (perhaps under the influence of invited stars, which they could promote), and not in a more logical production order. Several times the show was ousted for an additional half hour of such a tree, as the “Biggest Loser” (as if 60 minutes was not enough)! This is really a bad omen for the future of television as an art, if an original and bold show like this fails when Fear Factor and American Idol dominate. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the complete series has been released on DVD and the show. Now you can get more followers. 10/10
