Ghost Train is a beautiful and exciting film typical of the best British comedy films of the 1930s and 40s. The jokes of comic Arthur Asuka are not as funny as they once were, but this can be overcome by considering it as a historical episode or out of curiosity. <br /> <br /> For low-budget military production, the Ghost Train is atmospheric, efficient, and this provides some genuine uncertainty. Great fun for a dark (and, yes, stormy) night. Light up, take off the hat of the critic and enjoy.
