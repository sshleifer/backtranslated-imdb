I watched Elephant Walk for the first time in 30 years, and was amazed at how similar the storyline was to the superior Rebecca. As others have said, the sweet young girl is swept from her feet by the alternately charming and thoughtful lord of the estate, and only her marriage is threatened by the inevitable memory of a larger but deeply depraved relative. You have a stern and disapproving servant, a crisis that will either bind a couple, or separate them irreparably, in the midst of the fiery destruction of a luxurious manor. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Elephant Ride also owes some of its eerie jungle atmosphere "The Letter", Bette Davis's love triangle set on a Singapore rubber plantation, not on a Sri Lankan tea plantation. <br /> <br /> Maltin gives “Elephant Walk” only two stars, and IMDb readers are not much kinder, but I liked it, despite its predictability. Elizabeth Taylor never looked prettier, and Peter Finch does a decent job, being mostly a good person, unable to get rid of the influence of his powerful father. Dana Andrews - a favorite in “Laura” and “The best year of our life” - wasted as a disappointed fan of Elizabeth. A real star is a bungalow, one of the most beautiful interiors in cinema history.
