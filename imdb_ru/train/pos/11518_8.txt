You can do a lot with a little money. Blair the Witch proved it. This movie supports it. This is nothing more than a comedy in length and complexity. However, since he has John Cleese in the role of Sherlock Holmes, he manages to be cheerful even with a budget that he cannot afford meager funds. The highlight of this film is Arthur Lowe, since sincere, clumsy Watson, his vagueness and slowness interfere with quick-witted Cleese. If you've ever come across a movie, watch it for a freaky laugh or two.
