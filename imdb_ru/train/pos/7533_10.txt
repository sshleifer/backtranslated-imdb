I liked this show when it was on the Children's WB, I didn’t believe that Batman was spontaneous since the original show ended in 1995, and this show took place in 1997. First of all, I liked the idea of ​​leaving Robin Batman. solve the crime yourself. It was an interesting perspective on their relationship. I also liked the addition of Tim Drake to the series, and again, like his predecessor, this show had great storylines, great animation (better than the original), fantastic voice acting and, of course, great writing. The only thing I didn’t like was that in the USA they often showed episodes in the 15-minute storyline. I just wish some episodes were longer. My favorite episode of all the Batman cartoons comes out of this series, and it is called “Over the Edge”, in my opinion, good, if not better, than Heart of Ice and Robin’s Payback. In general, a good sequel, along with Superman, this show made my childhood very happy.
