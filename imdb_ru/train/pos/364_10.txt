Adaptation of the popular novel by Alice Walkers Steven Spailberg is not without controversy. When the first black members of the black community criticized his treatment of black men, while others wondered why the white man made this film about black women. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a young black woman named Seli, who grew up in rural America after the turn of the century. She has two children from an abusive father, who are plucked from her arms at birth. The only consolation in her miserable life is her sister. <br /> <br /> Seli (in the following years, newcomer Whoopi Goldberg played) married an abusive husband (Danny Glover). The sister humiliates the husband, and therefore she quickly withdraws from the life of Seli. <br /> <br /> The story is often heartbreaking, as Seli continues to hope that one day she will be able to reunite with her sister and her children. Throughout her life, she meets many characters, including Sofia, tough as nails, the wife of her step-son, and Shuga, a loud and juicy sedan singer who teaches her something about love. <br /> <br /> All this shows the direction of Spailberg, which offers brilliant cinematography and some star performances. I dare you to watch this movie and not touch! The film "Colored Purple" was able to grasp the essence of a complex story. While he tends to minimize the lesbian aspects, as well as African history, both of which were so vivid in the book, the film remains true to its themes, allowing Alice Walker to shine through. <br /> <br /> I could not begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film. Suffice it to say, however, that this is one of the few films that I can watch again and again and which left an indelible mark on my life. <br /> <br />
