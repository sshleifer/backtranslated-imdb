From time to time, the conversation turns into "favorite movies." I will mention the Titanic, and at least a couple of people will laugh. I donâ€™t pay attention to them, because I know that five years ago these same people were moved to tears by this very film. And now they are too embarrassed to admit it. <br /> <br /> I just reviewed the Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the film has not lost its power in these five years. I cried again .... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997, when I was able to remember how a movie that no one could break was even the most popular movie of all time. A film that broke into the public consciousness, like no other film that I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many do not even admit that they liked it. Guys, let's get this straight - you don't look cool when you scold this movie. You look like an impenetrable cynic. <br /> <br /> No movie is perfect, and there are several flaws in this. Some dialogues do not work, and some of the plots surrounding the two lovers are too neat. However, none of this is so distracting that it destroys the film. <br /> <br /> Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the best actors of his generation. Wait until you see him in the Bands of New York before calling him nothing more than a cute boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The film really belonged to her, and she perfectly kept it together. <br /> <br /> James Cameron coped with what many considered impossible by recreating the very plausible Titanic. The sinking scenes were terrifying, just like that night. How someone can say that the consequences were bad is beyond my power. I was completely shocked. <br /> <br /> This film is one unforgettable scene after another. The Titanic leaves the port at Southampton. Rose and Jack in the nose "fly." "Iceberg, straight ahead!" Screws are incredibly hanging from the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And this ending led to the fact that even the most turbulent person in the theater began to cry. <br /> <br /> Music, which also fell victim to the success of the film, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was just perfect. And the theme of love was beautiful and tragic. It is a pity that the pop song Celine Dion was forced to destroy this wonderful music for many. <br /> <br /> I confess that I am a lover of the Titanic. Thus, I enjoyed the opportunity to see the ship as we had never seen it - in all its glory. Perhaps observing his fall affected me more than a few, because all my life I had been so interested in the ship. However, I doubt that many of those whom I saw weeping were lovers of the Titanic. I applaud Cameron for bringing the story to the masses in such a way as to never humiliate the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said that this is better than I ever could: open your hearts to Titanic and you will not be disappointed.
