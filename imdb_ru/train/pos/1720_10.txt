This early biography was fun to watch. The second disc is one of D.V. Griffith's Years of Discovery DVD (highly recommended) contains three superb performances by the main characters, and it is interesting to see Henry B. Waltolla (Little Colonel, Birth of a Nation) as a traveling musician giving the Countess a look and other things) . <br /> <br /> The husband of the countess is infuriated by the betrayal of his wife, and she is immured in a small room with her lover. It's unbelievable that they won't hear the wall rising, but, hey, maybe the wine has something to do with it. Here Mr. Johnson (the father of the silent player Raymond Hackett) is gesticulating wildly, and this adds to melodrama, but unexpectedly in a comical way. The best moment comes at the end. When a lady loses consciousness from shock and fear, as soon as she realizes that she is doomed, Henry takes her instrument and “inflates” it over her. The way he did it was so unexpected and strangely sexy, and I just lost it and laughed. The expression on his face! From that moment on, I was fascinated by Henry B. Walthall.
