Another remake of "A Fistful of Dollars", a remake of Sergio Leone from Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" (proposed by the novel "Red Harvest"). <br /> <br /> This movie is strictly B-Movie; if you take it, it's pretty nice. directing clear, acting, full of enthusiasm, the limitations of his photos "straight to the video" are well developed. <br /> <br /> The film’s weakness in the disastrous decision to marry the “handful” The plot '/' yojimbo 'to the subplot from the movie “Once Upon a Time in the West” by Leon. Although Leone directed The Fistful And The West, his motives behind these two films could no longer be different. “A man without a name” (Eastwood) is a social frontier with a soft spot for broken families. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed with his own broken family and obsessed with revenge. These two characters would not have much to do with each other. In order to bring them together, “Gun Crazy” has to distort the plot and complicate it, until we lose the idea of ​​what story we are really following. <br /> <br /> But in the end it is a B-film, and filled with action and stupidity; it’s interesting at this level, just don’t expect anything more.
