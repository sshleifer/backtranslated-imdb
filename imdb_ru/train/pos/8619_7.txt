First, I would say that somehow I remember watching this film in early childhood, I could not read the subtitles and thought that Sonny Tiba was Sean Connery. But I really liked the concept. If you cannot at least partially suspend your skepticism for adults and accept your seven, you can avoid this movie. However, having just viewed the restored 137-minute version on DVD, I have to say that I liked it, although not as much as when I was seven years old (I remembered the final). <br /> <br /> There are some aspects of the film that deserve criticism: the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes have really funny moments, my favorite is the contrast between the scenes played in the last 10 minutes, and a curious choice of back music (listen to the text). <br /> <br /> In the action movie, great attention is paid to the personal stories of some soldiers and the social dynamics of the detachment, since their journey in time takes its own course. By the end of the film, I decided that it was good when at seven years old I thought that “relationship” was a bad thing. <br /> <br /> There are also lots of nice action games for an action movie. especially a couple of epic battle scenes between a platoon and hordes of warriors of the Shogun era. The filmmakers have ensured that as many deaths as possible were bloody and, say, with a sense of humor. I thought it was a great aspect of the film when I was a kid, and I'm not ashamed to say that I still do. <br /> <br /> I also like the fact that modern soldiers without spending a film on hooliganism at all, trying to avoid changing the space-time continuum, they have heavy caliber machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, a tank and a helicopter, and they obsessed with turning feudal Japan into its own. This is what I would like to think that any avid IMDb user would do in their boots. <br /> <br /> In short, films that are worth seeing make the viewer regret that there were no more films shot with a similar premise. and at the same time offers some useful tips on why such a film as GI Samurai is so unique.
