In the discovery of the great (semi) unknown film, I always found a certain charm. These discoveries were almost always dramatic films - in my experience, unknown science fiction, thriller and horror are unknown for very, very compelling reasons. I found "High Tide" in a video in a garbage store, mixed among countless dozens of tapes of different quality. Of course, this is the only place where I could find it, since it is still not on DVD. <br /> <br /> While I was watching Judy Davis (as Lilly) throughout the entire film, for some reason I was sure that I was watching a magnificent, uncharted show. Yes, I used to see Davis in several small parts - and in one lead role in “Passage to India.” But, although she was gorgeous in the aforementioned film, “Tide” is a completely different animal. Since I recently watched Jillian Armstrong's later film Charlotte Gray, I was acutely aware of what kind of actress impresses her. Davis is much more than a fleeting resemblance to Cate Blanchett, both in manner and in sensuality. <br /> <br /> Judy Davis’s game is amazing, I can’t say enough good words about it. She shares an amazing relationship on screen with young Claudia Karwan (like Ellie), another great actress of this film. There are a lot of drama and quiet humanity that they share together, details that I will not allow to reveal here (see for yourself!). Too much good in Tide to cover it in one review. In fact, I wouldn’t care - the film speaks for itself. In conclusion, I would like to commend screenwriter Laura Jones for her amazing dialogue, director Gillian Armstrong for her understanding of actors and great Russell Boyd for his brilliant, understated cinematography (see His work in Gentle Charity).
