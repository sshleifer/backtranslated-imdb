Although DiG! he was hailed as being closest to the fact that the music industry was very much fabricated. The director misled the audience by believing that the slaughter of Brian Johnstown disappeared from the earth after 98 years. And the competition between Dandy Warhols and Jonestown was milked. The truth of this question is not disclosed in this film. <br /> <br /> However, this film is endlessly cited and represents an interesting watch, as we see two groups of very talented musicians creating their art. One of the best things about this film is the unique perspective between indie music and a large corporate scene. <br /> <br /> Recommended mainly for music and two fantastic bands.
