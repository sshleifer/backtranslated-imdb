A warning! Spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I saw a movie in German, so maybe I missed some clues. <br /> <br /> Despite some weakness in the plot, this is the film that came to me. I especially liked the game Lex Doig. Sometimes I got the impression that she * Camilla. But I can't stop wondering what happened at the end with Bob, Cassie and the kid. I believe that after she was originally installed on Bob, she eventually fell in love with him and regretted what happened to his brother, and was forced to lie to him. Otherwise it is a bit strange that she will carry his child and love him. This is up to the viewer - and I do not like such endings. Dean Caine was as good as before, Eric Roberts ... well, I saw him better, but worse. <br /> <br /> I believe that a film is more an analysis of human relations and a reaction in unexpected situations than a criminal story. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I really liked it.
