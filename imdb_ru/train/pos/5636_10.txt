In The Brave New Girl, Holly hails from a small town in Texas, sings the Yellow Rose of Texas at a local competition and enters a prestigious art college in Philadelphia. From there, the film turns into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I like this movie. He was full of great singing and acting, and the characters supported him at a very good pace. The game was, of course, wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsay Hown were outstanding, as well as Nick Roth. The operation with the camera was really well done, and I was very pleased with its result (it seems that the continuation may be in progress). Kudos to the director and everyone else who participated in this production. Pretty pearl in the film archives.
