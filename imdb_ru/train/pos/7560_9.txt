Starfucker (Starstruck is written on my box) was the most amazing film I've ever seen. I thought it was one of the best films I've ever seen. So why not 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look on the dark side of Hollywood. I made several others watch the movie, and they all agreed that it was an outstanding movie.
