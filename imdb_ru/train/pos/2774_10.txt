For me, cinema and acting is a storytelling. The story of David and Vefseva is a deep tragedy that can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical story. In this film, I thought the stories of Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward were at their best. Knowledge and understanding of the story of David and his journey to become the King of Israel made this story even more convincing. You could feel his passion for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the real human side of this man, who in his time was more than life. Susan Hayward's fear, reluctance, but then the obedience of his power as her king were beautifully depicted by her. One could also feel David’s sorrow that Uriah spent the night at the gate, not at home. And also sadness when he was killed in battle. Raymond Massey’s powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel his anger. The sets were real enough, and the atmosphere is believable. In general, I think it was one of the best films of its kind. I gave him a score of ten.
