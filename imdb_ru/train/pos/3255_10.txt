Every scene was perfect. This film had a wonderful cast and crew. I mean, how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr., none of them exist and will never exist. He has the ability to decorate any film with his amazing talent. This movie was perfect! I saw this film sitting alone on the shelf in the film Blockbuster, and as if he was calling me, I could not resist taking it and bringing it home with me. You can call me a sentimental romantic, but this film just touched my heart, not to mention that I was laughing with pleasure at the same time. Despite the fact that it made me cry, I admit that in the end the whole movie just covered my view of life afterwards. I offered my horror film, action movies and my brotherâ€™s pure humor, who absolutely adored this film. This is a movie with a good feeling. He can make you laugh out loud, touch your heart, fall in love and enjoy life. Every time you purposefully pass by this film, just know that you deliberately make a choice to live and feel this inspirational film. Who knows? What if this can really happen to you? And keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life.
