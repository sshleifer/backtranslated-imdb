This episode of The Twilight Zone combines the quiet part (1890) with a melodramatic play and gags - a tribute to Buster Keaton’s early films. A lot of farce: Buster falls on the bulkhead door, falls into a puddle, runs without pants. The invention of the stupid scientist Time Helmet, reminiscent of the idea of ​​Flash Gordon about what the future will be. Cheap prices, such as $ 1.95 for women's hats or 17 cents per pound of beef, seem to Buster to be incredibly high. Even the world of 1890 is too much for Buster / Mulligan. How shocking when he is mistakenly transferred to the “modern” world of the 1960s! Buster tried to go back! The “scholar” of that time wants to return to the more peaceful world of 1890, which he studied and admired. They come back together, and Baster / Mulligan is now happy, and the “scientist” regrets that he does not have electronic equipment, modern beds or an electric blanket. Therefore Buster sends him back with a crazy helmet. <br /> <br /> There are no heavy messages in this twilight zone. Since Buster Keaton died in 1966, this is one of his last attempts. It's enough. <br /> <br /> Another nice thing is the unused Maytag Man Jesse White, the repairman who repairs the Helmet of Time, foreshadowing his washing machine career.
