Gideon and Jules Naudet wanted to make a documentary about firefighters from New York. What they got was the only shooting of the film at the 9/11 World Trade Center. <br /> <br /> Working with the ladder company of James Hanlon before, Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair the gas leak, and Gideon stayed in the firehouse in case something interesting happened. The plane flying low over the city distracted Jules, and he turned the camera up a few seconds before the plane crashed into Tower One. <br /> <br /> Jules asked the captain to follow him to the Towers. The first thing he saw was two people on fire that he refused to take pictures. Over the next few hours, he remained in place, removing the reactions of firefighters and other people present. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers tried very hard to keep the film from being too cruel, grizzly and bloody. But the language of the firefighters is a bit rude, and CBS showed a lot of balloons aerating it without censorship. The Naudet brothers mixed shots that they took from the one-on-one interview so that the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions at certain moments of the crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike a feature film with a similar title, most of the money from the sale of the DVD goes to charities related to 9/11. Very well done, emotional, exciting and completely devoid of political propaganda - the best documentary of its kind today.
