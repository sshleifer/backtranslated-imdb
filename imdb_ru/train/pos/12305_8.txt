Not quite sure what to expect from this, except for the uniform positive feedback I read. It turns out that I could never imagine this film, because it is very close to “The Bride with White Hair” in terms of operaticity and in relation to fiction. It is a fine line between being a farce, a comedy and just a good old-fashioned ghost story. There is nothing terrible in it, it is not a topic, in fact it is basically a love story about an awkward guy who meets a beautiful ghost who has a lot of trouble with other ghosts. So the main theme is a guy trying to save a beautiful ghost. It also happens in ancient China, with wild outlandish exhibitions of kung fu and a trip to hell (more or less). Some of the ghostly characters are pretty cool, and the visual effects are excellent. I could watch this genre of Chinese films all day because they are very exciting, great visuals and pretty much mocking. And I look forward to see the first sequel to this film. Highly recommended.
