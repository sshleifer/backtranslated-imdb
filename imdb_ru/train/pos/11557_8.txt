Often laugh out loud, sometimes sad stories about two working divorced guys — Lemmon, a neurotic, pure “home husband,” and Mattau, a sports writer — who decided to live together to cut costs. <br /> <br /> Beautifully photographed and sent. The script is very jagged, that is, almost every side has more than one side. A particularly funny scene involves 2 British sisters (Evans and Shelley), who seem surprised by everyone saying, but when Lemmon takes out his photos of children and, yes, his ex-wife, he makes the girls cry with him before appear with the promised drinks! <br /> <br /> Very interesting.
