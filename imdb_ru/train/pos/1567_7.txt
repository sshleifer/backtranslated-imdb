It's not so bad, with Sanders, Barry, Hale, Cowan, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willy Best, we could be with Charlie Chan, Moto, Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or the Saints, and so on. D. Others In other words, you will get a chance to spend another hour in the company of old friends, from simple to polite, murder and murder - always a pleasure in my book. <br /> <br /> Barry is a hard-boiled lady in order to take revenge and clear her dead and dead father, a police detective, by planning and spending with her a number of murders in the underworld. That would certainly have the opposite effect! Sanders joins in the fun, just dancing in the right club at the right place in the right city at the right time, while the right lighting falls on him and the first killer (at the right time!) And kills him. <Br /> <br /> With the plot and the acting plot, everything is in order, the only thing I hear is almost the end, when they are in a hurry and almost ridiculously find out who the evil genius (Waldemann) was - they almost forgot about its significance in the plot? However, a solid entry in the series.
