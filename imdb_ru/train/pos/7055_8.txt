Although Cinderella is not the obvious choice to continue, I love Jacques and Gus, so I did not hesitate. The format of the mice writing a book for Cinderella was inspirational. I love to write stories and hope that the children will be inspired by this. Three stories are cute and funny, although the songs were forgotten. Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters, but I also liked to see Lucifer, Bruno, Mice Chorus and everyone else. Pom Pom proved to be the perfect companion for Lucifer, and I liked the governess. The continuation is done right for a change. My rating is 8/10.
