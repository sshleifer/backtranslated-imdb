Saw it on Saturday night at the Provincetown Film Festival, and this is the movie “Touching Your Bones” - he really stayed with me. Very cleverly adapted to what is probably an excellent novel, this is a back-and-forth time drama with fully rounded characters, thoughtful thinking about life choices, and I am not exaggerating. one of the greatest actors ever gathered in more than 100 years of filmmaking. A wonderful job from everyone, led by luminous Vanessa Redgrave as the dying, deceived mother of Newport, and Claire Danes as her much younger than herself. Meryl Streep's daughter, Mami Gammer, is a real bargain; Patrick Wilson looks like Paul Newman around 1958 and does not exaggerate the charm; and how nice it is to see such great stage actors as Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins creating clear, detailed cameos. Hugh Dancy, also from the stage, does not give much sense in the somewhat ordinary role of the unfortunate rich scoundrel, and family problems are solved, perhaps more carefully than in real life. But this is a focused, visually magnificent meditation on the real problems of life, and you may cry and not feel that you are being recklessly manipulated. Also, what a luxury parade of cars of the 1940s / 50s.
