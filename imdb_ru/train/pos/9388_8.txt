Fortunately for your honest readers, Cage and Hopper met and, fortunately, not in the Lynch film, because RED ROCK WEST is much better than in any Lynch film. Nicolas Cage is the third actor, the china baby is a surrogate femme fatale, only daddy Hopper is as mean as ever. RED ROCK WEST, despite the banal cast, is one of my favorite American thrillers; In short, a thriller with some twists and turns. <br /> <br /> Basically, it’s a pleasure, an amazing pace, thrills, a pleasant expectation, Lara Flynn Boyle’s pretty narrow ass, Cage’s enviable physical shape (although undoubtedly ugly, with sharp, bird-like features, thick eyebrows and thin sparse hair, Cage showed a beautiful overall form ??), Hopper's unsurpassed routine, some moderately but truly funny moments, Cage's play with his intended person, Hopper's harsh, psychopathic charm, Lara's Meanness, archetypical This gloomy tramp of a movie theater, hungry, hard, if necessary, naive, dirty, tired. Lara Flynn Boyle acts as a cold seductive seductress, Walsh as her heartless husband, and Hopper as the hired killer Lincian, whom he has done before. <br /> <br /> Cage really looks rather awkward or dizzy or very confused. severe hangover. But this may be his usual look.
