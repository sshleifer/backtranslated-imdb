This is the only film in which I saw the Prince, but it does not matter. And I thought he was only good at singing, boy, I was wrong. This is probably his best performance. The music is great. That's why he won an Oscar in 1984 for the best film music (or something like that). Now he has an Oscar and a Grammy under his belt. Although the curse interferes with the film (just make sure that there are no small children or in the room). Nothing to say without revealing the plot. You should really go and get this movie, your collection will not be complete if you have not received this movie in it. What more could I say other than go and get this movie now!
