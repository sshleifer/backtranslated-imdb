I was a little scared to watch this movie because of its price. But living in Italy, such names never occur, and I love the step so much that I decided to try. And how surprised I was! The story is different from any other dance film I've seen lately, with a deeper meaning than just “victory”. It is touching and well written and well directed. Paradise is such a strong character, I like the fact that she never doubts herself, she is so mature and focused and REALIZES her TALENT (and the fact that Rutina Wesley has talent, my jaw dropped in the final dance scene). The way she pursues her dream and refuses to allow anything to stop her, frankly, inspires. In addition, the fact that she is not the typical super hot chick (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Devan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes her truly attractive and real. Seriously, why is this movie so low rated? You can understand in the first 5 minutes that this is a good job. Really good indeed. I even cried at the end of the movie. And dance procedures are just sick.
