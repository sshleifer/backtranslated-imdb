Tony Hawk Underground came to the moment when the series really began to lose its brilliance, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not meet expectations and left the series really in the air over what Neversoft and Activision could do with a series that Be Different and Interesting. <br /> <br /> Underground presented a scene mode that was very cool because he created a whole new world for Tony Hawk Pro Skater fans. Another feature was introduced that fans argued about and which was able to get off the skateboard, which is nice, because now you can climb, run and do something new. <br /> <br /> Levels Ok, Neversoft also fixed a problem that started with Pro Skater 3 and which was the length of level design. The first two games for PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long, and some had hidden features. Pro Skater 3 and 4 were reduced due to several features that were added and really pushed the systems to the limit. In this version, they have reduced these opportunities, not so many people are interested in the streets, in fact they are almost absent on some levels, and the graphics and physics of skating are a bit relaxed, but not much. <Br /> <br /> This game has one drawback, the storyline is a bit short, of course, this is the first time Nepersoft does it with the Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so this is understandable. However, with that said, you will definitely end this game during the day. <br /> <br /> Overall, a great addition, which was very refreshing.
