Unlike the opinions of another review, this film was really amazingly good! I reluctantly went to see him and expected that he would be bored with cliches, obvious jokes and replays, and all this promised a trailer. <br /> <br /> However, after 5 minutes, I found that I genuinely laugh and enjoy a refreshing refreshing drink. the acting. With just one gag of “toilet humor” Over Her Dead Body, it is possible to actually come up with really funny scenarios, and, without spoiling anything too much, some moments related to animals are funny. <br /> <br /> The basic ingredients of a good movie are all there; The screenplay, director and actors, and also compared some other recent attempts at a romantic comedy, this film stands high. <br /> <br /> Of course, you will not know or will not receive a spiritual awakening, but if you leave with an open mind, you will most likely have a good time!
