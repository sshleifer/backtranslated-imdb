What do you get if you cross the Matrix with the Truman Show? <br /> <br /> I’m sure you’ve already seen the Matrix. The creators of The Matrix say that it is "anime inspired." Just from watching the trailer to this classic movie, you can see where they got the plot from. <br /> <br /> The film was made in Japan in the 1980s, and it does show. Costumes, music and words (in the recent version of AD Vision in English) - they all seem to be straight from the era. I believe that this was done at that time, but due to certain plot points the film does not date to the film. <br /> <br /> As you probably guessed, referring to the Matrix, the world is unreal, It is not quite the 1980s. In fact, it is something more similar to the 2480s. After a nuclear war, the Earth’s ecosystem (or Biosphere Prime) was destroyed. Survivors we are forced to escape into space, where the conflict continued. As soon as the planets (or “Biospheres”) were abandoned, people began to live in megazons - cities inside spaceships, where using the hypnotism and Truman illusions in the spirit of show esque they were convinced that we returned to earth in the most peaceful time lately ... 1980s. When young Shogo gets a mysterious advanced motorcycle, he makes him learn more than he should know ... Garland (a bicycle that becomes a fur), a weapon from the 2400s, helps This in his escape from the pursuit. military. As more and more information about the MegaZone is found out, the war is approaching home, and because of conflicts between the military and the computer, the war also comes to MegaZone ... I apologize if these items are considered spoilers, but the plot is outlined in general terms exactly. <br /> <br /> In this film, emotions are hotter than in The Matrix. You really believe that the war continues, and Shogo really becomes a scar from what he discovers. What begins as a super-cool 80s film becomes a tragic history of war and unreality. These characters are real people, not cardboard cutouts that we saw in The Matrix. In fact, there is a sense of suffering that people who end up in such a conspiracy and war can survive. It may just strangle you to the end ... I know it made me. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty impressive for its time, and the picture quality on an ADVision DVD is incredible for its age. The artwork style is beautiful and resembles a traditional anime, very cultural. Be prepared for a lot of violence and blood, there is also an erotic sex scene. <br /> <br /> The ending can be seen as “there can be no end”, similar to the Matrix, or perhaps a continuation that I have not had the pleasure of watching may follow. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is one of the best anime I’ve seen, in fact, one of the best films I’ve seen, and that many consider to be one of the greatest anime ever. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend the ADVision DVD, because their view of English is incredible, and the film is really good justice, and can be purchased from the artbox for storing two sequels when they are released, which will have the same vocal composition. <br /> <br /> In general, MegaZone 23 is an incredible film, and it deserves to be highly valued and should become an integral part of any collection of anime fans. Hell, even my mom liked it.
