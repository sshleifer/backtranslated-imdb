When I was a kid, I watched it many times, and I remember whistling the song "Happy Cat" quite often. All the songs are wonderful and really memorable, unlike many children's musicals, where the songs are simply inserted for no particular reason. The scenes and costumes are gorgeous, and the acting is very well done, which is not surprising given the cast. Christopher Walken is very similar to a cat, and he doesnâ€™t need a stupid make-up or a cat costume so that the viewer can believe that he has turned into a human being. And Jason Connery is as cute as the son of a shy and awkward miller, Corin, who falls in love with the beautiful and bold princess Vera. This is really a funny, fascinating, full-length film, in which, unlike most fairy tales, characters have an individuality. Some of my favorite roles are when Puss makes Korin pretend to be drowning; at the ball, when everyone starts to dance country dance, because it is "all the anger abroad"; when Walken dances in the kitchen on the table (he is also a good dancer!); and when Vera tells Corin about all the things she did in her youth, for example, pretending that she was the daughter of a miller. I would recommend this film to children and parents who love magic and fairy tales. And this is actually a movie that you can watch together, as it will not push adults on the wall.
